TI  - Is a clean river fun for all? Recognizing social vulnerability in watershed planning
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Watershed planning can lead to policy innovation and action toward environmental protection. However, groups often suffer from low engagement with communities that experience disparate impacts from flooding and water pollution. This can limit the capacity of watershed efforts to dismantle pernicious forms of social inequality. As a result, the benefits of environmental changes often flow to more empowered residents, short-changing the power of watershed-based planning as a tool to transform ecological, economic, and social relationships. The objectives of this paper are to assess whether the worldview of watershed planning actors are sufficiently attuned to local patterns of social vulnerability and whether locally significant patterns of social vulnerability can be adequately differentiated using conventional data sources. Drawing from 35 in-depth interviews with watershed planners and community stakeholders in the Milwaukee River Basin (WI, USA), we identify five unique definitions of social vulnerability. Watershed planners in our sample articulate a narrower range of social vulnerability definitions than other participants. All five definitions emphasize spatial and demographic characteristics consistent with existing ways of measuring social vulnerability. However, existing measures do not adequately differentiate among the spatio-temporal dynamics used to distinguish definitions. In response, we develop two new social vulnerability measures. The combination of interviews and demographic analyses in this study provides an assessment technique that can help watershed planners (a) understand the limits of their own conceptualization of social vulnerability and (b) acknowledge the importance of place-based vulnerabilities that may otherwise be obscured. We conclude by discussing how our methods can be a useful tool for identifying opportunities to disrupt social vulnerability in a watershed by evaluating how issue frames, outreach messages, and engagement tactics. The approach allows watershed planners to shift their own culture in order to consider socially vulnerable populations comprehensively.

TI  - Analysis of NVDI variability in response to precipitation and air temperature in different regions of Iraq, using MODIS vegetation indices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Iraq, the land of two rivers, has a history that extends back millennia and is the subject of much archaeological research. However, little environmental research has been carried out, and as such relatively little is known about the interaction between Iraq's vegetation and climate. This research serves to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and two climatic factors (precipitation and air temperature) over the last decade. The precipitation and air temperature datasets are from the Water and Global Change Forcing Data ERA-Interim (WFDEI), and the NDVI dataset was extracted from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 250 m spatial resolution and 16 day temporal resolution. Three different climatic regions in Iraq, Sulaymaniyah, Wasit, and Basrah, were selected for the period of 2001-2015. This is the first study to compare these regions in Iraq, and one of only a few investigating vegetation's relationship with multiple climatic factors, including precipitation and air temperature, particularly in a semi-arid region. The interannual, intra-annual and seasonal variability for each region is analysed to compare the different responses of vegetation growth to climatic factors. Correlations between NDVI and climatic factors are also included. Plotting annual cycles of NDVI and precipitation reveals a coherent onset, fluctuation (peak and decline), with a time lag of 4 months for Sulaymaniyah and Wasit (while for the Basrah region, high temperatures and a short rainy season was observed). The correlation coefficients between NDVI and precipitation are relatively high, especially in Sulaymaniyah, and the largest positive correlation was (0.8635) with a time lag of 4 months. The phenological transition points range between 3 and 4 month time lag; this corresponds to the duration of maturity of the vegetation. However, when correlated with air temperature, NDVI experiences an inverse relationship, although not as strong as that of NDVI and precipitation; the highest negative correlation was observed in Wasit with a time lag of 2 months (- 0.7562). The results showed that there is a similarity between temporal patterns of NDVI and precipitation. This similarity is stronger than that of NDVI and air temperature, so it can be concluded that NDVI is a sensitive indicator of the inter-annual variability of precipitation and that precipitation constitutes the primary factor in germination while the air temperature acts with a lesser effect.

TI  - Detection of Saturation in High-Resolution Pushbroom Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last decade, DigitalGlobe has launched a series of commercial Earth imaging satellites. These high-resolution satellite imageries provide an increasingly abundant data source for remotemapping of the Earth surface and its temporal variability. Among the factors affecting image quality is saturation of the charge-coupled device due to improper setting of the time delay integration level for the imaged surface, which results in along-track striping over areas of high radiance. We present and demonstrate an algorithm for the local detection of saturation striping by a wavelet transform, used to detect periodic variations of brightness (i.e., striping) with varying frequencies at different locations, combined with the use of unidirectional brightness gradients. The algorithm is applicable to raw, orthorectified, and resampled imagery. We test the algorithm using panchromatic images acquired by the GeoEye-1 and WorldView 1-3 sensors over polar regions. Saturation area classification masks generated by the algorithm agree well with manually identified areas of saturation. Manual validation of the algorithm applied to over 6000 images in Iceland reveals a high (>80%) success rate when the saturation levels are 2% or higher. Our general methodology may be widely applicable to periodic noise detection in imagery.

TI  - Evaluating landfast sea ice stress and fracture in support of operations on sea ice using SAR interferometry
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent Arctic warming has led to reduced sea-ice thickness and a more dynamic landfast ice cover with potential widespread consequences for ice users. Here, we develop an approach to assess the small-scale deformation of landfast ice critical to on-ice operations using synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR). InSAR has previously proven successful in determining long-term qualitative climatology of ice deformation around on-ice operations, but is now used to explore its potential for providing quantitative guidance for ice road planning, construction, and maintenance. A validation effort using X-band SAR and high-precision GPS data over Elson Lagoon, Alaska, confirms the ability of InSAR to accurately estimate 3-dimensional sea ice strain values accumulated between SAR image acquisitions, using an inverse model. The inverse model was further applied to L-band InSAR data over the Northstar Island ice road near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. Assuming an elasto-brittle rheology, the derived strain values yielded a spatial distribution of internal stress consistent with preexisting ice defects and morphology. In several localized regions of the study area, stress values exceeded expected yield stress. Resulting relative fracture intensity potential was shown to conform with local knowledge based on road inspections by engineers, and may be used to guide ice road planning, construction and maintenance efforts. The results presented here demonstrate that InSAR is an accurate tool for estimating landfast ice deformation and stability in support of ice use. The findings may also provide substantial new insights into the mechanics of landfast ice.

TI  - A Geostatistical Approach for Modeling Soybean Crop Area and Yield Based on Census and Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in satellite imagery and remote sensing have enabled the acquisition of spatial data at several different resolutions. Geographic information systems (GIS) and geostatistics can be used to link geographic data from different sources. This article discusses the need to improve soybean crop detection and yield prediction by linking census data, GIS, remote sensing, and geostatistics. The proposed approach combines Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) census data with an eight-day enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to monitor soybean areas and yields in Mato Grosso State, Brazil. In situ data from farms were used to validate the obtained results. Binomial areal kriging was used to generate maps of soybean occurrence over the years, and Gaussian areal kriging was used to predict soybean crop yield census data inside detected soybean areas, which had a downscaling effect on the results. The global accuracy and the Kappa index for the soybean crop detection were 92.1% and 0.84%, respectively. The yield prediction presented 95.09% accuracy considering the standard deviation and probable error. Soybean crop detection and yield monitoring can be improved by this approach.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy for early breast cancer in Queensland, Australia, during 2008-2012
T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is now the standard of care for women with early-stage breast cancer. Despite lower morbidity than axillary lymph node dissection, widespread variation in SNB rates by non-clinical factors persists. We explored the factors associated with SNB usage and changes in those associations over time for recently diagnosed women.Methods: We report here on a linked population-based cancer registry and hospital inpatient admission data set for 5577 women aged at least 20 years diagnosed with a first primary invasive early-stage node-negative breast cancer from July 2008 to 2012 in Queensland, Australia, who underwent breast cancer-related surgery within 2 years of diagnosis. Multivariate logistic regression was used to model predictors of SNB separately for 5172 women with <= 30 mm tumours and 405 with 31 to <= 50 mm tumours.Results: Overall, 3972 (77%) women with <= 30 mm tumours and 221 (55%) of those with larger tumours underwent SNB. Usage increased over time for both cohorts but was consistently lower among those with larger tumours. A more recent diagnosis, having breast-conserving surgery, living in more accessible areas and attending a private or high-volume hospital independently increased the odds of SNB for both cohorts. There was no evidence that the geographical disparity had reduced over the study period for either cohort.Conclusion: Geographical disparities to accessing SNB persist. Efforts to promote multidisciplinary care and facilitate education in healthcare changes through innovative solutions using emerging technologies as well as targeted research to identify the barriers to equitable access remain critical.

TI  - Quantifying the connections-linkages between land-use and water in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land development without thoughtful water supply planning can lead to unsustainability. In practice, management of our lands and waters is often unintegrated. We present new land-use, ecological stream health, water quality, and streamflow data from nine perennial watersheds in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal, in the 2016 monsoon (i.e., August and September) and 2017 premonsoon (i.e., April and May) periods. Our goal was to improve understanding of the longitudinal linkages between land-use and water. At a total of 38 locations, the Rapid Stream Assessment (RSA) protocol was used to characterize stream ecology, basic water quality parameters were collected with a handheld WTW multiparameter meter, and stream flow was measured with a SonTek FlowTracker Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. A pixel-based supervised classification method was used to create a 30-m gridded land use coverage from a Landsat 8 image scene captured in the fall of 2015. Our results indicated that land-use had a statistically significant impact on water quality, with built landuses (high and low) having the greatest influence. Upstream locations of six of the nine watersheds investigated had near natural status (i.e., river quality class (RQC) 1) and water could be used for all purposes (after standard treatments as required). However, downstream RSA measurements for all nine watersheds had RQC 5 (i.e., most highly impaired). Generally, water quality deteriorated from monsoon 2016 to pre-monsoon 2017. Our findings reinforce the importance of integrated land and water management and highlight the urgency of addressing waste management issues in the Kathmandu Valley.

AB  - This work has the objective of identifying research opportunities on the themes of performance evaluation and project management. In order to achieve this goal, the methodology described in ProKnow-C (Knowledge Development Process - Constructivist) was used, which allowed the formation of a bibliographic portfolio of 17 relevant articles on the subjects chosen, quantitatively demonstrating which are the most prominent, as well as their authors and periodicals, in addition to performing systemic analysis in this material to identify gaps on the subjects in the scientific environment and, thus, to instigate the accomplishment of new work. The systemic revision process was carried out using criteria derived from the constructivist worldview adopted by the researchers. The main results guide researchers in research opportunities where context uniqueness and limited rationality are taken into account when evaluating projects, as opposed to universal success criteria in project management.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to size a reservoir of water supply to attend the needs of Itabuna - Bahia from satellite images. So, was estimated a population by the year 2037 and its historical demand. Supervised classification of the Landsat 8 letter by 2017 was generated for evaluation of the study area. The sizing of the reservoir was carried out by analyzing the contour lines. The map generated from this analysis was superimposed on the landuse map for flooded classes identification and quantification. The estimated population in Itabuna-BA for the year 2037 was 246,755 inhabitants, to attend this population the reservoir should have a volume of 53.29 hm(3) and a height of 14 meters, maintaining a flow of 1.33 m(3)/s. The reservoir wetland area was 1548 ha which 1449 ha are pasture areas and 99 ha are forest fragments. The proposed design attended the demand of the estimated population that presents an area of flooding 96.8% of the vegetation cover which is composed by pasture, it means that this stretch is the most recommended for the reservoir construction.

TI  - Urban heat island effect: A systematic review of spatio-temporal factors, data, methods, and mitigation measures
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite research on urban heat island (UHI) effect has increased exponentially over the last few decades, a systematic review of factors contributing to UHI effect has scarcely been reported in the literature. This paper provides a systematic and overarching review of different spatial and temporal factors affecting the UHI effect. UHI is a phenomenon when urban areas experience a higher temperature than their surrounding non-urban areas and is considered as a critical factor contributing to global warming, heat related mortalities, and unpredictable climatic changes. Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify the spatio-temporal factors that contribute to (or mitigate) the UHI effect in order to develop a thorough understanding of their causal mechanism so that these are addressed through urban planning policies. This paper systematically identified 75 eligible studies on UHI effect and reviews the nature and type of satellite images used, the techniques applied to classify land cover/use changes, the models to assess the link between spatio-temporal factors and UHI effect, and the effects of these factors on UHI. The review results show that: a) 54% of the studies used Landsat TM images for modelling the UHI effect followed by Landsat ETM (34%), and MODIS (28%); b) land cover indices (46%), followed by supervised classification (17%) were the dominant methods to derive land cover/use changes associated with UHI effect; c) ordinary least square regression is the most commonly applied method (68%) to investigate the link between different spatio-temporal factors and the UHI effect followed by comparative analysis (33%); and d) the most common factors affecting the UHI effect as reported in the reviewed studies, include vegetation cover (44%), season (33%), built-up area (28%), day/night (25%), population density (14%), water body (12%) together with others. This research discusses the findings in policy terms and provides directions for future research.

TI  - Estimation of Annual Kara Sea Primary Production
T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Primary production of phytoplankton and ice and under-ice flora of the Kara Sea and regions thereof has been assessed using region-specific models and MODIS-Aqua satellite data for 2002-2015. Average annual primary production of phytoplankton calculated for the growing season (April-October) amounted to 165 mg D<inverted exclamation> m(-2) day(-1). Annual primary production of phytoplankton was 35 g C/m(2). Annual primary production of phytoplankton in the entire Kara Sea was 13 x 10(12) g C. Annual primary production of ice and underice flora calculated using an integrated biophysical model was 1.7 x 10(12) g C, or 12% of total primary production of the Kara Sea; the ice cover dynamics and published data were taken into account for the calculations. The results have been compared to earlier primary production estimates for the Kara Sea. The extent of the increase in sea productivity during warming of the Arctic and the decrease in ice cover area are discussed.

TI  - Evaluating the influence of spatial resolution of Landsat predictors on the accuracy of biomass models for large-area estimation across the eastern USA
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) estimates for regional-scale forest planning have become cost-effective with the free access to satellite data from sensors such as Landsat and MODIS. However, the accuracy of AGB predictions based on passive optical data depends on spatial resolution and spatial extent of target area as fine resolution (small pixels) data are associated with smaller coverage and longer repeat cycles compared to coarse resolution data. This study evaluated various spatial resolutions of Landsat-derived predictors on the accuracy of regional AGB models at three different sites in the eastern USA: Maine, Pennsylvania-New Jersey, and South Carolina. We combined national forest inventory data with Landsat-derived predictors at spatial resolutions ranging from 30-1000m to understand the optimal spatial resolution of optical data for large-area (regional) AGB estimation. Ten generic models were developed using the data collected in 2014, 2015 and 2016, and the predictions were evaluated (i) at the county-level against the estimates of the USFS Forest Inventory and Analysis Program which relied on EVALIDator tool and national forest inventory data from the 2009-2013 cycle and (ii) within a large number of strips (similar to 1 km wide) predicted via LiDAR metrics at 30 m spatial resolution. The county-level estimates by the EVALIDator and Landsat models were highly related (R-2 > 0.66), although the R-2 varied significantly across sites and resolution of predictors. The mean and standard deviation of county-level estimates followed increasing and decreasing trends, respectively, with models of coarser resolution. The Landsat-based total AGB estimates were larger than the LiDAR-based total estimates within the strips, however the mean of AGB predictions by LiDAR were mostly within one-standard deviations of the mean predictions obtained from the Landsat-based model at any of the resolutions. We conclude that satellite data at resolutions up to 1000 m provide acceptable accuracy for continental scale analysis of AGB.

TI  - Rain, forests and farmers: Evidence of drought induced deforestation in Madagascar and its consequences for biodiversity conservation
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropland expansion is the primary driver of deforestation worldwide. Since land and rainfall are two crucial inputs for agricultural production, a lack of rainfall may have severe consequences on yields, which in turn may lead to a change in cultivated areas, with possible impacts on deforestation rates. Our paper explores this issue of drought induced deforestation that has been largely neglected in the literature. By focusing on Madagascar where agriculture is mostly rainfed, we demonstrate that between 2000 and 2013, clearing additional forests was a strategy that farmers employ to cope with the negative impacts of droughts. Using remote sensing data and fixed-effects panel regressions, we find that droughts increased deforestation by 7.6% compared to years of near normal weather. The impact was most severe in dry and semi-arid areas (up to +17%). When droughts occurred across consecutive years, deforestation declined, a result that is consistent with risk averse behavior of farmers. We show that these results are not driven by ecological mechanisms or by accidental fires. We then study the implication of these outcomes for conservation policy and demonstrate that protected areas were partly effective at buffering against upsurges in deforestation induced by droughts. Our results reinforce the notion that when deforestation is an agricultural problem, agricultural solutions must be combined with conservation policies to decrease deforestation.

TI  - Geostationary Sensor Based Forest Fire Detection and Monitoring: An Improved Version of the SFIDE Algorithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper aims to present the results obtained in the development of a system allowing for the detection and monitoring of forest fires and the continuous comparison of their intensity when several events occur simultaneouslya common occurrence in European Mediterranean countries during the summer season. The system, called SFIDE (Satellite FIre DEtection), exploits a geostationary satellite sensor (SEVIRI, Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager, on board of MSG, Meteosat Second Generation, satellite series). The algorithm was developed several years ago in the framework of a project (SIGRI) funded by the Italian Space Agency (ASI). This algorithm has been completely reviewed in order to enhance its efficiency by reducing false alarms rate preserving a high sensitivity. Due to the very low spatial resolution of SEVIRI images (4 x 4 km(2) at Mediterranean latitude) the sensitivity of the algorithm should be very high to detect even small fires. The improvement of the algorithm has been obtained by: introducing the sun elevation angle in the computation of the preliminary thresholds to identify potential thermal anomalies (hot spots), introducing a contextual analysis in the detection of clouds and in the detection of night-time fires. The results of the algorithm have been validated in the Sardinia region by using ground true data provided by the regional Corpo Forestale e di Vigilanza Ambientale (CFVA). A significant reduction of the commission error (less than 10%) has been obtained with respect to the previous version of the algorithm and also with respect to fire-detection algorithms based on low earth orbit satellites.

TI  - Landsat time series-based multiyear spectral angle clustering (MSAC) model to monitor the inter-annual leaf senescence of exotic saltcedar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the western United States, the rapid expansion of exotic saltcedar along riparian corridors has drastically altered landscape structures and ecosystem functions. Monitoring the geographical distribution and spatio-temporal dynamics of this invasive species is essentially critical to conduct the systematic restoration of affected riparian ecosystems. Previous studies indicated that the leaf senescence stage is the optimal time window to remotely monitor saltcedar distributions. Yet due to climate variability and anthropogenic forcing, the timing of saltcedar leaf senescence varies over space and time. Given that the saltcedar leaf senescence stage only lasts for a short temporal window (i.e., three or four weeks), pinpointing the appropriate Landsat image across years and locations without the expert knowledge is challenging. Remotely sensed phenological time series analysis provides a practical means to locate the leaf senescence date on a per-pixel basis. However, affected by temporal revisit rates and cloud contamination, Landsat time series can only capture very limited temporal segments of vegetation phenology. The lack of Landsat imagery throughout the year makes the conventional time series analysis difficult. In this study, we developed a multiyear spectral angle clustering (MSAC) model to monitor the inter-annual leaf senescence of saltcedar with limited Landsat imagery on a per-pixel basis. The MSAC model leverages the Landsat images across years to temporally predict the fall phenology of plant species in a single year, and constructs the synthesized time series of spectral signatures to estimate critical phenological transition dates. Results indicated that the MSAC model could guide the construction of the composite Landsat surface reflectance image to accommodate spatial and inter-annual variation in the timing of plant leaf senescence. The phenology-guided composite image from the MSAC model achieved a greater saltcedar mapping accuracy than any single Landsat image in 2004. The proposed MSAC model provides new insights in estimating phenological transition dates of plant species with limited Landsat imagery. It opens up unique opportunities to guide the selection of representative remotely sensed imagery on a per-pixel basis for repetitive saltcedar mapping over wide geographical regions.

TI  - Analysis of Diffuse Attenuation Coefficient Spectra of Coastal Waters of Hainan Island and Performance Estimation of Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne LiDAR bathymetry is an active bathymetry method developed in recent years, which can quickly and efficiently obtain the water depth and underwater topography, especially plays an important role in surveying on shallow water and islandreefs where ships are not accessible. In general, the maximum detectable water depth of airborne LiDAR bathymetry systemic mainly affected by the turbidity of water. Therefore, a detailed study water turbidity of the experimental regionin advance will contribute to design the experimental scheme. In this paper, taking the coastal waters of Hainan Island in South China as an example, we studied the relationship between turbidity of water and the bathymetry performance of an airborne LiDAR bathymetry system named CZMIL (coastal zone mapping and imaging LiDAR), and presented an algorithm that can estimate the spatial distribution of maximum CZMIL detectable water depth in the coastal waters of Hainan Island by using the values of diffuse attenuation coefficient of sea water. Firstly, we studied the K-d (490) inversion algorithm in the experimental water region. Secondly, the relationship between the diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d (490) and K-d (532) was established by using the measured optical profile data in this region. Then, the relationship between the diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d (532) and the maximum CZMIL detectable depth was summarized. Finally, the spatial distribution of K-d (532) and maximum CZMIL detectable depth in the coastal waters of Hainan Island were retrieved by using MODIS data. What's more, the distribution of maximum CZMIL detectable depth in the coastal waters of Haikou City and Lingshui City are analyzed emphatically. The results provide a reference for the LiDAR bathymetric operation in the coastal waters of Hainan Island.

TI  - Mapping Global Bamboo Forest Distribution Using Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bamboo forest has great potential in climate change mitigation. However, the spatiotemporal pattern of carbon storage of global bamboo forest is still cannot be accurately estimated, because the lack of an accurate global bamboo forest distribution information. In this paper, the global bamboo forest distribution was mapped with the following steps. To begin with, training samples were obtained based on investigation data, statistic data, and literature data. Then, a decision tree was constructed for mapping the global bamboo forest distribution by integrating Landsat 8 OLI and MODIS data. Finally, the global bamboo forest area was estimated using a pixel unmixing algorithm. The constructed decision tree succeeds in extracting global bamboo forest based on remote sensing data, where the overall accuracy of classification was 78.81%. The estimated total global bamboo forest area was 30538.35 x 10(3) ha, with a low root-mean-square error of 611.1 x 10(3) ha. The estimated bamboo forest area of each province in China and each country were high consistent with the National Forest Inventory in China and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations statistic results (average R-2 > 0.9), respectively. Therefore, the global bamboo forest map yielded a satisfactory accuracy in both classification and area estimation, and could provide accurate and significant support for global bamboo forest resource management and carbon cycle research.

TI  - Correlating the subsidence pattern and land use in Bandung, Indonesia with both Sentinel-1/2 and ALOS-2 satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous research has been conducted in Bandung City, West Java province, Indonesia over the past two decades. Previous studies carried out in a regional-scale might be useful for estimating the correlation between land subsidence and groundwater extraction, but inadequate for local safety management as subsidence may vary over different areas with detailed characters. This study is focused primarily on subsidence phenomenon in local, patchy and village scales, respectively, with Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 dataset acquired from September 2014 to July 2017. The Sentinel-1 derived horizontal movement map confirmed that the vertical displacement is dominant of the Line-of-Sight (LoS) subsidence. Moreover, both Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 derived InSAR measurements were cross-validated with each other. In order to understand the subsidence in a more systematic way, six 10-cm subsidence zones have been selected known as Zone A-F. Further analyses conducted over multiple scales show that industrial usage of groundwater is not always the dominant factor that causes the land subsidence and indeed it does not always create large land subsidence either. Regions experiencing subsidence is due to a combined impact of a number of factors, e.g., residential, industrial or agricultural activities. The outcome of this work not only contributes to knowledge on efficient usage of the satellite-based monitoring networks, but also assists developing the best hazard mitigation plans. In the future work, as we cannot draw the conclusion which is the dominant factor within each sub-zone due to the lack of statistical data, e.g., the groundwater consumption rates per square kilometre for different land types, further datasets are still needed to examine the core factor.

TI  - QPhenoMetrics: An open source software application to assess vegetation phenology metrics
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is one of the most reliable indicators of vegetation dynamics. Assessing and monitoring the dynamics of phenology is relevant to support several decisions in order to improve the efficiency of several farming practices. An open source application QPhenoMetrics - implemented in QGIS software that estimates vegetation phenology metrics is presented, using Earth Observation Systems (EOS) based time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as proxies for phenology. QPhenoMetrics is characterized by freely-usable and updatable code, acceptance of satellite images or text formats, time-series analysis toolbox allowing the selection of region of interest with statistical quality assessment for Vegetation Indices (VI), and estimation of ensemble metrics. The application is structured in three components: (i) input data; (ii) pre-processing of the VI time-series and several fitting methods and (iii) computation of the phenological metrics. QPhenoMetrics produces a plot with the VI time-series and corresponding phenology metrics, and a spreadsheet is created with a list of NDVI or EVI values estimated using the selected fitting method. To evaluate the application, two main Portuguese crops, vineyards and maize, and MOD13 data from MODIS sensor during 2011-2012 were considered. QPhenoMetrics was validated with vineyard phenology observations (2007-2011). A comparative analysis with software products TimeSat and Spirits was also performed. It was concluded that QPhenoMetrics can be very useful for common users to extract phenology information for 16 daily MODIS data in HDF format, text files with NDVI/EVI data and ASCII files, through a simple and intuitive graphic interface. Furthermore, the user can evaluate the quality assessment of VI of the images used. QPhenoMetrics is an effective open source tool that in addition to being free, is readily modifiable by user according to the study requirements.

TI  - Unique Genes in Tumor-Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes Associated with Nonsentinel Lymph Node Metastases in Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current risk assessment tools to estimate the risk of nonsentinel lymph node metastases after completion lymphadenectomy for a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in cutaneous melanoma are based on clinical and pathologic factors. We identified a novel genetic signature that can predict non-SLN metastases in patients with cutaneous melanoma staged with a SLN biopsy.RNA was collected for tumor-positive SLNs in patients staged by SLN biopsy for cutaneous melanoma. All patients with a tumor-positive SLN biopsy underwent completion lymphadenectomy. A 1:10 case:control series of positive and negative non-SLN patients was analyzed by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR. Candidate differentially expressed genes were validated in a 1:3 case:control separate cohort of positive and negative non-SLN patients.The 1:10 case:control discovery set consisted of 7 positive non-SLN cases matched to 70 negative non-SLN controls. The cases and controls were similar with regards to important clinicopathologic factors, such as gender, primary tumor site, age, ulceration, and thickness. Microarray and RT-PCR identified six potential differentially expressed genes for validation. In the 40-patient separate validation set, 10 positive non-SLN patients were matched to 30 negative non-SLN controls based on gender, ulceration, age, and thickness. Five of the six genes were differentially expressed. The five gene panel identified patients at low (7.1%) and high risk (66.7%) for non-SLN metastases.A novel, non-SLN gene score based on differential expressed genes in a tumor-positive SLN can identify patients at high and low risk for non-SLN metastases.

TI  - Assessing Error Correlations in Remote Sensing-Based Estimates of Forest Attributes for Improved Composite Estimation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, non-expensive remote sensing (RS) data from different sensors and platforms can be obtained at short intervals and be used for assessing several kinds of forest characteristics at the level of plots, stands and landscapes. Methods such as composite estimation and data assimilation can be used for combining the different sources of information to obtain up-to-date and precise estimates of the characteristics of interest. In composite estimation a standard procedure is to assign weights to the different individual estimates inversely proportional to their variance. However, in case the estimates are correlated, the correlations must be considered in assigning weights or otherwise a composite estimator may be inefficient and its variance be underestimated. In this study we assessed the correlation of plot level estimates of forest characteristics from different RS datasets, between assessments using the same type of sensor as well as across different sensors. The RS data evaluated were SPOT-5 multispectral data, 3D airborne laser scanning data, and TanDEM-X interferometric radar data. Studies were made for plot level mean diameter, mean height, and growing stock volume. All data were acquired from a test site dominated by coniferous forest in southern Sweden. We found that the correlation between plot level estimates based on the same type of RS data were positive and strong, whereas the correlations between estimates using different sources of RS data were not as strong, and weaker for mean height than for mean diameter and volume. The implications of such correlations in composite estimation are demonstrated and it is discussed how correlations may affect results from data assimilation procedures.

TI  - Climate-induced hydrological variation controls the transformation of dissolved organic matter in a subalpine lake
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are an inherent component of the global carbon cycle. They receive dissolved organic matter (DOM) from the catchment, which is stored, transformed and respired, or delivered downstream. In this study, we show that a subalpine lake shifts its role from DOM transporter to transformer depending on season and climate. We monitored dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and DOM optical properties at the inlet and outlet of subalpine Lake Lunz (Austria) at high frequency during two contrasting years: an extreme drought in 2015, and regular precipitation regime in 2016. During both years, the DOC mass balance revealed that inflowing and outflowing DOC loads were nearly balanced (+6.57% and +1.70% DOC production in 2015 and 2016, respectively). However, DOM optical properties revealed an in-lake turnover of DOM compounds, so that the terrestrial and aromatic signature of inflowing DOM was modified into autochthonous, protein-like DOM. The magnitude of this transformation varied seasonally, being maximal in summer and minimal in winter, presumably following periods of high and low primary production and photo-degradation. Inter-annually, we found that drought further increased DOM transformation during summer by extending the lake water residence time. Finally, our results demonstrate a rapid response of DOM dynamics to hydrological and meteorological changes at both seasonal and inter-annual scales, suggesting that carbon cycling in clear-water mountain lakes may be highly sensitive to hydrological variation.

TI  - Impacts of Aerosols on the Retreat of the Sierra Nevada Glaciers in California
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountain range is the primary source of water for California. Many studies have shown that the increase in aerosols could lead to a reduction of the snowpack in this region. This study focuses on evaluating changes in the snowpack during the winter and summer seasons from 2000 till 2016 and determining the relationship between aerosols and the retreat of glaciers in the Sierra Nevada.The change detection analysis has shown reductions of 76.4% and 91.4% in the snowpack during winter and summer, respectively. Utilizing the aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent, snow depth anomalies, snowfall, radiation fluxes, and albedo, the effect of aerosols on snowfall over the Sierra Nevada glaciers has been examined for this 17-year period. Overall, based on correlation analysis, a negative relationship exists between the AOD and the snowfall.

TI  - Integration of remote sensing, geochemical and field data in the Qena-Safaga shear zone: Implications for structural evolution of the Eastern Desert, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Qena-Safaga shear zone (QSSZ) represents a significant structural characteristic in the Eastern Desert of Egypt. Remote Sensing, field and geochemical data were utilized in the present study. The results revealed that the QSSZ dominated by metamorphic complex (MC) that intruded by syn-tectonic granitoids. The low angle thrust fault brings calc-alkaline metavolcanics to overlie MC and its association. Subsequently, the area is dissected by strike-slip faults and the small elongated basins of Hammamat sediments of Precambrian were accumulated. The MC intruded by late-to post-tectonic granites (LPG) and Dokhan Volcanics which comprise felsic varieties forming distinctive columnar joints. Remote sensing analysis and field data revealed that major sub-vertical conspicuous strike-slip faults (SSF) including sinistral NW-SE and dextral ca. E-W shaped the study area. Various shear zones that accompanying the SSF are running NW-SE, NE-SW, E-W, N-S and ENE-WSW. The obtained shear sense presented a multiphase of deformation on each trend. i.e., the predominant NW-SE strike-slip fault trend started with sinistral displacement and is reactivated during later events to be right (dextral) strike slip cutting with dextral displacement the E-W trending faults; while NE-SW movements are cut by both the N-S and NNW- SSE trends. Remote sensing data revealed that the NW-SE direction that dominated the area is associated with hydrothermal alteration processes. This allowed modifying the major and trace elements of the highly deformed rocks that showed depletion in SiO2 and enrichments in Fe2O3, MnO, Al2O3, TiO2, Na2O, K2O, Cu, Zn and Pb contents. The geochemical signatures of major and trace elements revealed two types of granites including I-type calc-alkaline granites (late-to post-tectonic) that formed during an extensional regime. However, syn-tectonic granitoids are related to subduction-related environment. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Characterizing Drought Effects on Vegetation Productivity in the Four Corners Region of the US Southwest
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The droughts striking the Colorado Plateau, where the Hopi Tribe and Navajo Nation Native American reservation lands are located, and their impacts have appeared slowly and relatively unnoticed in conventional national drought monitoring efforts like the National Drought Monitor. To understand the effect of drought-based drivers on vegetation productivity in the Hopi Tribe and Navajo Nation reservation lands, an assessment approach was developed integrating climate, land cover types, and topographical data with annual geospatially explicit normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-related productivity from 1989 to 2014 derived from 15-day composite multi-sensor NDVI time series data. We studied vegetation-environment relationships by conducting multiple linear regression analysis to explain the driver of vegetation productivity changes. Our results suggest that the interannual change of vegetation productivity showed high variability in middle elevations where needleleaf forest is the dominant vegetation cover type. Our analysis also shows that the spatial variation in interannual variability of vegetation productivity was more driven by climate drivers than by topography ones. Specifically, the interannual variability in spring precipitation and fall temperature seems to be the most significant factor that correlated with the interannual variability in vegetation productivity during the last two and a half decades.

TI  - Improving Winter Storm Forecasts With Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). Part 2: Evaluating a Satellite Gap With Idealized and Targeted Dropsondes
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous satellites utilized in numerical weather prediction are operating beyond their nominal lifetime, and their replacements are not yet operational. We investigate the impacts of a loss of U.S.-based microwave and infrared satellite data and the addition of dropsonde data on forecast skill by conducting Observing System Simulation Experiments with the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts T511 Nature Run and the National Center for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System Model. Removing all U.S.-based microwave and infrared satellite data increases Global Forecast System analysis error, global forecast error, and forecast error during the first 36 hr of three winter storms that impact the United States. Data from Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership contributes roughly one third of the total satellite impacts. Assimilating "idealized" dropsondes (sampling over a large region of the Pacific/Arctic Oceans) significantly improves global forecasts and forecasts for all three storms. Assimilating targeted dropsonde flight paths using the Ensemble Transform Sensitivity method for 15 verification dates/locations for the three storms improves roughly 80% of forecasts relative to the control and 50% of forecasts relative to their corresponding experiments without dropsondes. However, removing satellite data degrades only 30% of targeted domain forecasts relative to the control. These results suggest that targeted dropsondes cannot compensate for a gap in satellite data regarding global average forecasts but may be able to compensate for specific targeted storms. However, as with any study of specific weather events, results are variable and more cases are needed to conclude whether targeted observations-as well as satellite data-can be expected to improve forecasts of specific weather events.-

TI  - Analyzing floating and bedfast lake ice regimes across Arctic Alaska using 25 years of space-borne SAR imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Late-winter lake ice regimes are controlled by water depth relative to maximum ice thickness (MIT). When MIT exceeds maximum water depth, lakes freeze to the bottom with bedfast ice (BI) and when MIT is less than maximum water depth lakes have floating ice (El). Both airborne radar and space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery (Ku-, X-, C-, and L-band) have been used previously to determine whether lakes have a BI or El regime in a given year, across a number of years, or across large regions. In this study, we use a combination of ERS-1/2, RADARSAT-2, Envisat, and Sentinel-1 SAR imagery for seven lake-rich regions in Arctic Alaska to analyze lake ice regime extents and dynamics over a 25-year period (1992-2016). Our interactive threshold classification method determines a unique statistic-based intensity threshold for each SAR scene, allowing for the comparison of classification results from C-band SAR data acquired with different polarizations and incidence angles. Additionally, our novel method accommodates declining signal strength in aging extended-mission satellite SAR instruments. Comparison of SAR ice regime classifications with extensive field measurements from six years yielded a 93% accuracy. Significant declines in BI regimes were only observed in the Fish Creek area with 3% of lakes exhibiting transitional ice regimes lakes that switch from BI to FI during this 25-year period. This analysis suggests that the potential conversion from BI to FI regimes is primarily a function of lake depth distributions in addition to regional differences in climate variability. Remote sensing of lake ice regimes with C-band SAR is a useful tool to monitor the associated thermal impacts on permafrost, since lake ice regimes can be used as a proxy for of sub-lake permafrost thaw, considered by the Global Climate Observing System as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV). Continued winter warming and variable snow conditions in the Arctic are expected and our long-term analysis provides a valuable baseline for predicting where potential future lake ice regimes shifts will be most pronounced.

TI  - Simultaneous comparison and assessment of eight remotely sensed maps of Philippine forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article compares and assesses eight remotely sensed maps of Philippine forest cover in the year 2010. We examined eight Forest versus Non-Forest maps reclassified from eight land cover products: the Philippine Land Cover, the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover, the Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF), the MODIS VCF, the MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1), the Global Tree Canopy Cover, the ALOS-PALSAR Forest/Non-Forest Map, and the GlobeLand30. The reference data consisted of 9852 randomly distributed sample points interpreted from Google Earth. We created methods to assess the maps and their combinations. Results show that the percentage of the Philippines covered by forest ranges among the maps from a low of 23% for the Philippine Land Cover to a high of 67% for GlobeLand30. Landsat VCF estimates 36% forest cover, which is closest to the 37% estimate based on the reference data. The eight maps plus the reference data agree unanimously on 30% of the sample points, of which 11% are attributable to forest and 19% to non-forest. The overall disagreement between the reference data and Philippine Land Cover is 21%, which is the least among the eight Forest versus Non-Forest maps. About half of the 9852 points have a nested structure such that the forest in a given dataset is a subset of the forest in the datasets that have more forest than the given dataset. The variation among the maps regarding forest quantity and allocation relates to the combined effects of the various definitions of forest and classification errors. Scientists and policy makers must consider these insights when producing future forest cover maps and when establishing benchmarks for forest cover monitoring.

TI  - Ultrastaging of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Endometrial Carcinoma According to Use of 2 Different Methods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling may provide staging information without exposing patients to risks of lymph node dissection. There is no consensus protocol for optimal pathologic handling of these specimens. This study compares 2 ultrastaging protocols of SLN in endometrial carcinoma (EC). All SLN were serially sectioned perpendicular to the long axis in 2 mm intervals and entirely submitted for routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) processing. SLN negative by routine processing had ultrastaging (US) by one of the following: method 1 (M1), 5 H&E levels at 250 m intervals with 2 unstained slides at each level; pankeratin immunohistochemistry (IHC) performed on level 1 in cases with negative H&E levels or method 2 (M2), 1 H&E level + 2 unstained slides cut 250 m into the tissue block; pankeratin IHC performed in cases with negative H&E. Histologic subtype, numbers of SLN, positive SLN, non-SLN, positive non-SLN, and metastasis size were recorded. A total of 178 patients had 527 SLNs (1-16 per case; median, 2 SLN) sampled during hysterectomy for the following EC histotypes: endometrioid International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade 1/2, 117 (66%); endometrioid International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade 3, 18 (10%); serous, 20 (11%); carcinosarcoma, 11 (6%); clear cell, 9 (5%); and undifferentiated, 3 (2%). In all, 172 patients had ultrastaging: M1=65; M2=58. In total, 33 patients were SLN positive. Twenty-seven had SLN submitted for US: M1=11; M2=16. Eleven patients had additional SLN detected by US: M1=5; M2=6. Of these, 8 were patients whose SLN were only detected by US representing an increase of 32% in number of patients with positive SLN. Six patients (M1=2; M2=4) with negative SLN had a positive non-SLN. Mean size of ultrastage-detected metastasis was 0.24 mm for M1 and 0.38 mm for M2. Statistical analysis comparing M1 and M2 detected no statistically significant associations with respect to number of positive SLN detected, size of metastasis or false-negative rate and method. The methods performed similarly for both low-grade and high-grade EC. A more comprehensive US protocol had no significant advantages over a single wide interval and IHC in this study population. A pankeratin IHC stain enhances metastasis detection. Additional studies are required to further test this limited protocol as well as to evaluate the clinical significance of the low volume disease detected by ultrastaging.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous head and neck melanoma
T2  - EUROPEAN ARCHIVES OF OTO-RHINO-LARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is now a standard of care for cutaneous melanoma, but it is still controversial for cutaneous head and neck melanoma (CHNM). This study aims to confirm the feasibility, accuracy and low morbidity of SLNB in CHNM and evaluate its prognostic value.A monocentric and retrospective study on patients with CHNM treated in our tertiary care center (Gustave Roussy) between January 2008 and December 2012 was performed. The feasibility, morbidity and prognostic value of this technique were analysed.One hundred and twenty-four consecutive patients were included. SLNB was realized in 97.6% of the cases. No significant post-operative morbidity was observed. Nineteen percents of patients had a positive SN while only 14.3% of complete lymph node dissections (CLND) had additional nodal metastasis. The risk of recurrence after positive SN was significantly higher (69.2 vs 30.8%, p = 0.043). The false omission rate was low with 7.1%. Overall survival and disease-free survival were better in the negative SN group (82 vs 49%, p < 0.001 and 69.3 vs 41.8%, p = 0.0131). The risk of recurrence was significantly higher in the positive SN group (p = 0.043) and when primary tumour was ulcerated (p = 0.031). Only the mitotic rate of the primary tumour was associated with SN positivity (p = 0.049).As in other sites, SLNB status is a strong prognostic factor with comparable false omission rate and no superior morbidity.

TI  - Integrating Team Training in the Pediatric Life Support Program <i>An Effective and Efficient Approach?</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF NURSING ADMINISTRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the feasibility of integrating teamwork training into an established Pediatric Advanced Life Support (PALS) program to assess the effect on teamwork and collaboration among interprofessionals.BACKGROUND: Lack of teamwork and ineffective communication are common contributors to hospital sentinel events. Interprofessional teamwork training to support a culture of patient safety is advocated; however, training methods and related expenses vary widely.METHODS: This study used a descriptive design. All participants received PALS recertification training; the intervention group received an additional 2-hour TeamSTEPPS (R) 2.0 Essentials curriculum with didactic and video critique including role-play on error, communication behaviors, and standard terms. Data were collected on perceptions of teamwork and collaboration. chi(2), Mann-Whitney U, and t tests were used.RESULTS: The intervention group reported significantly higher perceptions of teamwork and collaboration, situational awareness, and ability to help a team make decisions.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that integrating brief team training into an existing PALS program is a feasible, cost-effective, and sustainable method to provide interprofessional team training and positively influence the culture of safety.

TI  - Topographic Correction of Forest Image Data Based on the Canopy Reflectance Model for Sloping Terrains in Multiple Forward Mode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic correction methods rarely consider the canopy parameter effects directly and explicitly for sloping canopies. In order to address this problem, the topographic correction method MFM-GOST2 was developed by implementing the second version of the Geometric-Optical model for Sloping Terrains (the GOST2 model) in the multiple forward mode (MFM) inversion framework. First, a look up table (LUT) was constructed by multiple forward modeling of the GOST2 model; second, the radiance of a remotely sensed image and its corresponding topographic data were used for searching potential canopy parameter combinations from the LUT; and third, the corrected radiance was determined by averaging potential radiances of horizontal canopies from the LUT according to the canopy parameter combinations. The MFM-GOST2 and twelve generally used topographic correction methods were evaluated via a case study by visual analysis, linear relationship analysis, and the rose diagram analysis. The result showed that the MFM-GOST2 method successfully removed most of the topographic effects of a subset image of the Landsat-8 image in a case study. The case study also illustrates that the rose diagram analysis is a good way to evaluate topographic corrections, but the linear relationship analysis cannot be used independently for the evaluations because the decorrelation is not a sufficient condition to determine a successful topographic correction.

TI  - Coseismic landslides triggered by the 8th August 2017 <i>M</i><sub>s</sub> 7.0 Jiuzhaigou earthquake (Sichuan, China): factors controlling their spatial distribution and implications for the seismogenic blind fault identification
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - On 8th August 2017, a magnitude M-s 7.0 earthquake struck the County of Jiuzhaigou, in Sichuan Province, China. It was the third M-s >= 7.0 earthquake in the Longmenshan area in the last decade, after the 2008 M-s 8.0 Wenchuan earthquake and the 2013 M-s 7.0 Lushan earthquake. The event did not produce any evident surface rupture but triggered significant mass wasting. Based on a large set of pre- and post-earthquake high-resolution satellite images (SPOT-5, Gaofen-1 and Gaofen-2) as well as on 0.2-m-resolution UAV photographs, a polygon-based interpretation of the coseismic landslides was carried out. In total, 1883 landslides were identified, covering an area of 8.11 km(2), with an estimated total volume in the order of 25-30 x 10(6) m(3). The total landslide area was lower than that produced by other earthquakes of similar magnitude with strike-slip motion, possibly because of the limited surface rupture. The spatial distribution of the landslides was correlated statistically to a number of seismic, terrain and geological factors, to evaluate the landslide susceptibility at regional scale and to identify the most typical characteristics of the coseismic failures. The landslides, mainly small-scale rockfalls and rock/debris slides, occurred mostly along two NE-SW-oriented valleys near the epicentre. Comparatively, high landslide density was found at locations where the landform evolves from upper, broad valleys to lower, deep-cut gorges. The spatial distribution of the coseismic landslides did not seem correlated to the location of any known active faults. On the contrary, it revealed that a previously-unknown blind fault segment-which is possibly the north-western extension of the Huya fault-is the plausible seismogenic fault. This finding is consistent with what hypothesised on the basis of field observations and ground displacements.

TI  - Are remotely sensed traits suitable for ecological analysis? A case study of long-term drought effects on leaf mass per area of wetland vegetation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant and community traits provide valuable insights in ecosystem functioning. Yet, such traits are costly to sample. Existing trait data bases give access to species-specific traits and help to reduce the sampling effort and costs. However, many traits show a high intra-specific plasticity due to the variability of environmental conditions, which is not fully accounted for in the data bases. As an alternative approach, remote sensing is able to retrieve some traits from the spectral reflectance signal of the canopy. Here we test whether remotely sensed traits provide the level of detail to trace the trait plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions.For this proof of concept study, we selected the example of leaf mass per area (LMA), a key trait for ecosystem functioning and good negative correlate of potential growth rate, in our study site Las Tablas de Daimiel National Park (Spain). This wetland was affected by a long-term drought, which introduced a pronounced trait plasticity as part of the adaptation mechanisms of the vegetation to reduced water availability as well as a decrease in photosynthetic activity. Imaging spectroscopy (HyMap) data of the wetland at peak drought intensity were acquired in 2009 simultaneous to a field campaign. We applied an inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model on these data to map the LMA distribution across the wetland. Further, we quantified trends in photosynthetic activity and changing species composition across the wetland by analyzing time series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as calculated for multispectral remote sensing data. The retrieved LMA values were analyzed within and between stands of different species and communities along a gradient of changing photosynthetic activity and species composition.Results show that LMA values retrieved for stands of species with high photosynthetic activity at peak drought intensity closely meet the values reported in data bases. The observed intra-specific LMA variability is in line with the expected plasticity of this trait along a moisture gradient that is reflected in a change in photosynthetic activity and species composition. We thus conclude that LMA values retrieved from" imaging spectroscopy data provide sufficient detail to trace the response of wetland vegetation to long-term drought stress.

TI  - The Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) Part 2: Uncertainty and Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments (MEaSUREs) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity project, a new global land surface emissivity dataset has been produced by the University of Wisconsin-Madison Space Science and Engineering Center and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). This new dataset termed the Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL), is created by the merging of the UW-Madison MODIS baseline-fit emissivity dataset (UWIREMIS) and JPL's ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset v4 (GEDv4). CAMEL consists of a monthly, 0.05 degrees resolution emissivity for 13 hinge points within the 3.6-14.3 mu m region and is extended to 417 infrared spectral channels using a principal component regression approach. An uncertainty product is provided for the 13 hinge point emissivities by combining temporal, spatial, and algorithm variability as part of a total uncertainty estimate. Part 1 of this paper series describes the methodology for creating the CAMEL emissivity product and the corresponding high spectral resolution algorithm. This paper, Part 2 of the series, details the methodology of the CAMEL uncertainty calculation and provides an assessment of the CAMEL emissivity product through comparisons with (1) ground site lab measurements; (2) a long-term Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) emissivity dataset derived from 8 years of data; and (3) forward-modeled IASI brightness temperatures using the Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) radiative transfer model. Global monthly results are shown for different seasons and International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme land classifications, and case study examples are shown for locations with different land surface types.

TI  - Can MODIS Land Reflectance Products be Used for Estuarine and Inland Waters?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although designed for land surfaces, MODIS Aqua surface reflectance data products (MYD09, termed as R_Land in this work) have also been used for water applications. Yet to date their uncertainties and general suitability in such applications have rarely been documented. In this study, R_Land products of two regions (Chesapeake Bay and Taihu Lake) between July 2002 and December 2015 are evaluated against in situ measurements and against reflectance products derived by the MODIS Ocean Team using atmospheric correction schemes specifically designed for water applications, namely the default atmospheric correction method based on the near-infrared (NIR) bands (denoted as R_NIR, data products available from NASA) and alternative atmospheric correction method based on the shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands (denoted as R_SWIR, data products not available from NASA but require customized processing by the user), respectively. Results suggest high accuracy in R_Land(645) and R_Land(645/555) for both Chesapeake Bay and Taihu Lake in terms of daily spatial distributions, seasonality, and long-term trends. A sensitivity test also shows improved data quality in R_Land(645/555) when data are binned by 7 x 7 pixels in space and 32 days in time. Improved data quality can also be obtained for R_Land(645) when data are only binned in time to minimize the patchiness noise in R_Land daily images. Given the fact that most users do not have the capacity to process low-level data to obtain R_SWIR and the standard NASA R_NIR products often lack coverage over inland waters because they are optimized for global oceans instead of inland waters, this study provides a general guide on the applicability of the widely available R_Land products in inland and estuarine water applications in the absence of customized R_NIR or R_SWIR data products for local regions.

TI  - Groundwater Storage Changes in China from Satellite Gravity: An Overview
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Groundwater plays a critical role in the global water cycle and is the drinking source for almost half of the world's population. However, exact quantification of its storage change remains elusive due primarily to limited ground observations in space and time. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) twin-satellite data have provided global observations of water storage variations at monthly sampling for over a decade and a half, and is enable to estimate changes in groundwater storage (GWS) after removing other water storage components using auxiliary datasets and models. In this paper, we present an overview of GWS changes in three main aquifers within China using GRACE data, and conduct a comprehensive accuracy assessment using in situ ground well observations and hydrological models. GRACE detects a significant GWS depletion rate of 7.2 +/- 1.1 km(3)/yr in the North China Plain (NCP) during 2002-2014, consistent with ground well observations and model predictions. The Liaohe River Basin (LRB) experienced a pronounced GWS decline during 2005-2009, at a depletion rate of 5.0 +/- 1.2 km(3)/yr. Since 2010, GRACE-based GWS reveal a slow recovery in the LRB, with excellent agreement with ground well observations. For the whole study period 2002-2014, no significant long-term GWS depletion is found in the LRB nor in the Tarim Basin. A case study in the Inner Tibetan Plateau highlights there still exist large uncertainties in GRACE-based GWS change estimates.

TI  - The geomagnetic jerk of 2003.5-characterisation with regional observatory secular variation data
T2  - PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2003.5 geomagnetic jerk was identified in geomagnetic records from satellite data, and a matching feature reported in variations in length-of-day (Delta LOD), but detailed study has been hampered by lack of geomagnetic observatory data where it appears strongest. Here we examine secular variation (annual differences of monthly means) based on a new resource of 43 Chinese observatory records for 1998 until the present, focusing on 10 series of particularly high quality and consistency. To obtain a clean series, we calculate the covariance matrix of residuals between measurements and a state-of-the-art field model, CHAOS-6, and use eigenvalue analysis to remove noisy contributions from the uncorrected data. The magnitude of the most significant eigenvector correlates well with Dcx (corrected, extended Dst), suggesting the noise originates from unmodelled external magnetic field. Removal of this noise eliminates much coherent misfit around 2003-2005; nevertheless, the 2003.5 jerk is seen clearly in the first time derivative of the East component in Chinese data, and is also seen in the first time derivative of the vertical component in European data. Estimates of the jerk time are centred on 2003.5, but with some spatial variation; this variation can be eliminated if we allow a discontinuity in the secular variation as well as its temporal gradient. Both regions also provide evidence for a jerk around 2014, although less clearly than 2003.5. We create a new field model based on new data and CHAOS-6 to further examine the regional signals. The new model is close to CHAOS-6, but better fits Chinese data, although modelling also identifies some data features as unphysical.

TI  - Remote Sensing Applied to the Study of Fire Regime Attributes and Their Influence on Post-Fire Greenness Recovery in Pine Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We aimed to analyze the relationship between fire regime attributes and the post-fire greenness recovery of fire-prone pine ecosystems over the short (2-year) and medium (5-year) term after a large wildfire, using both a single and a combined fire regime attribute approach. We characterized the spatial (fire size), temporal (number of fires, fire recurrence, and return interval), and magnitude (burn severity of the last fire) fire regime attributes throughout a 40-year period with a long-time series of Landsat imagery and ancillary data. The burn severity of the last fire was measured by the dNBR (difference of the Normalized Burn Ratio) spectral index, and classified according to the ground reference values of the CBI (Composite Burn Index). Post-fire greenness recovery was obtained through the difference of the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) between pre- and post-fire Landsat scenes. The relationship between fire regime attributes (single attributes: fire recurrence, fire return interval, and burn severity; combined attributes: fire recurrence-burn severity and fire return interval-burn severity) and post-fire greenness recovery was evaluated using linear models. The results indicated that all the single and combined attributes significantly affected greenness recovery. The single attribute approach showed that high recurrence, short return interval and low severity situations had the highest vegetation greenness recovery. The combined attribute approach allowed us to identify a wider variety of post-fire greenness recovery situations than the single attribute one. Over the short term, high recurrence as well as short return interval scenarios showed the best post-fire greenness recovery independently of burn severity, while over the medium term, high recurrence combined with low severity was the most recovered scenario. This novel combined attribute approach (temporal plus magnitude) could be of great value to forest managers in the development of post-fire restoration strategies to promote vegetation recovery in fire-prone pine ecosystems in the Mediterranean Basin under complex fire regime scenarios.

TI  - Characterizing the Impact of Aerosols on Pre-Hurricane Sandy
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on the role that African dust over the Atlantic had on the persistence of the tropical system that eventually became Hurricane Sandy in October 2012. On October 8, a Saharan dust event in the Mauritania region of West Africa transported significant amounts of mineral dust into the troposphere and along the path of an easterly wave created by a break in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The Terra/Aqua-MODIS satellite observations clearly define the spatial distribution of the coarse/fine aerosols, while the CALIPSO observations of the total attenuated backscatter at 532 nm provide a detailed view of the vertical structure and aerosol types in the dust-laden layer. European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 reanalysis data show the distribution of aerosols along the path of the pre-Sandy wave as well as a second wave that formed north of the ITCZ under different condition. The second wave, which started in an area of relatively larger aerosol optical depth (AOD), moved into an area with abnormally low convective available potential energy and AOD, subsequently dying out, while the wave that became Sandy had light aerosol loading (AOD between 0.15-0.5) along a majority of its path. The evidence suggests that aerosols played a nontrivial role in the maintenance of this system until it moved into an environment favorable for cyclogenesis.

TI  - Evaluating the Interplay Between Biophysical Processes and Leaf Area Changes in Land Surface Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Models (LSMs) are essential to reproduce biophysical processes modulated by vegetation and to predict the future evolution of the land-climate system. To assess the performance of an ensemble of LSMs (JSBACH, JULES, ORCHIDEE, CLM, and LPJ-GUESS) a consistent set of land surface energy fluxes and leaf area index (LAI) has been generated. Relationships of interannual variations of modeled surface fluxes and LAI changes have been analyzed at global scale across climatological gradients and compared with those obtained from satellite-based products. Model-specific strengths and deficiencies were diagnosed for tree and grass biomes. Results show that the responses of grasses are generally well represented in models with respect to the observed interplay between turbulent fluxes and LAI, increasing the confidence on how the LAI-dependent partition of net radiation into latent and sensible heat are simulated. On the contrary, modeled forest responses are characterized by systematic bias in the relation between the year-to-year variability in LAI and net radiation in cold and temperate climates, ultimately affecting the amount of absorbed radiation due to LAI-related effects on surface albedo. In addition, for tree biomes, the relationships between LAI and turbulent fluxes appear to contradict the experimental evidences. The dominance of the transpiration-driven over the observed albedo-driven effects might suggest that LSMs have the incorrect balance of these two processes. Such mismatches shed light on the limitations of our current understanding and process representation of the vegetation control on the surface energy balance and help to identify critical areas for model improvement.

AB  - Surgery is the mainstay for treatment of oral carcinomas in respectable tumors in conjunction with stage-dependent radiotherapy and (radio)chemotherapy. Although many questions remain unanswered, a lot of data exist on the effectiveness of surgical resection of the primary tumor as well as on treatment of the regional lymphatic basins. Besides nodal status, the resection margins and the resection status are the crucial prognostic parameters. This underlines the high significance of the quality of surgical resection. Data are also available for the problem of mandibular resection; however, conclusions at a higher evidence level are more difficult to draw. For lower- and middle-stage oral carcinomas, surgical therapy currently sets the benchmark for treatment, also in terms of posttreatment functionality and quality of life.

AB  - Major progress has been made in the treatment of malignant melanoma during recent years. On the one hand, reliable evidence-based recommendations regarding surgical resection as well as lymph node management have been established on the basis of results from randomized multicenter studies. On the other hand, the advent of targeted therapies has led to spectacular improvements in the treatment of metastasized melanomas. Knowledge concerning treatment algorithms and updates thereof is also essential for maxillofacial surgeons. The German S3 guideline on diagnosis and treatment of melanoma was published in 2013 and revised in 2016 and 2018. This article informs readers about these developments and addresses the items relevant for treatment of head and neck melanomas in particular.

TI  - Deforestation and child diet diversity: A geospatial analysis of 15 Sub-Saharan African countries
T2  - HEALTH & PLACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation worldwide could have important consequences for diet quality and human nutrition given the numerous ecosystem services that are provided by forests and biodiverse landscapes. Yet, empirical research assessing the links between deforestation and diets is lacking. In this study, we examined the association between deforestation and diet diversity among children using geolocated Demographic and Health Survey data for 33,777 children across 15 countries of sub-Saharan Africa coupled with remotely-sensed data on forest cover loss. Deforestation was negatively associated with diet diversity (regression coefficient (95% CI): -0.47 (-0.76, -0.18)), as well as recent consumption of legumes and nuts, flesh foods, and fruits and vegetables among children aged 6 months to 24 months. Regionally, these trends were statistically significant only in the West Africa region. This hypothesis-generating research adds to the growing body of evidence that forests and forest-based ecosystems are associated with diet quality and nutrition and provides support for future studies that examine mechanisms linking forest loss and human nutrition.

TI  - Hydrological network and classification of lakes on the Third Pole
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity and form of changes in closed lakes, upstream lakes and outflow lakes on the Third Pole (TP) differ based on their drainage mode. Researchers' insufficient understanding of the hydrological networks associated with lakes hampers studies of the relationship between lakes and climate. In this study, we establish a comprehensive hydrological network for each lake ( > 1 km(2)) on the TP using 106 Landsat images, 236 Chinese topographic maps, and SRTM DEM. Three-hundred-ninety-seven closed lakes, 488 upstream lakes and 317 outflow lakes totaling 3,5498.49 km(2), 7,378.82 km(2), and 3,382.29 km(2), respectively, were identified on the TP using 2010 data. Two-hundred-thirty-four closed lakes were found to not be linked to upstream lakes. The remaining 163 closed lakes were connected to and fed by the 488 upstream lakes. The object-oriented analyses within this study indicated that more rapid changes occurred in the surface extent of closed lakes than in upstream lakes or outflow lakes on the TP from 1970s to 2010. Furthermore, the water volume of the examined closed lakes was almost nine times greater than that of the upstream lakes from 2003 to 2009. All the examined closed lakes exhibited an obvious water volume change compared to the corresponding upstream lakes in the same basin. Furthermore, two case studies illustrate that the annual and seasonal dynamics associated with the changes in closed lakes may reflect climate change patterns, while the upstream lake dynamics may be more controlled by the lakeshore terrain and drainage characteristics. The lake inventory and hydrological network catalogued in this study provide a basis for developing a better understanding of lake response to climate change on the TP.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The potential of citizen science in monitoring transient biological phenomena occurring over large spatial scales, such as the blooming of jellyfish species, has received increased acknowledgment in recent years. The Spot the Jellyfish citizen science campaign was launched by the International Ocean Institute and by the University of Malta in the summer of 2010, with thousands of jellyfish spotting reports having been submitted by sea-users through the campaign website, social media site, smart phone app or even through email, since then. The 2011-2015 submitted jellyfish reports were analysed, besides a number of water quality parameters (temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a content, nutrient and phytoplankton concentration), whose values were gleaned for the marine area of interest through online satellite water quality data portals. The main aim of this exercise was to seek to identify possible relationships, through a variety of univariate and multivariate statistical techniques, between the distribution of submitted campaign jellyfish records and the same water quality parameters. Possible bias introduced in the report database through artefacts such as differences in bay frequentation were addressed through normalisation procedures. Spatial differences in the abundance of jellyfish reports submitted along different parts of the Maltese coastline emerged, with the highest number of such reports having been submitted along the north-eastern coastline of the island of Malta, and jellyfish sighting reports correlated well with the values of the selected water quality values. Despite this, our results indicate that besides the selected water quality parameters, other forces, possibly hydrodynamic ones, were contributing to the recorded spatial variability in jellyfish occurrence.

TI  - Evaluating Renewable Groundwater Stress with GRACE Data in Greece
T2  - GROUNDWATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a resilient water source and its importance is even greater in periods of drought. Areas such as the Mediterranean where adverse climate change effects are expected are bell-weather locations for groundwater depletion and are of considerable interest. The present study evaluates renewable groundwater stress (RGS) as the ratio of groundwater use to groundwater availability, quantifying use as the trend in gravity recovery and climate experiment-derived (GRACE) subsurface anomalies (Delta GW(trend)) and renewable groundwater availability as mean annual recharge. Estimates for mean annual recharge for the various regions in Greece have been derived using numerical models. Our results highlight two RGS regimes in Greece (variable stress and unstressed) of the four characteristic stress regimes, that is, overstressed, variable stress, human-dominated stress, and unstressed, defined as a function of the sign of use and the sign of groundwater availability (positive or negative). Variable stress areas are found in Central Greece (Thessaly region), where intensive agriculture results in negative Delta GW(trend) values combined with positive mean annual recharge rates. RGS values range from -0.05 to 0, indicating a low impact area. Within this region, adverse effects of groundwater overexploitation are already evident based on the negative GRACE anomalies; however, recharge is still positive, mitigating the effects of over-pumping. The rest of Greek aquifers fall within the unstressed category, with RGS values from 0.02 to 0.05, indicating that the rate of use is less than the natural recharge rate.

TI  - Predicting Missing Values in Spatio-Temporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous, consistent, and long time-series from remote sensing are essential to monitoring changes on Earth's surface. However, analyzing such data sets is often challenging due to missing values introduced by cloud cover, missing orbits, sensor geometry artifacts, and so on. We propose a new and accurate spatio-temporal prediction method to replace missing values in remote sensing data sets. The method exploits the spatial coherence and temporal seasonal regularity that are inherent in many data sets. The key parts of the method are: 1) the adaptively chosen spatio-temporal subsets around missing values; 2) the ranking of images within the subsets based on a scoring algorithm; 3) the estimation of empirical quantiles characterizing the missing values; and 4) the prediction of missing values through quantile regression. One advantage of quantile regression is the robustness to outliers, which enables more accurate parameter retrieval in the analysis of remote sensing data sets. In addition, we provide bootstrap-based quantification of prediction uncertainties. The proposed prediction method was applied to a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data set from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and assessed with realistic test data sets featuring between 20% and 50% missing values. Validation against established methods showed that the proposed method has a good performance in terms of the root-mean-squared prediction error and significantly outperforms its competitors. This paper is accompanied by the open-source R package gapfill, which provides a flexible, fast, and ready-to-use implementation of the method.

TI  - Multiscale nonlinear microscopy and widefield white light imaging enables rapid histological imaging of surgical specimen margins
T2  - BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to histologically assess surgical specimens in real-time is a long-standing challenge in cancer surgery, including applications such as breast conserving therapy (BCT). Up to 40% of women treated with BCT for breast cancer require a repeat surgery due to postoperative histological findings of close or positive surgical margins using conventional formalin fixed paraffin embedded histology. Imaging technologies such as nonlinear microscopy (NLM), combined with exogenous fluorophores can rapidly provide virtual H&E imaging of surgical specimens without requiring microtome sectioning, facilitating intraoperative assessment of margin status. However, the large volume of typical surgical excisions combined with the need for rapid assessment, make comprehensive cellular resolution margin assessment during surgery challenging. To address this limitation, we developed a multiscale, real-time microscope with variable magnification NLM and real-time, co-registered position display using a widefield white light imaging system. Margin assessment can be performed rapidly under operator guidance to image specific regions of interest located using widefield imaging. Using simulated surgical margins dissected from human breast excisions, we demonstrate that multi-centimeter margins can be comprehensively imaged at cellular resolution, enabling intraoperative margin assessment. These methods are consistent with pathology assessment performed using frozen section analysis (FSA), however NLM enables faster and more comprehensive assessment of surgical specimens because imaging can be performed without freezing and cryo-sectioning. Therefore, NLM methods have the potential to be applied to a wide range of intra-operative applications.

TI  - Monitoring changes of NDVI in protected areas of southern California
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - California's Mediterranean ecosystem has been identified as one of the Earth's biodiversity hotspots. The high degree of rapid urbanization along the southern California coastline has resulted in the loss of significant natural areas over the last century and protected areas that do exist may be further threatened by climate change, drought, and fire. We use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor at a 250 m pixel resolution and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to monitor temporal/spatial patterns from 2000 to 2016 within Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area and Channel Islands National Park. We test the hypothesis that there should be no significant long-term change in protected areas, since 2000 and compare impacts of seasonality, drought, and fire. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area has experienced a long-term decline in vegetation greenness, vegetation types, and is the most significantly impacted with short-term declines during the summer with or without the impacts of fire. Change detection maps show areas of significant decline in NDVI in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area especially during the summer. The Channel Islands have relatively stable NDVI possibly due to the removal of non-native herbivores and the maritime climate around the Channel Islands may buffer some of the impacts of the regional drought. The MODIS 'sensors appears appropriate for identifying landscape patterns, time series, change detection maps, and the potential impacts from climate change for each park. Results suggest that all National Park landscapes and vegetation types can be. inventoried at a 250 m resolution and monitored at a high temporal resolution.

TI  - Surveillance of sexualised drug use - the challenges and the opportunities
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sexualised drug use (SDU), the use of drugs in a sexual context, has emerged as a marker of high-risk sexual activity and poor sexual health among gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, however, there are no robust estimates of the prevalence of SDU. The primary sources of surveillance data on SDU should include both sexual health and drug treatment services. The challenges to achieving comprehensive, timely and valid SDU surveillance include establishing case definitions, selecting appropriate surveillance settings, and normalising the monitoring of SDU at clinical services. In this commentary we propose a means to address these challenges and discuss other sources of SDU data from ad hoc population surveys and sentinel systems. We also present case studies of SDU surveillance development in England and Switzerland. The patterns of SDU will be affected by a rapidly changing drug market and, as a result, surveillance systems must continuously adapt to ensure that they are fit for purpose and can provide data to guide policy.

TI  - European Funds and the Hermeneutics of the Capitalist Crisis: Insights from within the Greek State
T2  - POLAR-POLITICAL AND LEGAL ANTHROPOLOGY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I seek to explore the political and epistemological implications of European Union developmental funds in settings of policymaking in Greece. Building on fieldwork with specialized technocrats in Athens and with political personnel in Evros, I initially posit that the discourse on European funds has functioned as a recurrent argument for the justification of a coherent liberal idealist paradigm starting in the 1980s. Notwithstanding the ideological usage of European funds, I suggest that its increasing relevance in the practices and worldview of these social agents also pertains to a broader relocation of political and analytical focus onto the ethical conduct and qualitative features of dominated classes. Most evidently, the recent manifestation of the capitalist crisis in Greece reactualized the precept of moral and cultural introspection as well as its interrelation with the discourse of past benefaction. n this sense, the recent crisis also made evident the pertinence of Michel Foucault's hermeneutics of the self to understand the delineation of class hegemony in capitalism. I argue that the discourse of European funds has been conducive to the consolidation of the hermeneutics of the self as an overarching political imperative in Greek society over the last decades.

AB  - Research related land use to the installation of real estate developments in Iranduba - AM. The land use maps were elaborated to describe two moments, 2006 and 2015. The satellite images Landsat 5 TM of (16-07-2006) and Landsat 8 of (11-09-2015). The image processing performed in the software Spring 5.4.3, generated a classification, the classes were obtained: forest, black water, white water, agriculture and exposed soil. In both maps the forest areas are dominant and are located to the northwest of the municipality, the agricultural areas appear in the vicinity of the city of Iranduba and the highway AM-070. The white water class had an increase in 2015 (10.88 to 12.25%) to the detriment of the reduction of black waters (4.19 to 2.87%). The increase of exposed soil (1.05 to 1.79%) and the decrease of agriculture (10.34 to 7.40%) is related to the replacement of agricultural areas by real estate projects. The area comprised by the planned New Manaus neighborhood in 2013, was used in 2007 for agriculture and livestock. The real estate interest, on the areas is due to the proximity of the Highway AM-070 and have already been deforested. For now it has several real estate developments, transforming the local landscape, which are in the stage of installation and sale, but mostly in exposed soil.

TI  - Effects of the 2013-2016 warm anomalies on the California Current phytoplankton
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anomalies occurring in the California Current System during 2013-2016 were examined using remote sensing data and in-situ measurements. Positive anomalies in sea surface temperature (SST, up to 4 degrees C) and absolute dynamic topography (ADT, up to 20 cm), as well as negative anomalies in satellite chlorophyll concentration (CHL, up to -3.0 mg m(-3)) were recorded. In-situ temperature anomalies in August 2014 increased equatorward, from 2 degrees C along the northernmost line (CalCOFI hydrographic line 76.7) to 10 degrees C (below similar to 80 m depth) at the southernmost hydrographic line (off Baja California). In-situ negative Chlorophyll-alpha (Chl-alpha) surface anomalies were similar in most of the lines examined (similar to -1.5 mg m(-3)), but for the CalCOFI lines, larger anomalies (similar to 3.5 mg m(-3)) were recorded. As a result of increased stratification, mirrored in the increase in mean monthly ADT and the upper water-column temperature, the 2003-2016 CHL time series showed a declining trend in phytoplankton production and biomass, which was particularly pronounced during the last four years in the central and southern zones of the California Current System. The mechanisms responsible for this trend seem to be related to a climate shift from cold to warm in the northeastern Pacific Ocean, as evidenced by large correlations between the CHL anomalies and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Multivariate ENSO Index, and Oceanic El Nino indices. Generalized additive models were used to explore the relationship between stratification and the decline in phytoplankton production. Two ADT ranges-characteristic of either highly dynamic or stratified environments-were defined, both of which led to a drop in primary production. The effects of these environments have been associated with the photo acclimation of phytoplankton to irradiance and nutrient availability regimes, by which primary production and biomass decrease due to the limitation of either of these factors. This study reveals some of the effects of the warm anomalies occurring from 2013 to 2016 in the California Current ecosystem, which will help to understand changes in higher trophic levels in this region.

TI  - Estimation of Above Ground Biomass in a Tropical Mountain Forest in Southern Ecuador Using Airborne LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A reliable estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in Tropical Mountain Forest (TMF) is still complicated, due to fast-changing climate and topographic conditions, which modifies the forest structure within fine scales. The variations in vertical and horizontal forest structure are hardly detectable by small field plots, especially in natural TMF due to the high tree diversity and the inaccessibility of remote areas. Therefore, the present approach used remotely sensed data from a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensor in combination with field measurements to estimate AGB accurately for a catchment in the Andes of south-eastern Ecuador. From the LiDAR data, information about horizontal and vertical structure of the TMF could be derived and the vegetation at tree level classified, differentiated between the prevailing forest types (ravine forest, ridge forest and Elfin Forest). Furthermore, topographical variables (Topographic Position Index, TPI; Morphometric Protection Index, MPI) were calculated by means of the high-resolution LiDAR data to analyse the AGB distribution within the catchment. The field measurements included different tree parameters of the species present in the plots, which were used to determine the local mean Wood Density (WD) as well as the specific height-diameter relationship to calculate AGB, applying regional scale modelling at tree level. The results confirmed that field plot measurements alone cannot capture completely the forest structure in TMF but in combination with high resolution LiDAR data, applying a classification at tree level, the AGB amount (Mg ha(-1)) and its distribution in the entire catchment could be estimated adequately (model accuracy at tree level: R-2 > 0.91). It was found that the AGB distribution is strongly related to ridges and depressions (TPI) and to the protection of the site (MPI), because high AGB was also detected at higher elevations (up to 196.6 Mg ha(-1), above 2700 m), if the site is situated in depressions (ravine forest) and protected by the surrounding terrain. In general, highest AGB is stored in the protected ravine TMF parts, also at higher elevations, which could only be detected by means of the remote sensed data in high resolution, because most of these areas are inaccessible. Other vegetation units, present in the study catchment (pasture and subparamo) do not contain large AGB stocks, which underlines the importance of intact natural forest stands.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the dynamics of temporary water bodies (TWBs) is crucial for sustainable development in the drylands of northern China (DNC). Our objective was to quantify the dynamics of TWBs in the DNC between 2000 and 2015. First, we extracted TWBs in the DNC from 2000 to 2015 using the modified normalized difference water index based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data. Then, we examined the spatiotemporal patterns of TWBs in the DNC at multiple scales, ranging from the entire region to basins. We found that the area of TWBs increased significantly in the DNC (5.97 thousand km(2) in 2000 to 9.92 thousand km(2) in 2015) at an annual growth rate of 4.41%. The Heilongjiang Basin had the largest increase in TWBs (848 km(2) in 2000 to 3230 km(2) in 2015), with an annual growth rate of 23.41%. Such growth was mainly attributed to changes in precipitation in the DNC. We also found that approximately 1/3 of the increase in TWBs was distributed over grasslands and barren lands, which provide valuablewater resources that may improve biodiversity and ecosystem services in the DNC. Thus, we suggest that effective measures are needed to manage TWBs to achieve sustainable development in the DNC.

TI  - Quantifying CDOM and DOC in major Arctic rivers during ice-free conditions using Landsat TM and ETM plus data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As high-latitudes warm, permafrost thaws, and the hydrological cycle accelerates, ground-based monitoring of riverine organic matter may be supplemented by satellite remote sensing during ice-free conditions. Recent programs, namely the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory, have established methodologically consistent sampling across the hydrograph, and shared the resulting data publicly. However, these efforts are limited by frequency, funding, and length of record. Satellite remote sensing can be used to estimate chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) as a riverine constituent that influences optical properties in surface waters. In this study, daily CDOM absorption was first estimated using discharge-constituent regression-based models for 2000-2013. We then regressed these discharge-based CDOM estimates against Landsat TM and ETM + surface reflectance data from Google Earth Engine for the six largest rivers draining the pan-Arctic watershed (the Kolyma, Lena, Mackenzie, Ob', Yenisey, and Yukon rivers). These CDOM results were converted to dissolved organic carbon (DOC), using the strong relationship (R-2 = 0.88) between direct measurements of the two constituents. Using river-specific remote sensing models, R-2 could be as high as 0.84. Grouping all rivers into a single "universal" regression reduced R-2 and increased root mean square errors, such as in the Yenisey River where R-2 dropped by 0.63, and RMSE rose by 1.1 m(-1). Seasonally varying discharge drove much of the variation in satellite-derived CDOM and DOC, corroborating recent studies. Satellite imagery can increase the frequency of monitoring observations, particularly during summer and fall when riverine CDOM absorption may be most sensitive to thawing permafrost.

TI  - Acculturation expectation profiles of Russian majority group members and their intergroup attitudes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTERCULTURAL RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Employing a person-oriented approach to acculturation expectations held by Russian majority group members, we investigated the presence of groups of profiles and relationships between acculturation expectation profiles and intergroup attitudes. Applying latent profile analysis, we found three easy-to-interpret acculturation expectation profiles: biculturalism expectations, alternate-biculturalism expectations (with public-private domain differences in preference), and assimilation expectations. The subsequent comparative analysis showed that these profiles mainly differed in the extent of the desirability of maintenance of heritage culture, and adoption of the mainstream culture by immigrants only in private domains of life. The biculturalism expectation profile contained individuals who support the idea of a multicultural society. The alternate-biculturalism expectation profile contained individuals with slightly less emphasis on adoption of mainstream acculturation for immigrants, a distinction between preferences in the public and private domains of life, more focus on public domains, and less right-wing authoritarianism. The assimilation expectation profile contained individuals with a higher dangerous worldview and endorsement of discrimination, and lower support of a multicultural ideology, willingness to engage in intergroup contact, and desire of maintenance of heritage acculturation for immigrants. Our study demonstrated the value of a person-oriented approach in a population where subgroups differ in the domain dependence of their acculturation expectations.

T2  - REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The characterization of land uses represents one of the essential inputs for the management of natural resources at different scales.Objective: To develop a methodology to characterize land use in the upper creek basin from the Azul stream (Buenos Aires, Argentina), through the fusion of satellite images with a medium spatial resolution.Materials and methods: A time-series of 23 images was used from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the MODIS-Terra satellite (product MOD13Q1) for the period May 2015 - May 2016. Landsat 8 images were used to discriminate some categories difficult to classify with NDVI-MODIS. The final cover map was validated regarding verification points independent to the classification process; its accuracy was evaluated by means of the Kappa statistic.Results and discussion: The NDVI time series allowed to recognize the phenological patterns of the covers and land use of greater representativeness in the region. Seven land cover were discriminated; the agricultural uses represented 81.5 % of the surface, double-crop wheat-soya (soybean in Argentina) system predominated (39.4 %). The overall accuracy of the final map was high (88.9 %, Kappa coefficient = 0.86).Conclusion: The methodology used has the advantage of being quick and replicable, to characterize the land uses of a given region and to evaluate its potential changes over time.

TI  - Evaluation of a Bayesian Algorithm to Detect Burned Areas in the Canary Islands' Dry Woodlands and Forests Ecoregion Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burned Area (BA) is deemed as a primary variable to understand the Earth's climate system. Satellite remote sensing data have allowed for the development of various burned area detection algorithms that have been globally applied to and assessed in diverse ecosystems, ranging from tropical to boreal. In this paper, we present a Bayesian algorithm (BY-MODIS) that detects burned areas in a time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2002 to 2012 of the Canary Islands' dry woodlands and forests ecoregion (Spain). Based on daily image products MODIS, MOD09GQ (250 m), and MOD11A1 (1 km), the surface spectral reflectance and the land surface temperature, respectively, 10 day composites were built using the maximum temperature criterion. Variables used in BY-MODIS were the Global Environment Monitoring Index (GEMI) and Burn Boreal Forest Index (BBFI), alongside the NIR spectral band, all of which refer to the previous year and the year the fire took place in. Reference polygons for the 14 fires exceeding 100 hectares and identified within the period under analysis were developed using both post-fire LANDSAT images and official information from the forest fires national database by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment of Spain (MAPAMA). The results obtained by BY-MODIS can be compared to those by official burned area products, MCD45A1 and MCD64A1. Despite that the best overall results correspond to MCD64A1, BY-MODIS proved to be an alternative for burned area mapping in the Canary Islands, a region with a great topographic complexity and diverse types of ecosystems. The total burned area detected by the BY-MODIS classifier was 64.9% of the MAPAMA reference data, and 78.6% according to data obtained from the LANDSAT images, with the lowest average commission error (11%) out of the three products and a correlation (R-2) of 0.82. The Bayesian algorithmoriginally developed to detect burned areas in North American boreal forests using AVHRR archival data Long-Term Data Recordcan be successfully applied to a lower latitude forest ecosystem totally different from the boreal ecosystem and using daily time series of satellite images from MODIS with a 250 m spatial resolution, as long as a set of training areas adequately characterising the dynamics of the forest canopy affected by the fire is defined.

TI  - Observing Scattering Mechanisms of Bubbled Freshwater Lake Ice Using Polarimetric RADARSAT-2 (C-Band) and UW-Scat (X- and Ku-Bands)
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A winter time series of ground-based (X- and Ku-bands) scatterometer and spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) (C-band) fully polarimetric observations coincident with in situ snow and ice measurements are used to identify the dominant scattering mechanism in bubbled freshwater lake ice in the Hudson Bay Lowlands near Churchill, Manitoba. Scatterometer observations identify two physical sources of backscatter from the ice cover: the snow-ice and ice-water interfaces. Backscatter time series at all frequencies show increases from the ice-water interface prior to the inclusion of tubular bubbles in the ice column based on in situ observations, indicating scattering mechanisms independent of double-bounce scatter. The co-polarized phase difference of interactions at the ice-water interface from both scatterometer and SAR observations is centered at 0 degrees during the time series, also indicating a scattering regime other than double bounce. A Yamaguchi three-component decomposition of the RADARSAT-2 C-band time series is presented, which suggests the dominant scattering mechanism to be single-bounce off the ice-water interface with appreciable surface roughness or preferentially oriented facets, regardless of the presence, absence, or density of tubular bubble inclusions. This paper builds on newly established evidence of single-bounce scattering mechanism for freshwater lake ice and is the first to present a winter time series of ground-based and spaceborne fully polarimetric active microwave observations with polarimetric decompositions for bubbled freshwater lake ice.

TI  - Improved Spatial Collocation and Parallax Correction Approaches for Calibration Accuracy Validation of Thermal Emissive Band on Geostationary Platform
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Calibration accuracy validation (CAV) can usually be realized by intercalibration between different satellites. Under the framework of Global Space-Based Intercalibration System (GSICS), two modifications, improved spatial collocation with variable weighting (VW) and parallax correction (PC) approaches, to enhance the CAV performance are proposed. Distinguished from the uniform weighting method recommended by GSICS, the proposed VW one establishes a novel way of overlapping identification and overlapping area computation that is widely suitable for measurements from both the same and different platforms. Simulations indicate that the uncertainty of the VW method behaves better for the collocated targets far away from satellite's nadir with a certain geolocation error, and is superior to 0.6 K for most overlapping situations when the geolocation error is less than 0.5 pixels. Case application shows that the VW method can significantly alleviate the uncertainty of assessed biases in brightness temperature (BT) by around 0.1-0.3 K for target nonuniformity larger than 2.5%, where the optimal bias estimation can be implemented with its uncertainty as little as possible. Besides the uncertainty improvement, the PC approach has the capability to reduce the bias of CAV by around 0.2-0.3 K, especially for BT range lower than 220 K with a limited number of paired samples. Long-term results show that the monthly biases of FY-2E and FY-2G satellites were superior to 1.5 and 1.0 K, respectively, where the mean monthly absolute biases of FY-2G IR1-IR3 bands were 0.4, 0.6, and 0.5 K, respectively. The proposed VW and PC methods are recommended for GSICS utilization and will further benefit to a more comprehensive community.

TI  - Monitoring the Results of Foodborne Diseases in Sentinel Hospitals in Wenzhou City, China from 2014 to 2015
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To investigate the epidemiologic distribution of foodborne diseases in Wenzhou City from 2014-2015, we analyzed the characteristics and main pathogens of foodborne disease outbreaks to provide a reference for the prevention, control, and early warning of foodborne diseases.Methods: A total of 9139 patients with foodborne diseases were included in the database of active monitoring from sentinel hospitals in Wenzhou City, China. Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, and norovirus in the stool samples collected from patients with foodborne diseases were detected according to national standards.Results: There were 82 cases of Salmonella, 6 cases of Shigella, 393 cases of V. parahaemolyticus, 9 cases of diarrhoeagenic E. coli, and 143 cases of norovirus in the 9139 stool and anal swab samples, for a total detection rate of 6.98%. The peak season in which foodborne diseases occurred was from Jun-Oct. The high-risk populations were the 0-5, 16-25, 26-35, 35-45, and 46-55 yr age groups. Aquatic products accounted for the greatest proportion of suspected food, followed by meat, poultry, fruits, and vegetables.Conclusion: V. parahaemolyticus was the main pathogen of foodborne diseases in the Wenzhou urban area; Salmonella and norovirus were also foodborne disease pathogens. To prevent foodborne diseases, it is necessary to strengthen active monitoring, especially the sanitary management of seafood.

TI  - Hyperspectral Measurement of Seasonal Variation in the Coverage and Impacts of an Invasive Grass in an Experimental Setting
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing can be a powerful tool for detecting invasive species and their impact across large spatial scales. However, remote sensing studies of invasives rarely occur across multiple seasons, although the properties of invasives often change seasonally. This may limit the detection of invasives using remote sensing through time. We evaluated the ability of hyperspectral measurements to quantify the coverage of a plant invader and its impact on senesced plant coverage and canopy equivalent water thickness (EWT) across seasons. A portable spectroradiometer was used to collect data in a field experiment where uninvaded plant communities were experimentally invaded by cogongrass, a non-native perennial grass, or maintained as an uninvaded reference. Vegetation canopy characteristics, including senesced plant material, the ratio of live to senesced plants, and canopy EWT varied across the seasons and showed different temporal patterns between the invaded and reference plots. Partial least square regression (PLSR) models based on a single season had a limited predictive ability for data from a different season. Models trained with data from multiple seasons successfully predicted invasive plant coverage and vegetation characteristics across multiple seasons and years. Our results suggest that if seasonal variation is accounted for, the hyperspectral measurement of invaders and their effects on uninvaded vegetation may be scaled up to quantify effects at landscape scales using airborne imaging spectrometers.

TI  - Contemporary Trend in Erosion of Arable Southern Chernozems (<i>Haplic Chernozems Pachic</i>) in the West of Orenburg Oblast (Russia)
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The contemporary trend in the degradation of arable southern chernozems (Haplic Chernozems Pachic) in the steppe zone of south-eastern European Russia under the impact of water erosion has been evaluated based on a field study of changes in the deposition rate of eroded products on the bottoms of the currently stable negative landforms within a small catchment (1.92 km(2) in area) with almost completely tilled slopes in the west of Orenburg oblast, in the basin of the Samara River (a left tributary of the Volga River). The dating of deposited sediments and the analysis of their temporal dynamics have been performed using the radioactive isotope Cs-137 as a chronomarker. The results of a thorough analysis of catchment topography, grain size distribution data on soils and sediments, hydrometeorological observations, and satellite data have been used. It is found that the mean accumulation rate of chernozem erosion products on the bottom of a small catchment valley was 1.9-2.0 cm/year (16.5-28.4 kg/m(2) annually) during the period of 1959-1986 (4.2-4.8 cm/year, or 30.4-83.5 kg/m(2) annually in 1959-1963) compared to only 0.52-0.68 cm/year, or 6.6-11.9 kg/m(2) annually, during the period of 1986-2016; i.e., the thickness of deposited sediments decreased at least by 3.0-3.6 times, and their mass decreased by 2.0-4.3 times (2.9 times on the average). It is shown that the main reason for the presumed significant decrease in the erosion rate of southern chernozems in the region during the last decades was the reduction in surface water runoff from slopes during the spring snowmelt period, as well as the probable change in the structure of crop rotation toward some increase in the share of perennial grasses, and erosion control measures.

TI  - Long-Term Validation of TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X Orbit Solutions with Laser and Radar Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise orbit determination solutions for the two spacecrafts TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX) are operationally computed at the German Space Operations Center (GSOC/DLR). This publication makes use of 6 years of TSX and TDX orbit solutions for a detailed orbit validation. The validation compares the standard orbit products with newly determined enhanced orbit solutions, which additionally consider GPS ambiguity fixing and utilize a macro model for modeling non-gravitational forces. The technique of satellite laser ranging (SLR) serves as a key measure for validating the derived orbit solutions. In addition, the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments on-board both spacecrafts are for the first time employed for orbit validation. Both the microwave instrument and the optical laser approach are compared and assessed. The average SLR residuals, obtained from the TSX and TDX enhanced orbit solutions within the analysis period, are at 1.6 +/- 11.4mm (1 sigma) and 1.2 +/- 12.5mm, mm, respectively. Compared to the standard orbit products, this is an improvement of 33 % in standard deviation. The corresponding radar range biases are in the same order and amount to - 3.5 +/- 12.5mm and 4.5 +/- 14.9mm. Along with the millimeter level position offsets in radial, along-track and cross-track inferred from the SLR data on a monthly basis, the results confirm the advantage of the enhanced orbit solutions over the standard orbit products.

TI  - Chronic, refractory ulcer on the ring finger. Manifestation of distal epithelioid sarcoma
T2  - HAUTARZT
M3  - Article
AB  - The epithelioid sarcoma classic, "distal" type was first published in 1970. It is a very rare, malignant, aggressive subcutaneous soft tissue sarcoma that shows characteristic positivity for both epithelial and mesenchymal immunohistochemical markers. It grows very slowly and mostly presents in young men. Clinically the tumor is characterized as a coarse cutaneous or subcutaneous nodular induration that often ulcerates in the course of the disease. An association with trauma is often described and can lengthen time to diagnosis. Most frequently it is found on the flexural side of fingers, the back of the hands, soles of the feet, and extensor sides of arms and legs. Specific for this type of sarcoma is the progression along nerves, tendons, and fasciae. Treatment of choice should be wide excision of the tumor, sentinel node biopsy, and possibly even localized postoperative radiation therapy. Unfortunately the epithelioid sarcoma is very likely to recur and is then associated with metastases in the lung and lymph nodes.

TI  - Controversies in Gynecologic Cancer Staging: An <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, Eighth Edition</i> Perspective
T2  - AJSP-REVIEWS AND REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Staging systems provide a common language to support clinical research and decision making in patients with cancer. The eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual incorporates updates that reflect evolving clinical practices and scientific insights. The present article summarizes changes that have been made for gynecologic subsites and outlines continued challenges. Gynecologic American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer staging continues to conform closely to current International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology staging. The eighth edition is aligned with the major revision made to International Federation of Obstetrics and Gynecology staging of ovarian cancer in 2014 and contains a unified staging system for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer. Continuing challenges for ovarian cancer include determining the relative significance of intraoperative rupture, surface involvement, and positive washings, which are rank ordered in the new staging system. Another challenge is assignment of a tubal versus ovarian primary site for high-grade serous carcinoma, which cannot be done in a reliable way. In uterine carcinoma, endometrial intraepithelial carcinoma is now recognized as a T1 cancer, and nodal micrometastases have been defined with their own N stage. Also, isolated tumor cells in lymph nodes have been incorporated in the staging of all gynecologic carcinomas. The staging of uterine sarcoma is largely unchanged. Future revisions may consider grouping these tumors with soft tissue sarcomas at large. Staging of cervical cancer is largely unchanged. Nomenclature of early invasive carcinoma and the challenges in defining tumor dimension in cervical carcinoma are discussed. The nodal staging of vulvar cancer now incorporates a vocabulary for isolated tumor cells and micrometastases. Despite the current interest in molecular staging, the eighth edition expert panel did not identify any specific biomarkers for inclusion in stage classification, but several are recommended for collection as ancillary data elements, including p16 status in vulvar, vaginal, and cervical tumors. In the eighth edition, as in the seventh, anatomic factors remain the cornerstone of gynecologic cancer staging.

TI  - Direct Reflectance Measurements from Drones: Sensor Absolute Radiometric Calibration and System Tests for Forest Reflectance Characterization
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drone-based remote sensing has evolved rapidly in recent years. Miniaturized hyperspectral imaging sensors are becoming more common as they provide more abundant information of the object compared to traditional cameras. Reflectance is a physically defined object property and therefore often preferred output of the remote sensing data capture to be used in the further processes. Absolute calibration of the sensor provides a possibility for physical modelling of the imaging process and enables efficient procedures for reflectance correction. Our objective is to develop a method for direct reflectance measurements for drone-based remote sensing. It is based on an imaging spectrometer and irradiance spectrometer. This approach is highly attractive for many practical applications as it does not require in situ reflectance panels for converting the sensor radiance to ground reflectance factors. We performed SI-traceable spectral and radiance calibration of a tuneable Fabry-Perot Interferometer-based (FPI) hyperspectral camera at the National Physical Laboratory NPL (Teddington, UK). The camera represents novel technology by collecting 2D format hyperspectral image cubes using time sequential spectral scanning principle. The radiance accuracy of different channels varied between +/- 4% when evaluated using independent test data, and linearity of the camera response was on average 0.9994. The spectral response calibration showed side peaks on several channels that were due to the multiple orders of interference of the FPI. The drone-based direct reflectance measurement system showed promising results with imagery collected over Wytham Forest (Oxford, UK).

TI  - Glacial and tidal strain of landfast sea ice in Terra Nova Bay, East Antarctica, observed by interferometric SAR techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of landfast sea ice, also called fast ice for short, has a large influence on the variability of polynyas and marine ecosystems, and the logistics for research stations near the Antarctic coast. Therefore, it is important to accurately measure the strain of fast ice and its seasonal variations, and to identify the cause of stresses on the ice. In this paper, we separate the strains from glacial stress and tidal stress of fast ice near the Campbell Glacier Tongue (CGT) in Terra Nova Bay, East Antarctica. This was done using observations from a series of one-day tandem COSMO-SkyMed Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) images obtained from December 2010 to January 2012. Firstly, we discriminated fast ice from pack ice and open water by analyzing the interferometric coherence values. We then identified the characteristics of the strains by investigating the equidisplacement lines of fringes in weekly InSAR and double-differential InSAR (DDInSAR) images. The weekly InSAR images predominantly showed glacial shear strain of the fast ice with fringes parallel to the sides of the CGT. This was due to the cumulative flow of the CGT for a week, while oscillating tidal signals were relatively small. The DDInSAR images, which cancelled glacial strain rates in two one-day InSAR images, showed a deformation of the fast ice by tidal sea surface tilt, with the fringes parallel to the coastline. Based on the unique characteristics of these strains, we separated them from the one-day InSAR images by decomposing the fringe patterns into glacial and tidal strain. Glacial shear strain rates of fast ice attached to the east of the CGT decreased from May to August owing to ice thickening and then stabilized until December. Those to the west of the CGT increased from May to July. This was possibly due to bottom melting of the ice by the increased ocean circulation during the expansion period of the nearby polynya. The glacial strain then decreased until December because of reduced polynya activity. The fast ice near the Jang Bogo Station (JBS) only showed tidal strain as it was isolated from the CGT by cracks and leads. Tidal strain rates of the fast ice were strongly correlated with the magnitude of tidal variations in all these regions, which represents shows that the tidal strain represents tidal sea surface tilt. The tidal response of fast ice to the west of the CGT and near the JBS was stronger than that to the east of the CGT, probably owing to thinner ice thickness there.

TI  - Evaluation of summer passive microwave sea ice concentrations in the Chukchi Sea based on KOMPSAT-5 SAR and numerical weather prediction data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite passive microwave (PM) sensors have observed sea ice in Polar Regions and provided sea ice concentration (SIC) data since the 1970s. SIC has been used as a primary data source for climate change prediction and ship navigation. However, the accuracy of PM SIC is typically low and biased in summer. To provide more accurate information for climatic research and ship navigation, it is necessary to evaluate quantitatively the accuracy of PM SIC and to account for its errors. In this research, we evaluated the SIC data derived from PM measurements using four representative sea ice algorithms: NASA Team (NT), Bootstrap (BT), Ocean and Sea Ice Satellite Application Facility (OSISAF) hybrid, and Arctic Radiation and Turbulence Interaction STudy (ARTIST) Sea Ice (ASI). Analyses were performed for the Chukchi Sea in summer using KOrean Multi-Purpose SATellite-5 (KOMPSAT-5) Enhanced Wide-swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. Ice/water maps were generated by binary classification of texture features in the SAR images based on Random Forest, a rule-based machine learning approach. SIC values estimated from the sea ice algorithms showed good correlation with those calculated from the KOMPSAT-5 ice/water maps, but the root mean square error was larger than 10%. SIC values estimated from the algorithms showed different error trends according to the KOMPSAT-5 SIC range. All algorithms overestimated SIC values in open drift ice zones (KOMPSAT-5 SICs ranged from 0% to 15%). In marginal ice zones (SICs ranged from 15% to 80%), the OSISAF SIC values were the least biased compared to those from KOMPSAT-5. The NT algorithm largely underestimated SIC values in marginal ice zones, while the BT and ASI algorithms overestimated them considerably. All algorithms, except for BT, underestimated SIC in consolidated pack ice zones (SICs ranged from 80% to 100%). By analyzing the correlations of biases of SIC from the algorithms with the numerical weather prediction (NWP) data from the European Reanalysis Agency Interim reanalysis, it was found that the overestimation of NT and ASI SICs was largely influenced by atmospheric water vapor content, while the underestimation of NT and OSISAF SICs was owing to ice surface melting. The overestimation of BT SICs was not significantly correlated with the NWP data. The underestimated SIC from the BT and ASI algorithms for high SIC regions might be compensated by the atmospheric water vapor content. The differences in SIC values estimated from each algorithm were due to different sensitivities to atmospheric water vapor content in the regions with KOMPSAT-5 SIC lower than 40% and to ice surface melting in the regions with higher KOMPSAT-5 SIC.

TI  - Rohingya Refugee Crisis and Forest Cover Change in Teknaf, Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Following a targeted campaign of violence by Myanmar military, police, and local militias, more than half a million Rohingya refugees have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since August 2017, joining thousands of others living in overcrowded settlement camps in Teknaf. To accommodate this mass influx of refugees, forestland is razed to build spontaneous settlements, resulting in an enormous threat to wildlife habitats, biodiversity, and entire ecosystems in the region. Although reports indicate that this rapid and vast expansion of refugee camps in Teknaf is causing large scale environmental destruction and degradation of forestlands, no study to date has quantified the camp expansion extent or forest cover loss. Using remotely sensed Sentinel-2A and -2B imagery and a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm with ground observation data, we quantified the territorial expansion of refugee settlements and resulting degradation of the ecological resources surrounding the three largest concentrations of refugee campsKutupalong-Balukhali, Nayapara-Leda and Unchiprangthat developed between pre- and post-August of 2017. Employing RF as an image classification approach for this study with a cross-validation technique, we obtained a high overall classification accuracy of 94.53% and 95.14% for 2016 and 2017 land cover maps, respectively, with overall Kappa statistics of 0.93 and 0.94. The producer and user accuracy for forest cover ranged between 92.98-98.21% and 96.49-92.98%, respectively. Results derived from the thematic maps indicate a substantial expansion of refugee settlements in the three refugee camp study sites, with an increase of 175 to 1530 hectares between 2016 and 2017, and a net growth rate of 774%. The greatest camp expansion is observed in the Kutupalong-Balukhali site, growing from 146 ha to 1365 ha with a net increase of 1219 ha (total growth rate of 835%) in the same time period. While the refugee camps' occupancy expanded at a rapid rate, this gain mostly occurred by replacing the forested land, degrading the forest cover surrounding the three camps by 2283 ha. Such rapid degradation of forested land has already triggered ecological problems and disturbed wildlife habitats in the area since many of these makeshift resettlement camps were set up in or near corridors for wild elephants, causing the death of several Rohingyas by elephant trampling. Hence, the findings of this study may motivate the Bangladesh government and international humanitarian organizations to develop better plans to protect the ecologically sensitive forested land and wildlife habitats surrounding the refugee camps, enable more informed management of the settlements, and assist in more sustainable resource mobilization for the Rohingya refugees.

TI  - Mapping dune dynamics by InSAR coherence
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is generally held that subtle changes in sandy environments are very difficult to detect in imagery. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates how synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric decorrelation can be used to identify changes in individual sand dunes. The use of coherence maps over time facilitates the analysis of dune dynamics, both temporally and spatially. The Ashdod-Nizzanim coastal dunes, along the southern coastal plain of Israel, were chosen as an illustrative example of the analysis of dune dynamics. High-resolution TerraSAR-X (TSX) radar images covering the entire research area were acquired for the period February to July 2012, together with meteorology data (wind and rain) for the area. The coherence results enabled the stability of individual dunes to be described as a function of time. It was found that the dune crests were more stable than the windward slopes and that the degree of stability was dependent on the distance of the dune from the sea. The results of this study show the potential of using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) decorrelation for aeolian studies, even in areas characterized by low coherence.

TI  - Combining TerraSAR-X and Landsat Images for Emergency Response in Urban Environments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid damage mapping following a disaster event, especially in an urban environment, is critical to ensure that the emergency response in the affected area is rapid and efficient. This work presents a new method for mapping damage assessment in urban environments. Based on combining SAR and optical data, the method is applicable as support during initial emergency planning and rescue operations. The study focuses on the urban areas affected by the Tohoku earthquake and subsequent tsunami event in Japan that occurred on 11 March 2011. High-resolution TerraSAR-X (TSX) images of before and after the event, and a Landsat 5 image before the event were acquired. The affected areas were analyzed with the SAR data using only one interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence map. To increase the damage mapping accuracy, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was applied. The generated map, with a grid size of 50 m, provides a quantitative assessment of the nature and distribution of the damage. The damage mapping shows detailed information about the affected area, with high overall accuracy (89%), and high Kappa coefficient (82%) and, as expected, it shows total destruction along the coastline compared to the inland region.

TI  - Predicting Growing Stock Volume of Scots Pine Stands Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery and Airborne Image-Derived Point Clouds
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of forest stand parameters using remotely sensed data has considerable significance for sustainable forest management. Wide and free access to the collection of medium-resolution optical multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite images is very important for the practical application of remote sensing technology in forestry. This study assessed the accuracy of Sentinel-2-based growing stock volume predictive models of single canopy layer Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. We also investigated whether the inclusion of Sentinel-2 data improved the accuracy of models based on airborne image-derived point cloud data (IPC). A multiple linear regression (LM) and random forest (RF) methods were tested for generating predictive models. The measurements from 94 circular field plots (400 m(2)) were used as reference data. In general, the LM method provided more accurate models than the RF method. Models created using only Sentinel-2A images had low prediction accuracy and were characterized by a high root mean square error (RMSE%) of 35.14% and a low coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.24. Fusion of IPC data with Sentinel-2 reflectance values provided the most accurate model: RMSE% = 16.95% and R-2 = 0.82. However, comparable accuracy was obtained using the IPC-based model: RMSE% = 17.26% and R-2 = 0.81. The results showed that for single canopy layer Scots pine dominated stands the incorporation of Sentinel-2 satellite images into IPC-based growing stock volume predictive models did not significantly improve the model accuracy. From an operational point of view, the additional utilization of Sentinel-2 data is not justified in this context.

TI  - Hospital-Based Study of Compliance with NCCN Guidelines and Predictive Factors of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in the Setting of Thin Melanoma Using the National Cancer Database
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - Thin melanoma is the most common form of melanoma in the United States. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) has guidelines for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) which recommend "discuss and consider" SLNB for invasion >0.75 mm and "discuss and offer" SLNB for invasion >0.75 mm with suspicious features. This study looked at compliance with NCCN guidelines and factors that are predictive of a positive SLNB. This is a retrospective study of patients diagnosed with thin melanoma 2012-2013 using the National Cancer Database. A total of 26,456 patients met study qualifications. Univariate analysis showed that 76 per cent of patients meeting criteria underwent SLNB. Patients recommended to "discuss and consider" received SLNB 53 per cent of the time and those not recommended for SLNB received SLNB 20 per cent of the time. On multivariate analysis, depth was not predictive for positive SLNB whereas mitoses and ulceration were. Other factors predictive of positive SLNB were nodular cell type, lympho-vascular invasion, and Clark's level greater than or equal to IV. Patients with thin melanoma that meet NCCN guidelines for SLNB undergo this procedure in good compliance but those who do not meet criteria continue to receive SLNB. Positive predictive factors for positive SLNB include mitoses, ulceration, Clark's level, and primary site.

TI  - A dynamic ocean management tool to reduce bycatch and support sustainable fisheries
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Seafood is an essential source of protein for more than 3 billion people worldwide, yet bycatch of threatened species in capture fisheries remains a major impediment to fisheries sustainability. Management measures designed to reduce bycatch often result in significant economic losses and even fisheries closures. Static spatial management approaches can also be rendered ineffective by environmental variability and climate change, as productive habitats shift and introduce new interactions between human activities and protected species. We introduce a new multispecies and dynamic approach that uses daily satellite data to track ocean features and aligns scales of management, species movement, and fisheries. To accomplish this, we create species distribution models for one target species and three bycatch-sensitive species using both satellite telemetry and fisheries observer data. We then integrate species-specific probabilities of occurrence into a single predictive surface, weighing the contribution of each species by management concern. We find that dynamic closures could be 2 to 10 times smaller than existing static closures while still providing adequate protection of endangered nontarget species. Our results highlight the opportunity to implement near real-time management strategies that would both support economically viable fisheries and meet mandated conservation objectives in the face of changing ocean conditions. With recent advances in eco-informatics, dynamic management provides a new climate-ready approach to support sustainable fisheries.

TI  - Satellite-based high-resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region of China using an improved geographically and temporally weighted regression model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations at high spatial resolution are substantially required for determining the population exposure to PM2.5 over densely populated urban areas. However, most studies for China have generated PM2.5 estimations at a coarse resolution (>= 10 km) due to the limitation of satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) product in spatial resolution. In this study, the 3 km AOD data fused using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 AOD products were employed to estimate the ground PM2.5 concentrations over the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region of China from January 2013 to December 2015. An improved geographically and temporally weighted regression (iGTWR) model incorporating seasonal characteristics within the data was developed, which achieved comparable performance to the standard GTWR model for the days with paired PM2.5-AOD samples (Cross-validation (CV) R-2 = 0.82) and showed better predictive power for the days without PM2.5-AOD pairs (the R-2 increased from 0.24 to 0.46 in CV). Both iGTWR and GTWR (CV R-2 = 0.84) significantly outperformed the daily geographically weighted regression model (CV R-2 = 0.66). Also, the fused 3 km AODs improved data availability and presented more spatial gradients, thereby enhancing model performance compared with the MODIS original 3/10 km AOD product. As a result, ground PM2.5 concentrations at higher resolution were well represented, allowing, e.g., short-term pollution events and long-term PM2.5 trend to be identified, which, in turn, indicated that concerns about air pollution in the BTH region are justified despite its decreasing trend from 2013 to 2015.

TI  - Effects of Earth curvature on atmospheric correction for ocean color remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a vector radiative transfer model for the coupled ocean-atmosphere system with consideration of the effects of Earth curvature (named PCOART-SA) was developed using the pseudo-spherical approximation. Both downward and reflected solar beam radiation were corrected accounting for Earth curvature effects. Validation showed that the PCOART-SA results agreed well with literature benchmarks and the CDISORT and AccuRT model results. Based on PCOART-SA, Earth curvature effects on Rayleigh-scattering radiance including polarization were investigated. The results showed that the influence of Earth curvature increased rapidly with solar zenith angle, with influences up to 1%, 3%, and 12% for solar zenith angles at 75, 80, and 85, respectively, which should be considered for high accuracy atmospheric correction. We also found that the Rayleigh-scattering look-up table in SeaDAS after version 7.2 showed significant bias at high solar zenith angles, which needs further investigation. Finally, using the PCOART-SA model, we generated Rayleigh-scattering lookup tables for Aqua/MODIS with consideration of Earth curvature effects, which can be directly used in SeaDAS.

TI  - Mapping fractional woody cover in semi-arid savannahs using multi-seasonal composites from Landsat data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing attention is being directed at mapping the fractional woody cover of savannahs using Earth observation data. In this study, we test the utility of Landsat TM/ETM-based spectral-temporal variability metrics for mapping regional-scale woody cover in the Limpopo Province of South Africa, for 2010. We employ a machine learning framework to compare the accuracies of Random Forest models derived using metrics calculated from different seasons. We compare these results to those from fused Landsat-PALSAR data to establish if seasonal metrics can compensate for structural information from the PALSAR signal. Furthermore, we test the applicability of a statistical variable selection method, the recursive feature elimination (RFE), in the automation of the model building process in order to reduce model complexity and processing time. All of our tests were repeated at four scales (30, 60, 90, and 120 m-pixels) to investigate the role of spatial resolution on modelled accuracies.Our results show that multi-seasonal composites combining imagery from both the dry and wet seasons produced the highest accuracies (R-2 = 0.77, RMSE = 9.4, at the 120 m scale). When using a single season of observations, dry season imagery performed best (R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 9.9, at the 120 m resolution). Combining Landsat and radar imagery was only marginally beneficial, offering a mean relative improvement of 1% in accuracy at the 120 m scale. However, this improvement was concentrated in areas with lower densities of woody coverage (<30%), which are areas of concern for environmental monitoring. At finer spatial resolutions, the inclusion of SAR data actually reduced accuracies. Overall, the RFE was able to produce the most accurate model (R-2 = 0.8, RMSE = 8.9, at the 120 m pixel scale). For mapping savannah woody cover at the 30 m pixel scale, we suggest that monitoring methodologies continue to exploit the Landsat archive, but should aim to use multi-seasonal derived information. When the coarser 120 m pixel scale is adequate, integration of Landsat and SAR data should be considered, especially in areas with lower woody cover densities. The use of multiple seasonal compositing periods offers promise for large-area mapping of savannahs, even in regions with a limited historical Landsat coverage.

CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The sea ice information such as ice extent, area, concentration, and thickness has been widely used for analyses of sea level, weather, and climate changes in the Polar Regions. Passive microwave sensing of sea ice traditionally has been applied to the Arctic Ocean for a shipping route support in spite of its low-spatial resolution. C-band Sentinel-1 (constellation of two satellites, Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is considered as one of the effective satellites because it provides an improvement in revisit time, and offers higher resolution and dual polarization (HH and HV). In this study, the Sentinel-1 sea ice mapping system was developed to acquire data automatically for the region of interest in the Arctic coastal region and to map sea ice areas extracted by using the sea ice discrimination algorithm. The system including a data acquisition process can make a sea ice product in 13 minutes. To intuitively understand the distribution of sea ice for safe navigation in coastal waters, the result can be visualized in a KML file that facilitates interfacing with other systems.

TI  - Distribution of fluorine in the surface dust of Wuda coal base, Inner Mongolia of Northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wuda coalfield in Inner Mongolia is one of China's typical old coal bases and has a coal fire history of over 50 years. Many studies have been carried out on fluorine pollution caused by high-temperature processing industries such as those related to the production of steel, aluminum, glass, brick, and tile. However, few studies have focused on fluorine pollution caused by coal-fired industrial parks or coal fires. For the present study, 224 dust samples were collected from Wuda district in Inner Mongolia and its surrounding zones, covering a total area of similar to 270 km(2). Subsequently, fluorine concentrations in the samples were analyzed using the combustion- hydrolysis/fluoride-ion selective electrode method. Results showed that the average fluorine concentration of dust is 848 mu g.g(-1) (430-1504 mu g.g(-1)) in Wuda coalfield and 1016 mu g.g(-1) (237-2830 mu g.g(-1)) in industrial parks, which are more than four times the background value. The average fluorine concentration in the adjoining downwind urban area of Wuda is 488 mu g.g(-1), which is twice the background value. The results indicate that long-term fluorine release from the coal fire and industrial parks leads to significantly elevated fluorine concentration levels in the dust around the study area. The scenario of urban areas in close proximity to coal seam fires and industrial parks is not particular to Wuda; it is relatively common in northern China and elsewhere. Thus, the influence of coal seam fire and industrial parks on other cities merits further investigation.

TI  - A New Approach to Estimating Coccolithophore Calcification Rates From Space
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The production and ultimate fate of calcium carbonate in the global ocean has implications for the efficiency of the biological carbon and alkalinity pumps. Historically, sediment trap flux data and/or mass balance equations have been used to estimate the rate of particulate inorganic carbon production in the ocean. More recently, satellite data have been used to provide a more comprehensive global overview of this important biogeochemical process based on relationships determined from multilinear regression of measured calcification rates against a number of measurable variables. Here we describe a simple model to estimate calcification rate based around elements of coccolithophore physiology that can be easily parametrized with satellite ocean color data. The model output conforms to our understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of coccolithophores and performs relatively well at reproducing global rates that are of the correct order of magnitude, while capturing the variability in such a complex, natural process when compared to field calcification rate measurements (slope=0.98; R-2=0.28; p<0.05; RMSE=0.53mgCm(-3)day(-1)). Average, global, euphotic zone depth-integrated calcification rate is estimated to be 1.421.69Pgparticulate inorganic carbon/year with the oceanic gyres contributing the greatest influence.

TI  - How much can natural resource inventory benefit from finer resolution auxiliary data?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For remote sensing-assisted natural resource inventories, the effects of spatial resolution in the form of pixel size and the effects of subpixel information on estimates of population parameters were evaluated by comparing results obtained using Landsat 8 and RapidEye auxiliary imagery. The study area was in Burkina Faso, and the response variable of interest was firewood volume (m(3)/ha). A sample consisting of 160 field plots was selected from the population following a two-stage sampling design. Models were fit using weighted least squares; the population mean, mu, and the variance of the estimator of the population mean, V ((mu) over cap), were estimated using two inferential frameworks, model-based and model-assisted, and compared. For each framework, V((mu) over cap) was estimated both analytically and empirically. Empirical variances were estimated using bootstrapping that accounted for the two-stage sampling. The primary results were twofold. First, for the effects of spatial resolution and subpixel information, four conclusions are relevant: (1) finer spatial resolution imagery indeed contributed to greater precision for estimators of population parameter, but despite the finer spatial resolution of RapidEye, the increase was only marginal, on the order of 10% for model-based variance estimators and 36% for model assisted variance estimators; (2) subpixel information on texture was marginally beneficial for inference of large area population parameters; (3) RapidEye did not offer enough of an improvement to justify its cost relative to the free Landsat 8 imagery; and (4) for a given plot size, candidate remote sensing auxiliary datasets are more cost-effective when their spatial resolutions are similar to the plot size than with much finer alternatives. Second, for the comparison between estimators, three conclusions are relevant: (1) sampling distribution for the model based V((mu) over cap) was more concentrated and smaller on the order of 42% to 59% than that for the model-assisted V((mu) over cap), suggesting superior consistency and efficiency of model-based inference to model-assisted inference; (2) bootstrapping is an effective alternative to analytical variance estimators; and (3) prediction accuracy expressed by RMSE is useful for screening candidate models to be used for population inferences.

TI  - A Cubesat enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) utilizing Planet, Landsat and MODIS data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite sensing in the visible to near-infrared (VNIR) domain has been the backbone of land surface monitoring and characterization for more than four decades. However, a limitation of conventional single-sensor satellite missions is their limited capacity to observe land surface dynamics at the very high spatial and temporal resolutions demanded by a wide range of applications. One solution to this spatio-temporal divide is an observation strategy based on the CubeSat standard, which facilitates constellations of small, inexpensive satellites. Repeatable near-daily image capture in RGB and near-infrared (NIR) bands at 3-4 m resolution has recently become available via a constellation of > 130 CubeSats operated commercially by Planet. While the observing capacity afforded by this system is unprecedented, the relatively low radiometric quality and cross-sensor inconsistencies represent key challenges in the realization of their full potential as a game changer in Earth observation. To address this issue, we developed a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) that uses a multi-scale machine-learning technique to correct for radiometric inconsistencies between CubeSat acquisitions. The CESTEM produces Landsat 8 consistent atmospherically corrected surface reflectances in blue, green, red, and NIR bands, but at the spatial scale and temporal frequency of the CubeSat observations. An application of CESTEM over an agricultural dryland system in Saudi Arabia demonstrated CubeSat-based reproduction of Landsat 8 consistent VNIR data with an overall relative mean absolute deviation of 1.6% or better, even when the Landsat 8 and CubeSat acquisitions were temporally displaced by > 32 days. The consistently high retrieval accuracies were achieved using a multi-scale target sampling scheme that draws Landsat 8 reference data from a series of scenes by using MODIS-consistent surface reflectance time series to quantify relative changes in Landsat-scale reflectances over given Landsat-CubeSat acquisition timespans. With the observing potential of Planet's CubeSats approaching daily nadir-pointing land surface imaging of the entire Earth, CESTEM offers the capacity to produce daily Landsat 8 consistent VNIR imagery with a factor of 10 increase in spatial resolution and with the radiometric quality of actual Landsat 8 observations. Realization of this unprecedented Earth observing capacity has far reaching implications for the monitoring and characterization of terrestrial systems at the precision scale.

TI  - Quantifying landscape-level land-use intensity patterns through radar-based remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. The increasing availability of high resolution and high frequency, radar-based remote sensing data (i.e. observations on land surface characteristics, insensitive to cloud interference), makes it possible to track land-use intensity more precisely at the whole landscape scale.2. Here, we develop a new radar-based remote sensing technique for large-scale quantification of agricultural land-use intensity across human-dominated landscapes. We compare the respective abilities of Sentinel-1 C-band radar (C-SAR, C-band synthetic aperture radar) remote sensing data with the more traditional optical data, as MODIS enhanced vegetation indices (MODIS EVI), in capturing seasonality and the magnitude of land-use intensity (quantity and frequency of biomass removal). Linking our novel radar-based change detection algorithm to agricultural management activities on the ground, we quantify a whole landscape according to timing of mowing, a key grassland disturbance, thus capturing the dynamics of mowing regimes in grasslands.3. We found that the radar-based proxy provides a rapid and reliable measure of land-use intensity, reliably predicting plant community composition at the landscape scale.4. We tested this methodology using data on black-tailed godwits (Limosa limosa limosa), a specialist breeder of lowland meadows which, over the last 50years, has shown dramatic declines. During territory establishment, black-tailed godwits preferentially used fields corresponding to intermediate radar-sensed land-use intensities. However, the present-day timing of mowing in these habitats was such that most godwit broods were less likely to be successful than broods in grasslands used at a lower intensity.5. Synthesis and applications. The newly developed radar-based land-use intensity quantification is a powerful tool that makes it possible for ecologists and land managers to include agricultural land-use intensity measurements in population studies of the plants, insects, birds and mammals using these landscapes, at the spatial scale of entire populations. Applications of this tool include evaluating the effectiveness of European agri-environment schemes aiming to increase biodiversity through decreased land-use intensity or expanding the quantification of agricultural land-use intensity to other geographic regions.

TI  - A Multivariate Approach to Study Drivers of Land-Cover Changes through Remote Sensing in the Dry Chaco of Argentina
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land-cover changes are driven by different combinations of biophysical, economic, and cultural drivers that are acting at different scales. We aimed to (1) analyze trends in land use and land cover changes (conversion, abandonment, forest persistence) in the dry Chaco in central Argentina (1979 to 2010), and (2) examine how physical and socio-economic drivers have influenced those changes. Based on Landsat data, we obtained the proportion of 16 classes of land cover changes for 81 individual circular samples. We performed a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify the main trends of change across the whole region. To explore the relationships between the changes in land cover and drivers, we developed a GIS comprising thematic maps representing the different drivers. The drivers were first correlated with the two first PCA axes, and in a second approximation were subjected to multiple regression analyses. We obtained in this way the best model to explain each PCA axis. The highest conversion, as indicated by PCA axis 1, was experienced by flat areas close to roads and with the highest annual rainfall. Besides agricultural expansion that was triggered by precipitation increase as a major driver of forest conversion, changes that were observed during the period 1979-2010, may have also been influenced by several other driving forces acting at different spatial scales and contexts.

TI  - Long-term changes of land use/cover in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of the Yangtze River, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the temporal and spatial dynamics of land use/cover (LUC) can contribute to reveal the impacts of climate change and human activities on ecosystems and thus be an important prerequisite for ecosystem management. As an ecologically vulnerable area in China, the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) of the Yangtze River presented significant complexity in the response to environmental changes. However, there is a general lack of understanding in the under. lying mechanism. In this study, we interpreted the time series remote sensing images derived from the Landsat sensors to map the LUC of the TGRA, and aimed to analyze the long-term changes in the distribution and structure of LUC and elucidate the evolution process of LUC, which could provide a scientific basis to understand the complexity of ecosystem changes and regional ecosystem management in ecologically fragile regions. The results showed that the TGRA presented the significant changes in spatial heterogeneity of LUC structure from 1990 to 2015. Meanwhile, the landscape changed from farmland to woodland (forest and shrubland). Farmland decreased from 66.2% to 40.4%, but woodland increased from 31.3% to 53.5%, buildings and water area increased gradually. Forest gradually spread to the middle of the TGRA, while the buildings presented a scattered expansion. In the altitude zone of 500-1000 m and slope zone of 15 degrees-25 degrees, woodland increased noticeably, and the coniferous forest, mixed forest and shrubland had a higher growth rate. In the study period, due to the urban construction and the various ecological restoration projects in the TGRA, the LUC structure varied with the dam's impoundment and was characterized by the ecosystem restoration. Ecological restoration projects were helpful to reduce the negative impacts of urban construction and economic development on the environment.

TI  - DMBLC: An Indirect Urban Impervious Surface Area Extraction Approach by Detecting and Masking Background Land Cover on Google Earth Image
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Implying the prosperity and development of the city, impervious surface area (ISA) is playing an increasingly important role in ecological processes, microclimate, material and energy flows, and urban flood. The free sub-meter resolution Google Earth image, which is integrated by several high spatial resolution data, appears to have potential for high-resolution ISA extraction, where present study is rare and performances remain to be improved. Due to the high spatial and spectral variation of the urban environment as well as confusion between ISA and soil, the accurate delineating of ISA with traditional (direct) methods can be costly and time-consuming, which is in a word resource-intensive. However, this paper presents a novel indirect ISA extraction conceptual model and a new detecting and masking background land cover (DMBLC) approach that: uses a freely available, high-resolution dataset; requires a reduced set of training samples; and consists of relatively simple, common, and feasible image processing steps. The key characteristic of DMBLC is to detect the background of ISA (vegetation, soil, and water) accurately and obtain the ISA by masking the background. The approach relies on background detection to avoid the predicaments of direct ISA extraction. Water can be directly gained by water body vector data, in DMBLC; mixture tuned matched filtering (MTMF) is exploited to detect vegetation and soil, image segmentation is used to mitigate the spectral variation problem within the same land cover, and segment rectangularity reduces the confusion between ISA and soil. From experiments in a core area of Fuzhou, China, the DMBLC approach reached high performance and outperformed the powerful traditional support vector machines (SVM) method (overall accuracy of 94.45% and Kappa coefficient of 0.8885, compared to 86.44% and 0.7329, respectively). From the comparison of different levels of complexity within the inner processing steps, it is confirmed that the DMBLC approach is a powerful and flexible changed framework for indirect ISA extraction, which can be improved by using more advanced inner methods.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Surface Water Extent from Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately quantifying surface water extent in wetlands is critical to understanding their role in ecosystem processes. However, current regional- to global-scale surface water products lack the spatial or temporal resolution necessary to characterize heterogeneous or variable wetlands. Here, we proposed a fully automatic classification tree approach to classify surface water extent using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and training datasets derived from prior class masks. Prior classes of water and non-water were generated from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) water body dataset (SWBD) or composited dynamic surface water extent (cDSWE) class probabilities. Classification maps of water and non-water were derived over two distinct wetlandscapes: the Delmarva Peninsula and the Prairie Pothole Region. Overall classification accuracy ranged from 79% to 93% when compared to high-resolution images in the Prairie Pothole Region site. Using cDSWE class probabilities reduced omission errors among water bodies by 10% and commission errors among non-water class by 4% when compared with results generated by using the SWBD water mask. These findings indicate that including prior water masks that reflect the dynamics in surface water extent (i.e., cDSWE) is important for the accurate mapping of water bodies using SAR data.

TI  - An integrated phenology modelling framework in R
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Phenology is a first-order control on productivity and mediates the biophysical environment by altering albedo, surface roughness length and evapotranspiration. Accurate and transparent modelling of vegetation phenology is therefore key in understanding feedbacks between the biosphere and the climate system.2. Here, we present the PHENOR R package and modelling framework. The framework leverages measurements of vegetation phenology from four common phenology observation datasets, the PhenoCam network, the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), the Pan European Phenology Project (PEP725), MODIS phenology (MCD12Q2) combined with (global) retrospective and projected climate data.3. We show an example analysis, using the PHENOR modelling framework, which quickly and easily compares 20 included spring phenology models for three plant functional types. An analysis of model skill using the root mean squared (RMSE) error shows little or no difference regardless of model structure, corroborating previous studies. We argue that addressing this issue will require novel model development combined with easy data assimilation as facilitated by our framework.4. In conclusion, we hope the PHENOR phenology modelling framework in the R language and environment for statistical computing will facilitate reproducibility and community driven phenology model development, in order to increase their overall predictive power, and leverage an ever growing number of phenology data products.

TI  - Monitoring and Mapping Invasive Aquatic Weed <i>Salvinia molesta</i> using Multispectral Remote Sensing Technique in Tumaria Wetland of Uttarakhand, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Indian reservoir's managers have been facing problem in managing water and fisheries resources due to invasive aquatic weed infestation. Multispectral remote sensing data was used for monitoring the growth pattern of world's worst weed; Giant Salvinia (S. molesta Mitchell) in reservoir "Tumaria", located in the Terai region of Uttarakhand (India). Temporal satellite data of Landsat-7 (ETM +) and Landsat-8 (OLI) for the period April, 2013 to May, 2015 were used for mapping and monitoring the weed. It was revealed that the reservoir was free from floating weed Salvinia until June, 2013 and for the first time appeared during September, 2013. It has covered 42% of the water spread area and subsequently covered 92% area until October, 2013. Active growth (matured weed) of Salvinia was observed when it covered 89-92% of water surface from October, 2013 to January, 2014 and also new growth (immatured weed) of Salvinia was observed on same months. Thematic map derived from the study can be used as a decision support tool for controlling aquatic weed infestation.

TI  - Radiative-Transfer Modeling of Spectra of Planetary Regoliths Using Cluster-Based Dense Packing Modifications
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing of planetary bodies, the development of analysis techniques that lead to quantitative interpretations of data sets has relatively been deficient compared to the wealth of acquired data, especially in the case of regoliths with particle sizes on the order of the probing wavelength. Radiative transfer theory has often been applied to the study of densely packed particulate media like planetary regoliths, but with difficulty; here we continue to improve theoretical modeling of spectra of densely packed particulate media. We use the superposition T-matrix method to compute the scattering properties of an elementary volume entering the radiative transfer equation by modeling it as a cluster of particles and thereby capture the near-field effects important for dense packing. Then, these scattering parameters are modified with the static structure factor correction to suppress the irrelevant far-field diffraction peak rendered by the T-matrix procedure. Using the corrected single-scattering parameters, reflectance (and emissivity) is computed via the invariant-imbedding solution to the scalar radiative transfer equation. We modeled the emissivity spectrum of the 3.3m particle size fraction of enstatite, representing a common regolith component, in the midinfrared (5-50m). The use of the static structure factor correction coupled with the superposition T-matrix method produced better agreement with the corresponding laboratory spectrum than the sole use of the T-matrix method, particularly for volume scattering wavelengths (transparency features). This work demonstrates the importance of proper treatment of the packing effects when modeling semi-infinite densely packed particulate media using finite, cluster-based light scattering models.Plain Language Summary Currently, remote sensing measurements from spacecraft and ground-based observatories are the main means to understand the characteristics of various solar system objects. Remote sensing data can be complex and difficult to interpret, yet their correct interpretation is critical in making scientific findings. Surfaces of many solar system objects are covered with regolithsoil-like material made of fine particles of ices, minerals, and rock fragments. Remote sensing data from such surfaces pose a challenge to accurate interpretations and require improved analysis techniques. Our work takes some of the initial steps in addressing this problem by capturing and modeling one of the fundamental physical processes of remote sensing, known as light scattering. We present a light scattering model that has been tailored, to a reasonable extent, to meet the conditions of planetary regoliths. Our model places particular emphasis on accurately representing the packing (how condensed) of the regolith particles. This leads to more accurate results than previous models, within limits of the scope of our method. Our method contributes to the unfolding development of ever-improving light scattering models for accurate remote sensing data analyses.

TI  - Application and Comparison of the MODIS-Derived Enhanced Vegetation Index to VIIRS, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI Platforms: A Case Study in the Arid Colorado River Delta, Mexico
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is a key Earth science parameter used to assess vegetation, originally developed and calibrated for the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites. With the impending decommissioning of the MODIS sensors by the year 2020/2022, alternative platforms will need to be used to estimate EVI. We compared Landsat 5 (2000-2011), 8 (2013-2016) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS; 2013-2016) to MODIS EVI (2000-2016) over a 420,083-ha area of the arid lower Colorado River Delta in Mexico. Over large areas with mixed land cover or agricultural fields, we found high correspondence between Landsat and MODIS EVI (R-2 = 0.93 for the entire area studied and 0.97 for agricultural fields), but the relationship was weak over bare soil (R-2 = 0.27) and riparian vegetation (R-2 = 0.48). The correlation between MODIS and Landsat EVI was higher over large, homogeneous areas and was generally lower in narrow riparian areas. VIIRS and MODIS EVI were highly similar (R-2 = 0.99 for the entire area studied) and did not show the same decrease in performance in smaller, narrower regions as Landsat. Landsat and VIIRS provide EVI estimates of similar quality and characteristics to MODIS, but scale, seasonality and land cover type(s) should be considered before implementing Landsat EVI in a particular area.

TI  - Derivation of global vegetation biophysical parameters from EUMETSAT Polar System
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the algorithm developed in LSA-SAF (Satellite Application Facility for Land Surface Analysis) for the derivation of global vegetation parameters from the AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) sensor on board MetOp (Meteorological-Operational) satellites forming the EUMETSAT (European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) Polar System (EPS). The suite of LSA-SAF EPS vegetation products includes the leaf area index (LAI), the fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR). LAI, FAPAR, and FVC characterize the structure and the functioning of vegetation and are key parameters for a wide range of land-biosphere applications. The algorithm is based on a hybrid approach that blends the generalization capabilities offered by physical radiative transfer models with the accuracy and computational efficiency of machine learning methods. One major feature is the implementation of multi-output retrieval methods able to jointly and more consistently estimate all the biophysical parameters at the same time. We propose a multi-output Gaussian process regression (GPR(muiti)), which outperforms other considered methods over PROSAIL (coupling of PROSPECT and SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrary Inclined Leaves) radiative transfer models) EPS simulations. The global EPS products include uncertainty estimates taking into account the uncertainty captured by the retrieval method and input errors propagation. A sensitivity analysis is performed to assess several sources of uncertainties in retrievals and maximize the positive impact of modeling the noise in training simulations. The paper discusses initial validation studies and provides details about the characteristics and overall quality of the products, which can be of interest to assist the successful use of the data by a broad user's community. The consistent generation and distribution of the EPS vegetation products will constitute a valuable tool for monitoring of earth surface dynamic processes.

TI  - Spectral matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization: A new method for terrestrial water body extraction using multi-temporal Landsat 8 images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial water, an important indicator of inland hydrological status, is sensitive to land use cover change, natural disaster and climate change. An accurate and robust water extraction method can determine the surface water distribution. In this paper, a new method, called the spectrum matching based on discrete particle swarm optimization (SMDPSO) is proposed to recognize water and nonwater in Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Only two parameters, the standard water spectrum and the tile size, are considered. These parameters are sufficiently stable so it is unnecessary to change their values for different conditions. By contrast, in supervised methods, samples are chosen based on conditions. Eight test sites covering various water types in different climate conditions are used to assess the performance relative to that of unsupervised and supervised methods in terms of overall accuracy (OA), kappa coefficients (KC), commission error (CE) and omission error (OE). The results show that: (1) SMDPSO achieves the highest accuracy and robustness; (2) SMDPSO has lower OE but higher CE than the supervised method, which means that SMDPSO is the least likely to misclassify water as nonwater, but is more likely to misclassify nonwater as water; (3) SMDPSO has advantages with respect to removing shallows and dark vegetation and preserving the real distribution of small ponds, but cannot recognize shadows, ice, or clouds without the help of other data such as DEM. In addition, a case of flooding in northeastern China is analyzed to demonstrate the applicability of SMDPSO in water inundation mapping. The findings of this study demonstrate a novel robust, low-cost water extraction method that satisfies the requirements of terrestrial water inundation mapping and management.

TI  - Uncertainty in simulating regional gross primary productivity from satellite based models over northern China grassland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale estimation of regional terrestrial gross primacy production (GPP) can improve our understanding of carbon cycle. However, model based estimates are subject to uncertainty. In this study, eight satellite-based models (i.e. VPM, TG, GR, VI, CFIX, ECLUE, VPRM and MODIS-GPP) were compared for GPP simulation in northern China grassland based on 17 site-year eddy covariance measurements, meteorological data and satellite data. Also, the regional spatial temporal GPP patterns during 2001-2013 in northern China grassland were simulated and their uncertainties were quantified. The results showed that the model simulations exhibited significant correlations with observed GPP across these eight models and R-2 or pseudo R-2 ranged between 0.64 and 0.89 (p < .001), ECLUE model performed best. The annual grassland GPP had been growing in fluctuations from 2001 to 2013, with the averaged value of 241.8 g Cm-2 a(-1). Substantial spatial heterogeneity existed in grassland GPP, increasing from the west to the east. The disparities of satellite-based model structures resulted in the overall 49% relative uncertainty in regional simulation of GPP, which was high in area with arid dry climate. Our study highlighted the uncertainty traced back to model approaches under different environmental stresses (photosynthetically active radiation, soil water content and air temperature). For the accurate simulation of grassland GPP, uncertainty in alpine grassland and arid cold area on regional grassland GPP should be focused.

TI  - Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network for Surface Water Extraction in Landsat 8 OLI Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water mapping is essential for monitoring climate change, water resources, ecosystem services and the hydrological cycle. In this study, we adopt a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network to identify surface water in Landsat 8 satellite images. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method when extracting surface water, eight images of typical regions are collected, and a water index and support vector machine are employed for comparison. Through visual inspection and a quantitative index, the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of the entire scene classification, various surface water types and noise suppression is comprehensively compared with those of the water index and support vector machine. Moreover, band optimization, image preprocessing and a training sample for the proposed algorithm are analyzed and discussed. We find that (1) based on the quantitative evaluation, the performance of the surface water extraction for the entire scene when using the MLP is better than that when using the water index or support vector machine. The overall accuracy of the MLP ranges from 98.25-100%, and the kappa coefficients of the MLP range from 0.965-1. (2) The MLP can precisely extract various surface water types and effectively suppress noise caused by shadows and ice/snow. (3) The 1-7-band composite provides a better band optimization strategy for the proposed algorithm, and image preprocessing and high-quality training samples can benefit from the accuracy of the classification. In future studies, the automation and universality of the proposed algorithm can be further enhanced with the generation of training samples based on newly-released global surface water products. Therefore, this method has the potential to map surface water based on Landsat series images or other high-resolution images and can be implemented for global surface water mapping, which will help us better understand our changing planet.

TI  - An algorithm for the retrieval of the clumping index (CI) from the MODIS BRDF product using an adjusted version of the kernel-driven BRDF model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The clumping index (CI) characterizes the grouping of foliage relative to a random spatial distribution of leaves and is an important structural parameter for plant canopies that can influence canopy radiation regimes. Consequently, the CI is very useful for ecological and meteorological models. One method used to retrieve the CIs of plant canopies is to construct a linear relationship between the CI and the normalized difference between hotspot and dark spot (NDHD) angular index. This method requires a particularly accurate reconstruction of hotspot signatures, which are difficult to measure. In this study, we propose a framework to retrieve CIs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters, which are generally based on linear CI-NDHD equations. The main algorithm is designed to retrieve CIs in the closed interval [0.33, 1.00]. This range is derived from the CI-NDHD equations and is thus called as the physical range here, although a modified lower boundary can be implemented in the future if necessary. If CIs are outside of this range, then a backup algorithm is designed to reprocess these so-called outlier CIs. The hotspot-adjusted version of the RossThick-LiSparseReciprocal (RTLSR) model (i.e., the RTCLSR model) is employed to reconstruct the hotspot signatures for the MODIS BRDF parameters. This method simplifies the hotspot reconstruction by using two hotspot parameters that are not distinctly scale-dependent particularly in the context of an inhomogeneous coarse spatial resolution. To evaluate this algorithm framework, we collect dozens of global field-measured CIs and calculate their determination coefficient (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias relative to MODIS CIs derived using both the main algorithm and the backup algorithm. Our results show that this framework can derive MODIS CIs with a high accuracy (i.e., R-2 = 0.80 (0.72), RMSE = 0.07 (0.12), bias = -0.03 (-0.10)) using the main (backup) algorithms and that it shows promise for various ecological applications, especially in combination with the leaf area index (LAI).

TI  - Inter-Annual Variation of the Annual New Production of Phytoplankton in the Southwestern East/Japan Sea Estimated from Satellite-Derived Surface Nitrate Concentration
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The new production of phytoplankton based on nitrate is very important to understand how much portion of primary production passes on to higher trophic levels and sinks into deeper ocean. In this study, the inter-annual variation of the annual new production estimated from MODIS-aqua satellite-derived sea surface nitrate (SSN) concentration was analyzed in the southwestern East/Japan Sea from 2003 to 2015. Climatological SSN concentrations averaged in this study period ranged from 0.47 mu M (+/- 0.16 mu M) to 6.95 mu M (+/- 0.20 mu M) during the study period. The annual new production based on the estimated SSN ranged from 41.7 g C m(-2) yr(-1) to 62.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Overall, the average annual new production was 55.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1) (S.D = +/- 11.8 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in the southwestern East/Japan Sea for 13 years from 2003 to 2015. This value is comparable to those from previous studies but considerably lower than that based on nitrogen stable isotope measurements in the southwestern East/Japan Sea. We found a strong relationship between the annual new production and the sea surface temperature (SST) on February during the study period (y = -11.461 x + 180.52, r(2) = 0.8796, p < 0.01, n = 13). This result has a very significant ecological meaning in an ocean surface warming scenario since a warming SST could lead a lower annual new production and thus cause significant effects on upper trophic levels in the southwestern East/Japan Sea.

TI  - Annual New Production of Phytoplankton Estimated from MODIS-Derived Nitrate Concentration in the East/Japan Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Our main objective in this study was to determine the inter-annual variation of the annual new production in the East/Japan Sea (EJS), which was estimated from MODIS-aqua satellite-derived sea surface nitrate (SSN). The new production was extracted from northern (>40 degrees N) and southern (>40 degrees N) part of EJS based on Sub Polar Front (SPF). Based on the SSN concentrations derived from satellite data, we found that the annual new production (Mean +/- S.D = 85.6 +/- 10.1 g C m(-2) year(-1)) in the northern part of the EJS was significantly higher (t-test, p < 0.01) than that of the southern part of the EJS (Mean +/- S.D = 65.6 +/- 3.9 g C m(-2) year(-1)). Given the relationships between the new productions and sea surface temperature (SST) in this study, the new production could be more susceptible in the northern part than the southern part of the EJS under consistent SST warming. Since the new production estimated in this study is only based on the nitrate inputs into the euphotic depths during the winter, new productions from additional nitrate sources (e.g., the nitrate upward flux through the MLD and atmospheric deposition) should be considered for estimating the annual new production.

TI  - Correcting Measurement Error in Satellite Aerosol Optical Depth with Machine Learning for Modeling PM<sub>2.5</sub> in the Northeastern USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived estimates of aerosol optical depth (AOD) are key predictors in particulate air pollution models. The multi-step retrieval algorithms that estimate AOD also produce quality control variables but these have not been systematically used to address the measurement error in AOD. We compare three machine-learning methods: random forests, gradient boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) to characterize and correct measurement error in the Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) 1 x 1 km AOD product for Aqua and Terra satellites across the Northeastern/Mid-Atlantic USA versus collocated measures from 79 ground-based AERONET stations over 14 years. Models included 52 quality control, land use, meteorology, and spatially-derived features. Variable importance measures suggest relative azimuth, AOD uncertainty, and the AOD difference in 30-210 km moving windows are among the most important features for predicting measurement error. XGBoost outperformed the other machine-learning approaches, decreasing the root mean squared error in withheld testing data by 43% and 44% for Aqua and Terra. After correction using XGBoost, the correlation of collocated AOD and daily PM2.5 monitors across the region increased by 10 and 9 percentage points for Aqua and Terra. We demonstrate how machine learning with quality control and spatial features substantially improves satellite-derived AOD products for air pollution modeling.

TI  - Estimating Peatland Water Table Depth and Net Ecosystem Exchange: A Comparison between Satellite and Airborne Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands play a fundamental role in climate regulation through their long-term accumulation of atmospheric carbon. Despite their resilience, peatlands are vulnerable to climate change. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to better understand these ecosystems at large spatial scales through time. In this study, we estimated water table depth from a 6-year time sequence of airborne shortwave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral imagery. We found that the narrowband index NDWI1240 is a strong predictor of water table position. However, we illustrate the importance of considering peatland anisotropy on SWIR imagery from the summer months when the vascular plants are in full foliage, as not all illumination conditions are suitable for retrieving water table position. We also model net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from 10 years of Landsat TM5 imagery and from 4 years of Landsat OLI 8 imagery. Our results show the transferability of the model between imagery from sensors with similar spectral and radiometric properties such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. NEE modeled from airborne hyperspectral imagery more closely correlated to eddy covariance tower measurements than did models based on satellite images. With fine spectral, spatial and radiometric resolutions, new generation satellite imagery and airborne hyperspectral imagery allow for monitoring the response of peatlands to both allogenic and autogenic factors.

TI  - Antitumor in situ vaccination effect of TNFα and IL-12 plasmid DNA electrotransfer in a murine melanoma model
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gene electrotransfer (GET) is one of the most efficient non-viral gene therapy approaches for the localized transfer of multiple genes into tumors in vivo; therefore, it is especially promising for delivering different cytokines that are toxic if administered systemically. In this study, we used concomitant intratumoral GET of two cytokines: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), a potent cytotoxic cytokine to induce in situ vaccination, and interleukin 12 (IL-12), an immunostimulatory cytokine to boost the primed local immune response into a systemic one. After performing GET in murine melanoma tumors, both TNF alpha and IL-12 mRNA levels were significantly increased, which resulted in a pronounced delay in tumor growth of 27 days and a prolonged survival time of mice. An antitumor immune response was confirmed by extensive infiltration of immune cells in the tumor site, and expansion of the effector immune cells in the sentinel lymph nodes. Furthermore, the effect of in situ vaccination was indicated by the presence of vitiligo localized to the treatment area and resistance of the mice to secondary challenge with tumor cells. Intratumoral GET of two cytokines, one for in situ vaccination and one for an immune boost, proved feasible and effective in eliciting a potent and durable antitumor response; therefore, further studies of this approach are warranted.

TI  - The Response of Vegetation Phenology and Productivity to Drought in Semi-Arid Regions of Northern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A major disturbance in nature, drought, has a significant impact on the vulnerability and resilience of semi-arid ecosystems by shifting phenology and productivity. However, due to the various disturbance mechanisms, phenology and primary productivity have remained largely ambiguous until now. This paper evaluated the spatio-temporal changes of phenology and productivity based on GIMMS NDVI3g time series data, and demonstrated the responses of vegetation phenology and productivity to drought disturbances with the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) in semi-arid ecosystems of northern China. The results showed that (1): vegetation phenology exhibited dramatic spatial heterogeneity with different rates, mostly presented in the regions with high chances of land cover type variation. The delayed onset of growing season (SOS) and advanced end of growing season (EOS) occurred in Horqin Sandy Land and the eastern Ordos Plateau with a one to three days/decade (p < 0.05) rate and in the middle and east of Inner Mongolia with a two days/decade rate, respectively. Vegetation productivity presented a clear pattern: south increased and north decreased. (2) Spring drought delayed SOS in grassland, barren/sparsely vegetated land, and cropland, while autumn drought significantly advanced EOS in grassland and barren/sparsely vegetated lands. Annual drought reduced vegetation productivity and the sensitivity of productivity regarding drought disturbance was higher than that of phenology.

TI  - Modeling Gross Primary Production of a Typical Coastal Wetland in China Using MODIS Time Series and CO<sub>2</sub> Eddy Flux Tower Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - How to effectively combine remote sensing data with the eddy covariance (EC) technique to accurately quantify gross primary production (GPP) in coastal wetlands has been a challenge and is also important and necessary for carbon (C) budgets assessment and climate change studies at larger scales. In this study, a satellite-based Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM) combined with EC measurement and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was used to evaluate the phenological characteristics and the biophysical performance of MODIS-based vegetation indices (VIs) and the feasibility of the model for simulating GPP of coastal wetland ecosystems. The results showed that greenness-related and water-related VIs can better identify the green-up and the senescence phases of coastal wetland vegetation, corresponds well with the C uptake period and the phenological patterns that were delineated by GPP from EC tower (GPP(EC)). Temperature can explain most of the seasonal variation in VIs and GPP(EC) fluxes. Both enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and water-sensitive land surface water index (LSWI) have a higher predictive power for simulating GPP in this coastal wetland. The comparisons between modeled GPP (GPP(VPM)) and GPP(EC) indicated that VPM model can commendably simulate the trajectories of the seasonal dynamics of GPP(EC) fluxes in terms of patterns and magnitudes, explaining about 85% of GPP(EC) changes over the study years (p < 0.0001). The results also demonstrate the potential of satellite-driven VPM model for modeling C uptake at large spatial and temporal scales in coastal wetlands, which can provide valuable production data for the assessment of global wetland C sink/source.

TI  - Respiratory Syncytial Virus Surveillance System in Japan: Assessment of Recent Trends, 2008-2015
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major cause of lower respiratory tract illness in infants and young children. In Japan, surveillance for RSV infection started in 2003 based on approximately 3,000 pediatric sentinel sites. In recent years, RSV notifications have increased, but the interpretation of trends has been challenging due to a suspected increase in testing frequency and the expansion of the insurance coverage for RSV testing to include certain outpatients in late 2011. Therefore, we evaluated RSV surveillance data during 2008-2015, considering the number of sites that reported at least one RSV case during a surveillance year and restricting to sites that had continuous reporting status since 2008. While annual RSV notifications had increased, the number of sites reporting also increased. And the same magnitude of increase was not observed when the number of cases reported was restricted to the 1,372 sites that had continuous reporting status since 2008. Additionally, in the year following the insurance expansion, RSV notifications increased more remarkably for clinics than for hospitals. These results suggested that some of the recent increases in notifications might be due to an increase in testing frequency.

TI  - A Predictive Model for Axillary Node Pathologic Complete Response after Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent trials have suggested the feasibility of performing a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). The selection of suitable patients for this approach remains controversial. We developed a predictive model to identify patients most likely to benefit from SNB following NAC.The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify patients with clinically node positive (cN+) breast cancer undergoing NAC followed by breast surgery and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Patients were randomly assigned to a 70% testing or 30% validation cohort for model development. A predictive model was built based on significant factors associated with pathologic nodal response (pN0) and breast response.Using the testing cohort (n = 13,396), multivariate regression was used to identify predictors of pN0 based on preoperative factors. Younger age, hormone receptor (HR)-negative/Her2-negative, HR-positive/Her2-positive, HR-negative/Her2-positive, high-grade, ductal histology, cN1 versus cN2, and extent of breast response were all significant independent predictors of pN0 on adjusted analysis. The odds ratios translated into a 10-point scale correlating to a stepwise increase in pN0 response. The area under the curve for the ROC curves for the testing and validation cohorts was 0.781 and 0.788, respectively (p < 0.01).Our model incorporates known preoperative factors to predict the likelihood of pN0 response in patients with cN+ disease who undergo NAC. For patients with high scores, SNB should be considered over ALND, because these patients have a greater likelihood of having negative nodes at final pathology.

TI  - Diurnal and Longitudinal Variations of the Structure of an Equatorial Anomaly During Equinoxes According to Intercosmos-19 Satellite Data
T2  - GEOMAGNETISM AND AERONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Longitudinal and local time variations in the structure of the equatorial anomaly under high solar activity in the equinox are considered according to the Intercosmos-19 topside sounding data. It is shown that the anomaly begins to form at 0800 LT, when the southern crest is formed. The development of the equatorial anomaly is associated with well-known variations in the equatorial ionosphere: a change in the direction of the electric field from the west to the east, which causes vertical plasma drift W (directed upward) and the fountain effect. At 1000 LT, both anomaly crests appear, but they become completely symmetrical only by 1400 LT. The average position of the crests increases from I = 20A degrees at 1000 LT to I = 28A degrees at 1400 LT. The position of the crests is quite strong, sometimes up to 15A degrees, varies with longitude. The foF2 value above the equator and the equatorial anomaly intensity (EAI) at 1200-1400 LT vary with the longitude according to changes in the vertical plasma drift velocity W. At this time, four harmonics are observed in the longitudinal variations of W, foF2, and EAI. The equatorial anomaly intensity increases to the maximum 1.5-2 h after the evening burst in the vertical plasma drift velocity. Longitudinal variations of foF2 for 2000-2200 LT are also associated with corresponding variations in the vertical plasma drift velocity. The equatorial anomaly intensity decreases after the maximum at 2000 LT and the crests decrease in size and shift towards the equator, but the anomaly is well developed at midnight. On the contrary, after midnight, foF2 maxima in the region of the anomaly crests are farther from the equator, but this is obviously associated with the action of the neutral wind. At 0200 LT, in contrast to the morning hours, only the northern crest of the anomaly is clearly pronounced. Thus, in the case of high solar activity during the equinoxes, a well-defined equatorial anomaly is observed from 1000 to 2400 LT. It reaches the maximum at 2000 LT.

TI  - Satellite Images and Gaussian Parameterization for an Extensive Analysis of Urban Heat Islands in Thailand
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For the first time, an extensive study of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Thailand's six major cities is reported, using 728 MODIS (MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images for each city. The SUHI analysis was performed at three timescalesdiurnal, seasonal, and multiyear. The diurnal variation is represented by the four MODIS passages (10:00, 14:00, 22:00, and 02:00 local time) and the seasonal variation by summer and winter maps, with images covering a 14-year interval (2003-2016). Also, 126 Landsat scenes were processed to classify and map land cover changes for each city. To analyze and compare the SUHI patterns, a least-square Gaussian fitting method has been applied and the corresponding empirical metrics quantified. Such an approach represents, when applicable, an efficient quantitative tool to perform comparisons that a visual inspection of a great number of maps would not allow. Results point out that SUHI does not show significant seasonality differences, while SUHI in the daytime is a more evident phenomenon with respect to nighttime, mainly due to solar forcing and intense human activities and traffic. Across the 14 years, the biggest city, Bangkok, shows the highest SUHI maximum intensities during daytime, with values ranging between 4 degrees C and 6 degrees C; during nighttime, the intensities are rather similar for all the six cities, between 1 degrees C and 2 degrees C. However, these maximum intensities are not correlated with the urban growth over the years. For each city, the SUHI spatial extension represented by the Gaussian footprint is generally not affected by the urban area sprawl across the years, except for Bangkok and Chiang Mai, whose daytime SUHI footprints show a slight increase over the years. Orientation angle and central location of the fitted surface also provide information on the SUHI layout in relation to the land use of the urban texture.

TI  - Evidence for Gravity Wave Seeding of Convective Ionospheric Storms Possibly Initiated by Thunderstorms
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase in solar activity, the Communication/Outage Forecast System satellite decayed on orbit to below the F peak. As such, we can study the development of convective ionospheric storms and, most importantly, study large-scale seeding of the responsible instability. For decades, gravity has been suggested as being responsible for the long wavelengths in the range of 200 to 1,000 km, as are commonly observed using airglow and satellite data. Here we suggest that convective thunderstorms are a likely source of gravity waves and point out that recent theoretical analysis has shown this connection to be quite possible.

TI  - Implementation of the LandTrendr Algorithm on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The LandTrendr (LT) algorithm has been used widely for analysis of change in Landsat spectral time series data, but requires significant pre-processing, data management, and computational resources, and is only accessible to the community in a proprietary programming language (IDL). Here, we introduce LT for the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The GEE platform simplifies pre-processing steps, allowing focus on the translation of the core temporal segmentation algorithm. Temporal segmentation involved a series of repeated random access calls to each pixel's time series, resulting in a set of breakpoints (vertices) that bound straight-line segments. The translation of the algorithm into GEE included both transliteration and code analysis, resulting in improvement and logic error fixes. At six study areas representing diverse land cover types across the U.S., we conducted a direct comparison of the new LT-GEE code against the heritage code (LT-IDL). The algorithms agreed in most cases, and where disagreements occurred, they were largely attributable to logic error fixes in the code translation process. The practical impact of these changes is minimal, as shown by an example of forest disturbance mapping. We conclude that the LT-GEE algorithm represents a faithful translation of the LT code into a platform easily accessible by the broader user community.

TI  - Evaluating the capability of Landsat 8 OLI and SPOT 6 for discriminating invasive alien species in the African Savanna landscape
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, there is paucity of accurate information on the spatial distribution and patch sizes of Invasive Alien Plants (IAPs) species. Such information is needed to aid optimisation of control mechanisms to prevent further spread of IAPs and minimize their impacts. Recent studies have shown the capability of very high spatial (< 1 m) and spectral resolution (< 10 nm) data for discriminating vegetation species. However, very high spatial resolution may introduce significant intra-species spectral variability and result in reduced mapping accuracy, while higher spectral resolution data are commonly limited to smaller areas, are costly and computationally expensive. Alternatively, medium and high spatial resolution data are available at low or no cost and have limitedly been evaluated for their potential in determining invasion patterns relevant for invasion ecology and aiding effective IAPs management. In this study medium and high resolution datasets from Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) and SPOT 6 sensors respectively, were evaluated for mapping the distribution and patch sizes of IAP, Parthenium hysterophorus in the savannah landscapes of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier was used for classification of both datasets. Results indicated that SPOT 6 had a higher overall accuracy (86%) than OLI (83%) in mapping P. hysterophorus. The study found larger distributions and patch sizes in OLI than in SPOT 6 as a result of possible P. hysterophorus expansion due to temporal differences between images and coarser pixels were insufficient to delineate gaps inside larger patches. On the other hand, SPOT 6 showed better capabilities of delineating gaps and boundaries of patches, hence had better estimates of distribution and patch sizes. Overall, the study showed that OLI may be suitable for mapping well-established patches for the purpose of large scale monitoring, while SPOT 6 can be used for mapping small patches and prioritising them for eradication to prevent further spread at a landscape scale.

TI  - Identification of forest cutting in managed forest of Haldwani, India using ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 SAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale forest clear-cut identification is one of the major application of remote sensing techniques. ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 is the latest SAR satellite providing multi-polarized L-band SAR data. With increasing deforestation, it is important to assess the potential of SAR data for identifying clear-cuts in forest regions. In this research work, multi-temporal ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 SAR data and supplementary Landsat-8 optical data sets are acquired over Indian tropical forest, and SAR parameters are analysed over a progressively clear-cut Teak plantation. Sensitivity of the SAR parameters to progressive clear-cuts is estimated and found that the cross polarized backscatter sigma HV0 and entropy parameter H are most sensitive to both partial and complete clear-cut in forest compartments. An entropy thresholding based classification is carried out to identify clear-cut regions with a good accuracy. The study highlights the utility of SAR parameters to monitor forest clear-cuts for better forest management. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Transformation of shifting cultivation: Extent, driving forces and impacts on livelihoods in Tanzania
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifting cultivation is in rapid transformation in many parts of the Global South, but the drivers and consequences of these changes are still not well understood, especially in Africa. We therefore analysed the drivers of this transformation and its impacts on livelihoods between 1995 and 2014 in two villages located in Eastern Central Tanzania by combining analysis of socio-economic and remote sensing data. Results revealed that in an upland village, the number of shifting cultivators declined from 34% to 16% and the area changed from 19% to 17%. In a plateau village, the number of shifting cultivators declined from 24% to 18% and the area substantially declined from 23% to 14%. In both villages, shifting cultivators adopted intensive land preparation methods that involved deep tillage and burying of vegetation. Transformation of shifting cultivation in the upland area was driven by adoption and enforcement of land tenure policies that restrict shifting cultivation whereas in the plateau area, it was driven by population pressure causing competition for land between shifting cultivators and pastoralists. In both villages transformation of shifting cultivation negatively affected household income and increased periods of food insecurity.

TI  - Intercomparison of Terrestrial Carbon Fluxes and Carbon Use Efficiency Simulated by CMIP5 Earth System Models
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares historical simulations of the terrestrial carbon cycle produced by 10 Earth System Models (ESMs) that participated in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Using MODIS satellite estimates, this study validates the simulation of gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and carbon use efficiency (CUE), which depend on plant function types (PFTs). The models show noticeable deficiencies compared to the MODIS data in the simulation of the spatial patterns of GPP and NPP and large differences among the simulations, although the multi-model ensemble (MME) mean provides a realistic global mean value and spatial distributions. The larger model spreads in GPP and NPP compared to those of surface temperature and precipitation suggest that the differences among simulations in terms of the terrestrial carbon cycle are largely due to uncertainties in the parameterization of terrestrial carbon fluxes by vegetation. The models also exhibit large spatial differences in their simulated CUE values and at locations where the dominant PFT changes, primarily due to differences in the parameterizations. While the MME-simulated CUE values show a strong dependence on surface temperatures, the observed CUE values from MODIS show greater complexity, as well as non-linear sensitivity. This leads to the overall underestimation of CUE using most of the PFTs incorporated into current ESMs. The results of this comparison suggest that more careful and extensive validation is needed to improve the terrestrial carbon cycle in terms of ecosystem-level processes.

TI  - Multimodal photoacoustic imaging as a tool for sentinel lymph node identification and biopsy guidance
T2  - BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING LETTERS
M3  - Review
AB  - As a minimally invasive method, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in conjunction with guidance methods is the standard method to determine cancer metastasis in breast. The desired guidance methods for SLNB should be capable of precise SLN localization for accurate diagnosis of micro-metastases at an early stage of cancer progression and thus facilitate reducing the number of SLN biopsies for minimal surgical complications. For this, high sensitivity to the administered dyes, high spatial and contrast resolutions, deep imaging depth, and real-time imaging capability are pivotal requirements. Currently, various methods have been used for SLNB guidance, each with their own advantages and disadvantages, but no methods meet the requirements. In this review, we discuss the conventional SLNB guidance methods in this perspective. In addition, we focus on the role of the PA imaging modality on real-time SLN identification and biopsy guidance. In particular, PA-based hybrid imaging methods for precise SLN identification and efficient biopsy guidance are introduced, and their unique features, advantages, and disadvantages are discussed.

CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The sea surrounding the Korean Peninsula is roughly divided into the western part (the Yellow Sea (YS) and the South Sea (SS); shallow inland sea) and the eastern part (the East Sea (ES); drastically deep). While internal wave (IW) studies have been mainly localized because of the complicated environmental conditions around the Korean Peninsula, this study determined the differences of the IWs in various ocean fields for over three years (2013-2015). First, satellite measurements with high spatial and temporal resolutions from Landsat 8 and the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) were used. The curvature analysis was used to define and compare the shapes of the objective factors of the IWs, such as sizes, ovalities, and maximum wavelengths. In the YS, IWs appeared at a densely spaced interval compared with the ES and the maximum wavelength of the packet was nonlinearly increased with depth, and that of the YS (1.1 km) was about 10 times larger than and ES (10.6 km). In addition, the standard deviations of the wavelengths in a packet, which can determine the irregularity of the within-packet spacings from front to rear; were 0.2 and 1.4 for the YS and ES, respectively. Second, the ocean temperature and salinity data from HYCOM and Korteweg-de Vries equation were used to calculate the theoretical phase speed of IWs. Typically, the IW phase speed increased nonlinearly with the water depth; and the mean value was approximately 0.1-0.7 m/s and 0.9-1.7 m/s for the YS and ES, respectively.

TI  - Seasonal variation of source contributions to eddy-covariance CO<sub>2</sub> measurements in a mixed hardwood-conifer forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) measurements using the eddy covariance technique have been widely used for calibration and evaluation of carbon flux estimates from terrestrial ecosystem models as well as for remote sensing-based estimates across various spatial and temporal scales. Therefore, it is vital to fully understand the land surface characteristics within the area contributing to these flux measurements (i.e. source area) when upscaling plot-scale tower measurements to regional-scale ecosystem estimates, especially in heterogeneous landscapes, such as mixed forests. We estimated the source area of a flux tower at a mixed forest (Harvard Forest in US) using a footprint model, and analyzed the spatial representativeness of the source area for the vegetation characteristics (density variation and magnitude) within the surrounding 1. and 1.5-km grid cells during two decades (1993-2011). Semi-variogram and window size analyses using 19 years of Landsat-retrieved enhanced vegetation index (EVI) confirmed that spatial heterogeneity within the 1-km grid cell has been gradually increasing for leaf-on periods. The overall prevailing source areas lay toward the southwest, yet there were considerable variations in the extents and the directions of the source areas. The source areas generally cover a large enough area to adequately represent the vegetation density magnitude and variation during both daytime and nighttime. We show that the variation in the daytime NEE during peak growing season should be more attributed to variations in the deciduous forest contribution within the source areas rather than the vegetation density. This study highlights the importance of taking account of the land cover variation within the source areas into gap-filling and upscaling procedures.

TI  - Microrelief Associated with Gas Emission Craters: Remote-Sensing and Field-Based Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Formation of gas emission craters (GEC) is a new process in the permafrost zone, leading to considerable terrain changes. Yet their role in changing the relief is local, incomparable in the volume of the removed deposits to other destructive cryogenic processes. However, the relief-forming role of GECs is not limited to the appearance of the crater itself, but also results in positive and negative microforms as well. Negative microforms are rounded hollows, surrounded by piles of ejected or extruded deposits. Hypotheses related to the origin of these forms are put forward and supported by an analysis of multi-temporal satellite images, field observations and photographs of GECs. Remote sensing data specifically was used for interpretation of landform origin, measuring distances and density of material scattering, identifying scattered material through analysis of repeated imagery. Remote-sensing and field data reliably substantiate an impact nature of the hollows around GECs. It is found that scattering of frozen blocks at a distance of up to 293 m from a GEC is capable of creating an impact hollow. These data indicate the influence of GEC on the relief through the formation of a microrelief within a radius of 15-20 times the radius of the crater itself. Our study aims at the prediction of risk zones.

TI  - Model-Assisted Estimation of Tropical Forest Biomass Change: A Comparison of Approaches
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of changes in forest biomass requires accurate transfer functions between remote sensing-derived changes in canopy height (H) and the actual changes in aboveground biomass (AGB). Different approaches can be used to accomplish this task: direct approaches link H directly to AGB, while indirect approaches are based on deriving AGB stock estimates for two points in time and calculating the difference. In some studies, direct approaches led to more accurate estimations, while, in others, indirect approaches led to more accurate estimations. It is unknown how each approach performs under different conditions and over the full range of possible changes. Here, we used a forest model (FORMIND) to generate a large dataset (>28,000 ha) of natural and disturbed forest stands over time. Remote sensing of forest height was simulated on these stands to derive canopy height models for each time step. Three approaches for estimating AGB were compared: (i) the direct approach; (ii) the indirect approach and (iii) an enhanced direct approach (dir+tex), using H in combination with canopy texture. Total prediction accuracies of the three approaches measured as root mean squared errors (RMSE) were RMSEdirect = 18.7 t ha(-1), RMSEindirect = 12.6 t ha(-1) and RMSEdir+tex = 12.4 t ha(-1). Further analyses revealed height-dependent biases in the AGB estimates of the direct approach, which did not occur with the other approaches. Finally, the three approaches were applied on radar-derived (TanDEM-X) canopy height changes on Barro Colorado Island (Panama). The study demonstrates the potential of forest modeling for improving the interpretation of changes observed in remote sensing data and for comparing different methodologies.

TI  - Elucidation of the Anatomical Mechanism of Nodal Skip Metastasis in Superficial Thoracic Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymph node metastasis (LNM) is a standard mechanism of cancer progression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We aimed to clarify the anatomical mechanism of skip nodal metastasis to mediastinal zones by analyzing the relationship between LNM to sentinel zones and lymphatic vessel counts in the muscle layer adjacent to the outer esophagus.We examined the surgical records of 287 patients with ESCC who underwent potentially curative surgery (three-field lymphadenectomy) and whole esophagi, including pharynges and stomachs from 10 cadavers, to determine the number of lymphatic vessels in the intra-outer longitudinal muscle layer adjacent to the outer esophagus of the cervical (Ce), upper thoracic, middle thoracic (Mt), lower thoracic (Lt), and abdominal esophagi (Ae).The frequency of LNM to the middle mediastinal and supraclavicular zones, including the Mt and Ce, respectively, was lower than to the upper and lower mediastinal and abdominal zone in patients with superficial and advanced thoracic ESCC. In cadavers, the lymphatic vessel counts of the intra-outer longitudinal muscle layer in the Mt and Ce were significantly lower than those of the Lt and Ae, suggesting that lymphatic flow toward the outside of the Mt and Ce was not more abundant than to other sites.Our anatomical data suggested that the absence of intra-muscle lymphatic vessels in the middle mediastinal and supraclavicular zones causes skip LNM in patients with thoracic ESCC. Thus, standard esophagectomy with lymph node dissection, including distant zones, may be appropriate for treating patients with superficial thoracic ESCC.

TI  - Long-term aerosol climatology over Indo-Gangetic Plain: Trend, prediction and potential source fields
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term aerosol climatology is derived using Terra MODIS (Collection 6) enhanced Deep Blue (DB) AOD retrieval algorithm to investigate decadal trend (2006-2015) in columnar aerosol loading, future scenarios and potential source fields over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), South Asia. Satellite based aerosol climatology was analyzed in two contexts: for the entire IGP considering area weighted mean AOD and for nine individual stations located at upper (Karachi, Multan, Lahore), central (Delhi, Kanpur, Varanasi, Patna) and lower IGP (Kolkata, Dhaka). A comparatively high aerosol loading (AOD: 0.50 +/- 0.25) was evident over IGP with a statistically insignificant increasing trend of 0.002 year(-1). Analysis highlights the existing spatial and temporal gradients in aerosol loading with stations over central IGP like Varanasi (decadal mean AOD +/- SD; 0.67 +/- 0.28) and Patna (0.65 +/- 0.30) exhibit the highest AOD, followed by stations over lower IGP (Kolkata: 0.58 +/- 0.21; Dhaka: 0.60 +/- 0.24), with a statistically significant increasing trend (0.0174-0.0206 year(-1)). In contrast, stations over upper IGP reveal a comparatively low aerosol loading, having an insignificant increasing trend. Variation in AOD across IGP is found to be mainly influenced by seasonality and topography. A distinct "aerosol pool" region over eastern part of Ganges plain is identified, where meteorology, topography, and aerosol sources favor the persistence of airborne particulates. A strong seasonality in aerosol loading and types is also witnessed, with high AOD and dominance of fine particulates over central to lower IGP, especially during post-monsoon and winter. The time series analyses by autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) indicate contrasting patterns in randomness of AOD over individual stations with better performance especially over central IGP. Concentration weighted trajectory analyses identify the crucial contributions of western dry regions and partial contributions from central Highlands and north-eastern India, in regulating AOD over stations across IGP. Although our analyses provide some attributes to the observed changes in aerosol loading, we conclude that the spatial and temporal pattern of aerosol properties is highly complex and dynamic over IGP, and require further investigation in order to reduce uncertainty in aerosol-climate model.

TI  - Evaluation of radiative fluxes over the north Indian Ocean
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiative fluxes are a key component of the surface heat budget of the oceans. Yet, observations over oceanic region are sparse due to the complexity of radiation measurements; moreover, certain oceanic regions are substantially under-sampled, such as the north Indian Ocean. The National Institute of Ocean Technology, Chennai, India, under its Ocean Observation Program has deployed an Ocean Moored Network for the Northern Indian Ocean (OMNI) both in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. These buoys are equipped with sensors to measure radiation and rainfall, in addition to other basic meteorological parameters. They are also equipped with sensors to measure sub-surface currents, temperature, and conductivity from the surface up to a depth of 500 m. Observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) AQUA and TERRA satellites have been used to infer surface radiation over the north Indian Ocean. In this study, we focus only on the shortwave (SWa dagger") fluxes. The evaluations of the MODIS-based SWa dagger" fluxes against the RAMA observing network have shown a very good agreement between them, and therefore, we use the MODIS-derived fluxes as a reference for the evaluation of the OMNI observations. In an early deployment of the OMNI buoys, the radiation sensors were placed at 2 m above the sea surface; subsequently, the height of the sensors was raised to 3 m. In this study, we show that there was a substantial improvement in the agreement between the buoy observations and the satellite estimates, once the sensors were raised to higher levels. The correlation coefficient increased from 0.87 to 0.93, and both the bias and standard deviations decreased substantially.

TI  - Targeting macrophage immunometabolism: Dawn in the darkness of sepsis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sepsis is known since the time (470 BC) of great Greek physician, Hippocrates. Advancement in modern medicine and establishment of separate branches of medical science dealing with sepsis research have improved its outcome. However, mortality associated with sepsis still remains higher (25-30%) that further increases to 40-50% in the presence of septic shock. For example, sepsis-associated deaths account more in comparison to deaths-associated with myocardial-infarction and certain cancers (i.e. breast and colorectal cancer). However, it is now well established that profound activation of innate immune cells including macrophages play a very important role in the immunopathogenesis of sepsis. Macrophages are sentinel cells of the innate immune system with their location varying from peripheral blood to various target organs including lungs, liver, brain, kidneys, skin, testes, vascular endothelium etc. Thus, profound and dysregulated activation of these cells during sepsis can directly impact the outcome of sepsis. However, the emergence of the concept of immunometabolism as a major controller of immune response has raised a new hope for identifying new targets for immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches. Thus this present review starts with an introduction of sepsis as a major medical problem worldwide and signifies the role of dysregulated innate immune response including macrophages in its immunopathogenesis. Thereafter, subsequent sections describe changes in immunometabolic stage of macrophages (both M1 and M2) during sepsis. The article ends with the discussion of novel macrophage-specific therapeutic targets targeting their immunometabolism during sepsis and epigenetic regulation of macrophage immunometabolism and vice versa.

TI  - Biopsychosocial model of illnesses in primary care: A hermeneutic literature review.
T2  - Journal of family medicine and primary care
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - Biopsychosocial model is a useful worldview for primary care or family doctors. However, it is often considered as impractical or too complicated. The objective of this study is to review the implementation of the biopsychosocial model in clinical practice, and its contributions to clinical outcomes. Hermeneutic circle literature review was conducted to provide experiential learning in an attempt to understand biopscyhosocial model, first developed by George Engel. Literature search started with review articles in Medline and Scopus as search engines. Citations from previous articles, editorials, and research articles were identified and interpreted in the context of the knowledge derived from all identified relevant articles. The progress of biopsychosocial model has been slow, and primary care doctors do not implement biopsychosocial medicine in their practice, while biomedical thinking and approach are still the dominant model. Biopsychosocial research addressed chronic illnesses and functional disorders as conditions in need for biopsychosocial model implementation. As payment scheme, clinical guidelines and clinical performance indicators are biomedically oriented, there is no incentive for primary care doctors to adopt biopsychosocial model in their practice. Workload and lack of competence in primary care may hinder the implementation of biopsychosocial model. Biopsychosocial model helps primary care doctors to understand interactions among biological and psychosocial components of illnesses to improve the dyadic relationship between clinicians and their patients and multidisciplinary approaches in patient care. Biopsychosocial model potentially improves clinical outcomes for chronic diseases and functional illnesses seen in primary care.

CP  - 62nd Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials (MMM)
CL  - Pittsburgh, PA
AB  - The developed device with electromagnetic coils and small permanent magnets quantifies the iron contents of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. To remove diamagnetic and paramagnetic components and detect only superparamagnetic components, a 2nd harmonics signal is detected by a gradiometer under a moderate AC magnetic field (1-2 mT) with the fundamental frequency (2.944 kHz) of the coils and DC magnetic field (1-2 mT) of the magnets. The detection limit with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 is approximately 0.28 mu g of iron, and the device has a wide dynamic range of 10(4), 0.28 mu g-2.8 mg. Additional coils and permanent magnets play an important role producing the optimum distribution of AC/ DC magnetic fields for an iron distribution-independent and SLN size-independent quantification. We demonstrated the quantification of the iron in phantoms, which have a size of 3-20 mm with varied iron distributions and contain magnetic nanoparticles numerically. These results indicate that the developed device is useful for quantifying the magnetic nanoparticles accumulating in SLNs. (C) 2017 Author(s).

AB  - To evaluate the feasibility and diagnostic performance of intradermal contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) sentinel lymph node (SLN) procedure in vulvar cancer.Twelve consecutive patients with vulvar cancer underwent preoperatively inguinal CEUS SLN examination and guide wire marking of the enhanced lymph nodes. Altogether, 20 groins were examined with CEUS contrast agent injections including 8 bilateral groins due to midline tumours. One groin was excluded due to previous inguinal surgery. The results of the CEUS examinations were compared to conventional SLN biopsy using radiocolloid scintigraphy and/or methylene blue dye and final postoperative histopathology.The inguinal sentinel CEUS procedure had a technical success rate of 94.7% (18/19 injections) for identifying a potential inguinal SLN. Conventional SLN biopsy using lymphoscintigraphy and/or methylene blue dye was successfully performed in 16 groins. Compared to conventional SLN biopsy, the overall sensitivity was 81.2% (13/16 injections). Additionally, CEUS detected enhancing SLNs in two cases when traditional SLN procedure failed to do so. All metastatic SLNs (n = 5) were correctly identified by CEUS procedure.Intradermal CEUS SLN localization can be applied in the inguinal lymphatic region in patients with vulvar cancer. Further studies are needed to verify the clinical value of this method.aEuro cent CEUS is a feasible method for inguinal SLN detection in vulvar canceraEuro cent All metastatic inguinal SLNs were identified by CEUS procedureaEuro cent Further studies are needed to verify the clinical value of this method.

TI  - Does quality control matter? Surface urban heat island intensity variations estimated by satellite-derived land surface temperature products
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The temporally regular and spatially comprehensive monitoring of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) have been extremely difficult, until the advent of satellite-based land surface temperature (LST) products. However, these LST products have relatively higher errors compared to in situ measurements. This has resulted in comparatively inaccurate estimations of SUHI indicators and, consequently, may have distorted interpretations of SUHIs. Although reports have shown that LST qualities are important for SUHI interpretations, systematic investigations of the response of SUHI indicators to LST qualities across cities with dissimilar bioclimates are rare. To address this issue, we chose eighty-six major cities across mainland China and analyzed SUHI intensity (SUHII) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data. The LST-based SUHII differences due to inclusion or exclusion of MODIS quality control (QC) flags (i.e., ASUHII) were evaluated. Our major findings included, but are not limited to, the following four aspects: (1) SUHIls can be significantly impacted by MODIS QC flags, and the associated QC-induced Delta SUHIIs generally accounted for 24.3% (29.9%) of the total SUHII value during the day (night); (2) the Delta SUHIIs differed between seasons, with considerable differences between transitional (spring and autumn) and extreme (summer and winter) seasons; (3) significant discrepancies also appeared among cities located in northern and southern regions, with northern cities often possessing higher annual mean Delta SUHIIs. The internal variations of Delta SUHIIs within individual cities also showed high heterogeneity, with ASUHII variations that generally exceeded 5.0 K (3.0 K) in northern (southern) cities; (4) Delta SUHIIs were negatively related to SUHIls and cloud cover percentages (mostly in transitional seasons). No significant relationship was found in the extreme seasons. Our findings highlight the need to be extremely cautious when using LST product-based SUHIIs to interpret SUHIs.

TI  - Effects of landscape fragmentation on land loss
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal Louisiana has been facing a serious land loss problem over the past several decades, and extensive research has been undertaken to address the problem. However, the importance of landscape fragmentation on land loss has seldom been examined. This paper evaluates the effects of landscape fragmentation on land loss in the Lower Mississippi River Basin region. The research hypothesis is that the higher the degree of fragmentation in a locality, the greater the amount of land loss in the next time period. We used Landsat-TM data with a pixel size of 30 m x 30 m in 1996 and 2010 and transformed the images into either land or water pixels. We then calculated the fractal dimension and Moran's I spatial autocorrelation statistics and used them to represent the degree of landscape fragmentation. Four sample box sizes, including sizes of 101 x 101, 71 x 71, 51 x 51, and 31 x 31 pixels, were used to detect if there is a relationship between fragmentation and land loss at different neighborhood (context) scales. For each box size, 100 samples were randomly selected. To isolate the fragmentation effect so that it can be better evaluated, we used only sample boxes with a 50% land-water ratio. Regression results between fragmentation and land loss show that the R-2 values for box sizes of 71 x 71, 51 x 51 and 31 x 31 were statistically significant (0.20, 0.45, 0.35; p < 0.001 for Moran's I) but not for the 101 x 101 box size. These results imply that land protection may be most effective by prioritizing areas with land patches that have the least fragmentation. Furthermore, the neighborhood scale at which the R-2 value is the highest indicates the scale at which the effects are most likely to be observed (51 x 51 box size, approximately 1.5 x 1.5 km(2), R-2 = 0.45), which suggests that future land loss modeling using this neighborhood scale would be most effective.

TI  - A Statistical Modeling Framework for Characterising Uncertainty in Large Datasets: Application to Ocean Colour
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty estimation is crucial to establishing confidence in any data analysis, and this is especially true for Essential Climate Variables, including ocean colour. Methods for deriving uncertainty vary greatly across data types, so a generic statistics-based approach applicable to multiple data types is an advantage to simplify the use and understanding of uncertainty data. Progress towards rigorous uncertainty analysis of ocean colour has been slow, in part because of the complexity of ocean colour processing. Here, we present a general approach to uncertainty characterisation, using a database of satellite-in situ matchups to generate a statistical model of satellite uncertainty as a function of its contributing variables. With an example NASA MODIS-Aqua chlorophyll-a matchups database mostly covering the north Atlantic, we demonstrate a model that explains 67% of the squared error in log(chlorophyll-a) as a potentially correctable bias, with the remaining uncertainty being characterised as standard deviation and standard error at each pixel. The method is quite general, depending only on the existence of a suitable database of matchups or reference values, and can be applied to other sensors and data types such as other satellite observed Essential Climate Variables, empirical algorithms derived from in situ data, or even model data.

TI  - Evidence-based outcomes of holmium laser enucleation of the prostate
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of reviewHolmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) has been a mainstay therapy for the treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) secondary to benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) for nearly 20 years. We briefly review current and sentinel publications that provide outcomes data after HoLEP.Recent findingsCurrent literature continues to support HoLEP as a versatile and durable surgical option for men with LUTS secondary to BPH. Despite evidence supporting durable symptom relief beyond 10 years even in large prostate glands, HoLEP is still not widely available to all patients. Concerns surrounding the learning curve of the procedure, high rates of retrograde ejaculation, and transient urinary incontinence seem to persist and limit the adoption of HoLEP by established urologists and residency training programs.SummaryRecent publications continue to show excellent short-term and long-term outcomes after HoLEP, in the categories of voiding function and patient satisfaction. Continued attempts to demonstrate equivalent outcomes of alternate-BPH surgical techniques are being met with renewed efforts by those performing HoLEP to demonstrate equivalent outcomes and patient safety during the learning phase of HoLEP for both mentored and self-directed surgical training.

TI  - Improved rice residue burning emissions estimates: Accounting for practice-specific emission factors in air pollution assessments of Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In Southeast Asia and Vietnam, rice residues are routinely burned after the harvest to prepare fields for the next season. Specific to Vietnam, the two prevalent burning practices include: a). piling the residues after hand harvesting; b). burning the residues without piling, after machine harvesting. In this study, we synthesized field and laboratory studies from the literature on rice residue burning emission factors for PM2.5. We found significant differences in the resulting burning-practice specific emission factors, with 16.9 g kg(-2) (+/- 6.9) for pile burning and 8.8 g kg(-2) (+/- 3.5) for non-pile burning. We calculated burning-practice specific emissions based on rice area data, region-specific fuel-loading factors, combined emission factors, and estimates of burning from the literature. Our results for year 2015 estimate 180 Gg of PM2.5 result from the pile burning method and 130 Gg result from non-pile burning method, with the most-likely current emission scenario of 150 Gg PM2.5 emissions for Vietnam. For comparison purposes, we calculated emissions using generalized agricultural emission factors employed in global biomass burning studies. These results estimate 80 Gg PM2.5, which is only 44% of the pile burning-based estimates, suggesting underestimation in previous studies. We compare our emissions to an existing all-combustion sources inventory, results show emissions account for 14-18% of Vietnam's total PM2.5 depending on burning practice. Within the highly-urbanized and cloud-covered Hanoi Capital region (HCR), we use rice area from Sentinel-IA to derive spatially-explicit emissions and indirectly estimate residue burning dates. Results from HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis stratified by season show autumn has most emission trajectories originating in the North, while spring has most originating in the South, suggesting the latter may have bigger impact on air quality. From these results, we highlight locations where emission mitigation efforts could be focused and suggest measures for pollutant mitigation. Our study demonstrates the need to account for emissions variation due to different burning practices. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the coastal and estuarine systems, the determination of bathymetric data is an important instrument for a safe shipping in harbor zones. Generally, data are collected in situ or ground, however, this information is time-consuming and costly. Remote sensing can be regarded as one of the most promising alternative tools to map bathymetry of the estuaries and coastal zones, due to its extensive coverage of the area and the low cost imbued. This study aims to analyze the accuracy of bathymetric data obtained by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor, coupled to Landsat 8 orbital platform, in comparison to the results with bathymetric data collected in situ (echo sounder) at the Rio Grande channel, situated in Patos Lagoon estuary, southern Brazil. With the bathymetric maps and data collected in situ, it was possible to estimate the estuary depth from Landsat 8 image; using the Coastal band (b1), with a spatial resolution of 30 m and penetration capacity of 15 m, and Near Infrared band (b5), with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The relation between the data collected in situ and the data obtained by remote sensing showed the accuracy of 71% kappa (index of accuracy) and R2 of 81.7% for the image referring to February 2015, nine months before the echo sounding survey. Nevertheless, the image processing for December 2015, one month after the survey with echo sounder, presented a kappa of 85%, and R2 of 96.5%. The results show a good correlation between the data acquired in situ and the data obtained by the OLI sensor. In this way, the remote sensing technique used for bathymetric analysis can be applied as a complementary form, increasing the temporal resolution of the obtained data.

T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pantanal is divided into subregions, and one of them is the object of this study. Called Nhecolandia subregion, it has specific characteristics related to its environmental and socioeconomic aspects. Livestock is the main activity in the region, through the extensive system of cattle farming. Throughout the year, this area presents a dynamics in the cover linked to its cycle of flood, drought, and consequent burning for the renewal of pasture. This study analyzes this dynamics through satellite images of Landsat series, from 2007 to 2015. The dynamics of vegetation, and the use and cover of land reinforce for the region the importance of better understand the short and long cycles of seasonal flood and drought, which directly impact the biodiversity, the local resident, and the rural producer.

TI  - An Image Fusion Method Based on Image Segmentation for High-Resolution Remotely-Sensed Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusion of high spatial resolution (HSR) multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images has become a research focus with the development of HSR remote sensing technology. In order to reduce the spectral distortions of fused images, current image fusion methods focus on optimizing the approach used to extract spatial details from the PAN band, or on the optimization of the models employed during the injection of spatial details into the MS bands. Due to the resolution difference between the MS and PAN images, there is a large amount of mixed pixels (MPs) existing in the upsampled MS images. The fused versions of these MPs remain mixed, although they may correspond to pure PAN pixels. This is one of the reasons for spectral distortions of fusion products. However, few methods consider spectral distortions introduced by the mixed fused spectra of MPs. In this paper, an image fusion method based on image segmentation was proposed to improve the fused spectra of MPs. The MPs were identified and then fused to be as close as possible to the spectra of pure pixels, in order to reduce spectral distortions caused by fused MPs and improve the quality of fused products. A fusion experiment, using three HSR datasets recorded by WorldView-2, WorldView-3 and GeoEye-1, respectively, was implemented to compare the proposed method with several other state-of-the-art fusion methods, such as haze- and ratio-based (HR), adaptive Gram-Schmidt (GSA) and smoothing filter-based intensity modulation (SFIM). Fused products generated at the original and degraded scales were assessed using several widely-used quantitative quality indexes. Visual inspection was also employed to compare the fused images produced using the original datasets. It was demonstrated that the proposed method offers the lowest spectral distortions and more sharpened boundaries between different image objects than other methods, especially for boundaries between vegetation and non-vegetation objects.

TI  - Applying Independent Component Analysis on Sentinel-2 Imagery to Characterize Geomorphological Responses to an Extreme Flood Event near the Non-Vegetated Rio Colorado Terminus, Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In some internally-draining dryland basins, ephemeral river systems terminate at the margins of playas. Extreme floods can exert significant geomorphological impacts on the lower reaches of these river systems and the playas, including causing changes to flood extent, channel-floodplain morphology, and sediment dispersal. However, the characterization of these impacts using remote sensing approaches has been challenging owing to variable vegetation and cloud cover, as well as the commonly limited spatial and temporal resolution of data. Here, we use Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) data to investigate the flood extent, flood patterns and channel-floodplain morphodynamics resulting from an extreme flood near the non-vegetated terminus of the Rio Colorado, located at the margins of the world's largest playa (Salar de Uyuni, Bolivia). Daily maximum precipitation frequency analysis based on a 42-year record of daily precipitation data (1976 through 2017) indicates that an approximately 40-year precipitation event (40.7 mm) occurred on 6 January 2017, and this was associated with an extreme flood. Sentinel-2 data acquired after this extreme flood were used to separate water bodies and land, first by using modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), and then by subsequently applying independent component analysis (ICA) on the land section of the combined pre- and post-flood images to extract flooding areas. The area around the Rio Colorado terminus system was classified into three categories: water bodies, wet land, and dry land. The results are in agreement with visual assessment, with an overall accuracy of 96% and Kappa of 0.9 for water-land classification and an overall accuracy of 83% and Kappa of 0.65 for dry land-wet land classification. The flood extent mapping revealed preferential overbank flow paths on the floodplain, which were closely related to geomorphological changes. Changes included the formation and enlargement of crevasse splays, channel avulsion, and the development of erosion cells (floodplain scour-transport-fill features). These changes were visualized by Sentinel-2 images along with WorldView satellite images. In particular, flooding enlarged existing crevasse splays and formed new ones, while channel avulsion occurred near the river's terminus. Greater overbank flow on the floodplain led to rapid erosion cell development, with changes to channelized sections occurring as a result of adjustments in flow sources and intensity combined with the lack of vegetation on the fine-grained (predominantly silt, clay) sediments. This study has demonstrated how ICA can be implemented on Sentinel-2 imagery to characterize the impact of extreme floods on the lower Rio Colorado, and the method has potential application in similar contexts in many other drylands.

TI  - Assessment of the Impacts From the World's Largest Floating Macroalgae Blooms on the Water Clarity at the West Yellow Sea Using MODIS Data (2002-2016)
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity (Secchi disk depth, SDD) is a very important factor for marine ecological environment. The world's largest "green tide" caused by the macroalgal blooms (MABs) of green macroalgae has occurred every summer in the Yellow Sea since 2008. In this study, we first present the effects of MABs on the water clarity in the west Yellow Sea. A regional empirical retrieval algorithm of SDD on the basis of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing reflectance is evaluated with the field data and satellite reflectance data: the spectral simulation with the end-member reflectance of sea water and macroalgae, and the MODIS Level-2 standard products of the remote sensing reflectance. The results show that the mixture of sea water and macroalgae will lead to decreased water clarity when the SDD is larger than 1.2 m and increased chlorophyll-a, i.e., false values in the standard products for pure sea water which therefore should be used with caution for the regions with large scale of floating macroalgae blooms. The long-term SDD in June and July (2002-2016) over the Yellow Sea is investigated and analyzed with the presence of "green tide." The significant decrease in the SDD by 2.6 m and with 12 544 km(2) of sea surface in total in July while no pronouncing changes in June suggests that the water clarity in the west Yellow Sea has been strongly affected from the period of 2002-2007 (the pre-MAB phase) to the period of 2008-2016 (the MAB phase).

TI  - Viral etiologies and epidemiology of patients with acute respiratory infections based on sentinel hospitals in Gansu Province, Northwest China, 2011-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding etiological role and epidemiological profile is needed to improve clinical management and prevention of acute respiratory infections (ARIs). A 5-year prospective study about active surveillance for outpatients and inpatients with ARIs was conducted in Gansu province, China, from January 2011 to November 2015. Respiratory specimens were collected from patients and tested for eight respiratory viruses using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). In this study, 2768 eligible patients with median age of 43 years were enrolled including pneumonia (1368, 49.2%), bronchitis (435, 15.7%), upper respiratory tract infection or URTI (250, 9.0%), and unclassified ARI (715, 25.8%). Overall, 29.2% (808/2768) were positive for any one of eight viruses, of whom 130 cases were identified with two or more viruses. Human rhinovirus (HRV) showed the highest detection rate (8.6%), followed by influenza virus (Flu, 7.3%), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV, 6.1%), human coronavirus (hCoV, 4.3%), human parainfluenza (PIV, 4.0%), adenovirus (ADV, 2.1%), human metapneumovirus (hMPV, 1.6%), and human bocavirus (hBoV, 0.7%). Compared with URTI, RSV was more likely identified in pneumonia ((2)=12.720, P<0.001) and hCoV was more commonly associated with bronchitis than pneumonia ((2)=15.019, P<0.001). In patients aged less than 5 years, RSV showed the highest detection rate and hCoV was the most frequent virus detected in adults and elderly. The clear epidemical seasons were observed in HRV, Flu, and hCoV infections. These findings could serve as a reference for local health authorities in drawing up further plans to prevent and control ARIs associated with viral etiologies.

TI  - Fast solar radiation pressure modelling with ray tracing and multiple reflections
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Physics based SRP (Solar Radiation Pressure) models using ray tracing methods are powerful tools when modelling the forces on complex real world space vehicles. Currently high resolution (1 mm) ray tracing with secondary intersections is done on high performance computers at UCL (University College London). This study introduces the BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) into the ray tracing approach for physics based SRP modelling and makes it possible to run high resolution analysis on personal computers. The ray tracer is both general and efficient enough to cope with the complex shape of satellites and multiple reflections (three or more, with no upper limit). In this study, the traditional ray tracing technique is introduced in the first place and then the BVH is integrated into the ray tracing. Four aspects of the ray tracer were tested for investigating the performance including runtime, accuracy, the effects of multiple reflections and the effects of pixel array resolution. Test results in runtime on GPS IIR and Galileo IOV (In Orbit Validation) satellites show that the BVH can make the force model computation 30-50 times faster. The ray tracer has an absolute accuracy of several nanonewtons by comparing the test results for spheres and planes with the analytical computations. The multiple reflection effects are investigated both in the intersection number and acceleration on GPS IIR, Galileo IOV and Sentinel-1 spacecraft. Considering the number of intersections, the 3rd reflection can capture 99,12%, 99.14%, and 91.34% of the total reflections for GPS IIR, Galileo IOV satellite bus and the Sentinel-1 spacecraft respectively. In terms of the multiple reflection effects on the acceleration, the secondary reflection effect for Galileo IOV satellite and Sentinel-1 can reach 0.2 nm/s(2) and 0.4 nm/s(2) respectively. The error percentage in the accelerations magnitude results show that the 3rd reflection should be considered in order to make it less than 0.035%. The pixel array resolution tests show that the dimensions of the components have to be considered when choosing the spacing of the pixel in order not to miss some components of the satellite in ray tracing. This paper presents the first systematic and quantitative study of the secondary and higher order intersection effects. It shows conclusively the effect is non-negligible for certain classes of misson. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ionospheric correction of InSAR data for accurate ice velocity measurement at polar regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) has become an essential tool for measuring ice sheet velocity in the Polar Regions. At low radar frequencies, e.g. L-band (1.2 GHz) but also at higher frequency, e.g. C-band (5.6 GHz), the ionosphere has been documented to be an important source of noise in these data. In this paper, we employ a split-spectrum technique and investigate its performance for correcting ionospheric effects in InSAR-based ice velocity measurements in Greenland and Antarctica. Three case studies using ALOS PALSAR data are used to assess the performance of the split spectrum technique for ionosphere correction over a range of environmental parameters. We employ several approaches to evaluate the results, including visual inspection, profile analysis, comparison of experimental and theoretic errors, comparison with reference data from other sources, generation of double difference interferograms, and analysis of time series of multi-temporal data. Our experiments show that ionospheric distortions are observed regularly, and in our analyzed Greenland dataset and Antarctic dataset the ionospheric noise reaches 14 m/yr and 10 m/yr, respectively, which exceeds the signal associated with ice motion. Our analysis using several different approaches demonstrates that the split-spectrum technique provides an effective correction. The split spectrum technique is also found to be superior to currently used approaches such as baseline fitting and multi-temporal averaging. The noise level is reduced by a factor of 70% in Greenland test areas and 90% in Antarctic test areas.

TI  - Prognostic value of isolated tumour cells in sentinel lymph nodes in early-stage breast cancer: a prospective study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognostic significance of isolated tumour cells (ITCs) in the sentinel nodes (SNs) is controversial in early breast cancer, and some centres have abandoned immunohistochemistry to detect ITCs.METHODS: Patients with unilateral pT1N0 breast cancer, operated between February 2001 and August 2005 at a university hospital were included in this prospective, population-based cohort study. Survival of 936 patients with or without isolated tumour cells (ITC) in their SNs were compared with the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis.RESULTS: Eight hundred sixty one (92.0%) patients were ITC-negative (pN0i-) and 75 (8.0%) ITC-positive (pN0i+). Patients with ITC-positive cancer received more frequently adjuvant systemic therapies than those with ITC-negative cancer. The median follow-up time was 9.5 years. Ten-year distant disease-free survival was 95.3% in the pN0i-group and 88.8% in the pN0i+ group (P = 0.013). ITCs were an independent prognostic factor in a Cox regression model (HR = 2.34, 95% CI 1.09-5.04; P = 0.029), together with tumour Ki-67 proliferation index and diameter. ITCs were associated with unfavourable overall survival (P = 0.005) and breast cancer-specific survival (P = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that presence of ITCs in the SNs is an adverse prognostic factor in early small node-negative breast cancer, and may be considered in the decision-making for adjuvant therapy.

TI  - AHI/Himawari-8 Yonsei Aerosol Retrieval (YAER): Algorithm, Validation and Merged Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Himawari-8, a next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite, was successfully launched by the Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) on 7 October 2014 and has been in official operation since 7 July 2015. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8 has 16 channels from 0.47 to 13.3 m and performs full-disk observations every 10 min. This study describes AHI aerosol optical property (AOP) retrieval based on a multi-channel algorithm using three visible and one near-infrared channels (470, 510, 640, and 860 nm). AOPs were retrieved by obtaining the visible surface reflectance using shortwave infrared (SWIR) data along with normalized difference vegetation index shortwave infrared (NDVISWIR) categories and the minimum reflectance method (MRM). Estimated surface reflectance from SWIR (ESR) tends to be overestimated in urban and cropland areas. Thus, the visible surface reflectance was improved by considering urbanization effects. Ocean surface reflectance is obtained using MRM, while it is from the Cox and Munk method in ESR with the consideration of chlorophyll-a concentration. Based on validation with ground-based sun-photometer measurements from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data, the error pattern tends to the opposition between MRMver (using MRM reflectance) AOD and ESRver (Using ESR reflectance) AOD over land. To estimate optimal AOD products, two methods were used to merge the data. The final aerosol products and the two surface reflectances were merged, which resulted in higher accuracy AOD values than those retrieved by either individual method. All four AODs shown in this study show accurate diurnal variation compared with AERONET, but the optimum AOD changes depending on observation time.

TI  - Estimation of Hurricane Maximum Wind Speed Using Temperature Anomaly Derived From Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of hurricane intensity is typically relying on aircraft observations and remote sensing data. This letter develops a satellite algorithm to estimate the hurricane surface maximum wind speed. The Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) observations are used to retrieve the atmospheric temperatures. The temperature anomaly field at each pressure level within the hurricane is derived with respect to its environment. It is shown that for a tropical cyclone entering the hurricane stage, a warm core anomaly occurs in upper troposphere. From the GPS dropsonde data of three hurricane cases (Harvey, Irma, and Maria) in 2017, a linear relationship is derived between the maximum warm core value and maximum surface wind speed. Thus, ATMS-derived warm core anomaly is a very good indicator of storm intensity and can be used in the operational weather forecasts.

TI  - Response of the water use efficiency of natural vegetation to drought in Northeast China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought has become a problem that is universally faced by global terrestrial ecosystems. Northeast China is located in a region sensitive to global climate changes, and one of the main impacts of climate changes in Northeast China is manifested as drought in growing seasons. This study analyzes the spatio-temporal evolution law of the water use efficiency (WUE) of the main natural vegetation (i.e., cold-temperate coniferous forests, temperate pine-broad-leaved mixed forests, warm-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests, and grasslands) in Northeast China based on public MODIS data products, including MCD12Q1, MOD15A2H, MOD16A2, and MOD17A3H, and meteorological data from 2002 to 2013. The influence of drought events on the WUE of different vegetation types and their response to drought events are also investigated. The study findings are as follows: (1) drought in Northeast China frequently occurs in the regions stretching from 114.55A degrees E to 120.90A degrees E, and the percentage of drought area among the forests is lower than that among the grasslands during these years; (2) the annual average WUE of the natural vegetation ranges from 0.82 to 1.08 C/kg(-1)H(2)O, and the WUE of forests (0.82 to 1.08 C/kg(-1)H(2)O) is universally higher than that of grasslands (0.84 to 0.99 C/kg(-1)H(2)O; (3) in 2008, the regions where the WUE in drought conditions is higher than that in normal water conditions account for 86.11% of the study area, and a significant linear positive correlation is found between the WUE in drought conditions and the WUE in normal water conditions, whereas the degree of drought does not influence the WUE of the natural vegetation in an obviously linear manner; and (4) the WUE for the cold-temperate coniferous forests and temperate pine-broad-leaved mixed forests with a high ET or low NPP is more likely to rise in drought conditions; the WUE for the grasslands with a low Evapotranspiration (ET), Net Primary Production (NPP), and Leaf Area Index (LAI) is more likely to rise in drought conditions; and the ET, NPP, and LAI have no significant influence on the WUE for the warm-temperate deciduous broad-leaved forests in drought conditions. This study contributes to improving the evaluation of the influence of drought on natural ecosystems.

TI  - Single satellite imagery simultaneous super-resolution and colorization using multi-task deep neural networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF VISUAL COMMUNICATION AND IMAGE REPRESENTATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite imagery is a kind of typical remote sensing data, which holds preponderance in large area imaging and strong macro integrity. However, for most commercial space usages, such as virtual display of urban traffic flow, virtual interaction of environmental resources, one drawback of satellite imagery is its low spatial resolution, failing to provide the clear image details. Moreover, in recent years, synthesizing the color for grayscale satellite imagery or recovering the original color of camouflage sensitive regions becomes an urgent requirement for large spatial objects virtual reality interaction. In this work, unlike existing works which solve these two problems separately, we focus on achieving image super-resolution (SR) and image colorization synchronously. Based on multi-task learning, we provide a novel deep neural network model to fulfill single satellite imagery SR and colorization simultaneously. By feeding back the color feature representations into the SR network and jointly optimizing such two tasks, our deep model successfully achieves the mutual cooperation between imagery reconstruction and image colorization. To avoid color bias, we not only adopt the non-satellite imagery to enrich the color diversity of satellite image, but also recalculate the prior color distribution and the valid color range based on the mixed data. We evaluate the proposed model on satellite images from different data sets, such as RSSCN7 and AID. Both the evaluations and comparisons reveal that the proposed multi-task deep learning approach is superior to the state-of-the-art methods, where image SR and colorization can be accomplished simultaneously and efficiently.

TI  - A Modified Spatiotemporal Fusion Algorithm Using Phenological Information for Predicting Reflectance of Paddy Rice in Southern China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data for studying surface dynamics in heterogeneous landscapes are missing due to frequent cloud contamination, low temporal resolution, and technological difficulties in developing satellites. A modified spatiotemporal fusion algorithm for predicting the reflectance of paddy rice is presented in this paper. The algorithm uses phenological information extracted from a moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer enhanced vegetation index time series to improve the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM). The algorithm is tested with satellite data on Yueyang City, China. The main contribution of the modified algorithm is the selection of similar neighborhood pixels by using phenological information to improve accuracy. Results show that the modified algorithm performs better than ESTARFM in visual inspection and quantitative metrics, especially for paddy rice. This modified algorithm provides not only new ideas for the improvement of spatiotemporal data fusion method, but also technical support for the generation of remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - An analysis of spatial representativeness of air temperature monitoring stations
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface air temperature is an essential variable for monitoring the atmosphere, and it is generally acquired at meteorological stations that can provide information about only a small area within an r m radius (r-neighborhood) of the station, which is called the representable radius. In studies on a local scale, ground-based observations of surface air temperatures obtained from scattered stations are usually interpolated using a variety of methods without ascertaining their effectiveness. Thus, it is necessary to evaluate the spatial representativeness of ground-based observations of surface air temperature before conducting studies on a local scale. The present study used remote sensing data to estimate the spatial distribution of surface air temperature using the advection-energy balance for air temperature (ADEBAT) model. Two target stations in the study area were selected to conduct an analysis of spatial representativeness. The results showed that one station (AWS 7) had a representable radius of about 400 m with a possible error of less than 1 K, while the other station (AWS 16) had the radius of about 250 m. The representable radius was large when the heterogeneity of land cover around the station was small.

TI  - High-resolution multi-temporal mapping of global urban land using Landsat images based on the Google Earth Engine Platform
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate delineation of global urban land is fundamental to the understanding of global environmental changes. However, most of the contemporary global urban land maps have coarse resolutions and are available for one or two years only. In this study, we developed the multi-temporal global urban land maps based on Landsat images for the 1990-2010 period with a five-year interval ('Urban land' in these maps refers to 'impervious surface', i.e., artificial cover and structures such as pavement, concrete, brick, stone and other man-made impenetrable cover types). We proposed the method of Normalized Urban Areas Composite Index (NUACI) and utilized the Google Earth Engine to facilitate the global urban land classifications from an extensive number of Landsat images. The global level's overall accuracy, producer's accuracy and user's accuracy for our mapping results are 0.81-0.84, 0.50-0.60 and 0.49-0.61, respectively. The Kappa values are 0.43-0.50 at the global level, and similar to 0.33 (in China) and similar to 0.42 (in the U.S.) at the country level. By analyzing the presented dataset, we found that the world's urban land area had increased from 450.97 +/- 1.18 thousand km(2) in 1990 to 747.05 +/- 1.50 thousand km(2) in 2010, reaching a global coverage of 0.63%. China, the United States and India together (14% of the world's terrestrial area in total) contributed almost 43% of the total increase of global urban land area. A free download link for these data is attached at the end of this paper.

TI  - Impact of short-term climate effects and sea ice coverage variation on Japanese scallop aquaculture in Saroma Lake, Japan
T2  - AQUACULTURE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Saroma Lake is the southernmost lagoon exhibiting seasonal sea ice coverage in the Northern hemisphere and one of the most important aquaculture areas for Japanese scallops (Mizuhopecten yessoensis). Under conditions of adequate food and appropriate temperature, scallops grow well from the time of ice melting in April to harvesting starting in July. However, over the past decade, Saroma Lake frequently has not been completely covered by ice in winter, and the production of Japanese scallops has shown significant changes. Therefore, this study integrated data from satellite remote sensing, buoys, and insitu observations with climatic events [the winter East Asian Monsoon (EAM) and El Nino/La Nina-Southern Oscillation events] to investigate the impact of ice coverage variations on scallop growth in Saroma Lake between 2007 and 2015. Daily ice conditions were detected using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer false colour images and an unsupervised classification method. The results indicated that EAM strongly influenced the ice coverage variation in Saroma Lake through their effects on temperature during winter. Ice coverage variations show a strong correlation with water temperature and spring phytoplankton blooms, which are the two most important environmental factors for scallop growth. In addition, extreme climate events could cause water temperature anomalies (as in 2015) which are unfavourable for scallop growth. Monitoring ice conditions should be considered when developing plans and management strategies for scallop aquaculture in Saroma Lake.

TI  - Identifying the relationship between urban land expansion and human activities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt, China
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban land expansion is closely related to and interacts with human activities. Although extensive studies have investigated the characteristics and patterns of urban land expansion, the coupling between urban land expansion and human activities has been neglected. Therefore, this paper explores the relationship between urban land expansion and the scope of human activities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (the YREB) of China during the period of 1995-2015 based on Landsat and nighttime light remote sensing data. Overall, a coupling exists between urban land and the scope of human activities at the scales of the metropolitan area and the urban agglomeration. On the one hand, the degree of match between urban land and the scope of human activities has an upward tendency with time. According to the results of our regression model and landscape indexes, the scope of human activities outside urban land is associated with the magnitude of urban land, and the land within the scope of human activities outside urban land changed more intensely in developed areas. On the other hand, a coupling between newly increased urban land and the scope of human activities was proven by calculating the degree of match and identifying three urban land expansion types based on the location relationship. This paper argues that although the degree of match increased and the dominant type of urban land expansion transformed from outlying to backfilling, the problems of disorderly expansion of urban land and imbalanced development of the spatial distribution and scale structure still exist. The results can be used to formulate reasonable policies and planning and to promote the regional integration and coordinated development of urban land and human activities.

TI  - Land Subsidence in Taiyuan, China, Monitored by InSAR Technique With Multisensor SAR Datasets From 1992 to 2015
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Taiyuan city has been suffering significant subsidence during last two to three decades, mainly due to the effects of groundwater withdrawal and urban construction. The purpose of this study is to map the spatial-temporal variations of land subsidence over Taiyuan and analyze the causes of the observed deformations by using the interferometric point target analysis (IPTA) technique with multisensor SAR datasets during 1992 and 2015. The InSAR-derived deformations are then compared to the leveling measurements and groundwater data. The observed deformation based on ERS-1 datasets has mapped regional subsidence rate ranging from 30 to 60 mm/a in the northern and central Taiyuan from 1992 to 1993. InSAR measurements from Envisat ASAR, TerraSAR-X, and Radarsat-2 data reveal land subsidence rate up to 80 mm/a in the southern suburb during 2009 to 2015, whereas a rebound rate more than 10 mm/a in northern Taiyuan from 2004 to 2005. The time series deformation maps from 2009 to 2010 present slight nonlinear periodic variations, which might be caused by the seasonal groundwater fluctuations. The observed InSAR results indicate that the pattern of ground deformation is nearly concentric around locations of intense groundwater withdrawal, and the spatial extent of the subsiding area has been shrinking and moving toward the central and southern Taiyuan after 2003. Furthermore, differential subsidence rates are identified on both sides of Tianzhuang fault from observed deformation maps during the period of 2009-2010, 2012-2013, and 2014-2015, which could be explained that the fault acts as the barrier to the groundwater flow. Our results could provide significant evidence to serve the decision-making on land subsidence mitigation in Taiyuan, China.

TI  - Psychology and Ruralities: paths for a transforming psychological practice
T2  - PSICOLOGIA CONOCIMIENTO Y SOCIEDAD
M3  - Review
AB  - This article intends to build a series of relevant discussions on the psychologist's role in the rural context. This professional possesses, most of the time, an academic background based on an urban worldview. For that, a literature review was conducted in order to present data on how psychology works with rural populations. In Brazil, the work of CRAS (Social Assistance Reference Center) features among the public policies as the main channel through which psychology arrives in the Brazilian countryside. Reflections were also raised on the necessary knowledge psychology needs, so it can present a critical and relevant practice collectively managing the ways for when inserted in the rural reality. Armed with the assumptions of an eminently urban psychological science, this professional might undertake a mere theoretical transposition. Without proper pondering and being built from our society's historical foundation, psychology may end up being a mere prejudice and blame repeater, thus, maintaining the naturalization state of the social problems. This work illustrates the worldview of the Cultural historical Psychology, making clear the necessity of an ethical commitment and the usage of a proper epistemology to the rural area, one that is capable of seeing the problems in this population's real life, also being capable of social transformation.

TI  - Evolution of the mid-channel bars in the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang (Yangtze) River from 1989 to 2014 based on the Landsat satellite images: impact of the Three Gorges Dam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The mid-channel bars have long been identified as essential landforms in the large rivers of the world, and the significance of connectivity between morphology and flow-sediment dynamics has been intensively emphasized. In this study, remote sensing images and associated hydrological data from 1989 to 2014 were used to explore mid-channel bars evolution in the middle and lower reach of the Changjiang and their responses to the Three Gorges Dam (TGD), the world's largest hydrological engineering. The results indicated that mid-channel bars, respectively, exhibited deposition and erosion in the flood and dry season in pre-TGD period, while mild deposition in flood season and deposition in dry season were found in post-TGD period. As a consequence, mid-channel bars area was characterized by 'remarkable seasonal differences in pre-TGD period, mild seasonal pattern in post-TGD period'. The obvious shift in seasonal features could be attributed to the TGD operation in 2003. Specifically, flood duration decrease and sediment load reduction following TGD regulation suppressed the bars growth in flood season. TGD-induced variations in differences between sediment carry capacity and suspended sediment concentration resulted in the bars transformation in dry season. Meanwhile, the change trends of downstream mid-channel bars became weak as their locations' distance to TGD increases because of the river adjustment and tributaries supplement. Moreover, mid-channel bars in different river patterns presented various change trends with the most remarkable variation being detected in goose-head-shaped river pattern. The results of this paper provide a theoretical basis for the river channel improvement in the middle and lower reaches of the Changjiang River.

TI  - Rainfall Variability, Wetland Persistence, and Water-Carbon Cycle Coupling in the Upper Zambezi River Basin in Southern Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Zambezi River Basin (UZRB) delineates a complex region of topographic, soil and rainfall gradients between the Congo rainforest and the Kalahari Desert. Satellite imagery shows permanent wetlands in low-lying convergence zones where surface-groundwater interactions are vigorous. A dynamic wetland classification based on MODIS Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance is developed to capture the inter-annual and seasonal changes in areal extent due to groundwater redistribution and rainfall variability. Simulations of the coupled water-carbon cycles of seasonal wetlands show nearly double rates of carbon uptake as compared to dry areas, at increasingly lower water-use efficiencies as the dry season progresses. Thus, wetland extent and persistence into the dry season is key to the UZRB's carbon sink and water budget. Whereas groundwater recharge governs the expansion of wetlands in the rainy season under large-scale forcing, wetland persistence in April-June (wet-dry transition months) is tied to daily morning fog and clouds, and by afternoon land-atmosphere interactions (isolated convection). Rainfall suppression in July-September results from colder temperatures, weaker regional circulations, and reduced instability in the lower troposphere, shutting off moisture recycling in the dry season despite high evapotranspiration rates. The co-organization of precipitation and wetlands reflects land-atmosphere interactions that determine wetland seasonal persistence, and the coupled water and carbon cycles.

TI  - Assessment of coastal Strandveld integrity using WorldView-2 imagery in False Bay, South Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone as interface between land and sea faces much pressure from human activities. These pressures make it difficult for the coastal zones to fulfil their natural functions, so threatening the state of coastal environments and making them vulnerable to coastal disasters and degradation. This study aimed to test whether high resolution remote sensing imagery can be used to assess the integrity of coastal Strandveld vegetation at the high spatial resolution required as baseline information for local environmental management. The study focused on the Cape Flats Dune Strandveld vegetation in northern False Bay near Cape Town, South Africa. The approach modifies and adopts a method developed by Liick-Vogel et al. (2013) for a remote sensing derived habitat intactness assessment for the Sandveld region at South Africa's west coast.A regression analysis was performed on the eight spectral bands of two WorldView-2 images and five image derivatives to evaluate the most suitable bands for producing an ecosystem integrity index. Based on the results, only the RED and NIR bands were required to perform a decision tree classification for the integrity classification, which significantly simplifies the application and opens the way for transfer to sensors with similar spectral bands.The overall accuracy of the results was 80.5% with a kappa value of 0.75. This means that this approach provides results accurate enough for coastal management and conservation applications at a local scale. A further finding is the importance of seasonality to delineate natural and alien vegetation accurately. (C) 2018 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Separating snow and forest temperatures with thermal infrared remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared sensing from space is a well-developed field, but mixed pixels pose a problem for many applications. We present a field study in Dana Meadows, Yosemite National Park, California to scale from point (similar to 2-m resolution) to aerial (similar to 5-m resolution gridded, 1 km x 6 km extent) to satellite (MODIS, similar to 1000-m resolution, global extent) observations. We demonstrate how multiple thermal bands on MODIS can be used to separate snow and forest temperatures and determine the fractional snow-covered area (f(scA)) over a 3 km x 3 km array of 9 MODIS grid cells. During the day, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared bands provide a first guess of f(scA) and help to constrain the solution. This technique, which has estimated errors < 2 degrees C and 10% f(scA) for many expected conditions, enables better understanding of the snowpack energy balance, atmospheric inversions and cold air pools, and forest health.

TI  - Auto-Extraction of Linear Archaeological Traces of <i>Tuntian</i> Irrigation Canals in Miran Site (China) from Gaofen-1 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the use of the Chinese Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite imagery to automatically extract tertiary Linear Archaeological Traces of Tuntian Irrigation Canals (LATTICs) located in the Miran site. The site is adjacent to the ancient Loulan Kingdom at the eastern margin of the Taklimakan Desert in western China. GF-1 data were processed following atmospheric and geometric correction, and spectral analyses were carried out for multispectral data. The low values produced by spectral separability index (SSI) indicate that it is difficult to distinguish buried tertiary LATTICs from similar backgrounds using spectral signatures. Thus, based on the textual characteristics of high-resolution GF-1 panchromatic data, this paper proposes an automatic approach that combines joint morphological bottom and hat transformation with a Canny edge operator. The operator was improved by adding stages of geometric filtering and gradient vector direction analysis. Finally, the detected edges of tertiary LATTICs were extracted using the GIS-based draw tool and converted into shapefiles for archaeological mapping within a GIS environment. The proposed automatic approach was verified with an average accuracy of 95.76% for 754 tertiary LATTICs in the entire Miran site and compared with previous manual interpretation results. The results indicate that GF-1 VHR PAN imagery can successfully uncover the ancient tuntian agricultural landscape. Moreover, the proposed method can be generalized and applied to extract linear archaeological traces such as soil and crop marks in other geographic locations.

Stereology is characterized by the description and estimation of properties of objects based on samples of lower dimension than the object, e.g., 2-dimensional slices from 3-dimensional objects, 1-dimensional probes from 3-dimensional or 2-dimensional objects and dimensionless points from higher dimensional objects. The stereological character of many forest inventory methods was historically developed independently of recognition of a relationship with stereology. Strip sampling of forests, common in the late 19th and early 20th century, can be considered as a sterelogical approach if the strip centerline is viewed as a 1-dimensional probe of tree inclusion zones on a land area. The stereological character of plot sampling and Bitterlich sampling becomes evident if one views these methods as samples of 1-dimensional probes for volume within tree inclusion zones, or dimensionless points sampling for basal area in inclusion zones. Traditional methods of estimation of tree stem volume include samples of 2-dimensional cross-sectional area at fixed points along the tree stem to estimate 3-dimensional volume. Though these traditional methods usually use a shape assumption (e.g., parabolic frustum) for short stem segments, we show how a random-systematic start estimator of stem cross-sections can provide a design-unbiased estimate of stem volume without using any stem shape assumptions. Monte Carlo integration estimators of tree volume such as importance sampling that are designed to depend on only a few (usually one or two) tree upper-stem height or cross-sectional samples can also be viewed as stereological methods. Several forest inventory methods such as Matern's individual tree basal area estimator and sector sampling can be viewed as local stereology, in which sample lines or slices pass through a central point. Finally, we suggest potential applications of stereological principles in the emerging big data era characterized by lidar and other remote sensing data and the assemblage of large tree and stand datasets. We suggest a new stem volume estimator which may have potential for future use with terrestrial lidar.

TI  - Remote Sensing Extraction Method of Tailings Ponds in Ultra-Low-Grade Iron Mining Area Based on Spectral Characteristics and Texture Entropy
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of the steel and iron industry, ultra-low-grade iron ore has been developed extensively since the beginning of this century in China. Due to the high concentration ratio of the iron ore, a large amount of tailings was produced and many tailings ponds were established in the mining area. This poses a great threat to regional safety and the environment because of dam breaks and metal pollution. The spatial distribution is the basic information for monitoring the status of tailings ponds. Taking Changhe Mining Area as an example, tailings ponds were extracted by using Landsat 8 OLI images based on both spectral and texture characteristics. Firstly, ultra-low-grade iron-related objects (i.e., tailings and iron ore) were extracted by the Ultra-low-grade Iron-related Objects Index (ULIOI) with a threshold. Secondly, the tailings pond was distinguished from the stope due to their entropy difference in the panchromatic image at a 7 x 7 window size. This remote sensing method could be beneficial to safety and environmental management in the mining area.

TI  - Using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree to Improve the Delineation of Hourly Rain Areas during the Summer from Advanced Himawari Imager Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A new classification scheme based on the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm is developed to improve the accuracy of rain area delineation for daytime, twilight, and nighttime modules using Advanced Himawari Imager on board Himawari-8 (AHI-8) geostationary satellite data and the U.S. Geological Survey digital elevation model data. The GBDT algorithm is able to efficiently manage the nonlinear relationships among high-dimensional data without being affected by overfitting problems. The new delineation module utilizes several features related to the physical variables, including cloud-top heights, cloud-top temperatures, cloud water paths, cloud phases, water vapor, temporal changes, and orographic variations. The scheme procedure is as follows. First, we perform extensive experiments to optimize the module parameters such that the equitable threat score (ETS) reaches its maximum value. Then, the GBDT-based modules are trained and classified with the optimum parameters. Finally, validation datasets are applied to test the true performance of the GBDT-based modules. The agreement between the estimations and observations of the ground-based rain gauges is verified. Results show that the ETS values of the GBDT-based modules are 0.42 for the daytime, 0.30 for the twilight period, and 0.32 for the nighttime. The cloud water path and cloud phase features make the most significant contributions to the modules. Comparisons drawn with the two probability-related methods show that our new scheme presents great advantages in terms of statistical scores on the overall performance.

TI  - An Estimate of the Pixel-Level Connection between Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS DNB) Nighttime Lights and Land Features across China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived nighttime light images are increasingly used for various studies in relation to demographic, socioeconomic and urbanization dynamics because of the salient relationships between anthropogenic lighting signals at night and statistical variables at multiple scales. Owing to a higher spatial resolution and fewer over-glow and saturation effects, the new generation of nighttime light data derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) day/night band (DNB), which is located on board the Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) satellite, is expected to facilitate the performance of nocturnal luminosity-based investigations of human activity in a spatially explicit manner. In spite of the importance of the spatial connection between the VIIRS DNB nighttime light radiance (NTL) and the land surface type at a fine scale, the crucial role of NTL-based investigations of human settlements is not well understood. In this study, we investigated the pixel-level relationship between the VIIRS DNB-derived NTL, a Landsat-derived land-use/land-cover dataset, and the map of point of interest (POI) density over China, especially with respect to the identification of artificial surfaces in urban land. Our estimates suggest that notable differences in the NTL between urban (man-made) surfaces and other types of land surfaces likely allow us to spatially identify most of the urban pixels with relatively high radiance values in VIIRS DNB images. Our results also suggest that current nighttime light data have a limited capability for detecting rural residential areas and explaining pixel-level variations in the POI density at a large scale. Moreover, the impact of non-man-made surfaces on the partitioned results appears inevitable because of the spatial heterogeneity of human settlements and the nature of remotely sensed nighttime light data. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve-based analysis, we obtained optimal thresholds of the nighttime light radiance, by equally weighting the sensitivity and specificity of the identification results, for extracting the nationwide distribution of lighted urban man-made pixels from the 2015 annual composite of VIIRS DNB data. Our findings can provide the basic knowledge needed for the further application of current nighttime light data to investigate spatiotemporal patterns in human settlements.

TI  - The study of thermal pattern changes using Landsat-derived land surface temperature in the central part of Isfahan province
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban development and consequently, the growth of construction can result in changing the climatic parameters, such as land surface temperature (LST). This study was conducted in the central part of Isfahan province to investigate changes in thermal patterns during 1985-2015 time period. To generate land-use/land-cover maps and LST, Landsat-TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS data were utilized. The results demonstrated that impervious surfaces had been increased by 2.8 times from 1985 to 2015. The results also indicated a negative correlation between LST and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in hot months. This research also focused on exploring the occurrence of surface urban heat island (SUHI) in hot and cold months in the city of Isfahan. Buffer zones in various widths were created to measure SUHI. In August 1985, in buffers of 1 km-3 km and in July 1992, in all buffers, SUHI was observed. In contrast, in July 2001, in buffers of 3 km-10 km and in July 2015, in all buffers, LST of Isfahan rural area was higher than that of city, showing surface urban cool island (SUCI). The results also demonstrated that the urban area was cooler than the surrounding rural area in the cold months.

AB  - Since his entry as a member of the Institut fur Sozialforschung's work team, Herbert Marcuse begins to develop a materialist theory of society far from his youth Heideggerianism. During the period between 1933 and 1936, the Berlin author writes several essays where he criticizes German existential philosophy's political drift. In these essays, Marcuse confronts Lebensphilosophie and phenomenology's vulgarized versions - headed by Heidegger-which provided a kind of philosophic foundation to the heroic realism's "worldview" (Weltanschauung) and to the totalitarian State's socio-economic policies.

M3  - Article
AB  - Present article is the study of various products of satellite data of the Enderby Basin, thereby correlated to known plate tectonic features, volcanic traces and continental margin features. Timing for breakup of the Indian continent from eastern Gondwanaland and evolution of the lithosphere in the Bay of Bengal are still remained as ambiguous issues. Geoid and free air gravity data of the conjugate regions, Bay of Bengal and Enderby Basin, are coupled with ship-borne geophysical data for investigation of early evolution of the eastern Indian Ocean. The geoid and gravity data over the western Enderby Basin reveal a major Kerguelen Fracture Zone (FZ) and five N4 degrees E FZs. Spectral analyses of free-air gravity anomaly over a part of the Enderby Basin near Conrad Rise indicate that the sources of those anomalies varies between 100-400 km The results obtained from these analyses may help in further exploration in these conjugate basins.

TI  - Derivation of vegetation density and land-use type pattern in mountain regions of Jordan using multi-seasonal SPOT images
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The mountainous region represents the most important agricultural and biodiversity haven in Jordan. The objective of this study is to characterize the seasonal pattern of land use and vegetation using multi-temporal SPOT images. Multi-temporal SPOT images were analyzed to characterize the land use and cropping pattern in the mountain regions of Jordan. The images were radiometrically corrected using invariant objects located on the image, and a linear inter-calibration method was used to calibrate the other images. A hybrid classification approach was used in the classification; the spectral signatures of the land-use classes were derived in an iterative procedure using the ISODATA and field survey data. Then, the maximum likelihood classification was applied on all images to classify the class signatures into thematic land-use types. The hybrid classification approach gives more accurate classification accuracy especially for the multi-seasonal image classification. The overall accuracy of the multi-temporal data set was achieved with 87.9%, while classification accuracy for single-date classifications were 61.3, 76.8, 72.2, and 65.5 for months of October, February, April, and June, respectively. In addition, the scene combinations that were derived from February and April were classified the land-use types almost as well as those combinations including more scenes. Regarding the classification details, the multi-temporal images enable higher level of classification for land-use types such as Anderson level 2, and produce accurate boundaries for the different cropping and farming systems.

TI  - Bridging Thermal Infrared Sensing and Physically-Based Evapotranspiration Modeling: From Theoretical Implementation to Validation Across an Aridity Gradient in Australian Ecosystems
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared sensing of evapotranspiration (E) through surface energy balance (SEB) models is challenging due to uncertainties in determining the aerodynamic conductance (g(A)) and due to inequalities between radiometric (T-R) and aerodynamic temperatures (T-0). We evaluated a novel analytical model, the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC1.2), that physically integrates T-R observations into a combined Penman-Monteith Shuttleworth-Wallace (PM-SW) framework for directly estimating E, and overcoming the uncertainties associated with T0 and gA determination. An evaluation of STIC1.2 against high temporal frequency SEB flux measurements across an aridity gradient in Australia revealed a systematic error of 10-52% in E from mesic to arid ecosystem, and low systematic error in sensible heat fluxes (H) (12-25%) in all ecosystems. Uncertainty in TR versus moisture availability relationship, stationarity assumption in surface emissivity, and SEB closure corrections in E were predominantly responsible for systematic E errors in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. A discrete correlation (r) of the model errors with observed soil moisture variance (r = 0.33-0.43), evaporative index (r = 0.77-0.90), and climatological dryness (r = 0.60-0.77) explained a strong association between ecohydrological extremes and T-R in determining the error structure of STIC1.2 predicted fluxes. Being independent of any leaf-scale biophysical parameterization, the model might be an important value addition in working group (WG2) of the Australian Energy and Water Exchange (OzEWEX) research initiative which focuses on observations to evaluate and compare biophysical models of energy and water cycle components.Plain Language Summary Evapotranspiration modeling and mapping in arid and semi-arid ecosystems are uncertain due to empirical approximation of surface and atmospheric conductances. Here we demonstrate the performance of a fully analytical model which is independent of any leaf-scale empirical parameterization of the conductances and can be potentially used for continental scale mapping of ecosystem water use as well as water stress using thermal remote sensing satellite data.d

TI  - Snow cover and snow-albedo changes in the central Andes of Chile and Argentina from daily MODIS observations (2000-2016)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The variables of snow cover extent (SCE), snow cover duration (SCD), and snow albedo (SAL) are primary factors determining the surface energy balance and hydrological response of the cryosphere, influencing snow pack and glacier mass-balance, melt, and runoff conditions. This study examines spatiotemporal patterns and trends in SCE, SCD, and SAL (2000-2016; 16 years) for central Chilean and Argentinean Andes using the MODIS MOD10A1 C6 daily snow product. Observed changes in these variables are analyzed in relation to climatic variability by using ground truth observations (meteorological data from the El Yeso Embalse and Valle Nevado weather stations) and the Multivariate El Nino index (MEI) data. We identified significant downward trends in both SCE and SAL, especially during the onset and offset of snow seasons. SCE and SAL showed high inter-annual variability which correlate significantly with MEI applied with a one-month time-lag. SCE and SCD decreased by an average of similar to 13 +/- 2% and 43 +/- 20 days respectively, over the study period. Analysis of spatial pattern of SCE indicates a slightly greater reduction on the eastern side (similar to 14 +/- 2%) of the Andes Cordillera compared to the western side (similar to 12 +/- 3%). The downward SCE, SAL, and SCD trends identified in this study are likely to have adverse impacts on downstream water resource availability to agricultural and densely populated regions in central Chile and Argentina.

TI  - Monitoring Surface Deformation over a Failing Rock Slope with the ESA Sentinels: Insights from Moosfluh Instability, Swiss Alps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We leverage on optical and radar remote sensing data acquired from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinels to monitor the surface deformation evolution on a large and very active instability located in the Swiss Alps, i.e., the Moosfluh rock slope. In the late summer 2016, a sudden acceleration was reported at this location, with surface velocity rates passing from maximum values of 0.2 cm/day to 80 cm/day. A dense pattern of uphill-facing scarps and tension cracks formed within the instability and rock fall activity started to become very pronounced. This evolution of the rock mass may suggest that the most active portion of the slope could fail catastrophically. Here we discuss advantages and limitations of the use of spaceborne methods for hazard analyses and early warning by using the ESA Sentinels, and show that in critical scenarios they are often not sufficient to reliably interpret the evolution of surface deformation. The insights obtained from this case study are relevant for similar scenarios in the Alps and elsewhere.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, a segment of military-geographic analyses (visibility and range) for the position of Kriz Hill in the context of the liberation of occupied parts of the Zadar area during the Homeland War (Croatian War of Independence) was carried out. Special emphasis has been put on tactical task "Jaguar", which involved the liberation of the Hill from the aggressor's (Serbian) forces on 2 February 1992.The digital elevation model EU-DEM (Digital Elevation Model over Europe) served as the basis for performing spatial analyses. The work methodology is based on the implementation of the ArcGIS for Desktop, Military Analyst extension, which created visibility models from Kriz Hill and St Martin Hill. 3D range domes of weapons available to the enemy were created through visualisation of modern operative preparation methods by implementing the Range Dome tool within the ArcGlobe extension. The landscape was reconstructed by implementing visual techniques based on data exported using the method of controlled classification of multispectral LANDSAT records from August 1992. The specificity of the position, its geomorphologic characteristics, and the appearance of the wider area of the Kriz Hill in that period, alongside performed visibility analyses, confirms the tactical importance of that location for the Zadar area. By liberating the Hill, several key goals that contributed to the stabilisation of life in the wider Zadar area were accomplished.Use of GIS methods enabled the performing of geospatial analyses and visualisation of this significant tactical task in the context of the liberation of occupied areas of Croatia, which can increase our understanding of the importance of the mentioned tactical task.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the reproducibility of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique in male breast cancer.Material and methods: We retrospectively analysed 21 male patients diagnosed with breast cancer in our hospital from 2008 to 2016 with, at least, 18 months follow-up. Fifteen patients underwent selective sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following the usual protocols with peritumoral injection of 18.5-111 MBq of Tc-99m-nanocoloides and acquisition of planar images 2 hours after the injection. In 2 cases it was necessary to perform a SPECT/CT to locate the SLN. Immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques (OSNA) were used for their analysis. Six patients did not undergo SLNB because they had pathological nodes or distant disease at the time of diagnosis.Results: SLNB was performed in 15 patients. The SLN was negative in 6 patients and positive in the remaining 9. Three patients with positive SLNB did not need axillary lymphadenectomy because of the low number of copies by molecular analysis OSNA. Axillary lymphadenectomy was performed in the remaining 6 patients with the result of 4 positive axillary lymphadenectomies and 2 that did not show further extension of the disease.Conclusions: According to our experience, SLNB in males is a reproducible, useful, safe and reliable technique which avoids unnecessary axillary lymphadenectomy and prevents the appearance of undesirable effects.

TI  - Multisatellite Multisensor Observations of a Sub-Plinian Volcanic Eruption: The 2015 Calbuco Explosive Event in Chile
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A-train satellite data, acquired during the Calbuco volcano (Chile) sub-Plinian eruption in April 2015, are discussed to explore the complementarity of spaceborne observations in the microwave (MW), thermal infrared (TIR), and visible wavelengths for both near-source plume and distal ash clouds. The analysis shows that TIR-based detection techniques are not suitable near the volcanic vent where rising convective columns are associated with large optical depths. Detection and parametric estimates of near-source tephra mass loading and plume height from MW radiometric data, available 69 min after the eruption onset, are proposed. Results indicate a maximum plume altitude of about 21 km above the sea level and an ash mass of 3.65 x 10(10) kg, in agreement with mass values obtained from empirical formulas, but less than proximal- distal mass deposit of 1.86 x 10(11) kg. This discrepancy may be explained by extrapolating Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder-based estimates to 6 h, thus obtaining a total mass of about 1.90 x 10(11) kg. Distal volcanic cloud retrievals are derived from TIR imagery and results show a good agreement between Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) retrievals of total mass taking into account the overpass time shift. If only the overlapping pixels between MODIS and VIIRS are considered, the respective estimates are 1.90 x 10(9) kg and 1.80 x 10(9) kg. TIR radiometric estimates of distal ash cloud height and mass loadings are also compared with Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations lidar retrievals. For low-to-medium optically thick ash cloud, average Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization-derived mass loading is about 0.8 g/m(2) against 0.4 g/m(2) from VIIRS and 1.4 g/m(2) from MODIS.

TI  - Large-area mapping of Canadian boreal forest cover, height, biomass and other structural attributes using Landsat composites and lidar plots
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive optical remotely sensed images such as those from the Landsat satellites enable the development of spatially comprehensive, well-calibrated reflectance measures that support large-area mapping. In recent years, as an alternative to field plot data, the use of Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) acquisitions for calibration and validation purposes in combination with such satellite reflectance data to model a range of forest structural response variables has become well established. In this research, we use a predictive modeling approach to map forest structural attributes over the similar to 552 million ha boreal forest of Canada. For model calibration and independent validation we utilize airborne lidar-derived measurements of forest vertical structure (known as lidar plots) obtained in 2010 via a > 25,000 km transect-based national survey. Models were developed linking the lidar plot structural variables to wall-to-wall 30-m spatial resolution surface reflectance composites derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus imagery. Spectral indices extracted from the composites, disturbance information (years since disturbance and type), as well as geographic position and topographic variables (i.e., elevation, slope, radiation, etc.) were considered as predictor variables. A nearest neighbor imputation approach based on the Random Forest framework was used to predict a total of 10 forest structural attributes. The model was developed and validated on > 80,000 lidar plots, with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables such as canopy cover, stand height, basal area, stem volume, and aboveground biomass. Additionally, a predictor variable importance analysis confirmed that spectral indices, elevation, and geographic coordinates were key sources of information, ultimately offering an improved understanding of the driving variables for large-area forest structure modeling. This study demonstrates the integration of airborne lidar and Landsat-derived reflectance products to generate detailed and spatially extensive maps of forest structure. The methods are portable to map other attributes of interest (based upon calibration data) through access to Landsat or other appropriate optical remotely-sensed data sources, thereby offering unique opportunities for science, monitoring, and reporting programs.

TI  - Identification of tumor-reactive B cells and systemic IgG in breast cancer based on clonal frequency in the sentinel lymph node
T2  - CANCER IMMUNOLOGY IMMUNOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - A better understanding of antitumor immune responses is the key to advancing the field of cancer immunotherapy. Endogenous immunity in cancer patients, such as circulating anticancer antibodies or tumor-reactive B cells, has been historically yet incompletely described. Here, we demonstrate that tumor-draining (sentinel) lymph node (SN) is a rich source for tumor-reactive B cells that give rise to systemic IgG anticancer antibodies circulating in the bloodstream of breast cancer patients. Using a synergistic combination of high-throughput B-cell sequencing and quantitative immunoproteomics, we describe the prospective identification of tumor-reactive SN B cells (based on clonal frequency) and also demonstrate an unequivocal link between affinity-matured expanded B-cell clones in the SN and antitumor IgG in the blood. This technology could facilitate the discovery of antitumor antibody therapeutics and conceivably identify novel tumor antigens. Lastly, these findings highlight the unique and specialized niche the SN can fill in the advancement of cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Composition and Structure of Forest Fire Refugia: What Are the Ecosystem Legacies across Burned Landscapes?
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Locations within forest fires that remain unburned or burn at low severityknown as fire refugiaare important components of contemporary burn mosaics, but their composition and structure at regional scales are poorly understood. Focusing on recent, large wildfires across the US Pacific Northwest (Oregon and Washington), our research objectives are to (1) classify fire refugia and burn severity based on relativized spectral change in Landsat time series; (2) quantify the pre-fire composition and structure of mapped fire refugia; (3) in forested areas, assess the relative abundance of fire refugia and other burn severity classes across forest composition and structure types. We analyzed a random sample of 99 recent fires in forest-dominated landscapes from 2004 to 2015 that collectively encompassed 612,629 ha. Across the region, fire refugia extent was substantial but variable from year to year, with an annual mean of 38% of fire extent and range of 15-60%. Overall, 85% of total fire extent was forested, with the other 15% being non-forest. In comparison, 31% of fire refugia extent was non-forest prior to the most recent fire, highlighting that mapped refugia do not necessarily contain tree-based ecosystem legacies. The most prevalent non-forest cover types in refugia were vegetated: shrub (40%), herbaceous (33%), and crops (18%). In forested areas, the relative abundance of fire refugia varied widely among pre-fire forest types (20-70%) and structural conditions (23-55%). Consistent with fire regime theory, fire refugia and high burn severity areas were inversely proportional. Our findings underscore that researchers, managers, and other stakeholders should interpret burn severity maps through the lens of pre-fire land cover, especially given the increasing importance of fire and fire refugia under global change.

TI  - Improving Streamflow Prediction Using Uncertainty Analysis and Bayesian Model Averaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological modeling has been used worldwide as an important tool to evaluate the consequences of land cover and land use change on hydrological processes. However, the lack of spatial-temporal rainfall and runoff data have compromised the reliability of the results in several regions of Brazil. In this study, the authors investigated the use of uncertainty analysis and Bayesian model averaging (BMA) as a tool for improving streamflow estimates in the RibeirAo da Onca Basin (ROB), located in southeastern Brazil. They used a set of two precipitation data sources (ground and remote sensing data) and different spatial interpolation schemes as input data for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, resulting in five model configurations. These models were submitted to automatic calibration and uncertainty analysis through the sequential uncertainty fitting ver-2 (SUFI-2) method. Then, the BMA method was used to merge those different model configuration results into a single probabilistic prediction, thereafter compared among themselves. An analysis of the accuracy and precision of all simulations produced by the precipitation ensemble members against the BMA simulation supports the use of the latter as a suitable framework for streamflow simulations at the ROB. Furthermore, the approaches evaluated in this study may be used to improve streamflow predictions in ungauged or data-scarce basins. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.

TI  - Global Analysis of Burned Area Persistence Time with MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning causes a non-permanent land cover change (burned area) through the removal of vegetation, the deposition of charcoal and ashes, and the exposure of soil; the temporal persistence of these changes is highly variable, ranging from a few weeks in savannas to years in forests. Algorithms for the generation of moderate-resolution (10-30 m) continental and global burned area maps have been prototyped in an effort to meet the needs of diverse users of fire information. Nevertheless, moderate-resolution sensors have reduced the temporal resolution (e.g., to 16 days for Landsat), which could potentially lead to omission errors, especially in ecosystems where the spectral signal associated with burning disappears quickly and cloud cover limits the number of valid observations. This study presents a global analysis of the burned area persistence time, defined as the duration of the spectral separability of the burned/unburned areas mapped by the MODIS MCD64 Global Burned Area Product. The separability was computed by analyzing time series of normalized burn ratio (NBR) from nadir BRDF-adjusted MODIS reflectances (MCD43 product). Results showed that, globally, the median burned area persistence time was estimated at 29 days, and 86.6% of the global area, as detected by MODIS, can only be detected accurately for up to 48 days. Thus, results indicate that burned area persistence time can be a limiting factor for global burned area mapping from moderate-resolution satellite sensors, which have a low temporal resolution (e.g., Landsat 16 days, Sentinel-2A/B 5 days).

TI  - Unveiling 25 Years of Planetary Urbanization with Remote Sensing: Perspectives from the Global Human Settlement Layer
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last few decades the magnitude and impacts of planetary urban transformations have become increasingly evident to scientists and policymakers. The ability to understand these processes remained limited in terms of territorial scope and comparative capacity for a long time: data availability and harmonization were among the main constraints. Contemporary technological assets, such as remote sensing and machine learning, allow for analyzing global changes in the settlement process with unprecedented detail. The Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) project set out to produce detailed datasets to analyze and monitor the spatial footprint of human settlements and their population, which are key indicators for the global policy commitments of the 2030 Development Agenda. In the GHSL, Earth Observation plays a key role in the detection of built-up areas from the Landsat imagery upon which population distribution is modelled. The combination of remote sensing imagery and population modelling allows for generating globally consistent and detailed information about the spatial distribution of built-up areas and population. The GHSL data facilitate a multi-temporal analysis of human settlements with global coverage. The results presented in this article focus on the patterns of development of built-up areas, population and settlements. The article reports about the present status of global urbanization (2015) and its evolution since 1990 by applying to the GHSL the Degree of Urbanisation definition of the European Commission Directorate General for Regional and Urban Policy (DG-Regio) and the Statistical Office of the European Communities (EUROSTAT). The analysis portrays urbanization dynamics at a regional level and per country income classes to show disparities and inequalities. This study analyzes how the 6.1 billion urban dwellers are distributed worldwide. Results show the degree of global urbanization (which reached 85% in 2015), the more than 100 countries in which urbanization has increased between 1990 and 2015, and the tens of countries in which urbanization is today above the global average and where urbanization grows the fastest. The paper sheds light on the key role of urban areas for development, on the patterns of urban development across the regions of the world and on the role of a new generation of data to advance urbanization theory and reporting.

TI  - Automated method for measuring the extent of selective logging damage with airborne LiDAR data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Selective logging has an impact on the global carbon cycle, as well as on the forest micro-climate, and longer-term changes in erosion, soil and nutrient cycling, and fire susceptibility. Our ability to quantify these impacts is dependent on methods and tools that accurately identify the extent and features of logging activity. LiDAR-based measurements of these features offers significant promise. Here, we present a set of algorithms for automated detection and mapping of critical features associated with logging roads/decks, skid trails, and gaps- using commercial airborne LiDAR data as input. The automated algorithm was applied to commercial LiDAR data collected over two logging concessions in Kalimantan, Indonesia in 2014. The algorithm results were compared to measurements of the logging features collected in the field soon after logging was complete. The automated algorithm-mapped road deck and skid trail features match closely with features measured in the field, with agreement levels ranging from 69% to 99% when adjusting for GPS location error. The algorithm performed most poorly with gaps, which, by their nature, are variable due to the unpredictable impact of tree fall versus the linear and regular features directly created by mechanical means. Overall, the automated algorithm performs well and offers significant promise as a generalizable tool useful to efficiently and accurately capture the effects of selective logging, including the potential to distinguish reduced impact logging from conventional logging.

CL  - Havana, CUBA
AB  - Increased frequency and length of high heat episodes are leading to more cardiovascular issues and asthmatic responses among the population of San Juan, the capital of the island of Puerto Rico, USA. An urban heat island effect, which leads to foci of higher temperatures in some urban areas, can raise heat-related mortality. The objective of this research is to map the risk of high temperature in particular locations by creating heat maps of the city of San Juan. The heat vulnerability index (HVI) maps were developed using images collected by satellite-based remote sensing combined with census data. Land surface temperature was assessed using images from the Thermal Infrared Sensor flown on Landsat 8. Social determinants (e.g., age, unemployment, education and social isolation, and health insurance coverage) were analyzed by census tract. The data were examined in the context of land cover maps generated using products from the Puerto Rico Terrestrial Gap Analysis Project (USDA Forest Service). All variables were set in order to transform the indicators expressed in different units into indices between 0 and 1, and the HVI was calculated as sum of score. The tract with highest index was considered to be the most vulnerable and the lowest to be the least vulnerable. Five vulnerability classes were mapped (very high, high, moderate, low, and very low). The hottest and the most vulnerable tracts corresponded to highly built areas, including the Luis Munoz International Airport, seaports, parking lots, and high-density residential areas. Several variables contributed to increased vulnerability, including higher rates of the population living alone, disabilities, advanced age, and lack of health insurance coverage. Coolest areas corresponded to vegetated landscapes and urban water bodies. The urban HVI map will be useful to health officers, emergency preparedness personnel, the National Weather Service, and San Juan residents, as it helps to prepare for and to mitigate the potential effects of heat-related illnesses.

TI  - The safety and feasibility of minimally invasive sentinel lymph node staging using indocyanine green in the management of endometrial cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to report on the feasibility of laparoscopic sentinel lymph node (SLN) staging using indocyanine green (ICG) in the management of endometrial cancer.Study design: We retrospectively evaluated the charts of presumed, clinical stage I endometrial cancer patients who underwent robotic-assisted surgery that incorporated mapping with ICG and SLN dissection from January 2016 until February 2017. Patient demographics, operative characteristics (e.g., complications, lymph node counts) and pathology data were evaluated.Results: There were 87 patients who were included in the study. A total of 370 lymph nodes were removed, of which 245 were SLNs; unilateral and bilateral mapping of the SLNs was achieved in 84 (96.5%) and 71 (81.6%) of subjects, respectively. There were 10 (11.5%) patients who had metastatic disease identified within 22(5.9%) of the total (n = 370) lymph nodes extracted, 19 (7.7%) of which were sentinel lymph nodes. We did not observe any intraoperative complications.Conclusion: The results from our study suggest that minimally invasive SLN staging using ICG is a feasible procedure that is potentially effective at detecting metastases, which may ultimately attenuate the incidence of surgical morbidity.

TI  - Impacts of synoptic condition and planetary boundary layer structure on the trans-boundary aerosol transport from Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to northeast China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The northeastern China frequently experiences severe aerosol pollution in winter under unfavorable meteorological conditions. How and to what extent the meteorological factors affect the air quality there are not yet clearly understood. Thus, this study investigated the impacts of synoptic patterns on the aerosol transport and planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure in Shenyang from 1 to 3 December 2016, using surface observations, sounding measurements, satellite data, and three-dimensional simulations. Results showed that the aerosol pollution occurred in Shenyang was not only related to the local emissions, but also contributed by transboundary transport of aerosols from the Beiijng-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region. In the presence of the westerly and southwesterly synoptic winds, the aerosols emitted from BTH could be brought to Shenyang. From December 2 to 3, the aerosols emitted from BTH accounted for similar to 20% of near-surface PM2.5 in Shenyang. In addition, the large-scale synoptic forcings could affect the vertical mixing of pollutants through modulating the PBL structure in Shenyang. The westerly and southwesterly synoptic winds not only brought the aerosols but also the warmer air masses from the southwest regions to Shenyang. The strong warm advections above PBL could enhance the already existing thermal inversion layers capping over PBL in Shenyang, leading to the suppressions of PBL. Both the trans-boundary transport of aerosols and the suppressions of PBL caused by the large-scale synoptic forcings should be partly responsible for the poor air quality in Shenyang, in addition to the high pollutant emissions. The present study revealed the physical mechanisms underlying the aerosol pollution in Shenyang, which has important implications for better forecasting and controlling the aerosols pollution.

TI  - Summertime Aerosol Radiative Effects and Their Dependence on Temperature over the Southeastern USA
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data suggest that summertime aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the southeastern USA depends on the air/land surface temperature, but the magnitude of the radiative effects caused by this dependence remains unclear. To quantify these radiative effects, we utilized several remote sensing datasets and ECMWF reanalysis data for the years 2005-2011. In addition, the global aerosol-climate model ECHAM-HAMMOZ was used to identify the possible processes affecting aerosol loads and their dependence on temperature over the studied region. The satellite-based observations suggest that changes in the total summertime AOD in the southeastern USA are mainly governed by changes in anthropogenic emissions. In addition, summertime AOD exhibits a dependence on southerly wind speed and land surface temperature (LST). Transport of sea salt and Saharan dust is the likely reason for the wind speed dependence, whereas the temperature-dependent component is linked to temperature-induced changes in the emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) over forested regions. The remote sensing datasets indicate that the biogenic contribution increases AOD with increasing temperature by approximately (7 +/- 6) x 10(-3) K-1 over the southeastern USA. In the model simulations, the increase in summertime AOD due to temperature-enhanced BVOC emissions is of a similar magnitude, i.e., (4 +/- 1) x 10(-3) K-1. The largest source of BVOC emissions in this region is broadleaf trees, thus if the observed temperature dependence of AOD is caused by biogenic emissions the dependence should be the largest in the vicinity of forests. Consequently, the analysis of the remote sensing data shows that over mixed forests the biogenic contribution increases AOD by approximately (27 +/- 13) x 10(-3) K-1, which is over four times higher than the value for over the whole domain, while over other land cover types in the study region (woody savannas and cropland/natural mosaic) there is no clear temperature dependence. The corresponding clear-sky direct radiative effect (DRE) of the observation-based biogenic AOD is -0.33 +/- 0.29 W/m(2)/K for the whole domain and -1.3 +/- 0.7 W/m(2)/K over mixed forests only. The model estimate of the regional clear-sky DRE for biogenic aerosols is similar to the observational estimate for the whole domain: -0.29 +/- 0.09 W/m(2)/K. Furthermore, the model simulations showed that biogenic emissions have a significant effective radiative forcing (ERF) in this region: -1.0 +/- 0.5 W/m(2)/K.

TI  - Anatomical localization and clinical impact of sentinel lymph nodes based on patterns of pelvic lymphatic drainage in clinically localized prostate cancer
T2  - PROSTATE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAlthough sentinel lymph node in prostate has been generating renewed interest, its significance remains controversial due to inadequate evidence.MethodsWe reviewed a prospective cohort of 50 consecutive patients with intermediate- to high-risk localized prostate cancer who had undergone laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. Sentinel lymph node biopsy by fluorescence detection using intraoperative imaging with indocyanine green and backup extended pelvic lymph node dissection were conducted prior to prostatectomy. Intraoperative and pathological findings were elaborated and compared for confirmation.ResultsSentinel lymph nodes were successfully identified in 47 patients (94%). A median of four sentinel lymph nodes was detected per patient. Lymph node metastasis was confirmed in six patients (12%), all of whom had positive sentinel lymph nodes. Three typical pathways of lymphatic drainage related to sentinel lymph nodes from the prostate were recognized. Ninety-one percent of the positive sentinel lymph nodes (10/11) were located at two predominant sites along these characteristic lymphatic pathways. One site was the junctional nodes, located at the junction between internal and external iliac vessels. The other was the distal internal iliac nodes, located along the inferior vesical artery.ConclusionsOver 90% of positive sentinel lymph nodes were identified at two predominant sites. Priority should be given to the removal of these sentinel lymph nodes, which are located closer to the prostate, in pelvic lymph node dissection. Particular attention should be paid to identifying these nodes to reduce the possibility of overlooking lymph node metastasis.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - Recently emergence of cold water from coastal upwelling has caused frequent damages to the coastal aquaculture along the southeast coast of Korea. So, the necessity of early forecasting of cold water using satellite data has emerged. Coastal upwelling generally detected by meteorological satellites of sea surface temperature (SST) data. However, this study tries to seek a possibility of use of ocean color satellite data to find the cold water, by Chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) concentration of upwelled cold water. The concentration of CDOM will change if coastal upwelling occurs. That could be observed through the ocean color sensor. 2017 summer, SST and CDOM concentrations in the in-situ and satellite data were matched up, when coastal upwelling occurred. As a result, SST and CDOM were correlated positively in coastal area, meanwhile negative correlation was found in off shore. When upwelling occurs, it is considered that high concentration of CDOM on the coast and subsurface flow to the off shore along with cold middle water, and then relatively low CDOM is supplied.

TI  - Analysis of the landscape complexity and heterogeneity of the Pantanal wetland
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This is the first report on analysis of habitat complexity and heterogeneity of the Pantanal wetland. The Pantanal encompasses a peculiar mosaic of environments, being important to evaluate and monitor this area concerning conservation of biodiversity. Our objective was to indirectly measure the habitat complexity and heterogeneity of the mosaic forming the sub-regions of the Pantanal, by means of remote sensing. We obtained free images of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVT) from the sensor MODIS and calculated the mean value (complexity) and standard deviation (heterogeneity) for each sub-region in the years 2000, 2008 and 2015. The sub-regions of Pocone, Canoeira, Paraguai and Aquidauana presented the highest values of complexity (mean NDVT). between 0.69 and 0.64 in the evaluated years. The highest horizontal heterogeneity (NDVT standard deviation) was observed in the sub-region of Tuiuiu, with values of 0.19 in the years 2000 and 2015, and 0.21 in the year 2008. We concluded that the use of NDVI to estimate landscape parameters is an efficient tool for assessment and monitoring of the complexity and heterogeneity of the Pantanal habitats, applicable in other regions.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present work a hybrid approach is implemented to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) from ocean colour monitor sensor on board Oceansat-2. The retrieved AOD (490 nm) has been validated with the ground observed AOD (500 nm) made at different locations of the study area for different months observed by AERONET sites and hand held sun photometer. The Oceasat 2 retrieved AOD (490 nm) is also compared with the MODIS retrieved AOD (470 nm). It is observed that Oceansat 2 retrieved AOD is in good agreement with ground observed AOD with a significant correlation of 0.839 and with a RMSE value of 0.273. The comparison between Oceansat 2 retrieved AOD and MODIS retried AOD are also found to be encouraging with a correlation coefficient of 0.852 with RMSE 0.1243.

AB  - The given article analyzes the linguistic and linguocultural features of the Avar gender paroemiological units with the concept "poverty". The significance of the problem is that the Avar paroemiological units with the concept "poverty" have not been studied before. Besides, proverbs and sayings oriented on a human, are an interesting case not only for linguistics, but for the research of the Avar language worldview and emotional associations of these paroemiological units.Thus, it is analysed the linguistic (lexico-semantic, morphological, lexico-syntactical) features of the characterized proverbs and their linguocultural characteristics connected with different culture codes. The majority of the characterized paroemiological units with the concept "poverty" expresses the negative connotations of national and cultural character.The article describes different cases of metaphors, cultural codes, national and cultural components of paroemiological units characterizing poor and lazy man. The role of language symbols is determined, which are the cultural signs of the language, and also evaluative connotations showing the particular features of mindset of the Avar language speakers.

TI  - Influence of the Subtropical High and Storm Track on Low-Cloud Fraction and Its Seasonality over the South Indian Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The south Indian Ocean is characterized by enhanced midlatitude storm-track activity around a prominent sea surface temperature (SST) front and unique seasonality of the surface subtropical Mascarene high. The present study investigates the climatological distribution of low-cloud fraction (LCF) and its seasonality by using satellite data, in order to elucidate the role of the storm-track activity and subtropical high. On the equatorward flank of the SST front, summertime LCF is locally maximized despite small estimated inversion strength (EIS) and high SST. This is attributable to locally augmented sensible heat flux (SHF) from the ocean under the enhanced storm-track activity, which gives rise to strong instantaneous wind speed while acting to relax the meridional gradient of surface air temperature. In the subtropics, summertime LCF is maximized off the west coast of Australia, while wintertime LCF is distributed more zonally across the basin unlike in other subtropical ocean basins. Although its zonally extended distribution is correspondent with that of LCF, EIS alone cannot explain the wintertime LCF enhancement, which precedes the EIS maximum under continuous lowering of SST and enhanced SHF in winter. Basinwide cold advection associated with the wintertime westward shift of the subtropical high contributes to the enhancement of SHF, especially around 15 degrees-25 degrees S, while seasonally enhanced storm-track activity augments SHF around 30 degrees S. The analysis highlights the significance of large-scale controls, particularly through SHF, on the seasonality of the climatological LCF distribution over the south Indian Ocean, which reflect the seasonality of the Mascarene high and storm-track activity.

TI  - Assessment of Machine Learning Algorithms for Automatic Benthic Cover Monitoring and Mapping Using Towed Underwater Video Camera and High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Benthic habitat monitoring is essential for many applications involving biodiversity, marine resource management, and the estimation of variations over temporal and spatial scales. Nevertheless, both automatic and semi-automatic analytical methods for deriving ecologically significant information from towed camera images are still limited. This study proposes a methodology that enables a high-resolution towed camera with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) to adaptively monitor and map benthic habitats. First, the towed camera finishes a pre-programmed initial survey to collect benthic habitat videos, which can then be converted to geo-located benthic habitat images. Second, an expert labels a number of benthic habitat images to class habitats manually. Third, attributes for categorizing these images are extracted automatically using the Bag of Features (BOF) algorithm. Fourth, benthic cover categories are detected automatically using Weighted Majority Voting (WMV) ensembles for Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN), and Bagging (BAG) classifiers. Fifth, WMV-trained ensembles can be used for categorizing more benthic cover images automatically. Finally, correctly categorized geo-located images can provide ground truth samples for benthic cover mapping using high-resolution satellite imagery. The proposed methodology was tested over Shiraho, Ishigaki Island, Japan, a heterogeneous coastal area. The WMV ensemble exhibited 89% overall accuracy for categorizing corals, sediments, seagrass, and algae species. Furthermore, the same WMV ensemble produced a benthic cover map using a Quickbird satellite image with 92.7% overall accuracy.

AB  - Geodetic stereo synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is capable of absolute 3-D localization of natural persistent scatterers, which allows for ground control point (GCP) generation using only SAR data. The prerequisite for the method to achieve high-precision results is the correct detection of common scatterers in SAR images acquired from different viewing geometries. In this contribution, we describe three strategies for automatic detection of identical targets in SAR images of urban areas taken from different orbit tracks. Moreover, a complete workflow for automatic generation of large number of GCPs using SAR data is presented and its applicability is shown by exploiting TerraSAR-X high-resolution spotlight images over the city of Oulu, Finland, and a test site in Berlin, Germany.

TI  - Exploring Beginner Teachers' Sources of Knowledge for Teaching Literature in ESL Classrooms
T2  - ENGLISH TEACHING AND LEARNING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify beginner teachers' sources of knowledge for teaching literature in the English Second Language (ESL) classroom. A review of the literature on ESL teachers' knowledge indicated a paucity of studies that focus specifically on teaching knowledge for Literature as a stand-alone subject in ESL. In addition, ESL teacher training in most countries seemingly focuses on preparing pre-service teachers for language teaching rather than literature. To identify the sources of teaching knowledge for Literature teachers, this study adopted an interpretivist epistemological worldview and used a qualitative single case study design. Data were collected using non-participant observations and semi-structured interviews from four purposively selected Literature in English beginner teachers. Quality and ethical considerations were upheld in this study using a number of strategies. Inductive thematic analysis was used for data analysis. The analysis resulted in three sources of ESL Literature teaching, namely, theory of language education, the nature of the subject and problematic areas in Literature teaching. The findings may be of benefit to ESL teacher preparation programmes which could use them to provide pre-service teachers with multiple contexts as sources of teaching knowledge.

TI  - Is syndromic data from rural poultry farmers a viable poultry disease reporting tool and means of identifying likely farmer responses to poultry disease incursion?
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Syndromic surveillance is a well described tool used in developed countries for alerting authorities to livestock disease incursions. However, little work has been done to evaluate whether this could be a viable tool in countries where disease reporting infrastructure and resources is poor. Consequently, a syndrome-based questionnaire study in Eastern Zambia was designed to gather data on previous encounters farmers had with poultry diseases, as well as control measures they use to mitigate them. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used to analyse the data.Farmers reported an overall annual disease incidence in rural poultry for eastern Zambia of 31% (90% CI 29-32%). Occurrence of poultry disease in the last 12 months was associated with use of middlemen to purchase poultry products (p = 0.05, OR = 7.87), poultry products sold or given away from the farm (p = 0.01, OR = 1.92), farmers experiencing a period with more trade of poultry and its products (p = 0.04, OR = 1.70), presence of wild birds near the farm or village (p = 0.00, OR = 2.47) and poultry diseases being reported from neighbouring farms or villages (p = 0.00, OR = 3.12). The study also tentatively identified three poultry diseases (Newcastle Disease, Gumboro Disease and Fowl Pox) from the thirty-four disease syndromes provided by farmers. Farmers reported an incidence of 27% for Newcastle Disease in 2014. When compared with the state veterinary services data which reported Newcastle Disease incidence at 9% in 2014, it seems syndromic data obtained from farmers may be more sensitive in identifying disease incursion.Thirty-six remedies and strategies farmers use to treat and control these diseases were revealed. The main control strategy for identified diseases was vaccination and the main treatment was unspecified herbs, which warrants further investigation and presents an opportunity for further research in ethno-veterinary medicine. More still, this study identified chilli, Aloe Vera, garlic onion, moringa, and ash as traditional remedies that are commonly being used in Eastern Zambia, and which are also used to treat poultry diseases in Zimbabwe and Botswana. Only fourteen remedies described are conventionally accepted by veterinarians as remedies and disease control measures for poultry diseases.This study shows that syndromic data obtained from farmers is a useful disease reporting tool and could be used as an effective means of alerting authorities to disease incursion. In addition, it shows that these data may give a more accurate estimate of incidence for certain diseases than current surveillance methods and could be useful in assessing significant risk factors associated with disease occurrence.

TI  - An approach to the asthma-protective farm effect by geocoding: Good farms and better farms
T2  - PEDIATRIC ALLERGY AND IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe highly consistent association of growing up on a farm with a reduced asthma risk has so far been attributed to direct farm exposure. In contrast, geographic determinants of the larger environment have never been assessed. In this study, the effects of proximity to farms and environmental variables in relation to the residential address on asthma and atopy were assessed.MethodsAddresses of 2265 children of the Bavarian arm of the GABRIELA study were converted into geocodes. Proximity to the nearest cow farm was calculated, and environmental characteristics were derived from satellite data or terrestrial monitoring. Bacterial diversity in mattress dust samples was assessed in 501 children by sequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicons. Logistic regression models were used to calculate associations between outcomes and exposure variables.ResultsAsthma and atopy were inversely associated with the presence of a farm within a radius of maximum 100m. The environmental variables greenness, tree cover, soil sealing, altitude, air pollution differed not only between farm and non-farm children but also between farm children with and without another farm nearby. The latter distinction revealed strong associations with characteristics of traditional farms including a broader diversity of microbial exposure, which mainly contributed to the protective effect on asthma. In non-farm children, the protective effect of a farm nearby was completely explained by consumption of farm milk.ConclusionsClustering of farms within a neighborhood of 100m is strongly associated with the protective effect on asthma and may represent a more traditional style of farming with broader microbial exposure.

It based on vegetation indices developed through algorithms of a mathematical model within the visible and near-infrared reflectance bands. The index is an estimate of either leaf density per species or vegetation types, respectively. This study aimed to evaluate those indices and find the best algorithm using Sentinel-2 satellite image. Twenty four algorithms of vegetation indices were analyzed for mangrove density mapping, i.e., BR, GNDVI BR, GR, SAVI, MSAVI, NDRE, NDVI, NDVI2, NDWI, NNIP, PSRI, RR, RVI, VIRE, SVI, VIRRE, MTV1, MTVI2, RDVI, VARI, VI green, MSR, and TVI. During pre-processing stage, a digital number of a Sentinel-2 image was converted into radiance and reflectance value. The analysis resulted in three algorithms that provide the highest accuracy, i.e., NDVI (normalized difference vegetation indices) with exponential regression approach, RVI (Ratio Vegetation indices) with the exponential approach and NDVI (normalized difference vegetation indices) with a polynomial approach. The mangrove biomass spatial modeling NDVI with exponential regression approach (RMSE = 89 kg) showed the average of each pixel (10x10m) was 0.97 ton / 100 m2. Total mangrove biomass for above ground and underground vegetation in the study area was 22,365.6 tons. Sentinel-2 satellite image may best use one of those three algorithms, especially applied for mangrove vegetation.

TI  - Glacier mass budget and climate reanalysis data indicate a climatic shift around 2000 in Lahaul-Spiti, western Himalaya
T2  - CLIMATIC CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - While glacier mass changes in the Himalaya since the year 2000 are relatively well investigated, there is still a lack of knowledge about the long-term changes and their climatic drivers. We use historical and recent remote sensing data to study glacier changes of the Lahaul-Spiti region in western Himalaya, India, over the last four decades (1971-2013). The glaciers were losing mass moderately between 1971 and 1999 (-0.07 +/- 0.1 m w.e. year(-1)) while the losses have increased significantly after 2000 (-0.30 +/- 0.1 m w.e. year(-1)). During both periods, the debris-covered glaciers and glaciers having pro-glacial lakes lost more mass than glaciers with little debris cover. Mass changes of Chhota Shigri, a benchmark glacier, closely matched the average of the overall study area. Analysis of gridded climate data covering the period 1948-2015 shows that the mean annual air temperature increased, especially since 1995. One dataset shows a significant increase in summer temperature after 2000 while others do not show any trend. The mean annual precipitation started decreasing around 1995 and reached a minimum around 2000, after which it increased again. One dataset shows a significant decrease in winter precipitation after 2000 while the others show no trend. The climate data indicate that the increase in mean annual temperature from 1995, combined with no significant trend/significant decrease of winter precipitation in the period after 2000, has probably resulted in accelerated mass loss of the glaciers.

TI  - Detecting and Attributing Drivers of Forest Disturbance in the Colombian Andes Using Landsat Time-Series
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Colombian Andes foothills have seen an expansion of forest disturbance since the 1950s. While understanding the drivers of disturbance is important for quantifying the implications of land use change on regional biodiversity, methods for attributing disturbance to specific drivers of change at a high temporal and spatial resolution are still lacking in the Andes region, in part due to persistent cloud cover. Using 20 years of Landsat images (1996-2015) covering Picachos National Park in the Colombian Andes, we detected sub-annual forest cover disturbances using the Breaks For Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) Monitor algorithm; characterized different types of disturbance using spectral, spatial, and topographic indicators; and attributed causes of forest disturbance such as conversion to pasture, conversion to agriculture, and non-stand replacing disturbance (i.e., thinning) using a Random Forest (RF) classifier. Conversion to pasture has been the main driver of forest disturbance in Picachos, responsible for 11,395 +/- 72 ha (17%) of forest cover loss, followed by non-stand replacing disturbance and conversion to agriculture. Disturbance detection had 96% overall agreement with validation data, although we had a high omission error of 21% primarily associated with forest to agriculture conversion. Other change drivers had a much more reliable attribution with forest to pasture conversion or non-stand-replacing disturbance, showing only 1-5% commission and 2-14% omission errors. Our results provide spatially-explicit information on sub-annual disturbances and associated drivers of change that are necessary for evaluating and improving domestic conservation efforts and establishing systematic ecological observations, which is currently absent from Colombia. While effective at revealing forest change dynamics in a geographically remote and socio-politically complex region like Picachos, our approach is highly automated and it can be easily extended to the rest of Andes-Amazon transition belt where low availability of remote sensing data and high cloud cover impede efforts at consistent monitoring of forest cover change dynamics and drivers.

TI  - Image Enhancement and Change Detection for Urban Sprawl Analysis of Bauchi Metropolis, Nigeria Using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques
T2  - ADVANCED SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Annual International Conference on Social and Behavioural Sciences (ICSBS)
CL  - Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB  - The objective of this study is to enhance and classify satellite images, and to use them to examine LC/LU changes and urban growth pattern in Bauchi metropolis, Nigeria over a period of three decades (1985-2015). The study utilised multitemporal Landsat satellite images of four different epochs; Thematic Mapper (TM) of 1985 and 1995, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) of 2005 and Operational Land Imager (OLI) of 2015. Color composites were made after which geometric and radiometric corrections were performed for the four images using image-to-map and Empirical Line Calibration methods, respectively. Then the images were classified using maximum likelihood algorithm. The classification accuracy was assessed through cross-validation using confusion matrices and field validation through ground truthing with the aid of a hand-held Global Positioning System (GPS). The classified images with their Kappa indexes are; TM of 1985 (0.90%), TM of 1995 (0.82%), ETM+ of 2005 (0.91%), and OLI of 2015 (0.95%). Post-classification comparisons and cross-tabulation analyses were performed and the results showed that changes took place in bare surface (+78.75%), built-up area (+568.77%), farmland (+84.01%), forest (-92.60%), rock outcrop (-56.18%) and water body (+59.78%) between 1985 and 2015 in the metropolis. This shows an unusual change (increase) in water body (lake) over the study period which is largely attributed to sand/rock mining from and around the lake for building and other construction works, in and around the metropolis. It also shows a rapid decrease in forest (vegetation), which may not be unconnected with improper environmental protection strategy in the metropolis. The study demonstrates the relevance of remote sensing and GIS in assessing urban growth as well as revealing the LC and LU situation in the metropolis and the result will serve as an input into a predictive model for urban sprawl analysis.

TI  - The Total Electron Content From InSAR and GNSS: A Midlatitude Study
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The total electron content (TEC) measured from the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) and froma dense network of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers are used to assess the capability of InSAR to retrieve ionospheric information, when the tropospheric contribution to the interferometric phase is reasonably negligible. With this aim, we select three night-time case studies over Italy and investigate the correlation between TEC from advanced land observing satellite-phased array type L-band synthetic aperture radar (ALOS-PALSAR) and from the Rete Integrata Nazionale GPS (RING) network, the latter considered as the reference true ionospheric TEC. To retrieve the TEC variability from ALOS-PALSAR, we first investigate the correlation between the integral of the azimuth shifts and the interferometric phase in the absence of ground motions (e.g., earthquakes) and/or heavy rain events. If correlation exists (as in two out of three case studies under investigation), we can assume the tropospheric contribution to the interferometric phase as negligible and the TEC variability from L-band InSAR can be retrieved. For these two case studies, the comparison between the TEC from the InSAR images and from the RING network is quite encouraging as the correlation coefficient is R similar to 0.67 in the first case and R similar to 0.83 in the second case. This result highlights the potential to combine InSAR and GNSS experimental measurements to investigate small-scale spatial variability of TEC, in particular over regions scarcely covered by ground-based GNSS receivers.

TI  - Hydrological Regime Monitoring and Mapping of the Zhalong Wetland through Integrating Time Series Radarsat-2 and Landsat Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Zhalong wetland is a globally important breeding habitat for many rare migratory bird species. Prompted by the high demand for temporal and spatial information about the wetland's hydrological regimes and landscape patterns, eight time series Radarsat-2 images were utilized to detect the flooding characteristics of the Zhalong wetland. Subsequently, a random forest model was built to discriminate wetlands from other land cover types, combining with optical, radar, and hydrological regime data derived from multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The results showed that hydrological regimes variables, including flooding extent and flooding frequency, derived from multitemporal SAR images, improve the land cover classification accuracy in the natural wetlands distribution area. The permutation importance scores derived from the random forest classifier indicate that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) calculated from optical imagery and the flooding frequency derived from multitemporal SAR imagery were found to be the most important variables for land cover mapping. Accuracy testing indicate that the addition of hydrological regime features effectively depressed the omission error rates (from 52.14% to 2.88%) of marsh and the commission error (from 77.34% to 51.27%) of meadow, thereby improving the overall classification accuracy (from 76.49% to 91.73%). The hydrological regimes and land cover monitoring in the typical wetlands are important for eco-hydrological modeling, biodiversity conservation, and regional ecology and water security.

TI  - Surgical management of tumor-positive interval node in melanoma patients: An observational study
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of interval nodes (IN) in melanoma is testified in several studies and sometimes these lymph nodes can contain metastatic disease. Currently there are no guidelines about the management of patients with tumor-positive INs.We enrolled all patients affected by melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in a single institution. All patients with tumor-positive IN underwent the lymphadenectomy of the subsequent draining lymphatic field. Prognosis of IN+-patients was compared with subjects with positive SLNB in usual field through Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox regression analysis.Overall 596 subjects underwent lymphoscintigraphy and one or more INs were identified in 94 (15.8%) patients. The mean number of sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) identified per patient was significantly higher in patients with INs. Macrometastasis were more common in patients with INs. Matched pair analysis testified a statistically significant better prognosis in patients with positive-INs when compared with patients with positive SNs in usual side with the same demographic and clinical characteristics. These findings were confirmed both in analysis of 10-year recurrence-free period, then in 10-years overall survival analysis.Lymphadenectomy of the lymphatic draining field beyond positive-IN testify has proved to be a safe procedure that may improve prognosis in melanoma patients with tumor-positive INs. The better prognosis of patients with tumor-positive INs undergoing lymphadenectomy may be justified by the earlier treatment of lymphatic metastases. Further multicentric comparative studies are needed to evaluate possible impact of this procedure on prognosis of melanoma patients.

TI  - Hydrological Modeling in Data-Scarce Catchments: The Kilombero Floodplain in Tanzania
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Deterioration of upland soils, demographic growth, and climate change all lead to an increased utilization of wetlands in East Africa. This considerable pressure on wetland resources results in trade-offs between those resources and their related ecosystem services. Furthermore, relationships between catchment attributes and available wetland water resources are one of the key drivers that might lead to wetland degradation. To investigate the impacts of these developments on catchment-wetland water resources, the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was applied to the Kilombero Catchment in Tanzania, which is like many other East African catchments, as it is characterized by overall data scarcity. Due to the lack of recent discharge data, the model was calibrated for the period from 1958-1965 (R-2 = 0.86, NSE = 0.85, KGE = 0.93) and validated from 1966-1970 (R-2 = 0.80, NSE = 0.80, KGE = 0.89) with the sequential uncertainty fitting algorithm (SUFI-2) on a daily resolution. Results show the dependency of the wetland on baseflow contribution from the enclosing catchment, especially in dry season. Main contributions with regard to overall water yield arise from the northern mountains and the southeastern highlands, which are characterized by steep slopes and a high share of forest and savanna vegetation, respectively. Simulations of land use change effects, generated with Landsat images from the 1970s up to 2014, show severe shifts in the water balance components on the subcatchment scale due to anthropogenic activities. Sustainable management of the investigated catchment should therefore account for the catchment-wetland interaction concerning water resources, with a special emphasis on groundwater fluxes to ensure future food production as well as the preservation of the wetland ecosystem.

TI  - Improving the analysis of biogeochemical patterns associated with internal waves in the strait of Gibraltar using remote sensing images
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - High Amplitude Internal Waves (HAIWs) are physical processes observed in the Strait of Gibraltar (the narrow channel between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea). These internal waves are generated over the Camarinal Sill (western side of the strait) during the tidal outflow (toward the Atlantic Ocean) when critical hydraulic conditions are established. HAIWs remain over the sill for up to 4h until the outflow slackens, being then released (mostly) towards the Mediterranean Sea. These have been previously observed using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which captures variations in surface water roughness. However, in this work we use high resolution optical remote sensing, with the aim of examining the influence of HAIWs on biogeochemical processes. We used hyperspectral images from the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) and high spatial resolution (10 m) images from the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2A satellite. This work represents the first attempt to examine the relation between internal wave generation and the water constituents of the Camarinal Sill using hyperspectral and high spatial resolution remote sensing images. This enhanced spatial and spectral resolution revealed the detailed biogeochemical patterns associated with the internal waves and suggests local enhancements of productivity associated with internal waves trains.

TI  - Identification of purple spot disease on asparagus crops across spatial and spectral scales
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purple spot caused by the fungus Stemphylium vesicarium is a disease that causes heavy damage in asparagus crops. It infects the leaves and stem and results in degradation of the quality in the harvested asparagus shoots, lowering their commercial value. Precautionary spraying with fungicides is practiced to prevent its appearance, posing a threat to consumers and the environment. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of visible and near-infrared field spectroscopy (UNISPEC-DC) to identify the appearance of the purple spot symptoms at the level of asparagus plants and the ability of very high resolution (Pleiades-1A) and wide area (Landsat 8) satellite images to map fungal distribution within asparagus fields and across the river plain, respectively. Field measurements were used as reference to select the optimum infection identification models. Results indicate that field spectroscopy and wide area remote sensing can be used to create sufficiently accurate quantification models of disease severity in asparagus plants (R-2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 9.68%) or across asparagus fields (R-2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 8.26%). The accuracy drops when using satellite data to quantify infection within field (R-2 = 0.34 and RMSE = 13.13%). The contributing wavelengths, bands and indices can be utilized to provide timely information to farmers and agronomists in order to support precision plant protection applications.

TI  - Investigating the impacts of typhoon-induced floods on the agriculture in the central region of Vietnam by using hydrological models and satellite data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding associated with landing tropical cyclones (TCs) is one of the major natural hazards in the coastal region of Vietnam. Annually, approximately 5 or 6 TCs make landfall in Vietnam, bringing heavy rains and inducing flooding, particularly to the central coastal region because of its topography and geographic configuration. This study focuses on the modelling of typhoon-induced floods that have resulted in widespread damage to agriculture over the central Thua Thien Hue Province of Vietnam by coupling two well-known hydrological models, KINEROS2 and HEC-RAS (Daniel et al. in Open Hydrol J 5(1), 2011), and using GSMaP (Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation) data as the satellite rainfall input. Landsat imagery and GIS are also used for mapping and analysing the inundated areas. The discharge and water level from the KINEROS2 and HEC-RAS models displayed acceptable results for the floods modelled from three selected typhoons; both the Nash-Sutcliffe simulation efficiency coefficient (NSE) and the coefficient of determination (R (2)) were greater than 0.6. The simulated inundation maps of these typhoon-induced floods were compared with those extracted from the Landsat imagery to assess consistency. The result revealed a similar spatial extension of the inundated agricultural areas. This information, together with the forecasted TC movements and associated rainfalls, will be helpful to plan methods for mitigating potential typhoon-induced flooding and damage, particularly damage to agricultural regions.

TI  - Improving the Accuracy of Remotely Sensed Irrigated Areas Using Post-Classification Enhancement Through UAV Capability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although advances in remote sensing have enhanced mapping and monitoring of irrigated areas, producing accurate cropping information through satellite image classification remains elusive due to the complexity of landscapes, changes in reflectance of different land-covers, the remote sensing data selected, and image processing methods used, among others. This study extracted agricultural fields in the former homelands of Venda and Gazankulu in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Landsat 8 imageries for 2015 were used, applying the maximum likelihood supervised classifier to delineate the agricultural fields. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) applied on Landsat imageries on the mapped fields during the dry season (July to August) was used to identify irrigated areas, because years of satellite data analysis suggest that healthy crop conditions during dry seasons are only possible with irrigation. Ground truth points totaling 137 were collected during fieldwork for pre-processing and accuracy assessment. An accuracy of 96% was achieved on the mapped agricultural fields, yet the irrigated area map produced an initial accuracy of only 71%. This study explains and improves the 29% error margin from the irrigated areas. Accuracy was enhanced through post-classification correction (PCC) using 74 post-classification points randomly selected from the 2015 irrigated area map. High resolution aerial photographs of the 74 sample fields were acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to give a clearer picture of the irrigated fields. The analysis shows that mapped irrigated fields that presented anomalies included abandoned croplands that had green invasive alien species or abandoned fruit plantations that had high NDVI values. The PCC analysis improved irrigated area mapping accuracy from 71% to 95%.

TI  - Diagnostic Performance of One-off Flexible Sigmoidoscopy with Fecal Immunochemical Testing in a Large Screening Population
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal immunochemical tests are established diagnostic tests for colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and less invasive, less expensive, and easier to conduct than colonoscopy. However, little is known about their joint diagnostic performance compared with colonoscopy. We aimed to assess the expected diagnostic performance of joint use of flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal immunochemical test.Methods: We assessed the overall and site-specific prevalences of colorectal neoplasms and the overall sensitivity, specificity, area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of a quantitative fecal immunochemical test (FOB Gold, Sentinel Diagnostics, Milano, Italy) among 3,466 participants in screening colonoscopy in Germany. Results were used to model the expected diagnostic performance of joint use of flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing.Results: CRC and advanced adenomas were found in 29 (1%) and 354 (10%) participants, respectively. The area under the curve of fecal immunochemical testing for these outcomes could be raised from 96% to 100% and from 70% to 89%, respectively, by combining it with flexible sigmoidoscopy. At 90% specificity, sensitivity of fecal immunochemical testing would increase from 97% to 100% for CRC and from 40% to 79% for advanced adenomas.Conclusions: Combining flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal immunochemical testing might strongly enhance diagnostic performance of each single test to a level close to the diagnostic performance of screening colonoscopy while avoiding many unnecessary colonoscopies.

TI  - The Sentinel™ EAD<SUP>R</SUP> program can detect more microorganisms than bedding sentinel animals
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bedding sentinel programs have been the standard method for monitoring the health status of rodents housed in individually ventilated cages. However, it has been reported that some infectious microorganisms cannot be detected by bedding sentinels. Thus, more sensitive microbiological monitoring methods are needed. In the present study, we assessed the sensitivity of the Sentinel (TM) EAD(R) program, developed by Allentown Inc. and Charles River Laboratories Inc., which involves a combination of exhaust air dust and environmental PCR testing. We compared the sensitivity of Sentinel (TM) EAD(R) to that of bedding sentinels and fecal samples collected from mice housed in rooms. In conclusion, Sentinel (TM) EAD(R) was more sensitive than the bedding sentinel method.

TI  - Spatiotemporal patterns and characteristics of land-use change in China during 2010-2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change is an important theme on the impacts of human activities on the earth systems and global environmental change. National land-use changes of China during 2010-2015 were acquired by the digital interpretation method using the high-resolution remotely sensed images, e.g. the Landsat 8 OLI, GF-2 remote sensing images. The spatiotemporal characteristics of land-use changes across China during 2010-2015 were revealed by the indexes of dynamic degree model, annual land-use changes ratio etc. The results indicated that the built-up land increased by 24.6x10(3) km(2) while the cropland decreased by 4.9x10(3) km(2), and the total area of woodland and grassland decreased by 16.4x10(3) km(2). The spatial pattern of land-use changes in China during 2010-2015 was concordant with that of the period 2000-2010. Specially, new characteristics of land-use changes emerged in different regions of China in 2010-2015. The built-up land in eastern China expanded continually, and the total area of cropland decreased, both at decreasing rates. The rates of built-up land expansion and cropland shrinkage were accelerated in central China. The rates of built-up land expansion and cropland growth increased in western China, while the decreasing rate of woodland and grassland accelerated. In northeastern China, built-up land expansion slowed continually, and cropland area increased slightly accompanied by the conversions between paddy land and dry land. Besides, woodland and grassland area decreased in northeastern China. The characteristics of land-use changes in eastern China were essentially consistent with the spatial govern and control requirements of the optimal development zones and key development zones according to the Major Function-oriented Zones Planning implemented during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015). It was a serious challenge for the central government of China to effectively protect the reasonable layout of land use types dominated with the key ecological function zones and agricultural production zones in central and western China. Furthermore, the local governments should take effective measures to strengthen the management of territorial development in future.

TI  - RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COFFEE CROP PRODUCTIVITY AND VEGETATION INDEXES DERIVED FROM OLI / LANDSAT-8 SENSOR DATA WITH AND WITHOUT TOPOGRAPHIC CORRECTION
T2  - ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA
M3  - Article
AB  - The reflectance values of a coffee crop are influenced by several factors such as planting direction, crop spacing, time of the year, plant age and topography which reduces the accuracy of the estimates derived from remote sensing data. In this context were evaluated the relationships between coffee productivity and values of NDVI, SAVI and NDWI vegetation indexes with and without topographic reflectance correction for different coffee phenological phases for the crop years 2013/2014 (low productivity) and 2014/2015 (high productivity). The evaluations were made through the standard deviation of vegetation indices (VIs), linear relationship between the cosine factor and the VIs and between VIs and coffee productivity. The best phenological phases of coffee to determine productivity from spectral indexes were the stages of dormancy and flowering. The results indicated that the NDVI was the best index to estimate the productivity of coffee trees with coefficient of determination (R-2) that ranged from 0.58 to 0.90. There was an increase in R-2 between productivity and NDVI with topographic correction in the dormancy phase in the year of low productivity; between productivity and NDVI with topographic correction in the flowering phase in the year of high productivity; and between productivity and SAVI and NDWI with topographic corrections in the flowering phase in the year of high productivity.

TI  - The impact of soil erosion on soil fertility and vine vigor. A multidisciplinary approach based on field, laboratory and remote sensing approaches
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion processes in vineyards, beyond surface runoff and sediment transport, have a strong effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and redistribution along the slope. Variation in SOC across the landscape can determine differences in soil fertility and vine vigor. The goal of this research was to analyze the interactions among vines vigor, sediment delivery and SOC in a sloping vineyard located in Sicily. Six pedons were studied along the slope by digging 6 pits up to 60 cm depth. Soil was sampled every 10 cm and SOC, water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) were analyzed. Erosion rates, detachment and deposition areas were measured by the pole height method which allowed mapping of the soil redistribution. The vigor of vegetation, expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from high-resolution satellite multispectral data, was compared with measured pruning weight. Results confirmed that soil erosion, sediment redistribution and SOC across the slope was strongly affected by topographic features, slope and curvature. The erosion rate was 16Mg ha(-1) y(-1) since the time of planting (6 years). SOC redistribution was strongly correlated with the detachment or deposition areas as highlighted by pole height measurements. The off-farm SOC loss over six years amounted to 1.2 Mg C ha(-1). SUVA(254) values, which indicate hydrophobic material rich in aromatic constituents of WEOC, decreased significantly along the slope, demonstrating that WEOC in the detachment site is more stable in comparison to deposition sites. The plant vigor was strongly correlated with WEOC constituents. Results demonstrated that high resolution passive remote sensing data combined with soil and plant analyses can survey areas with contrasting SOC, soil fertility, soil erosion and plant vigor. This will allow monitoring of soil erosion and degradation risk areas and support decision-makers in developing measures for friendly environmental management. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Analysis of Land Use Change and Expansion of Surface Urban Heat Island in Bogor City by Remote Sensing
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Bogor as one of the satellite cities of Jakarta Metropolitan experiences rapid population growth and urban development. The urban landscape that is changed by urban development affects the city expansion, the increase of land surface temperature (LST), and the urban heat island (UHI). Objectives of this study are to analyze the city expansion, to analyze the LST characteristic of each land use type, and to examine the correlation between LST change and land use change that is affected by the city expansion. We examined the development of the UHI through the city expansion and the increasing of LST. Landsat 5 TM in 1990, 1997, 2007, and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS in 2017 were used in this study. For the land used classification, we used Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification system. The result shows that Bogor has experienced city expansion in the last 27 years. According to the rate of city expansion in the different period, the highest city expansion occurred in 1997-2007 by 8213.7 ha in the analyzed area. In the analysis of relationship between LST and LCZ, there are differences of LSTs among LCZ categories. We also found the area that shows a high LST value expanded broadly towards suburban area with urban development. The temperature differences between urban and suburban were 1.36 degrees C in 1990, 2.33 degrees C in 1997, 2.97 degrees C in 2007, and 2.26 degrees C in 2017. We defined urban change degree to quantify the land use change, and it is compared with LST change. By the analysis, strong influence of urban expansion on the distribution of surface UHI was observed.

TI  - Internal Mammary Lymph Node Biopsy During Free-Flap Breast Reconstruction: Optimizing Adjuvant Breast Cancer Treatment Through Comprehensive Staging
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate breast cancer staging is essential for optimal management of adjuvant therapies. While breast lymphatic drainage involves both axillary and internal mammary (IM) lymph node (LN) basins, IM LN sampling is not routinely advocated. The current study analyzes the incidence of IM LN metastases sampled during free flap breast reconstruction and subsequent changes in adjuvant treatment.A retrospective analysis of patients with positive IM LN biopsies during free flap breast reconstruction was performed. Pre-reconstruction surgical and adjuvant therapies as well as staging and prognostic data were recorded. Change in adjuvant therapies based solely on IM LN positivity was determined.IM LN metastases were found on 28 (1.3%) out of 2057 patients and comprised the study population. Mean age was 49 years with pre-reconstruction chemotherapy or radiation administered in 50 or 54% of cases, respectively. Five (18%) patients had previously undergone lumpectomy with axillary sampling. Mean tumor size was 3.1 cm with tumor location evenly distributed among all four quadrants. Ten (36%) patients had isolated IM LN metastases Patients with both axillary and IM disease had larger lesions, increased prevalence of pre-reconstruction chemotherapy and radiation. Based exclusively on positive IM LN disease, 17 (63%) patients had a change in adjuvant therapy.Despite the low incidence of IM LN metastases, IM LN biopsy during free flap breast reconstruction is recommended. In 36% of cases, nodal metastases were isolated to the IM nodes. Identification of IM metastases influenced adjuvant therapies in a majority of cases.

TI  - Preventing And Counteracting Youth Religious Extremism And Terrorism
T2  - MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The theme of this article has gained added relevance over the past two or three decades due to the unprecedented rise of extremism and terrorism among youth in practically all countries of the world. The article looks at the worldview-related and ideological foundations of preventing and counteracting religious extremism among youth. The main research method used to study the problem is comparative analysis of the Holy Scriptures which offers a comprehensive view and identifies the worldview values underlying the destructive activities of the young people who are recruited by extremist and terrorist organizations. The article reveals and describes the role and significance of the data set forth in the monotheistic Holy Scriptures (the Torah, the New Testament and the Quran) for civilizational mentality for the preventing and counteracting religious radicalism among youth. The distinctions are described of the religious perception of the world (paganism and monotheism) from the scientific world perception whose inevitable advent is predicted in the monotheistic Holy Scriptures. The article has practical value for all those who seek to promote a tolerant attitude not only to religious views, but to any views, positions and life styles as long as they do not break the laws of the country. The case is made for the need to reappraise state policy in promoting tolerance, legal consciousness and law abidance in the country.

TI  - Modeling Solar Radiation in the Forest Using Remote Sensing Data: A Review of Approaches and Opportunities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Solar radiation, the radiant energy from the sun, is a driving variable for numerous ecological, physiological, and other life-sustaining processes in the environment. Traditional methods to quantify solar radiation are done either directly (e.g., quantum sensors), or indirectly (e.g., hemispherical photography). This study, however, evaluates literature which utilized remote sensing (RS) technologies to estimate various forms of solar radiation or components, thereof under or within forest canopies. Based on the review, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has, so far, been preferably used for modeling light under tree canopies. Laser system's capability of generating 3D canopy structure at high spatial resolution makes it a reasonable choice as a source of spatial information about light condition in various parts of forest ecosystem. The majority of those using airborne laser system (ALS) commonly adopted the volumetric-pixel (voxel) method or the laser penetration index (LPI) for modeling the radiation, while terrestrial laser system (TLS) is preferred for canopy reconstruction and simulation. Furthermore, most of the studies focused only on global radiation, and very few on the diffuse fraction. It was also found out that most of these analyses were performed in the temperate zone, with a smaller number of studies made in tropical areas. Nonetheless, with the continuous advancement of technology and the RS datasets becoming more accessible and less expensive, these shortcomings and other difficulties of estimating the spatial variation of light in the forest are expected to diminish.

TI  - Comparing Landsat and RADARSAT for Current and Historical Dynamic Flood Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the historical occurrence of flood water in time and space provides information that can be used to help mitigate damage from future flood events. In Canada, flood mapping has been performed mainly from RADARSAT imagery in near real-time to enhance situational awareness during an emergency, and more recently from Landsat to examine historical surface water dynamics from the mid-1980s to present. Here, we seek to integrate the two data sources for both operational and historical flood mapping. A main challenge of a multi-sensor approach is ensuring consistency between surface water mapped from sensors that fundamentally interact with the target differently, particularly in areas of flooded vegetation. In addition, automation of workflows that previously relied on manual interpretation is increasingly needed due to large data volumes contained within satellite image archives. Despite differences between data received from both sensors, common approaches to surface water and flooded vegetation mapping including multi-channel classification and region growing can be applied with sensor-specific adaptations for each. Historical open water maps from 202 Landsat scenes spanning the years 1985-2016 generated previously were enhanced to improve flooded vegetation mapping along the Saint John River in New Brunswick, Canada. Open water and flooded vegetation maps were created over the same region from 181 RADARSAT 1 and 2 scenes acquired between 2003-2016. Comparisons of maps from different sensors and hydrometric data were performed to examine consistency and robustness of products derived from different sensors. Simulations reveal that the methodology used to map open water from dual-pol RADARSAT 2 is insensitive to up to about 20% training error. Landsat depicts open water inundation well, while flooded vegetation can be reliably mapped in leaf-off conditions. RADARSAT mapped approximately 8% less open water area than Landsat and 0.5% more flooded vegetation, while the combined area of open water and flooded vegetation agreed to within 0.2% between sensors. Derived historical products depicting inundation frequency and trends were also generated from each sensor's time-series of surface water maps and compared.

TI  - Multi-scale relief model (MSRM): a new algorithm for the visualization of subtle topographic change of variable size in digital elevation models
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphological analysis of landforms has traditionally relied on the interpretation of imagery. Although imagery provides a natural view of an area of interest (AOI) images are largely hindered by the environmental conditions at the time of image acquisition, the quality of the image and, mainly, the lack of topographical information, which is an essential factor for a correct understanding of the AOI's geomorphology.More recently digital surface models (DSMs) have been incorporated into the analytical toolbox of geomorphologists. These are usually high-resolution models derived from digital photogrammetric processes or LiDAR data. However, these are restricted to relatively small areas and are expensive or complex to acquire, which limits widespread implementation.In this paper, we present the multi-scale relief model (MSRM), which is a new algorithm for the visual interpretation of landforms using DSMs. The significance of this new method lies in its capacity to extract landform morphology from both high- and low-resolution DSMs independently of the shape or scale of the landform under study. This method thus provides important advantages compared to previous approaches as it: (1) allows the use of worldwide medium resolution models, such as SRTM, ASTER GDEM, ALOS, and TanDEM-X; (2) offers an alternative to traditional photograph interpretation that does not rely on the quality of the imagery employed nor on the environmental conditions and time of its acquisition; and (3) can be easily implemented for large areas using traditional GIS/RS software.The algorithm is tested in the Sutlej-Yamuna interfluve, which is a very large low-relief alluvial plain in northwest India where 10 000 km of palaeoriver channels have been mapped using MSRM. The code, written in Google Earth Engine's implementation of JavaScript, is provided as Supporting Information for its use in any other AOI without particular technical knowledge or access to topographical data.

TI  - Glacier Changes on the Pik Topografov Massif, East Sayan Range, Southeast Siberia, from Remote Sensing Data
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Small mountain glaciers represent the most abundant class in many glaciarized areas around the world; however, less is known about their recent area changes under climatic variability of the last decades. The recent fluctuations of glaciers located in the inner parts of continents are the least studied. In this study we present the results of repeated mapping of seven small (<1.5 km(2)) glaciers located in a continental setting on the northern slope of the Pik Topografov massif, East Sayan Range, southeast Siberia. The multitemporal glacier inventory was derived from the late summer Landsat TM/ETM+ scenes acquired between 1986 and 2010. Glacier outlines were mapped with thresholded ratio (TM3/TM5) method. Topographic inventory parameters were measured from SRTM DEM. Glacier outlines of the Little Ice Age maximum (LIA, similar to 1850) were reconstructed from terminal moraines widely distributed around the glacier snouts. The results indicate a total ice area decrease from 8.1 km(2) in the LIA to 3.8 km(2) in 2010 (53%, 0.33% year(-1)). We revealed accelerated area shrinkage between 1991 and 2001 (almost two times higher than during the period 1986-2010), while between 2001 and 2010, the ice area did not change significantly. Overall, the glacier changes are consistent with the regional climatic trends (winter precipitation and summer temperature). Local topographic settings significantly impacted the glacier dynamics.

TI  - Use of Geophysical and Remote Sensing Data for Assessment of Aquifer Depletion and Related Land Deformation
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - An integrated approach [field, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), hydrogeology, geodesy, and spatial analysis] was adopted to identify the nature, intensity, and spatial distribution of deformational features (sinkholes, fissures, differential settling) reported over fossil aquifers in arid lands, their controlling factors, and possible remedies. The Lower Mega Aquifer System (area 2 x 10(6) km(2)) in central and northern Arabia was used as a test site. Findings suggest that excessive groundwater extraction from the fossil aquifer is the main cause of deformation: (1) deformational features correlated spatially and/or temporally with increased agricultural development and groundwater extraction, and with a decline in water levels and groundwater storage (- 3.7 +/- 0.6 km(3)/year); (2) earthquake events (years 1985-2016; magnitude 1-5) are largely (65% of reported earthquakes) shallow (1-5 km) and increased from 1 event/year in the early 1980s (extraction 1 km(3)/year), up to 13 events/year in the 1990s (average annual extraction > 6.4 km(3)). Results indicate that faults played a role in localizing deformation given that deformational sites and InSAR-based high subsidence rates (- 4 to - 15 mm/year) were largely found within, but not outside of, NW-SE-trending grabens bound by the Kahf fault system. Findings from the analysis of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment solutions indicate that sustainable extraction could be attained if groundwater extraction was reduced by 3.5-4 km(3)/year. This study provides replicable and cost-effective methodologies for optimum utilization of fossil aquifers and for minimizing deformation associated with their use.

TI  - Developing religiously-tailored health messages for behavioral change: Introducing the reframe, reprioritize, and reform ("3R") model
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: As community health interventions advance from being faith-placed to authentically faith-based, greater discussion is needed about the theory, practice, and ethics of delivering health messages embedded within a religious worldview. While there is much potential to leverage religion to promote health behaviors and improve health outcomes, there is also a risk of co-opting religious teachings for strictly biomedical ends.Objective: To describe the development, implementation, and ethical dimensions of a conceptual model for religiously-tailoring health messages.Method: We used data from 6 focus groups and 19 interviews with women aged 40 and older sampled from diverse Muslim community organizations to map out how religious beliefs and values impact mammography-related behavioral, normative and control beliefs. These beliefs were further grouped into those that enhance mammography intention (facilitators) and those that impede intention (barriers). In concert with a multi-disciplinary advisory board, and by drawing upon leading theories of health behavior change, we developed the "3R" model for crafting religiously-tailored health messages.Results: The 3R model addresses barrier beliefs, which are beliefs that negatively impact adopting a health behavior, by (i) reframing the belief within a relevant religious worldview, (ii) reprioritizing the belief by introducing another religious belief that has greater resonance with participants, and (iii) reforming the belief by uncovering logical flaws and/or theological misinterpretations. These approaches were used to create messages for a peer-led, mosque-based, educational intervention designed to improve mammography intention among Muslim women.Conclusions: There are benefits and potential ethical challenges to using religiously tailored messages to promote health behaviors. Our theoretically driven 3R model aids interventionists in crafting messages that address beliefs that hinder healthy behaviors. It is particularly useful in the context of faith-based interventions for it highlights the ethical choices that must be made when incorporating religious values and beliefs in tailored messages.

TI  - Evaluation of Climate Change Impacts on Wetland Vegetation in the Dunhuang Yangguan National Nature Reserve in Northwest China Using Landsat Derived NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on 541 Landsat images between 1988 and 2016, the normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVIs) of the wetland vegetation at Xitugou (XTG) and Wowachi (WWC) inside the Dunhuang Yangguan National Nature Reserve (YNNR) in northwest China were calculated for assessing the impacts of climate change on wetland vegetation in the YNNR. It was found that the wetland vegetation at the XTG and WWC had both shown a significant increasing trend in the past 20-30 years and the increase in both the annual mean temperature and annual peak snow depth over the Altun Mountains led to the increase of the wetland vegetation. The influence of the local precipitation on the XTG wetland vegetation was greater than on the WWC wetland vegetation, which demonstrates that in extremely arid regions, the major constraint to the wetland vegetation is the availability of water in soils, which is greatly related to the surface water detention and discharge of groundwater. At both XTG and WWC, the snowmelt from the Altun Mountains is the main contributor to the groundwater discharge, while the local precipitation plays a lesser role in influencing the wetland vegetation at the WWC than at the XTG, because the wetland vegetation grows on a relatively flat terrain at the WWC, while it grows on a stream channel at the XTG.

TI  - Semantic Labeling of High Resolution Aerial Imagery and LiDAR Data with Fine Segmentation Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN)-based architecture, named fine segmentation network (FSN), is proposed for semantic segmentation of high resolution aerial images and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data. The proposed architecture follows the encoder-decoder paradigm and the multi-sensor fusion is accomplished in the feature-level using multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The encoder consists of two parts: the main encoder based on the convolutional layers of Vgg-16 network for color-infrared images and a lightweight branch for LiDAR data. In the decoder stage, to adaptively upscale the coarse outputs from encoder, the Sub-Pixel convolution layers replace the transposed convolutional layers or other common up-sampling layers. Based on this design, the features from different stages and sensors are integrated for a MLP-based high-level learning. In the training phase, transfer learning is employed to infer the features learned from generic dataset to remote sensing data. The proposed FSN is evaluated by using the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (ISPRS) Potsdam and Vaihingen 2D Semantic Labeling datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can bring considerable improvement to other related networks.

TI  - Migrating pattern of deformation prior to the Tohoku-Oki earthquake revealed by GRACE data
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding how and when far-field continuous motions lead to giant subduction earthquakes remains a challenge. An important limitation comes from an incomplete description of aseismic mass fluxes at depth along plate boundaries. Here we analyse Earth's gravity field variations derived from GRACE satellite data in a wide space-time domain surrounding the M-w 9.0 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake. We show that this earthquake is the extreme expression of initially silent deformation migrating from depth to the surface across the entire subduction system. Our analysis indeed reveals large-scale gravity and mass changes throughout three tectonic plates and connected slabs, starting a few months before March 2011. Before the Tohoku-Oki earthquake rupture, the gravity variations can be explained by aseismic extension of the Pacific plate slab at mid-upper mantle depth, concomitant with increasing seismicity in the shallower slab. For more than two years after the rupture, the deformation propagated far into the Pacific and Philippine Sea plate interiors, suggesting that subduction accelerated along 2,000 km of the plate boundaries in March 2011. This gravitational image of the earthquake's long-term dynamics provides unique information on deep and crustal processes over intermediate timescales, which could be used in seismic hazard assessment.

TI  - Adverse Outcomes and Prediction of Cardiopulmonary Complications in Elective Spine Surgery
T2  - GLOBAL SPINE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Study Design: Retrospective cohort study.Objectives: The purpose of this study was to report incidence of cardiopulmonary complications in elective spine surgery, demographic and surgical predictors, and outcomes. Understanding the risks and predictors of these sentinel events is important for risk evaluation, allocation of hospital resources, and counseling patients.Methods: A retrospective review of the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) was performed on 60 964 patients undergoing elective spine surgery (any region; lanninectomy, arthrodesis, discectomy, or laminoplasty) between 2011 and 2013. Incidence of myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, unplanned reintubation, on ventilator >48 hours, perioperative pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism was measured. Demographic and surgical predictors of cardiopulmonary complications and associated outcomes (length of stay, discharge disposition, and mortality) were measured using binary logistic regression controlling for confounders.Results: Incidence rates per 1000 elective spine patients were 2.1 myocardial infarctions, 1.3 cardiac arrests, 4.3 unplanned intubations, 3.5 on ventilator >48 hours, 6.1 perioperative pneumonia, and 3.7 pulmonary embolisms. In analysis of procedure, diagnosis, and approach risk factors, thoracic cavity (odds ratio = 2.47; confidence interval = 1.95-3.12), scoliosis diagnosis, and combined approach (odds ratio = 1.51; confidence interval = 1.15-1.96) independently added the most risk for cardiopulmonary complication. Cardiac arrest had the highest mortality rate (34.57%). Being on ventilator greater than 48 hours resulted in the greatest increase to length of stay (17.58 days).Conclusions: Expected risk factors seen in the Revised Cardiac Risk Index were applicable in the context of spine surgery. Surgical planning should take into account patients who are at higher risk for cardiopulmonary complications and the implications they have on patient outcome.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Data to Support Monitoring of Dryland Ecosystems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands are the habitat and source of livelihood for about two fifths of the world's population and are highly susceptible to climate and anthropogenic change. To understand the vulnerability of drylands to changing environmental conditions, land managers need to effectively monitor rates of past change and remote sensing offers a cost-effective means to assess and manage these vast landscapes. Here, we present a novel approach to accurately monitor land-surface phenology in drylands of the Western United States using a regression tree modeling framework that combined information collected by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) onboard Landsat 8 and the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2. This highly-automatable approach allowed us to precisely characterize seasonal variations in spectral vegetation indices with substantial agreement between observed and predicted values (R-2 = 0.98; Mean Absolute Error = 0.01). Derived phenology curves agreed with independent eMODIS phenological signatures of major land cover types (average r-value = 0.86), cheatgrass cover (average r-value = 0.96), and growing season proxies for vegetation productivity (R-2 = 0.88), although a systematic bias towards earlier maturity and senescence indicates enhanced monitoring capabilities associated with the use of harmonized Landsat-8 Sentinel-2 data. Overall, our results demonstrate that observations made by the MSI and OLI can be used in conjunction to accurately characterize land-surface phenology and exclusion of imagery from either sensor drastically reduces our ability to monitor dryland environments. Given the declines in MODIS performance and forthcoming decommission with no equivalent replacement planned, data fusion approaches that integrate observations from multispectral sensors will be needed to effectively monitor dryland ecosystems. While the synthetic image stacks are expected to be locally useful, the technical approach can serve a wide variety of applications such as invasive species and drought monitoring, habitat mapping, production of phenology metrics, and land-cover change modeling.

TI  - Last glacial geomorphologic records in Mt Chelmos, North Peloponnesus, Greece
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study deals with the analysis of the glacial processes that have affected the relief of Mt Chelmos in northern Peloponnesus, Greece during middle and Late Pleistocene. The goal was to compile a combined geomorphological-geological map of the study area which would enable the chronological stratification of the glacial landforms cropping up on Mt. Chelmos. Chronological stratification was further aided by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating. The map served as the basis upon which the reconstruction and discussion on the phases of the Middle-Late Quaternary paleoclimatic history of Mt. Chelmos have been made. A sophisticated semiautomated method was first used to analyze the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), combined with Aster, Quickbird and ALOS imagery in order to identify glacial and periglacial, as well as karstic features. Then, these features along with other nonrecognizable features from the remote-sensing images were documented in the field. In this way, several glacial landforms were identified, such as moraines and cirques, indicating extended glaciation phases during the middle and Late Pleistocene. Additionally, a ground moraine located at an altitude of 1900-2050 m, within the Spanolakos glacial valley, was dated using the OSL-dating method. The resulting ages indicate a phase of glacier advance/stabilization during MIS-5b (89-86 ka), which is in consistence with pollenrecord evidence from Greece and the Mediterranean.

TI  - Multi-sensor feature fusion for very high spatial resolution built-up area extraction in temporary settlements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and up-to-date knowledge on the situation in temporary settlements of forced migrants plays an important role for effective humanitarian assistance. These settlements emerge as planned or spontaneous camps or camp-like structures, characterized by a small-scale physical morphology and high dynamics. Information on the built-up area (BUA; i.e. areas occupied by buildings) in these settlements provides important evidence on the local situation. The objective of this work is to present a generic procedure for the detailed extraction of BUA in complex temporary settlements from very high spatial resolution satellite data collected by different sensor types. The proposed approach is embedded in the methodological framework of object-based image analysis and is compound of i) the computation of an exhaustive set of spectral-spatial features aggregated on multiple hierarchic segmentation scales, ii) filter based feature subset selection and iii) supervised classification using a Random Forest classifier. Experimental results are obtained based on Pleiades multispectral optical and TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite imagery for six distinct but representative test areas within the refugee camp Al Zaatari in Jordan. The experiments include a detailed assessment of classification accuracy for varying configurations of considered feature types and training data set sizes as well as an analysis of the feature selection (FS) outcomes. We observe that the classification accuracy can be improved by the use of multiple segmentation levels as well as the integration of multi-sensor information and different feature types. In addition, the results show the potential of the applied FS approach for the identification of most relevant features. Accuracy values beyond 80% in terms of kappa statistic and True Skill Statistic based on significantly reduced feature sets compared to the input underline the potential of the proposed method.

TI  - Impact of land cover change on aboveground carbon stocks in Afromontane landscape in Kenya
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change takes place in sub-Saharan Africa as forests and shrublands are converted to agricultural lands in order to meet the needs of growing population. Changes in land cover also impact carbon sequestration in vegetation cover with an influence on climate on continental scale. The impact of land cover change on tree aboveground carbon stocks was studied in Taita Hills, Kenya. The land cover change between 1987 and 2011 for four points of time was assessed using SPOT satellite imagery, while the carbon density in various land cover types was assessed with field measurements, allometric biomass functions and airborne laser scanning data. Finally, the mean carbon densities of land cover types were combined with land cover maps resulting in carbon stock values for given land cover types for each point of time studied. Expansion of croplands has been taking place since 1987 and before on the cost of thickets and shrublands, especially on the foothills and lowlands. Due to the land cover changes, the carbon stock of trees was decreasing until 2003, after which there has been an increase. The findings of the research is supported by forest transition model, which emphasizes increase of awareness of forests' role in providing ecosystem services, such as habitats for pollinators, water harvesting and storage at the same time when economic reasons in making land-use choices between cropland and woodland, and governmental legislation supports trees on farms.

TI  - Spectral Differences of Water Quality at Different Index Concentrations : in Langya Mountain Scenic Area
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is possible to provide theoretical basis for accurate identification and quantitative extraction of water quality indicators remote sensing spectroscopy by studying the variation of water quality spectrum and its spectral characteristics under different target concentrations with Hyperspectral technology, which has been widely used in water quality testing. A total of 47 typical stations in Langya Mountain Scenic Area were selected for water quality testing and spectral synchronization in this paper. Then, seven water quality indexes and 350 similar to 950 nm bands of each test point were extracted to explore the variation of spectral characteristics of different concentration water quality indexes, and to analyze the relationship between water quality index and spectral reflectance, first derivative reflectance, any two-band reflectance ratio and difference. The results showed that the spectral curves of the water quality indexes were consistent, but their changing rules were different. What's more, bands with the highest degree of discrimination were in the visible range. The spectral curves of water quality with different salinity, total dissolved solids and conductivity content were close to each other, and reflectivity of water samples that change the most significantly was the highest. The spectral reflectance of the water samples with higher turbidity content was more obvious, but there was no difference of spectral reflectance of different turbidity content samples in the range of 700 similar to 950 nm. The spectral reflectance of water with a dissolved oxygen concentration of 4 similar to 4. 9 mg . L-1 was significantly lower than that of the remaining samples in the range of 350 similar to 900 nm. In the range of 350 similar to 380 nm, the spectral reflectance did not change with the chlorophyll content, and the samples with chlorophyll content close to zero were significantly lower than those of the remaining samples in the 400 similar to 950 nm bands. The spectral curves of different BGA-PC concentrations water samples were more complex than other water quality indexes in the range of 350 similar to 730 nm. In addition, the correlation between the water quality index and its original spectral reflectivity was low, but it could be improved by the combination of band reflectivity, such as the first derivative reflectance, any two-band reflectance ratio and difference. This study aims at providing a theoretical support for water quality monitoring of hyperspectral remote sensing.

TI  - Decrease in Snow Cover over the Aysen River Catchment in Patagonia, Chile
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The evidence for global warming can be seen in various forms, such as glacier shrinkage, sea ice retreat, sea level rise and air temperature increases. The magnitude of these changes tends to be critical over pristine and extreme biomes. Chilean Patagonia is one of the most pristine and uninhabited regions in the world, home to some of the most important freshwater reservoirs as well as to evergreen forest, lakes and fiords. Furthermore, this region presents a sparse and weak network of ground stations which must be complemented with satellite information to determine trends on biophysical parameters. The main objective of this work is to present the first assessment on snow cover over the Aysen basin in Patagonia-Chile by using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from the period 2000-2016. The MOD10A2 product was processed at 500 x 500 m spatial resolution. The time-series analysis consisted in the application of non-parametric tests such as the Mann-Kendall test and Sen's slope for annual and seasonal mean of snow covered area (SCA). Data from ground meteorological network and river discharges were also included in this work to show the trends in air temperature, precipitation and stream flow during the last decades. Results indicate that snow cover shows a decreasing non-significant trend in annual mean SCA with a -20.01 km(2)year(-1) slope, and neither seasonal mean shows statistical significance. The comparison with in situ data shows a seasonal decrease in stream flows and precipitation during summer. The hydrological year 2016 was the year with the most negative standardized joint anomalies in the period. However, the lack of in situ snow-monitoring stations in addition to the persistence of cloud cover over the basin can impact trends, creating some uncertainties in the data. Finally, this work provides an initial analysis of the possible impacts of global warming as seen by snow cover in Chilean Patagonia.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ONCOLOGY PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - In-transit melanoma represents a distinct disease pattern of heterogeneous superficial tumors. Many treatments have been developed specifically for this type of disease, including regional chemotherapy and a variety of directly injectable agents. Novel strategies include the intralesional delivery of oncolytic viruses and immunocytokines. The combination of intralesional or regional chemotherapy with systemic immune checkpoint inhibitors also is a promising approach. In the current review, we examine the general management of the workup of patients with in-transit disease, the range of available therapies, and recommendations for specific therapies for an individual patient.

TI  - Defining wet season water quality target concentrations for ecosystem conservation using empirical light attenuation models: A case study in the Great Barrier Reef (Australia)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Optically active water quality components (OAC) transported by flood plumes to nearshore marine environments affect light levels. The definition of minimum OAC concentrations that must be maintained to sustain sufficient light levels for conservation of light-dependant coastal ecosystems exposed to flood waters is necessary to guide management actions in adjacent catchments. In this study, a framework for defining OAC target concentrations using empirical light attenuation models is proposed and applied to the Wet Tropics region of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) (Queensland, Australia). This framework comprises several steps: (i) light attenuation (Kd(PAR)) profiles and OAC measurements, including coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations collected in flood waters; (ii) empirical light attenuation models used to define the contribution of CDOM, Chl-a and SPM to the light attenuation, and; (iii) translation of empirical models into manageable OAC target concentrations specific for wet season conditions. Results showed that (i) Kd(PAR) variability in the Wet Tropics flood waters is driven primarily by SPM and CDOM, with a lower contribution from Chl-a (r2 = 0.5, p < 0.01), (ii) the relative contributions of each OAC varies across the different water bodies existing along flood waters and strongest Kd(PAR) predictions were achieved when the in-situ data were clustered into water bodies with similar satellite-derived colour characteristics ('brownish flood waters', r2 = 0.8, p < 0.01, 'greenish flood waters', r2 = 0.5, p < 0.01), and (iii) that Kd(PAR) simulations are sensitive to the angular distribution of the light field in the clearest flood water bodies. Empirical models developed were used to translate regional light guidelines (established for the GBR) into manageable OAC target concentrations. Preliminary results suggested that a 90th percentile SPM concentration of 11.4 mg L-1 should be maintained during the wet season to sustain favourable light levels for Wet Tropics coral reefs and seagrass ecosystems exposed to 'brownish' flood waters. Additional data will be collected to validate the light attenuation models and the wet season target concentration which in future will be incorporated into wider catchment modelling efforts to improve coastal water quality in the Wet Tropics and the GBR.

TI  - Evaluation of biomarkers in <i>Mytilus galloprovincialis</i> as an integrated measure of biofilm-membrane bioreactor (BF-MBR) system efficiency in mitigating the impact of oily wastewater discharge to marine environment: a microcosm approach
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The large volumes of oily wastewater discharged to marine environment cause heavy impacts on the coastal marine ecosystem. The selection of an appropriate technology to reduce these impacts should be based on the respect of the discharge limits and on the effective assessment and monitoring of its effects on biological organism preservation. To this aim, we set up a controlled microcosm-scale system to compare the effects of a treated and untreated oily wastewater discharge in which the restore process is performed through a Membrane Bio-Reactor. The system is completed by other three microcosms to control and isolate any possible concurrent effect on the Mytilus galloprovincialis, used as sentinel organism.Mytilus galloprovincialis have been kept in all these microcosms, and then mRNA expression and morphology were evaluated on gills and digestive gland. The genes considered in this work are Heat Shock Protein 70 and Metallothionein 10, involved in response to physicochemical sublethal stressors, Superoxide dismutase 1, Catalase, and Cytochrome P450 involved in oxidative stress response. Our results evidenced a significant overexpression, both in gills and digestive gland, of HSP70 in samples maintained in the microcosm receiving the untreated effluent, and of MT10 in those animals kept in microcosm where the effluent was treated. Even though the mRNA modifications are considered "primary" and transient responses which do not always correspond to protein content, the study of these modifications can help to gain insights into the mechanisms of action of xenobiotic exposure. Morphological analysis suggested that, although different, depending on the microcosm, the most serious damages were found in the gill epithelium accompanied with severe haemocyte infiltration, whilst in digestive gland the tissue architecture alterations and the haemocyte infiltration were less pronounced. These observations suggest that the immune system was activated as a general response to stressful stimuli such as the presence of toxic compounds. Moreover, the results indicate that the treatment process is useful. In fact, samples derived from the microcosm receiving the treated effluent, even though presenting some signs of stress, seemed to partially recover the normal structure, although their mRNA expression indicated some cellular suffering.

TI  - 5-year overall survival after early breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy: A retrospective case-control multicentre French study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy (BCP) is rare, but the prevalence is expected to rise. Long-term follow-up data regarding this clinically challenging condition are scarce. The main objective of this multicentre case-control French study was to compare the survival between pregnant patients and matched controls.Methods: Patients from 27 centres diagnosed between 2000 and 2009 with histologically proven invasive breast cancer occurring during pregnancy were retrospectively included. Controls were matched to BCP patients on age, clinical T stage, hormone receptor, HER2, administration of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and pathological node involvement in the absence of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. Five-year overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS) and metastasis-free survival (MFS) rates were estimated using the KaplaneMeier method.Results: One hundred and eleven BCP patients and 253 controls were included. Median age was 33 and 35 years, respectively. Both populations were managed similarly, except for less frequent sentinel node dissection (p = 0.026) and taxane administration (p = 0.03) among BCP patients. Median follow-up was 7.5 years. Survival rates were similar between both BCP and controlpatients: 5-year OS rates were 83.1% (95% CI: 74.5-89.0) vs 85.5% (95% CI: 80.4-89.4), respectively, p=0.31; 5-year DFS rates 60.0% (95% CI: 50.1-68.6) vs 68.5% (95% CI: 62.3-73.9), respectively, p=0.12 and 5-year MFS rates 71.0% (95% CI: 61.3-78.6) and 74.5% (95% CI: 68.6-79.5), respectively, p=0.21.Conclusion: Our study showed that the survival outcomes of patients diagnosed with BCP were not significantly different as compared to those of matched non-pregnant controls. A proper management of women diagnosed with BCP is crucial. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - IDENTIFICATION OF DYNAMICALLY HOMOGENEOUS AREAS WITH TIME SERIES SEGMENTATION OF REMOTE SENSING DATA
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a method of segmentation of remote sensing time series data, which exploits multi-temporal information to identify objects' boundaries. Extracting homogeneous objects with similar temporal behavior, the method analyzes large volumes of multi-temporal input data in a piecewise way and produces a consistent output segmentation layer for large territories. Segment building logic is simplified to minimize the computation time, while objects' boundary identification accuracy remains sufficient for remote monitoring and mapping of vegetation, and specifically, agricultural crops. At the Space Research Institute of the RAS, the proposed method is currently applied for automated on-line satellite imagery analysis for recognition and mapping of (winter and spring) crops on large territories and land-use evaluation. The method successfully deals with gaps in remote sensing time series data and performs well even when input images are contaminated with speckle noise. Due to its ability to map dynamically homogeneous surface areas with partially missing data, the method provides a potential for their recovery.

A1  - Sentinel Node Recurrent Breast
TI  - Risk of Regional Recurrence After Negative Repeat Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients with Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy (rSLNB) has increasingly been used in patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). The safety in terms of regional disease control after this procedure remains unclear. This study evaluates occurrence of regional recurrence as first event in patients with IBTR and negative rSLNB, treated without additional lymph node dissection.Data were obtained from the Sentinel Node and Recurrent Breast Cancer (SNARB) study. In 201 patients, tumor-negative rSLNB was obtained without performing additional lymph node dissections.With median follow-up of 4.7 (range 0.9-12.7) years, regional recurrence occurred after median time of 3.0 (range 0.4-6.7) years in 4.5% (N = 9) of patients as first event after IBTR and rSLNB. In four of these nine patients, the site of recurrence was in concordance with the anatomical location of rSLNB. Two of the nine recurrences were reported in the ipsilateral axilla, resulting in an ipsilateral axillary regional recurrence rate of 1.0%. In the other seven patients, regional recurrence occurred in aberrant basins. Univariable analysis showed that triple-negative IBTR and lower amount of radioactive-labeled tracer ((99m)technetium) used during rSLNB were associated with developing regional recurrence as first event after negative rSLNB (P < 0.05).The risk of developing regional recurrence after negative rSLNB is low. The low relapse rate supports the safety of rSLNB as primary nodal staging tool in IBTR. The time has come for clinical guidelines to adopt rSLNB as axillary staging tool in patients with IBTR.

TI  - Repeat Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence: A Systematic Review of the Results and Impact on Prognosis
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - During recent years, an increasing number of patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) and previous axillary surgery have undergone repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy (rSLNB). The influence of axillary nodal status on prognosis for IBTR patients remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the technical success rate, follow-up assessment, and prognostic value of rSLNB for patients with IBTR.A systematic search conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library up to July 2017 included all studies on rSLNB in IBTR.A total of 34 articles describing 1761 patients were identified. A repeat sentinel lymph node (rSLN) was successfully harvested from 64.3% of the patients with IBTR, and the rate was significantly higher for the patients who had a previous SLNB than for those who had a previous axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) (75.7% vs. 46.1%; P < 0.0001). The rSLN was tumor-positive for 18.2% of the rSLNs, 40% of which were harvested in basins other than the ipsilateral axilla. The negative predictive value of the rSLNB was 96.5%. Overall survival, reported for 21.5% of the patients, was 95.2% after a mean follow-up period of 29.6 months.The prognostic impact of rSLN-positive versus rSLN-negative IBTR remains unclear. Further studies are needed to fill in the gap in the management of lymph nodes for patients with IBTR. However, based on the current evidence, rSLNB is feasible for 64% of patients, especially after previous SLNB. With a negative predictive value of 96.5%, rSLNB appears to be highly specific, with substantial advantages over ipsilateral ALND in IBTR.

T2  - GEOAMBIENTE ON-LINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The present essay aims to weave reflections and appraisals about the current process of expansion of the urban spot between the municipalities of Serra and Cariacica, Grande Vitoria - ES (Brazil), in concjuction with Duas Bocas - Mestre Alvaro Ecological Corridor. The above mentioned area was the exercise we propose to establish in this article. From the zoning contained in the Municipal Master Plan of both municipalities, the aid of the images supplied by Google Earth (R)'s satellite and the established reflections on "ecological corridors", "urban voids" and "free space systems", it was possible to emphasize that the effectiveness of the institution of Ecological Corridors as an environmental preservation strategy is hostage to the agents that produce the space, mainly in the intersections fringes between urban expansion and areas of environmental interest, which requires new rationalities in the construction, application and fiscalization of policies that, in some way, promote the production of space.

TI  - Predicting Tropical Tree Species Richness from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Time Series: The Devil Is Perhaps Not in the Detail
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from remote sensing is a common explanatory variable inputted in correlative biodiversity models in the form of descriptive statistics summarizing complex time series. Here, we hypothesized that a single meaningful remotely-sensed scene can provide better prediction of species richness than any usual multi-scene statistics. We tested this idea using a 15-year time series of six-day composite MODIS NDVI data combined with field measurements of tree species richness in the tropical biodiversity hotspot of New Caledonia. Although some overall, seasonal, annual and monthly statistics appeared to successfully correlate with tree species richness in New Caledonia, a range of individual scenes were found to provide significantly better predictions of both the overall tree species richness (|r| = 0.68) and the richness of large trees (|r| = 0.91). A preliminary screening of the NDVI-species richness relationship within each time step can therefore be an effective and straightforward way to maximize the accuracy of NDVI-based correlative biodiversity models.

TI  - Mapping the Loss of Mt. Kenya's Glaciers: An Example of the Challenges of Satellite Monitoring of Very Small Glaciers
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the last complete glacier mapping of Mt. Kenya in 2004, strong glacier retreat and glacier disintegration have been reported. Here, we compile and present a new glacier inventory of Mt. Kenya to document recent glacier change. Glacier area and mass changes were derived from an orthophoto and digital elevation model extracted from Pleiades tri-stereo satellite images. We additionally explore the feasibility of using freely available imagery (Sentinel-2) and an alternative elevation model (TanDEM-X-DEM) for monitoring very small glaciers in complex terrain, but both proved to be inappropriate; Sentinel-2 because of its too coarse horizontal resolution compared to the very small glaciers, and TanDEM-X-DEM because of errors in the steep summit area of Mt. Kenya. During 2004-2016, the total glacier area on Mt. Kenya decreased by 121.0 x 10(3) m(2) (44%). The largest glacier (Lewis) lost 62.8 x 10(3) m(2) (46%) of its area and 1.35 x 10(3) m(3) (57%) of its volume during the same period. The mass loss of Lewis Glacier has been accelerating since 2010 due to glacier disintegration, which has led to the emergence of a rock outcrop splitting the glacier in two parts. If the current retreat rates prevail, Mt. Kenya's glaciers will be extinct before 2030, implying the cessation of the longest glacier monitoring record of the tropics.

TI  - THE OPPOSITION "LIFE/DEATH" IN <i>MEMORIES OF P.I. TCHAIKOVSKY</i> BY N.D. KASHKIN
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article deals with the problem of the study of the author's language worldview on the material of the opposition life/death usage in the text of memoirs. The aim of this work was to analyse the functioning of the words related to the opposition life/death, cases of the opposition, as well as to reveal the meanings, most typical for the author, and to come to conclusions on how the author's features of comprehension influence the use of these words in the work. N.D. Kashkin's Memories of P.I. Tchaikovsky, written just after the death of the composer and published in 1894, was used as the material for this study. To analyse the meanings in a tight correspondence with the author's language the third edition of V.I. Dahl's dictionary (1903) was used. The research is made with the methods of component and contextual analysis. Relevant meanings of the words life, death from the material are compared with their dictionary meanings, the most frequent variants and relevant semes of meanings are investigated in the article. The analysis found the following language facts: 1. Many sentences show the word life and its derivatives in the expressions designating time or place (year of life, life period, life in Moscow, in St. Petersburg). 2. The words life and death are used as reference points to describe events and phenomena on the directed timeline. 3. The semantic excess expresses the author's understanding of the human existence limit. The author cannot speak about the dead in the same way as about the alive. Synonyms pokoynyy, pochivshyy, umershiy, usopshiy are used to focus on the fact that the person is dead. The above mentioned synonyms are semantically excessive. 4. The expressions meaning the inevitability of death and the irrevocability of it for any, even the most gifted, person underline the connection between time and life. 5. The continuum of life is many-sided. The movement of the person in this continuum can happen not only in one direction in time and in different directions in space, but also in different areas. The word life in Kashkin's Memories of P.I. Tchaikovsky means the existential continuum having one end - the death of the person. All events occur in this continuum, its various parts can be important to a greater or lesser extent for the person in different intervals of time. The lexeme life in the author's picture of the world is connotatively neutral. For Kashkin, the opposition life/death is generally expressed by the semantics of the words alive/dead, the antonyms life/death almost cannot be opposed as life is incomparably more important than death. This peculiarity is the essential feature of the idiostyle of Kashkin, reflecting his language picture of the world.

TI  - On-Board, Real-Time Preprocessing System for Optical Remote-Sensing Imagery
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of remote-sensing technology, optical remote-sensing imagery processing has played an important role in many application fields, such as geological exploration and natural disaster prevention. However, relative radiation correction and geometric correction are key steps in preprocessing because raw image data without preprocessing will cause poor performance during application. Traditionally, remote-sensing data are downlinked to the ground station, preprocessed, and distributed to users. This process generates long delays, which is a major bottleneck in real-time applications for remote-sensing data. Therefore, on-board, real-time image preprocessing is greatly desired. In this paper, a real-time processing architecture for on-board imagery preprocessing is proposed. First, a hierarchical optimization and mapping method is proposed to realize the preprocessing algorithm in a hardware structure, which can effectively reduce the computation burden of on-board processing. Second, a co-processing system using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) and a digital signal processor (DSP; altogether, FPGA-DSP) based on optimization is designed to realize real-time preprocessing. The experimental results demonstrate the potential application of our system to an on-board processor, for which resources and power consumption are limited.

TI  - Dehazing for Multispectral Remote Sensing Images Based on a Convolutional Neural Network With the Residual Architecture
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing images are often contaminated by haze, which causes low image quality. In this paper, a novel dehazing method based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with the residual structure is proposed for multispectral remote sensing images. First, multiple CNN individuals with the residual structure are connected in parallel and each individual is used to learn a regression from the hazy image to the clear image. Then, the outputs of CNN individuals are fused with weight maps to produce the final dehazing result. In the designed network, the CNN individuals, mining multiscale haze features through multiscale convolutions, are trained using different levels of haze samples to achieve different dehazing abilities. In addition, the weight maps change with the haze distribution, and the fusion of the CNN individuals is adaptive. The designed network is end-to-end, and putting a hazy image into it, the clear scene can be restored. To train the network, a wavelength-dependent haze simulation method is proposed to generate labeled data, which can synthesize hazy multispectral images highly close to real conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately remove the haze in each band of multispectral images under different scenes.

Its pathogen, bluetongue virus (BTV) has a double-stranded RNA genome consisting of 10 segments that provides an opportunity for field and vaccine strains of different serotypes to reassort whilst simultaneously infecting the same animal. For the first time, we report the full-length genome sequence of a BTV strain of serotype 21 (5149E) isolated from sentinel cattle in Guangxi Province in China in 2015. Sequence analysis suggested that the isolate 5149E had undergone a reassortment incident and acquired seg-6 from an isolate of BTV-16 which originated from Japan. This study aims to provide more understanding as to the origin and epidemiology of BTV.

TI  - Spectral band unification and inter-calibration of Himawari AHI with MODIS and VIIRS: Constructing virtual dual-view remote sensors from geostationary and low-Earth-orbiting sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Through band unification and inter-calibration this paper develops and presents a method to construct virtual dual-view sensors from compatible geostationary and low-Earth-orbiting (LEO) sensors such that spectrally unified and radiometrically consistent observations from two different angles can be acquired using these virtual sensors. Results for three virtual dual-view sensors constructed from Himawari-8/AHI (one of the next generation of geostationary sensors) paired with MODIS (Aqua and Terra) and VIIRS are reported. Over 1270 representative Hyperion passes were used to reproduce, by spectral band integration, "simultaneous" observations by the three pairs of sensors, and linear relationships between AHI-MODIS and AHI-VIIRS were established, allowing the conversion of MODIS bands and VIIRS bands to AHI bands. For 95% of the sample pixels, a maximum reflectance conversion error < 0.004 was achieved. Following band conversion, inter-calibration was conducted using a ray-matching technique, involving up to 2100 matchup areas from 20 months of imagery. Overall the final calibration accuracy is high as indicated by high correlation r(2) (similar to 0.98), small estimated parameter errors, small regression errors and negligible regression biases. The temporal drifting of the paired sensors over a 20 month period was also analysed. It shows that all the involved sensors are very stable. Accurate inter-calibration not only provides an economical solution for the calibration an Fd validation of remote sensors, it is also essential for synergetic multi-sensor applications. Lack of sufficient information from single-view sensors has been a common bottleneck in many remote sensing applications. Constructing virtual dual-view sensors using the presented method provides an effective way to overcome the limitations of single-view sensors, without incurring extra costs. The method can be applied to other next generation geostationary sensors leading to near global coverage and enhanced products. Inter-calibration between geostationary sensors, such as Himawari AHI - and GOES-R ABI, may be conducted using the LEO sensors as bridges.

TI  - Validation and update of a lymph node metastasis prediction model for breast cancer
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to validate and update a model for predicting the risk of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis for assisting clinical decision-making.Methods: We included breast cancer patients diagnosed at six Dutch hospitals between 2011 and 2015 to validate the original model which includes six variables: clinical tumor size, tumor grade, estrogen receptor status, lymph node longest axis, cortical thickness and hilum status as detected by ultrasonography. Subsequently, we updated the original model using generalized linear model (GLM) tree analysis and by adjusting its intercept and slope. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration curve were used to assess the original and updated models. Clinical usefulness of the model was evaluated by false-negative rates (FNRs) at different cut-off points for the predictive probability.Results: Data from 1416 patients were analyzed. The AUC for the original model was 0.774. Patients were classified into four risk groups by GLM analysis, for which four updated models were created. The AUC for the updated models was 0.812. The calibration curves showed that the updated model predictions were better in agreement with actual observations than the original model predictions. FNRs of the updated models were lower than the preset 10% at all cut-off points when the predictive probability was less than 12.0%. ER Conclusions: The original model showed good performance in the Dutch validation population. The updated models resulted in more accurate ALN metastasis prediction and could be useful preoperative tools in selecting low-risk patients for omission of axillary surgery.

TI  - Statistical Comparison of Regional-Scale Tropospheric Aerosol Extinction Coefficient across China Based on CALIPSO Data
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Two years of CALIPSO level 2 version 2 data were analyzed to obtain regional distributions of vertical profiles of the aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) across China 10 typical geographical regions were selected for comparison, which cover various aerosol pollution levels, climate zones, and underlying surfaces. The whole troposphere was split into twolayers: the Lower- and the Upper-layer-separated by the maximum boundary layer height-which represent the boundary layer and the upper tropospheric layer, respectively. The annual average of the column-average AEC in the 10 regions ranged from 0.066 to 0.243 km(-1) in the Lower-layer and from 0.022 to 0.059 km(-1) in the Upper-layer. The regional AEC in the Lower-layer was the highest in central and eastern China, followed by that in the Sichuan Basin, the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the capital economic circle, the Pearl River Delta, the desert region, the Tibetan Plateau, northeast China, the northwest semi-arid plateau, and, finally, the East China Sea. The seasonal AEC in the Lower-layer was the highest during spring in the desert and marine regions, during the summer on the Tibetan Plateau, and during autumn or winter in the other regions. The regional and seasonal patterns of AEC in the Lower-layer agreed to a large extent with known regional distributions of surface-layer PM2.5 distributions and dominant seasonal emission sources in their respective regions. Regional and seasonal patterns in the Upper-layer were slightly different from those in the Lower-layer due to different transport pathways of aerosol pollution in different regions. The proportion of occurrence under different pollution conditions and the number of polluted days were also estimated separately for the Lower- and the Upper-layer, based on AEC vertical profiles for each region.

TI  - A prospective evaluation of the sentinel node mapping algorithm in endometrial cancer and correlation of its performance against endometrial cancer risk subtypes
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel node mapping is emerging as the alternative to lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer. The objective of our study is to validate of the sentinel node mapping surgical algorithm and also to compare the performance of the algorithm against endometrial cancer risk subtypes.Design: This is a prospective interventional study carried out at a Single University teaching hospital. All patients with apparent early stage endometrial cancer who underwent robotic assisted surgical staging were included. Intracervical injection of Indocyanine Green dye and sentinel node identification and biopsy was done for all study patients. The node positive rate when using SLN mapping alone versus SLN mapping algorithm were compared. The node positivity was compared against various risk subtypes of endometrial cancer.Results: 69 patients were included in the study. In 95.7% patients SLN was detected with a bilateral detection rate of 87.9% 10 patients had nodal positivity, among which 7 were identified by SLN mapping alone. The algorithm captured all 10 patients with positive LNs, yielding a node positivity rate of 14.9%, sensitivity and NPV of 100%. For SLN mapping alone the sensitivity was 77.8%, false negative rate (FNR) 22.2%, and NPV 96.6%. In low- and intermediate-risk subtypes SLN mapping as well as algorithm identified all node positive patients, but in high-risk endometrial cancers the SLN mapping technique alone had a sensitivity of 57.1% and false-negative rate of 42.9% when compared with 100% sensitivity for the SLN mapping algorithm.Conclusions: When doing SLN mapping and biopsy during endometrial cancer staging surgery it is essential that the steps mentioned in the SLN mapping algorithm are followed as SLN mapping alone seems to have a limitation in detecting positive nodes especially in high risk subtypes of endometrial cancer. Even with the lack of survival data, based on the performance of SLN mapping surgical algorithm (even if ultrastaging facility is not available), it seems to be a better technique in detecting metastatic nodes, giving prognostic information, and enabling accurate adjuvant treatment.

TI  - Geo-anthropogenic aberrations and Chennai floods: 2015, India
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The flood occurred in December 2015 in Chennai, the capital city of the state of Tamil Nadu, India, is a major disaster in the history of the region as it caused the loss of 421 human lives, affected over 2 million people and the loss of properties worth of US$ 80,000 million. There were beeline of observations through media and dailies, all attributing the floods to the indiscriminate urbanization. In the context of lack of any scientific observations on the disaster which occurs often, and at the same time the Chennai region is geologically vibrant with active geodynamics viz. tectonics and tectonically induced riverine and coastal geomorphic processes, a study was undertaken involving all the features related to both geodynamics and anthropogeny to unfurl the mysteries behind the recent flood disaster. In the study, ArcGIS-based spatial databases were generated on the (1) flood inundation interpreted from post-flood MODIS satellite data, (2) geodynamic features related to earth movements, riverine/fluvial and coastal geomorphology interpreted from IRS LISS IV FCC and GeoEye satellite data, (3) anthropogenic features viz. encroached drainages, water bodies and the wetlands extracted from IRS and GeoEye satellite data and (4) integrated geo-anthropogenic data. Using these GIS databases, spatial modelling was carried out between the flood inundation data and the geodynamic, anthropogenic and geo-anthropogenic data sets which revealed that these have significantly controlled the December 2015 floods of Chennai city. The GIS-based spatial correlative study between the flood and the geodynamic features indicated that the land arching, deepening and land subsidence related to post-collision tectonics; and the tectonically tutored phenomenon of river migration and the resultant occurrence of huge system of palaeochannels and the complex drainage patterns, and the coastal geomorphic features viz. palaeobeach ridges and swales, defunct swamps and the wide tidal flats have controlled the floods. The study with anthropogenic features indicated that the unmindful obstructions of drainages, encroached water bodies and encroached segments of the tidal flats and the swamps were the loci for the floods, whereas the spatial analysis between the flood and integrated geo-anthropogenic data gave fine resolution information that the anthropogenic features depending upon the geodynamic features with which these are associated determined the floods; for example, (1) the obstructions of drainages along deflected drainages, compressed meanders and tectonic deepening, (2) encroachment of water bodies in zones of deflected drainages and tectonic subsidence and (3) encroachment of tidal flats and encroachment of Pallikaranai swamp in zones of tectonic deepening. These observations have lead to broader remedial strategies.

TI  - Spatial Changes of Urban Heat Island Formation in the Colombo District, Sri Lanka: Implications for Sustainability Planning
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The formation of surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) can cause significant adverse impacts on the quality of living in urban areas. Monitoring the spatial patterns and trajectories of UHI formations could be helpful to urban planners in crafting appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures. This study examined the spatial pattern of SUHI formation in the Colombo District (Sri Lanka), based on land surface temperature (LST), a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and population density (PD) using a geospatial-based hot and cold spot analysis tool. Here, 'hot spots' refers to areas with significant spatial clustering of high variable values, while 'cold spots' refers to areas with significant spatial clustering of low variable values. The results indicated that between 1997 and 2017, 32.% of the 557 divisions in the Colombo District persisted as hot spots. These hot spots were characterized by a significant clustering of high composite index values resulting from the four variables (LST, NDVI (inverted), NDBI, and PD). This study also identified newly emerging hot spots, which accounted for 49 divisions (8.8%). Large clusters of hot spots between both time points were found on the western side of the district, while cold spots were found on the eastern side of the district. The areas identified as hot spots are the more urbanized parts of the district. The emerging hot spots were in areas that had undergone landscape changes due to urbanization. Such areas are found between the persistent hot spots (western parts of the district) and persistent cold spots (eastern parts of the district). Generally, the spatial pattern of the emerging hot spots followed the pattern of urbanization in the district, which had been expanding from west to east. Overall, the findings of this study could be used as a reference in the context of sustainable landscape and urban planning for the Colombo District.

TI  - A Study on Land Suitability for Rice Cultivation in Khordha District of Odisha (India) Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With the global population on the rise, it is important to address the increasing demand for food. According to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization, United Nations), by 2050, the developing countries must double their food production to meet the growing demand. Proper land utilization can be one of the solutions for this problem. In view of this, the current study focussed on land suitability analysis for Khordha district of Odisha (India) for rice crop. This study estimated that the amount of land suitable for rice cropping was 195,731 ha against the currently cultivated land of 122,183.38 ha. Therefore, there was a possibility of more amount of land that could be available for rice cultivation in Khordha district than the currently cultivated area. In order to perform this exercise, the land use and land cover data from IRS (Indian remote sensing satellite), soil nutrient parameters like pH values and nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous and organic carbon contents were considered. In addition, the climatic parameters such as near surface temperature, rainfall and number of rainy days were taken into account. The unused land identified in Khordha district in this study might be utilized for cultivating rice crop in this region.

TI  - Characterizing Tropical Forest Cover Loss Using Dense Sentinel-1 Data and Active Fire Alerts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire use for land management is widespread in natural tropical and plantation forests, causing major environmental and economic damage. Recent studies combining active fire alerts with annual forest-cover loss information identified fire-related forest-cover loss areas well, but do not provide detailed understanding on how fires and forest-cover loss are temporally related. Here, we combine Sentinel-1-based, near real-time forest cover information with Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) active fire alerts, and for the first time, characterize the temporal relationship between fires and tropical forest-cover loss at high temporal detail and medium spatial scale. We quantify fire-related forest-cover loss and separate fires that predate, coincide with, and postdate forest-cover loss. For the Province of Riau, Indonesia, dense Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar data with guaranteed observations of at least every 12 days allowed for confident and timely forest-cover-loss detection in natural and plantation forest with user's and producer's accuracy above 95%. Forest-cover loss was detected and confirmed within 22 days in natural forest and within 15 days in plantation forest. This difference can primarily be related to different change processes and dynamics in natural and plantation forest. For the period between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2017, fire-related forest-cover loss accounted for about one third of the natural forest-cover loss, while in plantation forest, less than ten percent of the forest-cover loss was fire-related. We found clear spatial patterns of fires predating, coinciding with, or postdating forest-cover loss. Only the minority of fires in natural and plantation forest temporally coincided with forest-cover loss (13% and 16%) and can thus be confidently attributed as direct cause of forest-cover loss. The majority of the fires predated (64% and 58%) or postdated forest-cover loss (23% and 26%), and should be attributed to other key land management practices. Detailed and timely information on how fires and forest cover loss are temporally related can support tropical forest management, policy development, and law enforcement to reduce unsustainable and illegal fire use in the tropics.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Patterns of Urban Forest Basal Area under China's Rapid Urban Expansion and Greening: Implications for Urban Green Infrastructure Management
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban forest (UF) basal area is an important parameter of UF structures, which can influence the functions of the UF ecosystem. However, the spatio-temporal pattern of the basal area in a given UF in regions under rapid urbanization and greening is still not well documented. Our study explores the potential of estimating spatio-temporal UF basal area by using Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery. In our study, the predicting model was established to produce spatiotemporal maps of the urban forest basal area index in Changchun, China for the years 1984, 1995, 2005, and 2014. Our results showed that urban forests became more and more fragmented due to rapid urbanization from 1984 to 1995. Along with rapid urban greening after 1995, urban forest patches became larger and larger, creating a more homogeneous landscape. Urban forest and its basal area in the whole study area increased gradually from 1984 to 2014, especially in the outer belts of the city with urban sprawl. UF basal area was 27.3 x 10(3) m(2), 41.3 x 10(3) m(2), 45.8 x 10(3) m(2), and 65.1 x 10(3) m(2) of the entire study area for the year 1984, 1995, 2005, and 2014, respectively. The class distribution of the UF basal area index was skewed toward low values across all four years. In contrast, the frequency of a higher UF basal area index increased gradually from 1984 to 2014. Besides, the UF basal area index showed a decreasing trend along the gradient from suburban areas to urban center areas. Our results demonstrate the capability of TM remote sensing for understanding spatio-temporal changing patterns of UF basal area under China's rapid urban expansion and greening.

TI  - Spatiotemporal pattern of urban forest leaf area index in response to rapid urbanization and urban greening
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urbanization and urban greening have caused great changes to urban forests in China. Understanding spatiotemporal patterns of urban forest leaf area index (LAI) under rapid urbanization and urban greening is important for urban forest planning and management. We evaluated the potential for estimating urban forest LAI spatiotemporally by using Landsat TM imagery. We collected three scenes of Landsat TM (thematic mapper) images acquired in 1997, 2004 and 2010 and conducted a field survey to collect urban forest LAI. Finally, spatiotemporal maps of the urban forest LAI were created using a NDVI-based urban forest LAI predictive model. Our results show that normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) could be used as a predictor for urban forest LAI similar to natural forests. Both rapid urbanization and urban greening contribute to the changing process of urban forest LAI. The urban forest has changed considerably from 1997 to 2010. Urban vegetated pixels decreased gradually from 1997 to 2010 due to intensive urbanization. Leaf area for the study area was 216.4, 145.2 and 173.7 km(2) in the years 1997, 2004 and 2010, respectively. Urban forest LAI decreased sharply from 1997 to 2004 and increased slightly from 2004 to 2010 because of numerous greening policies. The urban forest LAI class distributions were skewed toward low values in 1997 and 2004. Moreover, the LAI presented a decreasing trend from suburban to downtown areas. We demonstrate the usefulness of TM remote-sensing in understanding spatiotemporal changing patterns of urban forest LAI under rapid urbanization and urban greening.

CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - Demarcation and continuous monitoring of shorelines are essential for understanding the dynamic nature and processes of the coastal areas. Shorelines of delta regions are ecologically and economically sensitive and dynamic. Changes in the environmental conditions and human interference affect the balance of delta's morphology. As delta areas are severely disturbed by natural as well as anthropogenic factors, it is essential to study the current status and their growth pattern. This study focuses on the decadal change analysis of Krishna-Godavari delta region on the east coast of India from 1973 to 2014 using satellite data. Advanced remote sensing and GIS technology along with statistical tools are efficient to study the changes in the delta. Results show that the major accretion over these areas is due to the growth in the geomorphological landforms like spits and bars. It is observed from the 40 years of analysis over Godavari delta river mouths; Nilarevu (-781 m), Gautami (-2.2 km), Vainateyam (-463 m) and Vasishta (-320 m) are under erosion. During 1973-1993, Gautami and Vasishta river mouths showed higher erosion of 1.6 km and 1.4 km whereas Nilarevu mouth marked 972.6 m of accretion. High erosion was observed in the northern part of the Krishna delta due to the reduction in the size of the spit and high accretion in the southern part of the delta during the period between 1973 and 2014. It is inferred that surface coastal current pattern during monsoon and post monsoon in Krishna delta support the growth of a spit in the south-western direction. This study has brought out the current status and growth patterns of Krishna-Godavari delta in last few decades. This kind of study helps in proper management and planning of the coast which requires accurate knowledge about the endurance of the area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMALLY INVASIVE GYNECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Iliopsoas abscess (IPA) is a rare condition seen in a variety of specialties that presents with nonspecific complaints. Presented herein is the development of an IPA after robotic staging with sentinel lymphadenectomy for endometrial carcinoma. The patient was a 61-year-old woman with history of prolonged immunosuppressive therapy due to psoriasis. She presented with an IPA 8 weeks after a robotic-assisted laparoscopic hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and sentinel lymph node dissection. The patient was treated and cured with empiric antibiotics and drainage by interventional radiology. Although infrequent, one must keep IPA as a possible diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients who have undergone dissection of the retroperitoneal space during gynecologic surgery. (C) 2017 AAGL.

TI  - Meteo-Marine Parameters from Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery: Towards Near Real-Time Services for the Baltic Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for estimating meteo-marine parameters from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, intended for near-real-time (NRT) service over the Baltic Sea, is presented and validated. Total significant wave height data are retrieved with an empirical function CWAVE_S1-IW, which combines spectral analysis of Sentinel-1A/B Interferometric Wide swath (IW) subscenes with wind data derived with common C-Band Geophysical Model Functions (GMFs). In total, 15 Sentinel-1A/B scenes (116 acquisitions) over the Baltic Sea were processed for comparison with off-shore sea state measurements (52 collocations) and coastal wind measurements (357 colocations). Sentinel-1 wave height was spatially compared with WAM wave model results (Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The comparison of SAR-derived wave heights shows good agreement with measured wave heights correlation r of 0.88 and with WAM model (r = 0.85). The wind speed estimated from SAR images yields good agreement with in situ data (r = 0.91). The study demonstrates that the wave retrievals from Sentinel-1 IW data provide valuable information for operational and statistical monitoring of wave conditions in the Baltic Sea. The data is valuable for model validation and interpretation in regions where, and during periods when, in situ measurements are missing. The Sentinel-1 A/B wave retrievals provide more detailed information about spatial variability of the wave field in the coastal zone compared to in situ measurements, altimetry wave products and model forecast. Thus, SAR data enables estimation of storm locations and areal coverage. Methods shown in the study are implemented in NRT service in German Aerospace Center's (DLR) ground station Neustrelitz.

TI  - Urban Expansion Occurred at the Expense of Agricultural Lands in the Tarai Region of Nepal from 1989 to 2016
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent rapid urbanization in developing countries presents challenges for sustainable environmental planning and peri-urban cropland management. An improved understanding of the timing and pattern of urbanization is needed to determine how to better plan urbanization for the near future. Here, we describe the spatio-temporal patterns of urbanization and related land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes in the Tarai region of Nepal, as well as discuss the factors underlying its rapid urban expansion. Analyses are based on regional time-series Landsat 5, 7 and 8 image classifications for six years between 1989 and 2016, representing the first long-term observations of their kind for Nepal. During this 27-year period, gains in urban cover and losses of cultivated lands occurred widely. Urban cover occupied 221.1 km(2) in 1989 and increased 320% by 2016 to a total 930.22 km(2). Cultivated land was the primary source of new urban cover. Of the new urban cover added since 1989,93% was formerly cultivated. Urban expansion occurred at moderately exponential rates over consecutive observation periods, with nearly half of all urban expansion occurring during 2006-2011 (305 km(2)). The annual rate of urban growth during 1989-1996 averaged 3.3% but reached as high as 8.09% and 12.61% during 1996-2001 and 2011-2016, respectively. At the district level, the rate of urban growth and, by extension, agricultural loss, were weakly related to total population growth. Variability in this relationship suggests that concerted urban-growth management may reduce losses of agricultural lands relative to historic trends despite further population growth and urbanization. Urbanization and LULC change in the Tarai region are attributable to significant inter-regional migration in a context of poor urban planning and lax policies controlling the conversion and fragmentation of peri-urban cultivated lands. Urban expansion and farmland loss are expected to continue in the future.

TI  - The Fractal Nature of Planetary Landforms and Implications to Geologic Mapping
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary product of planetary geologic and geomorphologic mapping is a group of lines and polygons that parameterize planetary surfaces and landforms. Many different research fields use those shapes to conduct their own analyses, and some of those analyses require measurement of the shape's perimeter or line length, sometimes relative to a surface area. There is a general lack of discussion in the relevant literature of the fact that perimeters of many planetary landforms are not easily parameterized by a simple aggregation of lines or even curves, but they instead display complexity across a large range of scale lengths; in fewer words, many planetary landforms are fractals. Because of their fractal nature, instead of morphometric properties converging on a single value, those properties will change based on the scale used to measure them. Therefore, derived properties can change-in some cases, by an order of magnitude or more-just when the measuring length scale is altered. This can result in significantly different interpretations of the features. Conversely, instead of a problem, analysis of the fractal properties of some landforms has led to diagnostic criteria that other remote sensing data cannot easily provide. This paper outlines the basic issue of the fractal nature of planetary landforms, gives case studies where the effects become important, and provides the recommendation that geologic mappers consider characterizing the fractal dimension of their mapped units via a relatively simple, straightforward calculation.Plain Language Summary Planetary scientists will create geologic maps of a surface to perform different kinds of studies. Geologic maps identify features of different types and help to distill many different kinds of data into an easier to use format from which scientific investigations can be done. An analysis that is not often done, but I argue in this work should be done, is examining how mapped features vary when one uses a different measuring stick. This issue is popularized by the "infinite coastline of Britain" problem, where the coastline of Britain and, indeed, all landmasses, continuously increases the smaller one's measuring length scale gets. This concept of complexity at many different scales is the idea behind the mathematical concept of a fractal. I demonstrate in this work that fractal considerations should be factored into geologic mapping and associated analyses, for interpretations can change when phenomena like this are considered.

TI  - Soil temperature effects on the structure and diversity of plant and invertebrate communities in a natural warming experiment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - 1. Global warming is predicted to significantly alter species physiology, biotic interactions and thus ecosystem functioning, as a consequence of coexisting species exhibiting a wide range of thermal sensitivities. There is, however, a dearth of research examining warming impacts on natural communities.2. Here, we used a natural warming experiment in Iceland to investigate the changes in above-ground terrestrial plant and invertebrate communities along a soil temperature gradient (10 degrees C-30 degrees C).3. The alpha-diversity of plants and invertebrates decreased with increasing soil temperature, driven by decreasing plant species richness and increasing dominance of certain invertebrate species in warmer habitats. There was also greater species turnover in both plant and invertebrate communities with increasing pairwise temperature difference between sites. There was no effect of temperature on percentage cover of vegetation at the community level, driven by contrasting effects at the population level.4. There was a reduction in the mean body mass and an increase in the total abundance of the invertebrate community, resulting in no overall change in community biomass. There were contrasting effects of temperature on the population abundance of various invertebrate species, which could be explained by differential thermal tolerances and metabolic requirements, or may have been mediated by changes in plant community composition.5. Our study provides an important baseline from which the effect of changing environmental conditions on terrestrial communities can be tracked. It also contributes to our understanding of why community-level studies of warming impacts are imperative if we are to disentangle the contrasting thermal responses of individual populations.

TI  - The importance of forest structure for carbon fluxes of the Amazon rainforest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise descriptions of forest productivity, biomass, and structure are essential for understanding ecosystem responses to climatic and anthropogenic changes. However, relations between these components are complex, in particular for tropical forests.We developed an approach to simulate carbon dynamics in the Amazon rainforest including around 410 billion individual trees within 7.8 million km(2). We integrated canopy height observations from space-borne LIDAR in order to quantify spatial variations in forest state and structure reflecting small-scale to large-scale natural and anthropogenic disturbances.Under current conditions, we identified the Amazon rainforest as a carbon sink, gaining 0.56 GtC per year. This carbon sink is driven by an estimated mean gross primary productivity (GPP) of 25.1 tC ha(-1) a(-1), and a mean woody aboveground net primary productivity (wANPP) of 4.2 tC ha(-1) a(-1). We found that successional states play an important role for the relations between productivity and biomass. Forests in early to intermediate successional states are the most productive, and woody above-ground carbon use efficiencies are non-linear. Simulated values can be compared to observed carbon fluxes at various spatial resolutions (> 40 m). Notably, we found that our GPP corresponds to the values derived from MODIS. For NPP, spatial differences can be observed due to the consideration of forest successional states in our approach.We conclude that forest structure has a substantial impact on productivity and biomass. It is an essential factor that should be taken into account when estimating current carbon budgets or analyzing climate change scenarios for the Amazon rainforest.

TI  - An approach to hydrogeological modeling of a large system of groundwater-fed lakes and wetlands in the Nebraska Sand Hills, USA
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The feasibility of a hydrogeological modeling approach to simulate several thousand shallow groundwater-fed lakes and wetlands without explicitly considering their connection with groundwater is investigated at the regional scale (similar to 40,000 km(2)) through an application in the semi-arid Nebraska Sand Hills (NSH), USA. Hydraulic heads are compared to local land-surface elevations from a digital elevation model (DEM) within a geographic information system to assess locations of lakes and wetlands. The water bodies are inferred where hydraulic heads exceed, or are above a certain depth below, the land surface. Numbers of lakes and/or wetlands are determined via image cluster analysis applied to the same 30-m grid as the DEM after interpolating both simulated and estimated heads. The regional water-table map was used for groundwater model calibration, considering MODIS-based net groundwater recharge data. Resulting values of simulated total baseflow to interior streams are within 1% of observed values. Locations, areas, and numbers of simulated lakes and wetlands are compared with Landsat 2005 survey data and with areas of lakes from a 1979-1980 Landsat survey and the National Hydrography Dataset. This simplified process-based modeling approach avoids the need for field-based morphology or water-budget data from individual lakes or wetlands, or determination of lake-groundwater exchanges, yet it reproduces observed lake-wetland characteristics at regional groundwater management scales. A better understanding of the NSH hydrogeology is attained, and the approach shows promise for use in simulations of groundwater-fed lake and wetland characteristics in other large groundwater systems.

TI  - Correction for the Impact of the Surface Characteristics on the Estimation of the Effective Emissivity at Fine Resolution in Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Most of the methods used to retrieve land surface temperature (LST) from thermal infrared (TIR) satellite data in urban areas do not take into account the complexity of the surface. Cities are characterized by high surface roughness and one of the main constraints to estimate LST over those areas is the difficulty to define an effective emissivity for a given pixel at a given scale. When working with mixed pixels, the emissivity used to estimate the LST is an effective emissivity composed of the emissivities of each basic element constituting the pixel. In urban areas, the surface geometry has a strong impact on this effective emissivity. Its estimation from TIR satellite data must be carried out considering multiple surface reflections and diffusions within the urban canopy in order to retrieve accurate LST values. The objective of this study is then to evaluate the impact of the surface geometry within the pixel on effective emissivity estimation and to propose a method to derive an effective emissivity corrected for those effects. Emissivity can be derived at 90 m of spatial resolution from the TIR data acquired by ASTER. To evaluate the impact of the geometry at the scale of an ASTER pixel, several urban canyon configurations are designed to develop and test the correction method. The basic principle behind the method is to accurately estimate the downwelling TIR radiation received by a pixel integrating contributions from both the atmosphere and the scene inside this pixel and then derive the corrected effective emissivity from ASTER data using the TES (temperature emissivity separation) algorithm. First, the total downwelling TIR radiation is estimated from the geometric characteristics of the scene, using morphological indicators and integrating the non-isothermal behavior of the pixel thanks to 3D thermo-radiative model simulations. The validation of those estimations for each canyon configuration provides a maximum RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) value of 2.2 Wm(-2). The validation performed over a district extracted from the 3D numerical model of Strasbourg (France) shows a RMSE of 2.5 Wm(-2). Once the method to estimate the total downwelling TIR radiation is validated, LSE and LST maps are retrieved from an ASTER image over three districts of Strasbourg, showing that accounting for the surface geometry highlights thermal behavior differences inside districts, and that the impact of the geometry seems more influenced by building height than street width or building density.

M3  - Article
AB  - This work addresses the generation of high quality digital surface models by fusing multiple depths maps calculated with the dense image matching method. The algorithm is adapted to very high resolution multi-view satellite images, and the main contributions of this work are in the multi-view fusion. The algorithm is insensitive to outliers, takes into account the matching quality indicators, handles non correlated zones (e.g. occlusions), and is solved with a multi-directional dynamic programming approach. No geometric constraints (e.g. surface planarity) or auxiliary data in form of ground control points are required for its operation. Prior to the fusion procedures, the RPC geolocation parameters of all images are improved in a bundle block adjustment routine. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on two VHR (Very High Resolution)-satellite image datasets (Pleiades, WorldView-3) revealing its good performance in reconstructing non-textured areas, repetitive patterns, and surface discontinuities.

TI  - Spatially enhanced passive microwave derived soil moisture: Capabilities and opportunities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Low frequency passive microwave remote sensing is a proven technology for providing soil moisture estimates, but the coarse resolution of its data restricts the range of applications. Downscaling, otherwise known as disaggregation, has been proposed as the solution to spatially enhance these coarse resolution soil moisture observations, through association with complementary observations, or ancillary information about land surface features at higher spatial resolution. Such information includes solar reflectance, thermal emission, passive microwave emissions at a higher frequency, radar backscatter, soil or surface attributes such as topography and soil properties, and land surface modelling. Each of these ancillary data sources has its own strengths and limitations in terms of, for example, sensitivity to surface soil moisture dynamics and availability. This paper provides an extensive review of the capabilities and opportunities of current soil moisture downscaling approaches which provide a deterministic pattern of soil moisture, together with their strengths and limitations.

AB  - The present study aims to detect and evaluate the groundwater quality in Siwa Oasis using chemical and remote sensing data analysis. To carry out this goal, the data of Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images have been used to discriminate the lithological rock units. ALOS radar remote sensing data with spatial resolution 12.5 m has been used to emphasize the predominant fault trends as well as detection of the buried structures. The chemical analysis of 39 groundwater samples was used to evaluate the suitability of groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes by comparing those parameters with World Health Organization standards. Seventy-seven percent of the collected water samples are unsuitable for drinking. About 82% of the studied water samples are unsuitable for the industry. According to salinity index, SAR, Na%, magnesium hazard and Kelley ratio, most of the collected groundwater samples are considered unsuitable for irrigation purposes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitative analysis of urban sprawl enables to understand the status, growth, direction, spatial pattern of urban growth. Spatio-temporal change analysis is essential to monitor and understand LULC dynamics. Present study illustrate use of IRS LISS4 and LANDSAT-5 (MSS) remote sensing data of 1991-2015, for change detection of LULC by quadrant and spatial metrics analysis in Class-1 town of Khammam in Telangana in south central India. Study revealed that extent of built-up area grew over 3.78-22.43 km(2) in 15 years by > 500% pushing beyond municipal limits and onto peri urban area. Development of urban sprawl into peri urban area has been around 8 km(2) during 2001-2015. Six landscape metrics were used to analyze to understand landscape characteristics in relation to urban growth size, shape, pattern; LecoS tool of QuantumGIS was used to compute Number of Patches, Patch Density, Edge Length, Fractal Dimension Index, Shannon's Diversity Index and Shannon's Equitable index. Results indicate that fragmentation of LULC increased due to pressure of anthropogenic activity. Core area of Khammam town is dense with single patch and compact shape, whereas, new patches of built up area of town are fragmented. Agriculture area is dominant patch with higher edge length. SDI value: 1.39 and SEI: 0.66 in 2015, show high diversity and low evenness among classes; dispersed fragmented outgrowth of urban sprawl, mostly towards NE and Eastern directions in a 'leap-frog pattern'.

TI  - Deforestation Drivers in Tehsil Barawal, Dir Upper, Pakistan
T2  - Pakistan Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research Series B-Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area Tehsil Barawal, district Dir (U) of forest has facing serious problems of deforestation. The forest of the study area is ever green forest trees like (Cedras deodar, Abies pindrow, Pinus roxbergii, Picea smithiana and Pinus wallichiana) are dominate trees. The focus of the study area was to explore the various drivers of the deforestation. The study was based on field survey and GIS and remote sensing techniques. The results of field survey revealed that there are seven drivers of deforestation, source of income from forest, fuel forest collection, illiteracy rate, agriculture expansion, forest fire, illegal cutting/harvesting and encroachment. The field survey shows that 40% people agreed that the major driver of deforestation in the area is agriculture. Study was based on the GIS and remote sensing techniques to explore the various drivers of the deforestation from year 2000 and 2012. In this study the images of 2000 and 2012 were downloaded from landsat 5 satellite. Five key classes such as forest, agriculture, barren land, snow and water were acknowledged. The result showed that the study area Tehsil Barawal, District Dir (U) of forest, barren land, agriculture, water and snow in year 2000 was 49.54, 43.38, 5.19, 1.40 and 0.49%, and the area in 2012 was 37.17, 41.36, 12.69, 5.05 and 3.72%, respectively. After data analysis it was cleared that 2.02% decrease in barren land, 12.37% decrease in forest and 7.5% increase in agriculture land was identified. Therefore, from field as well as from GIS and RS results it was cleared that agriculture is the key driver of the deforestation study area.

TI  - Evaluation of Unified Algorithms for Remote Sensing of Chlorophyll-a and Turbidity in Lake Shinji and Lake Nakaumi of Japan and the Vaal Dam Reservoir of South Africa under Eutrophic and Ultra-Turbid Conditions
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated unified algorithms for remote sensing of chlorophyll-a (Chla) and turbidity in eutrophic and ultra-turbid waters such as Japan's Lake Shinji and Lake Nakaumi (SJNU) and the Vaal Dam Reservoir (VDR) in South Africa. To realize this objective, we used 38 remote sensing reflectance (R-rs), Chla and turbidity datasets collected in these waters between July 2016 and March 2017. As a result, we clarified the following items. As a unified Chla model, we obtained strong correlation (R-2 = 0.7, RMSE = 2 mg m(-3)) using a two-band model (2-BM) and three-band model (3-BM), with R-rs(687)/R-rs(672) and [R-rs(-1)(687) - R-rs(-1)(672)] x R-rs(832). As a unified turbidity model, we obtained strong correlation (R-2 = 0.7, RMSE = 260 NTU) using 2-BM and 3-BM, with R-rs(763)/R-rs(821) and R-rs(810) - [R-rs(730) + R-rs(770)]/2. When targeting the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager (MSI) frequency band, we focused on MSI Bands 4 and 5 (R-rs(740) and R-rs(775)) for the Chla algorithm. When optically separating SJNU and VDR data, it is effective to use the slopes of MSI Bands 3 and 4 (R-rs(560) and R-rs(665)) and the slopes of MSI Bands 7 and 9 (R-rs(775) and R-rs(865)).

TI  - Influenza-associated severe acute respiratory infections in 2 sentinel sites in Lebanon-September 2015 to August 2016
T2  - INFLUENZA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY VIRUSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Given the sparse information on the burden of influenza in Lebanon, the Ministry of Public Health established a sentinel surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) to identify the attribution of influenza to reported cases. We aim to highlight the proportion of influenza-associated SARI from September 1st, 2015 to August 31st, 2016 in 2 Lebanese hospitals.Methods: The study was conducted in 2 sentinel sites located in Beirut suburbs and southern province of Lebanon. WHO's 2011 standardized SARI case definition was used. Data from September 1, 2015 to August 31, 2016 were reviewed, and all-cause hospital admission numbers were obtained. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected and tested by RT-PCR. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted using STATA 13.Results: The 2 sentinel sites reported 746 SARI cases during the studied time frame: 467 from the southern province site and 279 from the Beirut suburbs site. SARI reports peaked between January and March 2016. All, except 4, cases were sampled, and a co-dominance of influenza B (43%) and influenza A (H1N1) (41%) was evident. A high proportion of cases was reported in children <2 years 274 (37%). The proportional contribution of influenza-associated SARI to all-cause hospital admissions was high in children <2 years in the south (4.5% [95% CI: 3.1-6.5]) and in children <5 years in Beirut (0.7% [95% CI: 0.6-0.8]).Conclusion: This is the first study to highlight the proportion of influenza-associated SARI in 2 hospitals in Lebanon. The findings will be beneficial for supporting respiratory prevention and immunization program policies.

TI  - A modified temporal criterion to meta-optimize the extended Kalman filter for land cover classification of remotely sensed time series
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Humans are transforming land cover at an ever-increasing rate. Accurate geographical maps on land cover, especially rural and urban settlements are essential to planning sustainable development. Time series extracted from MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface reflectance products have been used to differentiate land cover classes by analyzing the seasonal patterns in reflectance values. The proper fitting of a parametric model to these time series usually requires several adjustments to the regression method. To reduce the workload, a global setting of parameters is done to the regression method for a geographical area. In this work we have modified a meta-optimization approach to setting a regression method to extract the parameters on a per time series basis. The standard deviation of the model parameters and magnitude of residuals are used as scoring function. We successfully fitted a triply modulated model to the seasonal patterns of our study area using a non-linear extended Kalman filter (EKF). The approach uses temporal information which significantly reduces the processing time and storage requirements to process each time series. It also derives reliability metrics for each time series individually. The features extracted using the proposed method are classified with a support vector machine and the performance of the method is compared to the original approach on our ground truth data.

TI  - Use of vaccines and factors associated with their uptake variability in dogs, cats and rabbits attending a large sentinel network of veterinary practices across Great Britain
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vaccination remains a mainstay of companion animal population health. However, how vaccine use at a population level complies with existing guidelines is unknown. Here we use electronic health records to describe vaccination in dogs, cats and rabbits attending a large sentinel network of UK veterinary practices. In total, 77.9% (95% CI: 77.6-78.1) of animals had recorded vaccinations. The percentage of animals with recorded vaccinations was higher in dogs, neutered animals, in insured dogs and cats and in purebred dogs. Vaccination rates varied in different regions of Great Britain in all species. Dogs and cats belonging to owners living in less deprived areas of England and Scotland were more likely to be recorded as vaccinated. In the vaccinated population, cats received more core vaccines per year of life (0.86) than dogs (0.75), with feline leukaemia vaccines almost as frequent as core vaccines. In dogs, leptospira vaccines were more frequent than core vaccines. This descriptive study suggests a substantial proportion of animals are not benefiting from vaccine protection. For the first time, we identify potential factors associated with variations in recorded vaccination frequency, providing a critical baseline against which to monitor future changes in companion animal vaccination and evidence to inform future targeted health interventions.

TI  - What is an open mind?
T2  - PHILOSOPHY & SOCIAL CRITICISM
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I suggest that an open mind wholly unburdened by preconceptions and prejudgments is a mistaken ideal. Not only is it unrealistic; it deprives us of context and background knowledge relevant to judging well. I begin with two cases that show how the ideal of the prejudice-free mind, though appealing, may end up thwarting good judgment: blind assessment and blank-slate jury selection (the ideal of empaneling jurors without prejudgments). I then trace the prejudice-free ideal to the Enlightenment, exposing its roots in the subject-object worldview. Drawing on Heidegger, I suggest that the subject-object worldview is misguided and that all judgment involves a prior understanding of the matter we judge. To have an open mind, paradoxically, is to have a stake in defending a prior understanding, to be possessed of an understanding of the good that one wishes (at least provisionally) to promote. I then draw out the implications of this view for how we might make sense of cultural differences, examining the difference between the practice of marriage based on a romantic conception of love, and that of arranged marriage. By thinking through these two practices, seemingly opposed, we can arrive at a conception of marriage and love that preserves both.

TI  - A global map of mangrove forest soil carbon at 30 m spatial resolution
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the growing recognition that effective action on climate change will require a combination of emissions reductions and carbon sequestration, protecting, enhancing and restoring natural carbon sinks have become political priorities. Mangrove forests are considered some of the most carbon-dense ecosystems in the world with most of the carbon stored in the soil. In order for mangrove forests to be included in climate mitigation efforts, knowledge of the spatial distribution of mangrove soil carbon stocks are critical. Current global estimates do not capture enough of the finer scale variability that would be required to inform local decisions on siting protection and restoration projects. To close this knowledge gap, we have compiled a large georeferenced database of mangrove soil carbon measurements and developed a novel machine-learning based statistical model of the distribution of carbon density using spatially comprehensive data at a 30 m resolution. This model, which included a prior estimate of soil carbon from the global SoilGrids 250 m model, was able to capture 63% of the vertical and horizontal variability in soil organic carbon density (RMSE of 10.9 kg m(-3)). Of the local variables, total suspended sediment load and Landsat imagery were the most important variable explaining soil carbon density. Projecting this model across the global mangrove forest distribution for the year 2000 yielded an estimate of 6.4 Pg C for the top meter of soil with an 86-729 Mg C ha(-1) range across all pixels. By utilizing remotely-sensed mangrove forest cover change data, loss of soil carbon due to mangrove habitat loss between 2000 and 2015 was 30-122 Tg C with >75% of this loss attributable to Indonesia, Malaysia and Myanmar. The resulting map products from this work are intended to serve nations seeking to include mangrove habitats in payment-for ecosystem services projects and in designing effective mangrove conservation strategies.

TI  - PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES OF THE RIVER BASIN OF RONCADOR RIVER ASSOCIATED TO THE LANDSCAPE CHANGE IN THE MUNICIPALITY OF MAGE, RIO DE JANEIRO-BRAZIL
T2  - BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to conduct a temporal analysis of biophysical attributes of the river basin of Rio Roncador, located in the municipality of Mage, Rio de Janeiro. SRTM data were used for the determination of the river basin morphometry and two images of the orbital platform Landsat5 TM sensor (01/28/1986 and 02/15/2010) applied the SEBAL algorithm to characterize the landscape dynamics. The results indicate that The river basin has a drainage area equivalent to 186.21 km(2), perimeter 101.78 km, circularity index equal to 0.22, form factor 0.26 and compares index 2.09. These results indicate that the river basin is not prone to flooding, mainly due to its elongated form. It was possible to verify that in the interval of 24 years, degradation occurred in the region beyond the change in the coverage of the soil of the river basin. The results indicated a tendency of reduction in the areas of permanent preservation -13.4% of the river basin. It is concluded that anthropogenic actions were able to alter the surface cover of the soil and that, by the way, may have influenced the water dynamics of the river basin.

TI  - Among Wolves, Ethnography and the Immersive Study of Power
T2  - QUALITATIVE REPORT
M3  - Book Review
AB  - Timothy Pachirat's (2018) Among Wolves: Ethnography and the Immersive Study of Power is an atypical book about doing and thinking about ethnography, presented in play format. I reviewed the book as a doctoral student and novice qualitative researcher as a part of a process to explore a developing interest in ethnography. The book's conversational format intertwined with perspective from acclaimed contemporary ethnographers' work helps both the novice ethnographer with a worldview of what doing ethnography entails and the seasoned ethnographer in thinking about reflexivity. The academic rigor and extensive coverage of issues about power, subjectivity and fieldwork, makes it an essential read for ethnographers and those working in interpretive traditions - irrespective of their experience in respective domains.

TI  - Danger Signals in the ICU
T2  - CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Objectives: Sterile and infectious critical illnesses often result in vasoplegic shock and a robust systemic inflammatory response that are similar in presentation. The innate immune system is at the center of the response to both infectious and traumatic insults. Damage-associated molecular patterns are small molecules that are released from stressed or dying cells. Damage-associated molecular patterns activate pattern recognition receptors and coordinate the leading edge of the innate immune response. This review introduces the concept of damage-associated molecular patterns and how they activate a systemic inflammatory response, specifically in trauma, neurologic injury, and infection. It also explores how, when carried to extremes, damage-associated molecular patterns may even perpetuate multisystem organ failure.Data Sources: Basic and clinical studies were obtained from a PubMed search through August 2017.Study Selection: Articles considered include original articles, review articles, and conference proceedings.Data Extraction: An analysis of scientific, peer-reviewed data was performed. High quality preclinical and clinical studies adjudicated by the authors were included and summarized.Data Synthesis: Pattern recognition receptors respond to damage-associated molecular patterns and then activate inflammatory pathways. Damage-associated molecular patterns have been linked to the recruitment of sentinel leukocytes and the initiation of the inflammatory cascade. Damage-associated molecular patterns have been linked to many conditions in critical care illnesses. Preclinical models have added insight into how they may mediate distant organ dysfunction.Conclusions: Damage-associated molecular pattern activation and release is an important research for intensive care practitioners. It will add to our understanding of the phase and state of the innate immune response to an insult. Early work is encouraging. However, only with improved understanding of damage-associated molecular pattern activation and function, we can perhaps hope to target damage-associated molecular patterns as diagnostic and/or therapeutic modalities in the future.

TI  - GoAmazon2014/5 campaign points to deep-inflow approach to deep convection across scales
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - A substantial fraction of precipitation is associated with meso-scale convective systems (MCSs), which are currently poorly represented in climate models. Convective parameterizations are highly sensitive to the assumptions of an entraining plume model, in which high equivalent potential temperature air from the boundary layer is modified via turbulent entrainment. Here we show, using multiinstrument evidence from the Green Ocean Amazon field campaign (2014-2015; GoAmazon2014/5), that an empirically constrained weighting for inflow of environmental air based on radar wind profiler estimates of vertical velocity and mass flux yields a strong relationship between resulting buoyancy measures and precipitation statistics. This deep-inflow weighting has no free parameter for entrainment in the conventional sense, but to a leading approximation is simply a statement of the geometry of the inflow. The structure further suggests the weighting could consistently apply even for coherent inflow structures noted in field campaign studies for MCSs over tropical oceans. For radar precipitation retrievals averaged over climate model grid scales at the GoAmazon2014/5 site, the use of deep-inflow mixing yields a sharp increase in the probability and magnitude of precipitation with increasing buoyancy. Furthermore, this applies for both mesoscale and smaller-scale convection. Results from reanalysis and satellite data show that this holds more generally: Deep-inflow mixing yields a strong precipitation-buoyancy relation across the tropics. Deep-inflow mixing may thus circumvent inadequacies of current parameterizations while helping to bridge the gap toward representing mesoscale convection in climate models.

TI  - Real-World Data Analytics Fit for Regulatory Decision-Making
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF LAW & MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Healthcare database analyses (claims, electronic health records) have been identified by various regulatory initiatives, including the 21(st) Century Cures Act and Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), as useful supplements to randomized clinical trials to generate evidence on the effectiveness, harm, and value of medical products in routine care. Specific applications include accelerated drug approval pathways and secondary indications for approved medical products. Such real-world data ("RWD") analyses reflect how medical products impact health outside a highly controlled research environment. A constant stream of data from the routine operation of modern healthcare systems that can be analyzed in rapid cycles enables incremental evidence development for regulatory decision-making.Key evidentiary needs by regulators include 1) monitoring of medication performance in routine care, including the effectiveness, safety and value; 2) identifying new patient strata in which a drug may have added value or unacceptable harms; and 3) monitoring targeted utilization. Four broad requirements have been proposed to enable successful regulatory decision-making based on healthcare database analyses (collectively, "MVET"): Meaningful evidence that provides relevant and context-informed evidence sufficient for interpretation, drawing conclusions, and making decisions; valid evidence that meets scientific and technical quality standards to allow causal interpretations: expedited evidence that provides incremental evidence that is synchronized with the decision-making process; and transparent evidence that is audible, reproducible, robust, and ultimately trusted by decision-makers.Evidence generation systems that satisfy MVET requirements to a high degree will contribute to effective regulatory decision-making. Rapid-cycle analytics of healthcare databases is maturing at a time when regulatory overhaul increasingly demands such evidence. Governance, regulations, and data quality are catching up as the utility of this resource is demonstrated in multiple contexts.

TI  - Patients with sentinel lymph node positive melanoma: Who needs completion lymph node dissection?
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for melanoma after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was recently shown to improve regional but not overall survival, likely due to the majority of patients harboring no further nodal disease. We sought to determine predictors of non-sentinel node (NSN) positivity.Methods: Retrospective review of prospectively collected data on melanoma patients undergoing SLNB.Results: 116 patients underwent 119 CLNDs. The incidence of NSN positivity was 17.6%; the average number of positive NSNs in those cases was 1.5. Cervical and inguinofemoral location were most likely to yield positive NSN(s) (40% each). Conversely, the axilla was least likely at 18% (p < 0.001). The average number of nodes harvested was 13 for NSN negative cases and 20 for NSN positive cases (p = 0.005). Tumor thickness increased the probability of positive NSN(s) (OR 1.2, p = 0.02).Conclusions: Tumor thickness and nodal basin were predictors of NSN metastasis, factors that could help determine which patients may benefit from CLND. Further, CLNDs with fewer nodes may inadequately clear residual nodal disease. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Large-scale disturbance legacies and the climate sensitivity of primary <i>Picea abies</i> forests
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the drivers of shifting forest disturbance rates remains a pressing global change issue. Large-scale forest dynamics are commonly assumed to be climate driven, but appropriately scaled disturbance histories are rarely available to assess how disturbance legacies alter subsequent disturbance rates and the climate sensitivity of disturbance. We compiled multiple tree ring-based disturbance histories from primary Picea abies forest fragments distributed throughout five European landscapes spanning the Bohemian Forest and the Carpathian Mountains. The regional chronology includes 11,595 tree cores, with ring dates spanning the years 1750-2000, collected from 560 inventory plots in 37 stands distributed across a 1,000km geographic gradient, amounting to the largest disturbance chronology yet constructed in Europe. Decadal disturbance rates varied significantly through time and declined after 1920, resulting in widespread increases in canopy tree age. Approximately 75% of current canopy area recruited prior to 1900. Long-term disturbance patterns were compared to an historical drought reconstruction, and further linked to spatial variation in stand structure and contemporary disturbance patterns derived from LANDSAT imagery. Historically, decadal Palmer drought severity index minima corresponded to higher rates of canopy removal. The severity of contemporary disturbances increased with each stand's estimated time since last major disturbance, increased with mean diameter, and declined with increasing within-stand structural variability. Reconstructed spatial patterns suggest that high small-scale structural variability has historically acted to reduce large-scale susceptibility and climate sensitivity of disturbance. Reduced disturbance rates since 1920, a potential legacy of high 19th century disturbance rates, have contributed to a recent region-wide increase in disturbance susceptibility. Increasingly common high-severity disturbances throughout primary Picea forests of Central Europe should be reinterpreted in light of both legacy effects (resulting in increased susceptibility) and climate change (resulting in increased exposure to extreme events).

TI  - Radiometric Performance of the TerraSAR-X Mission over More Than Ten Years of Operation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The TerraSAR-X mission, based on two satellites, has produced SAR data products of high quality for a number of scientific and commercial applications for more than ten years. To guarantee the stability and the reliability of these highly accurate SAR data products, both systems were first accurately calibrated during their respective commissioning phases and have been permanently monitored since then. Based on a short description of the methods applied, this paper focuses on the radiometric performance including the gain and phase properties of the transmit/receiver modules, the antenna pattern checked by evaluating scenes acquired over uniformly distributed targets and the radiometric stability derived from permanently deployed point targets. The outcome demonstrates the remarkable performance of both systems since their respective launch.

TI  - Benthic-pelagic coupling and bottom-up forcing in rocky intertidal communities along the Atlantic Canadian coast
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Benthic species from rocky intertidal systems are irregularly distributed along marine coastlines. Nearshore pelagic conditions often help to explain such variation, but most such studies have been done on eastern ocean boundary coasts. We investigated possible benthic-pelagic coupling along the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia, a western ocean boundary coast. In 2014, we surveyed high-intertidal habitats from nine wave-exposed bedrock locations spanning 415 km of coastline. At each location in the spring, we measured the recruitment of barnacles and mussels, the two main filter-feeders. Recruitment varied irregularly along the coast. Satellite data on coastal phytoplankton and particulate organic carbon (food for intertidal filter-feeders and their pelagic larvae) and in-situ data on sea surface temperature explained, to varying degrees, the geographic structure of recruitment. In turn, the summer abundance of barnacles and mussels was positively related to their spring recruitment. Ultimately, intertidal predator (dogwhelk) abundance was positively related to the recruitment and/or abundance of barnacles and mussels (the main prey of dogwhelks). Sea ice may also have influenced this predator-prey interaction. Drift ice leaving the Gulf of St. Lawrence in late winter strongly disturbed the northern surveyed locations, making barnacles (through high spring recruitment) the only food source for dogwhelks (which survived ice scour in crevices) in such places. Overall, this study supports the occurrence of benthic-pelagic coupling and bottom-up forcing on this coast. Investigating the oceanographic drivers of pelagic food supply and seawater temperature should help to further understand how this large metacommunity is organized.

TI  - Fluorescence in rectal cancer surgery
T2  - ANNALS OF LAPAROSCOPIC AND ENDOSCOPIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Fluorescence image-guided surgery (FIGS) is a relatively emerging optical surgical navigation modality. In the present overview, we will outline the potential role of FIGS applied to rectal oncological surgery. FIGS enables accurate real-time evaluation of bowel perfusion. It allows to visualize the draining lymphatics, providing intraoperative mapping and sentinel node identification to tailor the optimal oncological resection. Critical structures, including ureters, can be highlighted by means of fluorescence to prevent inadvertent injuries. Cancer-specific fluorescent molecules allow to precisely evaluate radical tumor removal and to estimate the surgical margins. Fluorescence-enhanced endoscopy might improve the diagnostic yield.

TI  - Improved environmental monitoring of surface geothermal features through comparisons of thermal infrared, satellite remote sensing and terrestrial calorimetry
T2  - GEOTHERMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing changes in surface heat-loss at geothermally active areas provides insight into the geothermal reservoirs at depth. Surface temperatures and heat output of steam-heated ground can be inferred through processing of thermal infrared images, as well as by direct measurements using terrestrial calorimetry. In February 2014, a high resolution aerial thermal infrared (TIR) survey and a terrestrial heat-loss survey (excluding fumarole discharge) were carried out over Karapiti (ca. 0.35 Km(2) in the Wairakei-Tauhara Geothermal System) in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New Zealand. Estimates of heat-loss are compared to those calculated from TIR data collected by the Landsat-8 satellite of the area. This paper discusses the processing techniques for the datasets and compares inferred surface heat losses. The aerial TIR and terrestrial measurements are in reasonable agreement with calculated surface heat-loss values for Karapiti range from 41 MW (theoretical radiation heat loss using aerial TIR) to 58 MW (total heat loss based on an empirical correlation with boiling-point depths). Satellite images show a large variation between day-time and night-time TIR assessments. The assessment of nocturnal (non-solar), radiation heat-loss is an order of magnitude lower than the total heat-loss determined from the other techniques and approximately 1/3 of the inferred radiated component calculated from the aerial TIR data. This is likely to be a consequence of diffuse, advecting-steam heat-loss, combined with an image resolution issue: the pixel resolution of the satellite image (30 x 30 m) is much larger than the typical size of the active geothermal surface manifestations (< 10 m(2)). Because the radiated heat-loss is a non-linear function of land surface temperature, the in-pixel averaging under-estimates the radiated heat-loss. These and other problems currently restrict the usefulness of repeat low-resolution satellite imagery for monitoring of surface heat loss changes in steam-heated ground.

TI  - Leaf phenology paradox: Why warming matters most where it is already warm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Interactions between climate and ecosystem properties that control phenological responses to climate warming and drought are poorly understood. To determine contributions from these interactions, we used space-borne remotely sensed vegetation indices to monitor leaf development across climate gradients and ecoregions in the southeastern United States. We quantified how air temperature, drought severity, and canopy thermal stress contribute to changes in leaf flushing from mountainous to coastal plain regions by developing a hierarchical state-space Bayesian model. We synthesized daily field climate data with daily vegetation indices and canopy surface temperature during spring green-up season at 59 sites in the southeastern United States between 2001 and 2012. Our results demonstrated strong interaction effects between ecosystem properties and climate variables across ecoregions. We found spring green-up is faster in the mountains, while coastal forests express a larger sensitivity to inter-annual temperature anomalies. Despite our detection of a decreasing trend in sensitivity to warming with temperature in all regions, we identified an ecosystem interaction: Deciduous dominated forests are less sensitive to warming than are those with fewer deciduous trees, likely due to the continuous presence of leaves in evergreen species throughout the season. Mountainous forest green-up is more susceptible to intensifying drought and moisture deficit, while coastal areas are relatively resilient. We found that with increasing canopy thermal stress, defined as canopy-air temperature difference, leaf development slows following dry years, and accelerates following wet years.

TI  - Major Strike-Slip Faults Identified Using Satellite Data in Central Borneo, SE Asia
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We use freely available Google satellite data, instrumental seismicity, fault plane solutions, and previously mapped structural and geological maps to identify new fault zones in central Borneo. We have mapped a number of similar to NW-SE trending dextral strike-slip faults and similar to NE-SW to similar to N-S trending sinistral strike-slip fault zones. The geomorphic expression of faulting is shown by the well-developed triangular facets, fault rupture scarps, truncated sedimentary beds, topographic breaks, displaced ridges, deflected streams, faulted Plio-Pleistocene volcanic deposits, and back-tilted Holocene to Recent sedimentary deposits. Some of the mapped faults are actively growing, and show text-book examples of dextral and sinistral offset, which ranges from similar to 450 m to tens of km. The dextral strike-slip fault systems are clearly developed in the central and eastern portions of Borneo where they cut through the folded sedimentary sequences for >220 km. The similar to NE-SW to similar to N-S trending sinistral strike-slip faults are dominantly developed in the eastern portion of central Borneo for >230 km. The geomorphic expression of faulting is clear and the fault scarps are similar to SE facing for the sinistral fault system, and similar to NE facing for the dextral fault system. The age of the faulting is constrained by the cross-cutting relationship where the fault cuts through Plio-Pleistocene volcanic deposits for >30 km, which suggests a neotectonic nature of faulting. The strike-slip fault systems that we have mapped here provide the first geomorphic evidence of large-scale strike-slip faulting in Borneo and suggest the presence of a major sinistral strike-slip fault that runs for >900 km through the center of Borneo, and forms a backbone onto which most of the mapped structures root. The mapped structures clearly suggest that plate tectonic forces dominantly control the geological structures that we have mapped and support the regional oblique convergence that is oblique with respect to the major trend of the Crocker Range, which forms the spine of the Borneo Island.

TI  - Efficient Ground Surface Displacement Monitoring Using Sentinel-1 Data: Integrating Distributed Scatterers (DS) Identified Using Two-Sample <i>t</i>-Test with Persistent Scatterers (PS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) is important for effective displacement monitoring using time-series of SAR data. However, for large stacks of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, the DS analysis using existing algorithms becomes a time-consuming process. Moreover, the whole procedure of DS selection should be repeated as soon as a new SAR acquisition is made, which is challenging considering the short repeat-observation of missions such as Sentinel-1. SqueeSAR is an approach for extracting signals from DS, which first applies a spatiotemporal filter on images and optimizes DS, then incorporates information from both optimized DS and PS points into interferometric SAR (InSAR) time-series analysis. In this study, we followed SqueeSAR and implemented a new approach for DS analysis using two-sample t-test to efficiently identify neighboring pixels with similar behaviour. We evaluated the performance of our approach on 50 Sentinel-1 images acquired over Trondheim in Norway between January 2015 and December 2016. A cross check on the number of the identified neighboring pixels using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which is employed in the SqueeSAR approach, and the t-test shows that their results are strongly correlated. However, in comparison to KS-test, the t-test is less computationally intensive (98% faster). Moreover, the results obtained by applying the tests under different SAR stack sizes from 40 to 10 show that the t-test is less sensitive to the number of images.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Fusion With Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images with different spatial and spectral resolution, such as panchromatic (PAN) images and multispectral (MS) images, can be captured by many earth-observing satellites. Normally, PAN images possess high spatial resolution but low spectral resolution, while MS images have high spectral resolution with low spatial resolution. In order to integrate spatial and spectral information contained in the PAN and MS images, image fusion techniques are commonly adopted to generate remote sensing images at both high spatial and spectral resolution. In this study, based on the deep convolutional neural network, a remote sensing image fusion method that can adequately extract spectral and spatial features from source images is proposed. The major innovation of this study is that the proposed fusion method contains a two branches network with the deeper structure which can capture salient features of the MS and PAN images separately. Besides, the residual learning is adopted in our network to thoroughly study the relationship between the high- and low-resolution MS images. The proposed method mainly consists of two procedures. First, spatial and spectral features are respectively extracted from the MS and PAN images by convolutional layers with different depth. Second, the feature fusion procedure utilizes the extracted features from the former step to yield fused images. By evaluating the performance on the Quick Bird and Gaofen-1 images, our proposed method provides better results compared with other classical methods.

TI  - Association of Marital Status With T Stage at Presentation and Management of Early-Stage Melanoma
T2  - JAMA DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Early detection of melanoma is associated with improved patient outcomes. Data suggest that spouses or partners may facilitate detection of melanoma before the onset of regional and distant metastases. Less well known is the influence of marital status on the detection of early clinically localized melanoma.OBJECTIVE To evaluate the association between marital status and T stage at the time of presentation with early-stage melanoma and the decision for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in appropriate patients.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective, population-based study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database of 18 population-based registered cancer institutes. Patients with cutaneous melanoma who were at least 18 years of age and without evidence of regional or distant metastases and presented from January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2014, were identified for the study. Data were analyzed from September 27 to December 5, 2017.EXPOSURE Marital status, categorized as married, never married, divorced, or widowed.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Clinical T stage at presentation and performance of SLNB for lesions with Breslow thickness greater than 1 mm.RESULTS A total of 52 063 patients were identified (58.8% men and 41.2% women; median age, 64 years; interquartile range, 52-75 years). Among married patients, 16 603 (45.7%) presented with T1a disease, compared with 3253 never married patients (43.0%), 1422 divorced patients (39.0%), and 1461 widowed patients (32.2%) (P < .001). Conversely, 428 widowed patients (9.4%) presented with T4b disease compared with 1188 married patients (3.3%) (P < .001). The association between marital status and higher T stage at presentation remained significant among never married (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.26-1.39; P < .001), divorced (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.30-1.47; P < .001), and widowed (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.60-1.81; P < .001) patients after adjustment for various socioeconomic and patient factors. Independent of T stage and other patient factors, married patients were more likely to undergo SLNB in lesions with Breslow thickness greater than 1 mm, for which SLNB is routinely recommended, compared with never married (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.53-0.65; P < .001), divorced (OR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.76-0.99; P = .03), and widowed (OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.62-0.76; P < .001) patients.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Marital status is associated with earlier presentation of localized melanoma. Moreover, never married, divorced, and widowed patients are less likely to undergo SLNB for appropriate lesions. Marital status should be considered when counseling patients for melanoma procedures and when recommending screening and follow-up to optimize patient care. (C) 2018 American Medical Association.

TI  - Tumor-targeting CuS nanoparticles for multimodal imaging and guided photothermal therapy of lymph node metastasis
T2  - ACTA BIOMATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise diagnosis of lymph node metastasis to guide lymphadenectomy is highly important for gastric cancer therapy in clinics. Though surgical dissection of regional metastatic lymph nodes remains the only way for gastric cancer therapy, the extended dissection may cause unavoidable postoperative risk of complications. It is still lack of effective method enabling the accurate removal of metastatic gastric cancer cells in lymph nodes with minimum injuries to normal tissue. Herein, we report a new fluorescent copper sulfide (CuS) nanoparticle (RGD-CuS-Cy5.5) enabling both non-invasive multimodality imaging and targeting photothermal therapy (PTT) of metastatic gastric cancer cells in lymph nodes. We demonstrate that RGD-CuS-Cy5.5 can easily drain into sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) after injection into primary tumors, and selectively enter into metastatic gastric MNK45 tumor cells via alpha(v) beta(3) integrin-mediated endocytosis. The resulting strong near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence and computed tomography (CT) contrast in metastatic SLN compared to normal SLN can precisely differentiate SLN metastasis of gastric cancers. Guided by the imaging, localized PTT with RGD-CuS-Cy5.5 is conducted upon irradiation with an 808 nm laser, resulting in complete removal of metastatic gastric tumor cells in SLN without obvious toxicity. Moreover, RGD-CuS-Cy5.5 can also allow for the rapid and non-invasive self-monitoring of PTT efficacy against metastatic SLN5 in living mice. This study highlights the potential of using RGD-CuS-Cy5.5 for imaging-guided and targeting PIT of SLN metastasis in vivo, which may be applicable for the metastatic gastric cancer therapy in clinics.

TI  - Formation of the system of anti-stressor reactions as a non-specific basis for health and longevity
T2  - CARDIOMETRY
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - The proposed editorial article touches upon aspects of fundamental medicine associated with the discovery of systems of nonspecific adaptation reactions in the organism as a whole. It is shown that the key law of the organism's response to the actions of the external and internal environment consists in the dependence between the reaction quality and the quantity (measure, intensity) of an acting factor. Revealed is the historical sequence of events in the development of the general adaptation reaction theory, beginning with the creation of the theoretical basis of pathology, i.e. description of the adaptation syndrome of stress reaction by Hans Selye, up to the intimate-ly associated and logically continued studies and discovery of anti-stress-type reactions, namely, the reactions of training and activation, undertaken by Lyubov Garkavi, Maria Ukolova and Elena Kvakina. The characterization of archetypes of previously unknown, independent separate symptom complexes is given herein. The philosophy of adaptation discrete responses provided by the organism to different actions includes a higher stage of research pro-gress, when it would be possible to understand the unique natural ability of periodic repetition of the adaptation reactions tetrad in a very wide range of action intensities.This is an adaptation software designed by Nature that is strategically important for the organism, includ-ing different levels of reactivity on a scale of absolute magnitude, and this phenomenon, like the D.I. Mendeleev's periodic law, determines the possibility of forming the qualitatively different states at the same level (periods) and generating the states of the same name at different levels of reactivity (rows). The same name reactions of different levels differ in the nuances of their energy, peroxide and morpho-functional status that is important for conducting the controlled non-specific therapy in order to elevate the natural resistance of the organism. Activation therapy is a form of a targeted regulation of protective systems, namely, the nervous, endocrine and immune ones, that relies on laws, principles, programmed modes and biotechnology of accompanying therapy and functional rehabilitation that is all relevant for a new worldview: personalized medicine. This triggering mechanism works not in isolation from the individual processes of the organism's response, but under due consideration of its identified adaptive re-sponse types, as a guideline in the treatment. This fundamental basis significantly improves the promising capabilities in solving such critical problems of medicine as oncology, cardiovascular diseases, aging, as well as pediatric, sports and space medicine. We hope that translation of the activation therapy developments into clinical practice will improve health of many people, without any limitations in space and time.

The objective of our study was to extend stability of DTT-treated panel RBCs to 28 days through application of a commercially available panel RBC stabilizer.Materials and MethodsSerological antigen typing and IAT using DARA sera and DARA plasma spiked with weakly reacting alloantibodies was performed up to 28 days after DTT treatment and stabilization.ResultsDTT treatment resulted in loss of Fy-antigen expression on some panel RBCs. Antigen profiles of stabilized, DTT-treated panel RBCs remained stable. Alloantibodies in DARA sera and DARA plasma were reliably detected.ConclusionsApplication of a commercially available RBC stabilizer extends shelf life of DTT-treated panel RBCs to 28 days.

TI  - Establishing the cascade of care for hepatitis C in Englandbenchmarking to monitor impact of direct acting antivirals
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about engagement and retention in care of people diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in England. Establishing a cascade of care informs targeted interventions for improving case finding, referral, treatment uptake and retention in care. Using data from the sentinel surveillance of blood-borne virus (SSBBV) testing between 2005 and 2014, we investigate the continuum of care of those tested for HCV in England. Persons 1year old with an anti-HCV test and subsequent RNA tests between 2005 and 2014 reported to SSBBV were collated. We describe the cascade of care, as the patient pathway from a diagnostic test, referral into care, treatment and patient outcomes. Between 2005 and 2014, 2390507 samples were tested for anti-HCV, corresponding to 1766515 persons. A total of 53038 persons (35190 men and 17165 women) with anti-HCV positive were newly reported to SSBBV. An RNA test was conducted on 77.0% persons who were anti-HCV positive, 72.3% of whom were viraemic (RNA positive) during this time period, 21.4% had evidence of treatment and 3130 49.5% had evidence of a sustained virological response (SVR). In multivariable models, confirmation of viraemia by RNA test varied by age and region/test setting; evidence of treatment varied by age, year of test and region/test setting; and SVR varied by age, year of test and region/setting of test. In conclusion, our findings provide HCV cascade of care estimates prior to the introduction of direct acting antivirals. These findings provide important baseline cascade estimates to benchmark progress towards elimination of HCV as a major public health threat.

TI  - Modelling biodiversity trends in the montado (wood pasture) landscapes of the Alentejo, Portugal
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Montados are dynamic agroforestry systems of southern Portugal, with high economic and ecological values. Changes in land use and cover have important implications for landscape-level biodiversity and its conservation.Objectives Our objectives were to evaluate the biodiversity values and trends in a montado system in the Alentejo, Portugal so as to inform landscape level conservation approaches. In doing so, we aimed to develop a replicable and robust approach drawing together field observation, expert opinion, and remote sensing to produce predictions relevant to land management planning.Methods Field sampling and subsequent analysis of data on the birds, butterflies and plants in eight distinct land covers allowed the identification of two principal habitat groupings of importance: 'montado mosaic' and 'shrubland'. Morphological spatial pattern analysis was performed on Landsat-derived GIS habitat layers for 1984 and 2009, generating maps and statistics for change in the different landscape functional classes. In addition, we demonstrated how the modelling of ecotones between open and closed biomes can identify the preferred hunting grounds of the threatened Iberian lynx and black vulture, flagship species whose conservation provides benefits to the area's wider biodiversity values.Results Total and core area of montado mosaics and shrubland increased over the 25 year period, whilst the amount of habitat connectivity declined in the case of shrubland. Considerable local variation in these trends highlighted targetable areas for conservation action (e.g. through agri-environment spending).Conclusions A rapid and robust approach was demonstrated, with potentially wider utility for biodiversity assessment and planning.

TI  - On the Desiccation of the South Aral Sea Observed from Spaceborne Missions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The South Aral Sea has been massively affected by the implementation of a mega-irrigation project in the region, but ground-based observations have monitored the Sea poorly. This study is a comprehensive analysis of the mass balance of the South Aral Sea and its basin, using multiple instruments from ground and space. We estimate lake volume, evaporation from the lake, and the Amu Darya streamflow into the lake using strengths offered by various remote-sensing data. We also diagnose the attribution behind the shrinking of the lake and its possible future fate. Terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations observed by the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission from the Aral Sea region can approximate water level of the East Aral Sea with good accuracy (1.8% normalized root mean square error (RMSE), and 0.9 correlation) against altimetry observations. Evaporation from the lake is back-calculated by integrating altimetry-based lake volume, in situ streamflow, and Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) precipitation. Different evapotranspiration (ET) products (Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), the Water Gap Hydrological Model (WGHM)), and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Global Evapotranspiration Project (MOD16) significantly underestimate the evaporation from the lake. However, another MODIS based Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory (PT-JPL) ET estimate shows remarkably high consistency (0.76 correlation) with our estimate (based on the water-budget equation). Further, streamflow is approximated by integrating lake volume variation, PT-JPL ET, and GPCP datasets. In another approach, the deseasonalized GRACE signal from the Amu Darya basin was also found to approximate streamflow and predict extreme flow into the lake by one or two months. They can be used for water resource management in the Amu Darya delta. The spatiotemporal pattern in the Amu Darya basin shows that terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the central region (predominantly in the primary irrigation belt other than delta) has increased. This increase can be attributed to enhanced infiltration, as ET and vegetation index (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)) from the area has decreased. The additional infiltration might be an indication of worsening of the canal structures and leakage in the area. The study shows how altimetry, optical images, gravimetric and other ancillary observations can collectively help to study the desiccating Aral Sea and its basin. A similar method can be used to explore other desiccating lakes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOPHOTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urinary bladder imaging is critical to diagnose urinary tract disorders, and bladder cancer. There is a great need for safe, non-invasive, and sensitive imaging technique which enables bladder imaging. Photoacoustic imaging is a rapidly growing imaging technique for various biological applications. It can be combined with clinical ultrasound imaging system for hand-held, dual modal ultrasound-photoacoustic real-time imaging. Structural (bladder wall) and functional (accretion of nanoparticles) bladder imaging is shown here with combined ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging in rats. Photoacoustic images of bladder wall is shown using black ink as the contrast agent. Chicken tissues were stacked on the abdomen of the animal to demonstrate the feasibility of photoacoustic imaging till a depth of 2 cm. Also, the feasibility of photoacoustic imaging for a common bladder disorder, vesicoureteral reflux is studied using urinary tract mimicking phantom. It is also shown that a clinical ultrasound system can be used for photoacoustic imaging of non-invasive clearance study of gold nanorods from circulation by monitoring the gradual accumulation of the gold nanorods in the bladder. The time taken for accumulation of nanorods in the bladder can be used as an indicator of the clearance rate of the nanoparticle circulation from the body.

AB  - Language is powerful. Our words convey our impressions, attitudes, and worldview. Language not only reflects, but also shapes, the way that we think. In the field of bariatric-metabolic surgery, it is critical for clinicians to choose our language thoughtfully. In this paper, we demonstrate the importance of language choices in our clinical work and our professional communications; explore the potential pitfalls of words and phrases commonly used in the field of obesity; and encourage the use of more productive language choices in our communications with patients and professional colleagues, both within and outside of our field.

T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll (ChI) concentration is one of the key indicators identifying changes in the Arctic marine ecosystem. However, current Chl algorithms are not accurate in the Arctic Ocean due to different bio-optical properties from those in the lower latitude oceans. In this study, we evaluated the current Chl algorithms and analyzed the cause of the error in the western coastal waters of Svalbard, which are known to be sensitive to climate change. The NASA standard algorithms showed to overestimate the Chl concentration in the region. This was due to the high non-algal particles (NAP) absorption and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) variability at the blue wavelength. In addition, at lower Chl concentrations (0.1-0.3 mg m(-3)), chlorophyll-specific absorption coefficients were 2.3 times higher than those of other Arctic oceans. This was another reason for the overestimation of ChI concentration. OC4 algorithm based regionally tuned-Svalbard Chl (SC4) algorithm for retrieving more accurate Chl estimates reduced the mean absolute percentage difference (APD) error from 215% to 49%, the mean relative percentage difference (RPD) error from 212% to 16%, and the normalized root mean square (RMS) error from 211% to 68%. This region has abundant suspended matter due to the melting of tidal glaciers. We evaluated the performance of total suspended matter (TSM) algorithms. Previous published TSM algorithms generally overestimated the TSM concentration in this region. The Svalbard TSM-single band algorithm for low TSM range (ST-SB-L) decreased the APD and RPD errors by 52% and 14%, respectively, but the RMS error still remained high (105%).

TI  - ASTER-Derived High-Resolution Ice Surface Temperature for the Arctic Coast
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice surface temperature (IST) controls the rate of sea ice growth and the heat exchange between the atmosphere and ocean. In this study, high- resolution IST using the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared region (TIR) images was retrieved to observe the thermal change of coastal sea ice. The regression coefficients of the multi- channel equation using ASTER brightness temperatures (BT) and MODIS ISTs were derived. MODIS IST products (MOD29) were used as an in situ temperature substitute. The ASTER IST using five channels from band 10 (BT10) to band 14 (BT14) showed an RMSE of 0.746 K for the validation images on the Alaskan coast. The uncertainty of the two- channel (BT13 and BT14) ASTER IST was 0.497 K, which was better than that of the five- channel. We thus concluded that the two- channel equation using ASTER BT13 and BT14 was an optimal model for the surface temperature retrieval of coastal sea ice. The two- channel ASTER IST showed similar accuracy at higher latitudes than in Alaska. Therefore, ASTER- derived IST with 90 m spatial resolution can be used to observe small- scale thermal variations on the sea ice surface along the Arctic coast.

TI  - Surface diurnal warming in the East China Sea derived from satellite remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Process of sea surface diurnal warming has drawn a lot of attention in recent years, but that occurs in shelf seas was rarely addressed. In the present work, surface diurnal warming strength in the East China Sea was calculated by the sea surface temperature (SST) data derived from the MODIS sensors carried by the satellites Aqua and Terra. Due to transit time difference, both the number of valid data and the surface diurnal warming strength computed by the MODIS-Aqua data are relatively larger than Terra. Therefore, the 10-year MODIS-Aqua data from 2005 to 2014 were used to analyze the monthly variability of the surface diurnal warming. Generally, the surface diurnal warming in the East China sea is stronger in summer and autumn but weaker in winter and spring, while it shows different peaks in different regions. Large events with aT >= 5 K have also been discussed. They were found mainly in coastal area, especially near the Changjiang (Yangtze) River estuary. And there exists a high-incidence period from April to July. Furthermore, the relationship between surface diurnal warming and wind speed was discussed. Larger (diurnal warming mainly lies in areas with low wind speed. And its possibility decreases with the increase of wind speed. Events with aT >= 2.5 K rarely occur when wind speed is over 12 m/s. Study on surface diurnal warming in the East China Sea may help to understand the daily scale air-sea interaction in the shelf seas. A potential application might be in the marine weather forecasts by numerical models. Its impact on the coastal eco-system and the activities of marine organisms can also be pursued.

TI  - Weekday AOD smaller than weekend AOD in eastern China on the basis of the MODIS AOD product
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A weekly cycle of surface particulate matter (PM) characterized by smaller values during weekends and larger values during weekdays was reported in eastern China. Whether column-integrated aerosol optical depth (AOD) showed similar weekly cycling as that of PM was debated. The weekly variation of AOD in eastern China was further studied by using the latest MODIS aerosol product (collection 6) with a fine spatial resolution (0.1A degrees) from 2002 to 2015. We used three statistical methods to determine whether the weekly cycle of AOD was significant. AOD during weekdays (Wednesday to Friday) was lower than that during weekends. The maximum and minimum AOD was generally observed on Monday and Wednesday, respectively. This weekly pattern of AOD was in good agreement with previous results based on satellite aerosol products with a coarse spatial resolution, but it was in contrast to that of PM. Further analysis of the AOD weekly variability in 19 provincial cities suggested that AOD during weekdays was smaller than that during weekends in urban regions. Potential causes for the different weekly cycle of PM and AOD in eastern China were discussed.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast: Never justified?
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is not standard of care. However, nodal involvement for DCIS patients is reported. Aim of our study was to identify preoperative features predictive of nodal involvement in DCIS patients. We have retrospectively reviewed 175 patients with a preoperative diagnosis of DCIS following a vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, and undergoing surgery with sentinel node biopsy. Variables distribution was compared between patients upstaged to invasive cancer at final pathology and patients with a confirmed DCIS, and between positive vs negative sentinel node patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed for risk of a positive node. Lymph node biopsy was positive in 13 (7.4%) patients, with 8 (61.5%) macrometastases and 5 (38.5%) micrometastases. In these patients, Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) index >4 (OR 4.69, 95% CI 1.282-17.224, P = .02), lesion extension 20 mm (OR 4.25, 95% CI 1.255-14.447, P = .02), multifocal disease (OR 4.12, 95% CI 0.987-17.174, P = .05), comedo type (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.044-11.969, P = .04), and upstaging (OR 4.56, 95% CI 1.080-19.249, P = .04) were all predictive of nodal involvement, although upstaging could not be predicted preoperatively. By multivariate analysis, the only independent factor predictive for positive sentinel node was multifocal disease (OR 5.14, 95% CI 1.015-26.066, P < .05). A preoperative diagnosis of DCIS, also including advanced biopsy systems such as vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, may be not always sufficient to exclude patients from sentinel node biopsy. DCIS patients with associated BI-RADS >4, lesion extension 20 mm, comedo type, and above all multifocal disease should be considered for axillary evaluation.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The NW Iberian Peninsula (NWIP) coast includes a large diversity of estuarine systems such as Rias, river estuaries and coastal lagoons, being characterized by a high primary production, responsible for the significant fisheries and aquaculture productivity of the region. Thus, the main objective of this study is the development of a novel integrated high-resolution circulation and hydrographic coastal model designed with Delft3D-flow and applied for a large and complex area integrating the NWIP continental shelf and main estuarine systems. A domain decomposition technique was adopted to resolve the complex geomorphology in the study area. This approach allows local refinement in estuarine systems with the capability of two-way communication of water level, currents and hydrographic properties between those areas and the coastal ocean. The model was successfully validated using sea surface elevation, salinity and water temperature data from various observational sources, including remotely sensed images. Numerical calculations show good agreement with the observed water level in the entire domain. In addition, measured salinity and water temperature are well reproduced by the model. Results from two real events (summer 2005 and winter 2012-2013) were compared with remote sensing products, revealing that predictions adequately represent the hydrographic patterns observed. Results showed a complex interaction among estuarine systems as well with the adjacent coast, in addition to the accuracy of the integrated high-resolution numerical model developed in reproducing the hydrodynamic and thermohaline patterns of the NWIP coast and main estuarine systems.

TI  - Accuracy of sentinel lymph node mapping in detecting occult neck metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENDOCRINOLOGY METABOLISM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The objectives of this study were to evaluate the following: 1) the accuracy of sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) in detecting metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), and 2) if SLNM could modify the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging of previous cN0 PTC patients. Subjects and methods: Forty SLNM were performed prospectively in 38 consecutive cN0 PTC patients, with total thyroidectomy and elective compartment neck dissection (CND). The results of SLNM were compared with CND pathological findings to verify the accuracy of sentinel SLNM. Results: The mean patients' follow-up was 36 months. A total of 133 SLN were found at levels VI, II, III and IV. The SLN was identified in 95% of the patients with one false negative, 95% sensitivity, a 94% negative predictive value and 97% accuracy. The SLNM upstaging from cN0 to pN+ was 49%, and to stages III and IVa, it was 21%. Conclusions: For this series of cN0 PTC patients: 1) SLNM accuracy was 97%, and 2) SLNM upstaging from cN0 to pN+ was 49%, whereas to stages III and IVa, it was 21%.

TI  - Seasonal Influenza Vaccine Effectiveness in Preventing Laboratory-Confirmed Influenza in Primary Care in Israel, 2016-2017 Season: Insights Into Novel Age-Specific Analysis
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. The 2016-2017 influenza season in Israel was dominated by the circulation of influenza A(H3N2). Influenza vaccine is recommended for the entire population in Israel aged >6 months. The inactivated influenza vaccine was chosen for use this season.Methods. We estimated the 2016-2017 end-of-season influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) in preventing influenza-like illness due to influenza A(H3N2), using the test-negative design. Age-specific VE was estimated using a moving age window and weekly analysis.Results. During the 2016-2017 season, 1267 samples were collected; 467 (36.9%) were positive for influenza, with 97.9% A(H3N2), 0.2% A(H1N1)pdm09, and 1.9% B. A total of 1088 individuals were found eligible to be included in VE assessment. All vaccinated individuals included in the VE assessment received the inactivated influenza vaccine. Adjusted VE against influenza A(H3N2) was 29.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.3%-49.5%). Age group-specific adjusted VE was 69.2% (95% CI, 19.4%-88.3%) for children aged 5-17 years and 58.8% (95% CI,.8%-82.9%) for adults aged 45-64 years. Other age groups demonstrated lower VE estimates that were not statistically significant. Adjusted VE estimates using a moving window of 15 years and weekly VE analyses provided a more defined understanding of age-specific VE during the 2016-2017 season.Conclusions. Estimating VE using a moving age window as well as weekly VE analysis may provide more detailed information regarding the relationship between VE and age.

TI  - Prognostic value of sentinel lymph node biopsy according to Breslow thickness for cutaneous melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is widely performed for melanoma with certain histologic parameters and offers important prognostic and staging information. Breslow thickness (BT) by itself also provides meaningful prognostic information.Objective: To evaluate whether SLN status provides prognostic information independent from that which is already provided by BT.Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 896 patients who underwent SLN biopsy for primary cutaneous melanoma. Stratified analysis of the impact of SLN status within BT groups (0.01-1 mm, 1.01-2.00 mm, 2.01-4.00 mm, and >4.00 mm) was performed. In addition, a Cox proportional hazard model was fit to evaluate the interaction between BT unadjusted and then adjusted for SLN status to determine whether predictive ability is improved.Results: Having a negative SLN did not confer a statistically significant survival advantage for any BT subgroup (P=.54,.075,.17, and .95 for subgroups 0.01-1 mm, 1.01-2.00 mm, 2.01-4.00 mm, and >4.00 mm, respectively). In multivariate analysis, SLN status did not demonstrate independent prognostic ability over that of BT alone (P=.067).Limitations: Retrospective study, single institution.Conclusion: Our data suggest that SLN status does not offer better prognostic information for patients than BT alone.

TI  - Wave Attenuation Through an Arctic Marginal Ice Zone on 12 October 2015: 1. Measurement of Wave Spectra and Ice Features From Sentinel 1A
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A storm with significant wave heights exceeding 4 m occurred in the Beaufort Sea on 11-13 October 2015. The waves and ice were captured on 12 October by the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) on board Sentinel-1A, with Interferometric Wide swath images covering 400 x 1,100 km at 10 m resolution. This data set allows the estimation of wave spectra across the marginal ice zone (MIZ) every 5 km, over 400 km of sea ice. Since ice attenuates waves with wavelengths shorter than 50 m in a few kilometers, the longer waves are clearly imaged by SAR in sea ice. Obtaining wave spectra from the image requires a careful estimation of the blurring effect produced by unresolved wavelengths in the azimuthal direction. Using in situ wave buoy measurements as reference, we establish that this azimuth cutoff can be estimated in mixed ocean-ice conditions. Wave spectra could not be estimated where ice features such as leads contribute to a large fraction of the radar backscatter variance. The resulting wave height map exhibits a steep decay in the first 100 km of ice, with a transition into a weaker decay further away. This unique wave decay pattern transitions where large-scale ice features such as leads become visible. As in situ ice information is limited, it is not known whether the decay is caused by a difference in ice properties or a wave dissipation mechanism. The implications of the observed wave patterns are discussed in the context of other observations.Plain Language Summary Our work entitled Wave attenuation through an Arctic marginal ice zone on 12 October 2015. 1. Measurement of wave spectra and ice features from Sentinel-1A, uses a newly developed method to extract wave spectra from radar imagery over sea ice. This is possible since the sea ice rapidly removes the short waves which usually distort the radar imagery. We are able to estimate thousands of wave spectra across several hundred kilometers at kilometer-scale resolution for the first large-scale view of wave attenuation across the marginal ice zone. Our results show a unique wave attenuation pattern described by a piecewise exponential decay that changes by a factor of 10. The transition between the different wave attenuation regions occurs near a change in sea ice conditions we estimate from the SAR backscatter. This suggests the wave-ice interaction mechanisms are indeed changing over these large scales.

TI  - Modeling Habitat Suitability of Migratory Birds from Remote Sensing Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution of the species habitats would facilitate wildlife resource management and conservation efforts. Existing methods have poor performance due to the limited availability of training samples. More recently, location-aware sensors have been widely used to track animal movements. The aim of the study was to generate suitability maps of bar-head geese using movement data coupled with environmental parameters, such as remote sensing images and temperature data. Therefore, we modified a deep convolutional neural network for the multi-scale inputs. The results indicate that the proposed method can identify the areas with the dense goose species around Qinghai Lake. In addition, this approach might also be interesting for implementation in other species with different niche factors or in areas where biological survey data are scarce.Abstract With the application of various data acquisition devices, a large number of animal movement data can be used to label presence data in remote sensing images and predict species distribution. In this paper, a two-stage classification approach for combining movement data and moderate-resolution remote sensing images was proposed. First, we introduced a new density-based clustering method to identify stopovers from migratory birds' movement data and generated classification samples based on the clustering result. We split the remote sensing images into 16 x 16 patches and labeled them as positive samples if they have overlap with stopovers. Second, a multi-convolution neural network model is proposed for extracting the features from temperature data and remote sensing images, respectively. Then a Support Vector Machines (SVM) model was used to combine the features together and predict classification results eventually. The experimental analysis was carried out on public Landsat 5 TM images and a GPS dataset was collected on 29 birds over three years. The results indicated that our proposed method outperforms the existing baseline methods and was able to achieve good performance in habitat suitability prediction.

TI  - Practical Applications of Delayed-Immediate Autologous Breast Reconstruction <i>A Flexible and Safe Operative Strategy</i>
T2  - ANNALS OF PLASTIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 67th Annual Meeting of the California-Society-of-Plastic-Surgeons (CSPS)
CL  - San Francisco, CA
AB  - Background: Timing is an important consideration in patients undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer. While immediate reconstruction results in superior aesthetic outcomes, the need for postmastectomy radiation can often only be ascertained after review of surgical pathology. Delayed-immediate autologous reconstruction (DIAR) is a reconstructive approach that consists of mastectomy with tissue expander placement in the first stage and flap-based breast reconstruction in the second stage. We describe our institution's experience with DIAR to characterize the reasons in which patients opt for this reconstructive approach and analyze its ultimate outcomes.Methods: We conducted an institutional review board-approved retrospective chart review of all consecutive patients undergoing DIAR performed by the senior author from 2007 to 2016. Data gathered included demographics, operative techniques, and postoperative outcomes.Results: In our study, 17 patients and 26 breasts underwent DIAR. Seven patients initially planned for and eventually underwent DIAR. Ten patients initially planned for implant-based reconstructions but ultimately underwent DIAR instead. Flap types included deep inferior epigastric perforator (n = 6), superficial inferior epigastric artery (n = 2), and muscle-sparing free transverse rectus abdominis myocutaneous (n = 18). The mean time between mastectomy and reconstruction was 208 days. Complications included tissue expander infection, vascular compromise, abscess formation, hematoma, and skin necrosis.Conclusions: The delayed-immediate approach allows for breast reconstruction with aesthetic and psychosocial benefits, while enabling postmastectomy radiation in patients with advanced disease. We describe modifications to DIAR, including use of a flap skin paddle and prolonged time between stages, which allow for broader applicability. We show that DIAR accommodates a range of patient preferences with few complications.

TI  - Investigation of air quality over the largest city in central China using high resolution satellite derived aerosol optical depth data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban air pollution in China has gained unprecedented attention under the background of high concentration of particulate matter and increasing haze frequency in recent years. In this study, utilizing the high resolution Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) dataset derived from Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite during 2013-2016, we provide a new insight into the air quality over Wuhan, the largest city in central China. Local AOD (LAOD) was introduced to indicate the aerosol loading from local sources. Annual LAOD was found to increase with urban cover in the district scale, which revealed the potential positive feedback between urbanization and regional air pollution. The seasonal pattern of LAOD was consistent with PM2.5, both presenting a seasonality of highest in winter and lowest in summer. By locating the highly polluted regions from LAOD map, our research highlighted the impact of anthropogenic aerosol loading (especially from industrial parks) on the regional air quality. Noticing the concentrated distribution of anthropogenic aerosol loading over urban areas, we further defined the urban-induced AOD to quantify the urban aerosol effect by comparing LAOD between urban areas and other land types. Consistent with the change trend of PM2.5, annual urban-induced AOD also presented a slight downward trend, which was a reasonable response to the stricter environment policies adopted by local government in recent years. Though carried out as a case study over Wuhan in central China, we believe that the findings presented here would promote the understanding of air pollution in most mega cities of China.

TI  - Efficient Deceptive Jamming Method of Static and Moving Targets Against SAR
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Deceptive jamming against synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a topic of great interest in the SAR electronic countermeasure during the past decade. However, most of the existing jammer techniques concentrate on the jamming signals of the extended static scenes. Actually, the jamming signals of the moving targets are also highly desired to be included in order to protect the military moving targets. For this problem, this paper proposes an efficient deceptive jamming method of both static and moving targets against SAR. An equivalent range equation is first developed, which can precisely take into account for the motion with fixed velocity, even with constant acceleration. Then, a 2-D spectrum corresponding to target-dependent part in the jammer's frequency response based on the range equation is derived. Finally, the efficient deceptive jamming can be achieved by the fast Fourier transform, Stolt interpolation, and complex multiply, thus significantly reducing the computation complexity. In addition, practical implementation is also considered in this paper. Compared with its counterparts, it can generate the jamming signals of moving targets precisely and efficiently even in the case of high squint angle and long synthetic aperture. Simulation results are presented to validate the proposed method.

TI  - Overview of Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2: Retrieval, cross-mission comparison, and global monitoring for GPP
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2), launched in July 2014, is capable of measuring Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), a functional proxy for terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). Although its primary mission is to measure the column-averaged mixing ratio of CO2 (Xco(2)) to constrain global carbon source/sink distribution, one of the OCO-2 spectrometers allows for a robust SIF retrieval solely based on solar Fraunhofer lines. Here we present a technical overview of the OCO-2 SIF product, aiming to provide the scientific community guidance on best practices for data analysis, interpretation, and application. This overview consists of the retrieval algorithms, OCO-2 specific bias correction, retrieval uncertainty evaluation, cross-mission comparison with other existing SIF products, and a global-scale examination of the SIF-GPP relationship. With the initial three years of data (September 2014 onward), we compared OCO-2 SIF with retrievals from Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2), and examined its relationship with FLUXCOM and MODIS GPP datasets. Our results show that OCO-2 SIF, along with GOSAT products, closely resemble the mean spatial and temporal patterns of FLUXCOM GPP from regions to the globe. Compared with GOME-2, however, OCO-2 depicts a more realistic spatial contrast between the tropics and extra-tropics. The linear relationship between OCO-2 SIF and existing modeled GPP products diverges somewhat across biomes at the global scale, consistent with previous GOSAT or GOME-2 based findings when modeled GPP products were used, but in contrast to a consistent cross-biome SIF-GPP relationship obtained at flux tower sites with OCO-2 products. This contrast suggests a critical need to reconcile differences in diverse SIF and GPP products and the relationships among them. Overall, the OCO-2 SIF products are robust and valuable for monitoring the global terrestrial carbon cycle and for constraining the carbon source/sink strengths of the Earth system. Finally, insights are offered for future satellite missions optimized for SIF retrievals.

TI  - Spatial and temporal patterns of fires in tropical savannas of Indonesia
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines spatial and temporal patterns of large to medium-sized fires across the Indonesian Archipelago using remote sensing, particularly the MODIS fire products, over a 14 years period (2000-13 inclusive) in conjunction with climatic and land data in a GIS. Results showed fires (burned area and number of fires) were detected the most in year 2002 and least in 2010. The extent of burning was correlated with the annual Southern Oscillation Index with most burning occurring during times of sustained negative SOI values, which generally means drier conditions across the region. Most of the detected fires occurred in the middle of the dry season and in drier eastern Indonesia. Across Indonesia, approximately 1.5 per cent of available open vegetation area burned, whereas only 0.5 per cent of forest area burned. Most open vegetation burning was detected in the savanna with an area equivalent to 11.1 per cent of its extent being burned over the 14 years. On Sumba Island, where the pronounced dry season extends for at least four months, open vegetation is the most common land cover type, of which 99 per cent burned by area over the study period making it the island with the most burned areas in the Indonesian Archipelago.

TI  - Factors Affecting Dermatologists' Use of a 31-Gene Expression Profiling Test as an Adjunct for Predicting Metastatic Risk in Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF DRUGS IN DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance: A 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test to predict metastatic risk in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma has previously been validated and is available for clinical use. The impact of the availability of such a test on clinical decision-making has previously been studied. However, little is known about which factors play a role in clinicians' decision to utilize the test.Objective: To determine factors affecting clinicians' decisions to utilize the 31-GEP test for metastatic risk stratification in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma.Design, Setting, and Participants: Dermatologists attending a national conference completed a series of questions based around four clinical vignettes using an audience response system. The vignettes and associated questions were designed to determine the impact of three factors Breslow thickness, ulceration, and sentinel lymph node biopsy status on the decision to order the 31-GEP test.Main Outcomes and Measures: The percentage of respondents who would order the 31-GEP test in the various clinical scenarios was quantified. Differences between groups were assessed using the chi-squared test.Results: A total of 181/187 individuals completed the survey (96.8% response rate). For tumors with a Breslow thickness >= 0.5 mm, a majority of respondents reported that they would recommend the 31-GEP test. Ulceration was associated with a statistically significant increase in the percentage of clinicians who would recommend the assay for all but the thickest (2.1 mm) tumors. A negative SLN was only associated with a statistically significant increase in the percentage of clinicians who would recommend the test for the thinnest (0.26 mm) tumors (22% to 34%, P=0.033).Conclusions and Relevance: Ulceration appears to be the most important factor impacting clinicians when deciding to order the 31-GEP test to assess risk for melanoma metastasis.

TI  - Semiautomated Segmentation of Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery for Mapping Sea Ice in Labrador Coast
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims at proposing a semiautomated sea ice segmentation workflow utilizing Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar imagery. The workflow consists of two main steps. First, preferable features in sea ice interpretation were determined with a random forest feature selection method. Second, an unsupervised graph-cut image segmentation was performed. The workflow was tested on 13 Sentinel-1A images from January to June 2016, and the results were evaluated on open water segmentation per ice charts provided by Canada Ice Service. The results showed that the proposed workflow was able to segment Sentinel-1 images in to appropriate number of classes, and the potential water identification rate reached 95%.

AB  - This paper deals with the propagation of erosion wave in Cua Dai Beach in Central Vietnam under the influence of longshore sediment movement using analytical results from the simplified equation of the one-line model. In addition, measured shoreline positions obtained from Landsat images are utilized to validate the calculated results. Effects of the waves on the shapes of the erosion/accretion zones along the Cua Dai Beach are observed. Using the analytical solutions, the propagation speed of the erosion wave is estimated as 37 m/y while this value is 54 m/y in reality. Coastal structures such as seawalls located along the Cua Dai Beach is causing more severe erosion along Cua Dai Beach.

AB  - Natural disturbances significantly influence forest ecosystem services and biodiversity. Accurate delineation and early detection of areas affected by wind and insect outbreaks are crucial for guiding management decisions. To this end, past studies relied mostly on passive sensors (e.g., optical), and active sensors (i.e., radar) were rarely used. This study used L-band space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) within a change-detection framework to delineate forested areas affected by wind and insect disturbances. The results showed that changes in back scatter relate to damage caused by wind and insect outbreaks. Overall accuracies of 69-84% and 65-88% were obtained for delineation of areas affected by wind damage and insect outbreaks, respectively, depending on the acquisition date and environmental conditions. Areas susceptible to insect outbreaks or experiencing the initial outbreak phase (green) were detected with lower accuracies (64-74%). It is expected that L-band space-borne SAR data can be applied over larger areas and ecosystem types in the temperate and boreal regions to delineate and detect damaged areas.

TI  - A framework for detecting conifer mortality across an ecoregion using high spatial resolution spaceborne imaging spectroscopy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 2013 and 2015, during a time of severe drought and elevated bark beetle (Dendroctonus spp.) activity in California, the amount of conifer mortality in the Southern Sierra Nevada increased greatly. Remote sensing is a critical means of providing up-to-date information on the location, magnitude, and extent of mortality across a broad geographic area. We used eleven Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) flight lines, resampled to 30 by 30 m pixel size and acquired on six separate dates as part of the HyspIRI Preparatory Campaign to simulate spaceborne imaging spectroscopy. We also spectrally degraded the AVIRIS images to simulate Landsat-8 data. We tested the ability of single-date and multi-temporal remote sensing to identify red stage conifer mortality, healthy conifer, and non-conifer dominated pixels using a random forest algorithm. Accuracy was assessed with an independent validation dataset acquired via WorldView imagery in areas spatially separate from where training data were collected, as well as through comparison with aerial detection survey and canopy water loss data, with generally good agreement. We found that classifications based on imaging spectroscopy significantly outperformed broadband multispectral feature sets (with a highest overall accuracy of 85.1% obtained by imaging spectroscopy and 80.2% obtained by the simulated multispectral images). We also found that classifications based on multi-temporal imaging spectroscopy were more accurate than single-date imaging spectroscopy (the highest overall accuracy obtained for single-date imaging spectroscopy was 83.4%). Imaging spectroscopy that included interseasonal data from the end of the drought outperformed all other datasets, including interannual data that included only images collected in the summer. Multi-date analysis also improved accuracy using broad band systems. Although current spaceborne assets are adequate for monitoring bark beetle mortality in a heterogeneous ecosystem, a spaceborne imaging spectrometer would further improve operational accuracy.

TI  - Extrapelvic Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Endometrial Cancer Patients With Unmapped Pelvic Side: A Brief Report
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The aim of the study was to evaluate extrapelvic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in clinical early-stage endometrial cancer patients with unmapped pelvic side(s) during fluorescent imaging-based sentinel mapping.Materials and Methods Eligible patients underwent sentinel mapping using cervical injection of indocyanine green and near-infrared florescent imaging compatible endoscopic systems. Pelvic SLNs were identified and resected. If bilateral mapping was not achieved, upper lymph nodes areas including presacral, upper common iliac, and para-aortic caval regions were explored for any SLN. Systematic lymphadenectomy was performed after applying SLN algorithm steps.Results In 24 of 101 patients, bilateral pelvic mapping was not achieved. Bilateral unmapping was seen in 4 of 24 and unilateral pelvic side mapping in 20 of 24 patients. There was no extrapelvic SLN among 4 cases with bilateral pelvic unmapping, whereas 8 (40%) of 20 patients with unilateral pelvic mapping had extrapelvic SLNs. Five of extrapelvic SLNs were in presacral, 2 in upper common iliac, and 1 in paracaval regions.Conclusions Observing for extrapelvic SLNs in cases with unmapped pelvic side(s) could increase detection rate of SLN mapping in clinical early-stage endometrial cancer.

TI  - Expression of programmed death-1 in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesTo explore whether lymphocytes in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are highly exposed to tumor neoantigens and thus express high level of programmed death 1 (PD-1), we examined PD-1 expression in SLNs and non-sentinel regional lymph nodes (non-SLNs) in breast cancer.MethodsWe performed PD-1 immunohistochemistry in two cohorts: 40 metastasis-negative SLNs including 10 patients for each subtype (luminal A-like, luminal B-like, HER2, and triple negative breast cancer [TNBC]); and 25 pairs of metastasis-positive SLNs and non-SLNs (10 luminal A-like, 10 luminal B-like, and 5 TNBC).ResultsAmong 40 metastasis-negative SLNs, 34 and 6 samples were PD-1 intensity grade 1 (low) and 2 (high), respectively. PD-1 intensity correlated with PD-1-positive lymphocyte numbers (P=0.005); TNBC had the highest PD-1 lymphocyte numbers among all subtypes. The median PD-1-positive lymphocyte number was higher in SLNs than non-SLNs. In most cases, more lymphocytes in SLNs expressed PD-1 than those in non-SLNs (P<0.0001).ConclusionsTNBC had the greatest PD-1 expression among all subtypes, and metastasis-positive SLNs had more PD-1-positive lymphocytes than downstream non-SLNs. These data suggested that lymphocytes in SLNs are activated following exposure to tumor neoantigens and thus tumor specific, and could be utilized as a biomarker platform.

TI  - Mapping groundwater prospect zones in an intermontane basin of the Outer Himalaya in India using GIS and remote sensing techniques
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In India, groundwater is the major source for fulfilling domestic and commercial water requirements. Since groundwater levels in various regions have been decreasing at a much faster rate in the last few decades, it has become important to delineate potential new zones of groundwater to meet future requirements. The intermontane basins in the Outer Himalaya have the potential to hold significant amount of subsurface water in a region that is currently water deficient. The present study discusses groundwater prospect zonation in the Soan Basin of the Outer Himalaya in Una District of Himachal Pradesh in India. ASTER DEM, LANDSAT 8 satellite data and existing geological mapping of the Himalayan foothills were used to prepare a groundwater prospect map of the Soan Basin. Various thematic maps including maps of geomorphology, drainage and land use map were prepared using LANDSAT 8 Satellite data and a geological map of Himalayan foothills using ARC GIS 10.0. Watershed and slope maps were extracted from ASTER DEM with 30 m resolution. A groundwater prospect map was prepared by overlaying the various thematic maps and was subdivided into five potential zones on the basis of potential discharge conditions. These are: regions bearing very low [< 50 L per minute (LPM)]; low (50-100 LPM); moderate (100-400 LPM); high (400-800 LPM); and very high (> 800 LPM) potential zones of groundwater. The high and very high potential zones are located in the central synclinal valley along the fluvial terraces, alluvial fans and piedmont deposits. The low and very low potential zones lie in the hilly areas with high slopes and rugged topography causing rapid downslope movement of water, which results in less infiltration and consequently deeper groundwater levels with a low groundwater potential.

TI  - Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance Systems in 6 US State and Local Health Departments
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH MANAGEMENT AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Evaluating public health surveillance systems is critical to ensuring that conditions of public health importance are appropriately monitored. Our objectives were to qualitatively evaluate 6 state and local health departments that were early adopters of syndromic surveillance in order to (1) understand the characteristics and current uses, (2) identify the most and least useful syndromes to monitor, (3) gauge the utility for early warning and outbreak detection, and (4) assess how syndromic surveillance impacted their daily decision making.Design: We adapted evaluation guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and gathered input from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention subject matter experts in public health surveillance to develop a questionnaire.Participants: We interviewed staff members from a convenience sample of 6 local and state health departments with syndromic surveillance programs that had been in operation for more than 10 years.Results: Three of the 6 interviewees provided an example of using syndromic surveillance to identify an outbreak (ie, cluster of foodborne illness in 1 jurisdiction) or detect a surge in cases for seasonal conditions (eg, influenza in 2 jurisdictions) prior to traditional, disease-specific systems. Although all interviewees noted that syndromic surveillance has not been routinely useful or efficient for early outbreak detection or case finding in their jurisdictions, all agreed that the information can be used to improve their understanding of dynamic disease control environments and conditions (eg, situational awareness) in their communities.Conclusion: In the jurisdictions studied, syndromic surveillance may be useful for monitoring the spread and intensity of large outbreaks of disease, especially influenza; enhancing public health awareness of mass gatherings and natural disasters; and assessing new, otherwise unmonitored conditions when real-time alternatives are unavailable. Future studies should explore opportunities to strengthen syndromic surveillance by including broader access to and enhanced analysis of text-related data from electronic health records. Health departmentsmay accelerate the development and use of syndromic surveillance systems, including the improvement of the predictive value and strengthening the early outbreak detection capability of these systems. These efforts support getting the right information to the right people at the right time, which is the overarching goal of CDC's Surveillance Strategy.

TI  - Satellite-Based, Multi-Indices for Evaluation of Agricultural Droughts in a Highly Dynamic Tropical Catchment, Central Vietnam
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterization of droughts using satellite-based data and indices in a steep, highly dynamic tropical catchment, like Vu Gia Thu Bon, which is the most important basin in central Vietnam, has remained a challenge for many years. This study examined the six widely used vegetation indices (VIs) to effectively monitor droughts that are based on their sensitivity with precipitation, soil moisture, and their linkage with the impacts on agricultural crop production and forest fires. Six VIs representing the four main groups, including greenness-based VIs (Vegetation Condition Index), water-based VIs (Normalized Difference Water Index, Land Surface Water Index), temperature-based VIs (Temperature Condition Index), and combined VIs (Vegetation Health Index, Normalized Difference Drought Index) were tested using MODIS data from January 2001 to December 2016 with the support of cloud-based Google Earth Engine computational platform. Results showed that droughts happened almost every year, but with different intensity. Vegetation stress was found to be mainly attributed to precipitation in the rice paddy fields and to temperature in the forest areas. Findings revealed that combined vegetation indices were more sensitive drought indicators in the basin, whereas their performance was different by vegetation type. In the rice paddy fields, NDDI was more sensitive to precipitation than other indices; it better captured droughts and their impacts on crop yield. In the forest areas, VHI was more sensitive to temperature, and thus had better performance than other VIs. Accordingly, NDDI and VHI were recommended for monitoring droughts in the agricultural and forest lands, respectively. The findings from this study are crucial to map drought risks and prepare an effective mitigation plan for the basin.

TI  - Seagrass mapping in Greek territorial waters using Landsat-8 satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows are among the most valuable coastal ecosystems on earth due to their structural and functional roles in the coastal environment. This study demonstrates remote sensing's capacity to produce seagrass distribution maps on a regional scale. The seagrass coverage maps provided here describe and quantify for the first time the extent and the spatial distribution of seagrass meadows in Greek waters. This information is needed for identifying priority conservation sites and to help coastal ecosystem managers and stakeholders to develop conservation strategies and design a resilient network of protected marine areas. The results were based on an object-based image analysis of 50 Landsat-8 satellite images. The time window of image acquisition was between June 2013 and July 2015. In total, the seagrass coverage in Greek waters was estimated at 2619 km(2). The largest coverages of individual seagrass meadows were found around Lemnos Island (124 km(2)), Corfu Island (46 km(2)), and East Peloponnese (47 km(2)). The accuracy assessment of the detected areas was based on 62 Natura 2000 sites, for which habitat maps were available. The mean total accuracy for all 62 sites was estimated at 76.3%.

TI  - Risk factors for cutaneous myiasis (blowfly strike) in pet rabbits in Great Britain based on text-mining veterinary electronic health records
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Blowfly strike is a devastating and often rapidly fatal disease in rabbits. In Great Britain (GB), Lucilia sericata is the primary causative species. Despite its severity, there has been minimal investigatory work into the disease in rabbits. Here we used text mining to screen electronic health records (EHRs) from a large sentinel network of 389 veterinary practices in GB between March 2014 and April 2017 for confirmed cases of blowfly strike in rabbits.Blowfly strike was identified in 243 of 42,226 rabbit consultations (0.6%), affecting 205 individual rabbits. The anatomical site of recorded blowfly strike lesions was overwhelmingly the perineal area (n = 109, 52.4%). Less commonly lesions were observed affecting other areas of the body (n = 9, 4.3%) and head (n = 8, 3.8%); in 83 consultations (39.9%), the affected area was not specified. Of the rabbits presenting with blowfly strike, 44.7% were recorded as being euthanized or died.A case control study was used to identify risk factors for blowfly strike in this population. Whilst sex and neuter status in isolation were not significantly associated with blowfly strike, entire female rabbits showed a 3.3 times greater odds of being a case than neutered female rabbits. Rabbits five years of age and over were more than 3.8 times likely to present for blowfly strike. For every 1 degrees C rise in environmental temperature between 4.67 degrees C and 17.68 degrees C, there was a 33% increase risk of blowfly strike, with cases peaking in July or August. Overall blowfly strike cases started earlier and peaked higher in the south of Great Britain. The most northerly latitude studied was at lower risk of blowfly strike than the most southerly (OR = 0.50, p < 0.001). There appeared to be no significant relationship between blowfly strike in rabbits and either the sheep density or rural and urban land coverage types.The results presented here can be used for targeted health messaging to reduce the impact of this deadly disease for rabbits. We propose that real-time temporal and spatial surveillance of the rabbit disease may also help inform sheep control, where the seasonal profile is very similar, and where routine surveillance data is also not available. Our results highlight the value of sentinel databases based on EHRs for research and surveillance.

TI  - Geoblocks Recognition and Delineation of the Earthquake Prone Areas in the Tuan Giao Area (Northwest Vietnam)
T2  - GEOTECTONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of the paper is to reveal the hierarchical block structure in the Tuan Giao area (Northwest Vietnam) and, on that base, to identify areas prone to earthquakes with M 5. Four large geoblocks of the second rank have been delineated on the basis of the joint analysis of geological, geophysical, geomorphic, and remote sensing data. The second rank geoblocks have been divided into smaller sub-blocks of the third rank. The recent geodynamics of the geoblocks have been characterized using geomorphic, seismological, gravity, and GPS data.The system of the delineated geoblocks is viewed as the Geodynamic Blocks model. The areas prone to earthquakes with M 5 have been identified using the pattern recognition algorithm CORA-3. The objects of the recognition were defined as circular areas, where boundaries of the geoblocks intersect each other. The recognition results confirm high seismic potential of the study region and provide information on potential earthquake sources for seismic hazard assessment: a number of boundary intersections have been identified as areas prone to earthquakes with M 5, where events of such magnitude have not been recorded up to date. Mordern geothermal activity and anomalies of dissolved methane (up to 10000 nL/L), helium and hydrogen in the hot mineral water springs prove high permeability of the study area and its active seismo-tectonic state.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - The detection of coastal damage due to the 2011 Off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku Earthquake Tsunami on the southern Sendai Coast was attempted via state-of-the-art remote sensing technology using ALOS PRISM satellite images with a spatial resolution of 2.5 m. Digital surface models (DSMs) were generated semi-automatically, and their accuracies were confirmed via comparisons with digital elevation models generated from aerial laser measurements. The differences between the DSMs prior to and after the tsunami were analyzed statistically for each type of land cover: residential districts, rice fields, coastal forests, and beaches. It was demonstrated that the damage to the coastal forests and residential districts could be detected though the damage in the low land area was difficult to be detected because of its small undulations in topography. Low pass filtering was employed to remove the jitter noise; however, the major characteristics such as damage in the coastal forests and residential areas were not changed by the filtering; that is, the major statistical characteristics could be detected without filtering.

TI  - Evaluation and modification of the Drought Severity Index (DSI) in East Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived Drought Severity Index (DSI) can be produced at a 1-km spatial resolution and can be used for a wide range of water-resource and ecological applications. This study aims to understand the robustness and sensitivity of the DSI in East Asia, and we investigate the performance of the annual DSI using different Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) datasets. Additionally, the MODIS-based DSI is compared to other drought indices, including the DSI with Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) NDVI (DSIAviiRR) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) dataset. Three different drought indices are estimated in East Asia from 2000 to 2013 and compared via a correlation analysis based on a 5 degrees x 5 degrees grid. Specifically, the correlation between the DSI and DSIAvHRR is relatively high (0.796), which suggests the potential use of the DSI based on combined products that include parameters such as the NDVI, although the DSI originally used only MODIS-based products. Characteristics such as the frequency and spatial extent of droughts based on the DSI are compared to those based on the SPEI using the drought classification schemes that were originally proposed for the SPEI and DSI, including mild, moderate, severe and extremely dry classes. Based on the results, we suggest a revised classification according to a comparison of the DSI and SPEI. The frequency and spatial extent results of the SPEI and DSI exhibit good agreement when using this classification. Moreover, the DSI from the revised classification is used to evaluate drought events in East Asia in 2003, 2006, 2008 and 2009. Overall, this study shows the potential of using the DSI with datasets that differ from the originally suggested datasets; however, caution must be taken when classifying and identifying drought events.

TI  - The functional characterization of grass- and shrubland ecosystems using hyperspectral remote sensing: trends, accuracy and moderating variables
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing is increasingly being recognized as a powerful tool to map ecosystem properties and functions through time and space. However, general information on the accuracy of this technology to assess the vegetation's biophysical and-chemical trait composition, and on the variables which are mediating this accuracy, is often lacking so far. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap for grass- and shrubland ecosystems and applied novel three-level meta-analytical regression equations to 77 studies that validated hyperspectral remote sensing data with field observations. Our results showed that the accuracy of hyperspectral sensors is generally high, but strongly depends on the trait being studied (leaf area index: R-2 = 0.79 and nRMSE = 0.19, chlorophyll: R-2 = 0.77 and nRMSE = 0.21, carotenoids: R-2 = 0.80 and nRMSE = 0.29, phosphorus: R-2 = 0.75 and nRMSE = 0.14, nitrogen: R-2 = 0.74 and nRMSE = 0.09, water: R-2 = 0.69 and nRMSE = 0.13, and lignin content: R-2 = 0.64 and nRMSE = 0.26). Moreover, they indicated that the use of multivariate signal processing techniques could improve these estimation accuracies (adjusted p < 0.06 for LAI, chlorophyll and nitrogen). Finally, estimations from air- and spaceborne imaging spectrometers, allowing for functional mapping at broader spatial scales, were found to be as accurate as estimations from ground-based spectral measurements. Despite these promising findings, we revealed that leaf morphological properties (e.g. specific leaf area and leaf dry matter content) and biochemical traits which are not growth-related (e.g. lignin and cellulose) remain under explored in grass- and shrublands. Moreover there was a strong publication bias towards R2 for assessing model performance. Our findings foster and direct further methodological and technological developments for a more accurate and complete functional characterization of these ecosystems worldwide.

TI  - Improved Small Baseline processing by means of CAESAR eigen-interferograms decomposition
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Component extrAction and sElection SAR (CAESAR) is a method for the selection and filtering of scattering mechanisms recently proposed in the multibaseline interferometric SAR framework. Its strength is related to the possibility to select and extract multiple dominant scattering mechanisms, even interfering in the same pixel, since the stage of the interferograms generation, and to carry out a decorrelation noise phase filtering. Up to now, the validation of CAESAR has been addressed in the framework of SAR Tomography for the model-based detection of Persistent Scatterers (PSs). In this paper we investigate the effectiveness related to the use of CAESAR eigen-interferograms in classical multi-baseline DInSAR processing, based on the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) strategy, typically adopted to extract large scale distributed deformation and atmospheric phase screen. Such components are also exploited for the calibration of the full resolution data for PS or tomographic analysis. By using COSMO-SKyMed (CSK) SAR data, it is demonstrated that dominant scattering component filtering effectively improves the monitoring of distributed spatially decorrelated areas (f.i. bare soil, rocks, etc.) and allows bringing to light man-made structures with dominant backscattering characteristics embedded in highly temporally decorrelated scenario, as isolated asphalt roads and block of buildings in non-urban areas. Moreover it is shown that, thanks to the CAESAR multiple scattering components separation, the layover mitigation in low-topography eigen-interferograms relieves Phase Unwrapping (PhU) errors in urban areas due to abrupt height variations.

AB  - How does the world around us work? This question has preoccupied humanity since its beginnings. From the 16th centuryonwards, it has been periodically necessary to revise the prevailing worldview. But things became very strange at the beginning of the 20th century with the advent of relativity theory and quantum physics. The current focus is on the role of information, there being a debate about whether this is ontological or epistemological. A theory has recently been formulated in which space time and gravity emerges from microscopic quantum information, more specifically from quantum entanglement via entanglement entropy. In quantum physics, perception and observation play a central role. Perception, interaction with the environment, requires an exchange of information. Via biochemical projection, information is given an interpretation that is necessary to make life and consciousness possible. The world around us is not at all what it seems.

TI  - 3D Geostrophy and Volume Transport in the Southern Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 3D geostrophic currents and the associated volume transport (VT) can be estimated from the GOCE and Altimetry satellite data and in-situ temperature and salinity profiles measured by the Argo floats. We do so for the Southern Ocean between 20 degrees S and 65 degrees S with their time variability down to the depth of 1975 m (in 58 layers) over the 11-year period of 2004-2014. The results depict the Southern Ocean circulation where a zonal Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) interacts with a meridional thermohaline circulation. The VT reproduces the polar front and the subantarctic front of the ACC, as well as the large scale and mesoscale currents in the Southern Ocean. Our estimates for the Agulhas current and the East Australia currents are also quantitatively comparable with results from other approaches in the literature based on in-situ data. For ACC, the estimated VT at the Drake Passage is 185 Sv for the norm of the time average VT, or 202 Sv for the mean of the norms of the monthly VT, which are larger than previous estimations (ranging from 134 to 175 Sv). The estimate is potentially reconciled when only the zonal transport is considered (181 Sv). The Drake Passage total VT appears to be quite stable during the studied period, unlike its (dominant) zonal and meridional components which show higher variability that mostly compensate each other. The spatially averaged ACC VT shows per 1 degrees width in the main stream a mean value of 29.6 Sv or 35.8 Sv (depending on the method used), an annual signal with an amplitude of 0.33 +/- 0.06 Sv that peaks in early April, with no significant semi-annual signals nor linear trend. Water transports of barotropic and baroclinic origin have been isolated in the VT series showing that 75% of transport is barotropic and the remaining 25% baroclinic, while the variability and annual signal in the ACC is fully barotropic.

TI  - A Novel Machine Learning Method for Estimating Biomass of Grass Swards Using a Photogrammetric Canopy Height Model, Images and Vegetation Indices Captured by a Drone
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Silage is the main feed in milk and ruminant meat production in Northern Europe. Novel drone-based remote sensing technology could be utilized in many phases of silage production, but advanced methods of utilizing these data are still developing. Grass swards are harvested three times in season, and fertilizer is applied similarly three timesonce for each harvest when aiming at maximum yields. Timely information of the yield is thus necessary several times in a season for making decisions on harvesting time and rate of fertilizer application. Our objective was to develop and assess a novel machine learning technique for the estimation of canopy height and biomass of grass swards utilizing multispectral photogrammetric camera data. Variation in the studied crop stand was generated using six different nitrogen fertilizer levels and four harvesting dates. The sward was a timothy-meadow fescue mixture dominated by timothy. We extracted various features from the remote sensing data by combining an ultra-high resolution photogrammetric canopy height model (CHM) with a pixel size of 1.0 cm and red, green, blue (RGB) and near-infrared range intensity values and different vegetation indices (VI) extracted from orthophoto mosaics. We compared the performance of multiple linear regression (MLR) and a Random Forest estimator (RF) with different combinations of the CHM, RGB and VI features. The best estimation results with both methods were obtained by combining CHM and VI features and all three feature classes (CHM, RGB and VI features). Both estimators provided equally accurate results. The Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) and Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) of the estimations were at best 0.98 and 0.34 t/ha (12.70%), respectively, for the dry matter yield (DMY) and 0.98 and 1.22 t/ha (11.05%), respectively, for the fresh yield (FY) estimations. Our assessment of the sensitivity of the method with respect to different development stages and different amounts of biomass showed that the use of the machine learning technique that integrated multiple features improved the results in comparison to the simple linear regressions. These results were extremely promising, showing that the proposed multispectral photogrammetric approach can provide accurate biomass estimates of grass swards, and could be developed as a low-cost tool for practical farming applications.

TI  - Extracting the full value of the Landsat archive: Inter-sensor harmonization for the mapping of Minnesota forest canopy cover (1973-2015)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing estimates of forest canopy cover have frequently been used to support a variety of applications including wildlife habitat modeling, monitoring of watershed health, change detection, and are also correlated to various aspects of forest structure and ecosystem function. Although data from the long running Landsat earth observation program (1972-present) have been previously utilized to characterize forest canopy cover, the variability in spatial and spectral resolutions between the Landsat sensors has generally limited analyses to readily comparable imagery from the TM and ETM + sensors, which omits large portions of the full temporal record. In this study, we present an R package, LandsatLinkr, which automates the processes for harmonizing Landsat MSS and OLI imagery to the spatial and spectral qualities of TM and ETM + imagery, allowing for the generation of annual cloud-free composites of tasseled cap spectral indices across the entire Landsat archive. We demonstrate the utility of LandsatLinkr products, further enhanced through the LandTrendr segmentation algorithm, for characterizing forest attributes through time by developing annual forest masks and maps of estimated canopy cover for the state of Minnesota from 1973 to 2015. The forest mask model had an overall accuracy of 87%, with omission and commission errors for the forest class of 17% and 10%, respectively, and 9% and 16% for non-forest classification. Our resulting maps depicted a significant positive trend in forest cover across all ecological provinces of Minnesota during the study period. A random forest model used to predict continuous canopy cover had a pseudo R-2 of 0.75, with a cross validation RMSE of 5%. Our results are comparable to previous Landsat-based canopy cover mapping efforts, but expand the evaluation time period as we were able to utilize the entire Landsat archive for assessment.

TI  - Persistent growth of a young andesite lava cone: Bagana volcano, Papua New Guinea
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Bagana, an andesite lava cone on Bougainville Island, Papua New Guinea, is thought to be a very young central volcano. We have tested this idea by estimating the volumes of lava extruded over different time intervals (1-, 2-, 3-, 9-, 15-, 70 -years) using digital elevation models (DEMs), mainly created from satellite data. Our results show that the long-term extrusion rate at Bagana, measured over years to decades, has remained at about 1.0 m(3) s(-1). We present models of the total edifice volume, and show that, if our measured extrusion rates are representative, the volcano could have been built in only similar to 300 years. It could also possibly have been built at a slower rate during a longer, earlier period of growth. Six kilometres NNW of Bagana, an andesite-dacite volcano, Billy Mitchell, had a large, caldera-forming plinian eruption 437 years ago. We consider the possibility that, as a result of this eruption, the magma supply was diverted from Billy Mitchell to Bagana. It seems that Bagana is a rare example of a very youthful, polygenetic, andesite volcano. The characteristics of such a volcano, based on the example of Bagana, are: a preponderance of lava products over pyroclastic products, a high rate of lava extrusion maintained for decades, a very high rate of SO2 emission, evidence of magma batch fractionation and location in a trans-tensional setting at the end of an arc segment above a very steeply dipping and rapidly converging subduction zone.

AB  - A large number of imported cases of Zika virus infection and the potential for transmission by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes prompted the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to conduct sentinel, enhanced passive, and syndromic surveillance for locally acquired mosquitoborne Zika virus infections in New York City, NY, USA, during June-October 2016. Suspected case=patients were those >5 years of age without a travel history or sexual exposure who had >= 3 compatible signs/symptoms (arthralgia, fever, conjunctivitis, or rash). We identified 15 suspected cases and tested urine samples for Zika virus by using real-time reverse transcription PCR; all results were negative. We identified 308 emergency department visits for Zika-like illness, 40,073 visits for fever, and 17 unique spatiotemporal clusters of visits for fever. We identified no evidence of local transmission. Our experience offers possible surveillance tools for jurisdictions concerned about local mosquitoborne Zika virus or other arboviral transmission.

TI  - Does preoperative axillary staging lead to overtreatment of women with screen-detected breast cancer?
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: To determine the impact of preoperative axillary ultrasound staging in a screen-detected breast cancer population.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ultrasound and needle biopsy staging results alongside reference standard sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection were extracted retrospectively from the unit's computer records between 1 April 2008 and 31 March 2015. Axillary staging was compared with final histopathology and treatment.RESULTS: Of the 215,661 screening examinations performed, 780 invasive cancers were diagnosed, which had preoperative axillary staging data, of which 162 (20.7%) were node positive. Thirty-six (4.6%) had a heavy nodal burden (three or more nodes). Ninety (11.5%) had an abnormal axillary ultrasound and axillary biopsy of which 54 were positive for cancer (33.3% of the node positive cases) and triaged to axillary lymph node dissection avoiding a sentinel lymph node biopsy. Of these 22 (40.7%) had neoadjuvant treatment, and 32 (59.3%) proceeded directly to axillary lymph node dissection. The sensitivity of axillary ultrasound and biopsy to detect women with a heavy nodal burden (three or more nodes) was 41.7% (15 of 36); however, 17 (53%) of the 32 women with a positive axillary biopsy had a low burden of axillary disease (two or fewer positive nodes) at axillary lymph node dissection, the mean number of nodes obtained was 14.6.CONCLUSION: Significant numbers of women are being potentially overtreated or denied entry into positive sentinel node: adjuvant therapy only versus adjuvant therapy and clearance or axillary radiotherapy (POSNOC) because of routine preoperative axillary staging.

TI  - LiDAR Data Classification Using Morphological Profiles and Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, deep learning-based methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown their capabilities in remote sensing data processing. The efficacy of light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been already proven in a wide variety of research areas. Most of the existing methods do not extract the informative features from LiDAR-derived rasterized digital surface models (LiDAR-DSM) data in a deep manner. In order to utilize the advantages of deep models for the classification of LiDAR-derived features, deep CNN is proposed here to hierarchically extract the robust and discriminant features of the input data. Moreover, morphological profiles and multiattribute profiles (MAPs) are investigated to enrich the inputs of the CNN and further to improve the ultimate classification performance. Furthermore, a new activation function, sigmoid-weighted linear units (SiLUs), is introduced. The proposed frameworks are tested on two LiDAR-DSMs (i.e., Bayview Park and Houston data sets). The MAP-CNNs with SiLU outperform original CNNs by 6.62% and 6.88% in terms of overall accuracy on Bayview Park and Houston data sets, respectively, when the number of training samples of each class is 40.

TI  - Estimating soil organic carbon stocks using different modelling techniques in the semi-arid rangelands of eastern Australia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is pivotal for biological, cheniical and physical processes and provides vital information on changes in soil fertility and land degradation. Rangelands, accounting for about 81% of Australian land area; are significant carbon (C) stores and small increases in soil C sequestration over such a vast area represents a considerable climate change mitigation opportunity. Efficient modelling techniques to evaluate the potential to increase rangeland SOC stocks are vitally important to assess their role in the global carbon cycle and quantum abatement. This study aimed to evaluate boosted regression trees (BRT) and random forest (RF) models in predicting SOC stocks from available continuous remotely sensed variables using two feature selection techniques. Dominant variables that affect SOC stocks in the rangelands were also identified. Using field-based measurements of SOC stock collected from 564 data points across the study area and 28 GIS-based environmental variables including climate, topography, radiometry, vegetation and land fractional cover data, we employed stepwise regression (SR, linear approach) and genetic algorithm (GA, nonlinear approach) to select the most informative variables. These selected predictors were then used to train the BRT and RF models. In all, four models were evaluated: BRT using SR (SR BRT); RF using SR (SR RF); BRT using GA (GA BRT) and RF using GA (GA RF). In addition, BRT using all predictors (All BRT) and the RF using all predictors (All_RF) were used as benchmarks to test the performance of the four models. Of the field-based data, 75% were used to train the model ("calibration dataset") and the remaining 25% were used to validate the prediction of SOC stocks ("validation dataset"). The results indicate that the RF exhibited a better performance in predicting SOC stocks than the BRT regardless of input variables. In addition, we verified that feature selection for both machine learning techniques is necessary for estimating SOC stocks because they can increase accuracy and save time. The GA_RF was the most reliable method to predict SOC stocks, with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R2 values (7.44 Mg C ha't and 0.48, respectively), suggesting that the method of using GA-RF to generate a predictive model from measured data and remotely-sensed variables may provide a cost effective alternative to direct sampling to predict SOC stocks in the semi-arid rangelands of 'eastern Australia. The important variables for explaining the observed SOC stocks were rainfall, elevation, Prescott index (PI, a measure of water balance), and land fractional cover (bare ground fraction). The approach proposed here can be extended in areas where field observed data is scarce (e.g. rangelands) to produce more detailed information about SOC stocks..As such, the results of our study are of particular importance in Australian rangelands to provide a statistical and theoretical basis for producing digital SOC stock maps based on readily available remotely-sensed data, with potential for use in similar rangelands conditions internationally.

T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A total of 18 polymorphic microsatellite loci were isolated and characterized from RAPD products in the Xinjiang Arctic Grayling (Thymallus arcticus grubei). The number of alleles (N (a)) per locus varied from 2 to 10. Observed (H (o)) and expected (H (e)) heterozygosities ranged from 0.64 to 0.92, and from 0.63 to 0.88, respectively. Considerable differences were found among HBH, FH and FY populations in the number of alleles, effective number of alleles, number of genotypes at all of these loci. These new RAPD-SSR markers have provided a helpful tool for genetic analyses and resources conservation of T. arcticus grubei. Five additional fish species, Amur grayling (Thymallus grubii), Taimen (Hucho taimen), Sea perch (Lateolabrax japonicus), Lenok (Brachymystax lenok) and Red seam bream (Pagrosomus major) were assessed for cross-species amplification. Three of the five species showed at least one polymorphic locus. In addition, seven loci were found to be polymorphic in at least one species.

TI  - The impact of urban expansion on the regional environment in Myanmar: a case study of two capital cities
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context This study examines the spatio-temporal patterns of urban expansion for Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw, the former and new national capitals of Myanmar, and its impact on the regional environment between 2000 and 2013.Objectives The objective is to examine different driving forces of urban expansion for Yangon and Nay Pyi Taw, and their environmental consequences during Myanmar's transitional economy.Methods Classified time-series Landsat images are used to evaluate urban expansion processes. Environmental parameters being evaluated in this study include five sets of remotely sensed MODIS land products that are land surface temperature (LST), percent tree cover (PTC), evapotranspiration (ET), terrestrial ecosystem net primary productivity (NPP), and aerosol optical depth (AOD). A time-series trend analysis technique is used to examine the environmental consequences.Results The built-up areas in Nay Pyi Taw and Yangon exhibit exponential and polynomial increase, respectively. A 1% increase of built-up area could potentially cause an increase of daytime LST of 0.7 degrees C, a PTC loss of 2.3%, a decrease in NPP of 34.3 kg/m(2), and an ET decrease of 42.2 mm for Yangon. Similarly, for Nay Pyi Taw, a 1% increase in built-up area could potentially cause a daytime LST increase of 0.3 degrees C, a nighttime LST increase of 0.06 degrees C, a PTC loss of 2.5%, a decrease in NPP of 15.1 kg/m(2), and a decrease of 19.2 mm ET. No significant change was observed for AOD for either city.Conclusions Both cities have experienced extensive urban expansion but with different spatial and temporal characteristics, and their effects on the regional environment are different. Urban expansion of Nay Pyi Taw mainly was government-induced municipal infrastructure development. Yangon's expansion is mainly caused by population pressure and migration from rural areas. The urban expansion in Yangon was mainly due to reconstruction and renovation, as well as infill development during the study period.

TI  - Is afforestation-induced land use change the main contributor to vegetation dynamics in the semiarid region of North China?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantitatively analyzing the response of'vegetation dynamics to land use change is very important, especially it relates to gaining a better understanding of the effects of ecological restoration projects. Previous studies have focused on the effects of land use change caused by the Grain for Green Project (GGP) on vegetation dynamics, but the effects from other changes in land use have less been explored. Therefore, in order to bridge this gap, Landsat images and MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were used to examine how land use had changed from 2000 to 2014 as well as to study its influence on vegetation growth in Ulanqab City, Inner Mongolia, China. For this, four major land use change processes were identified through land use trajectories analysis: the Grain for Green Program (GGP), agricultural intensification, cropland abandonment, and cropland degradation. The GGP caused 36.60% of the total land use change in our study area, while three other processes caused the remaining of 44.40%. Anthropogenic activities significantly influenced vegetation coverage in 10.47% of the research area based on residual trend analysis. Pixels analysis showed 8.72% of the research area experienced a significant increase in vegetation coverage, where 39.53% of this increase was caused by afforestation while 33.25% was attributable to agricultural intensification. However, vegetation degradation was observed in 1.75% of the research area, of which 12.91% was caused by afforestation, an amount that was lower than that caused by the combined effects of the other three practices. Overall, afforestation can effectively increase vegetation coverage, but the overall effects can be undermined by other unstainable land use. However, although agricultural intensification contributed greatly to an increase in vegetation coverage, it also caused severe land degradation. This study demonstrates that ecological restoration projects and regional ecological systems are facing increasing pressure in Ulanqab City caused by an increase in human activity. Managing and maintaining restoration projects sustainably and appropriately in fragile areas will help land managers to achieve better results during vegetation restoration as well as to contribute to sustainable development.

TI  - Optimization of the time series NDVI-rainfall relationship using linear mixed-effects modeling for the anti-desertification area in the Beijing and Tianjin sandstorm source region
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Degradation in drylands is a critically important global issue that threatens ecosystem and environmental in many ways. Researchers have tried to use remote sensing data and meteorological data to perform residual trend analysis and identify human-induced vegetation changes. However, complex interactions between vegetation and climate, soil units and topography have not yet been considered. Data used in the study included annual accumulated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 250 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 2002 to 2013, accumulated rainfall from September to August, digital elevation model (DEM) and soil units. This paper presents linear mixed-effect (LME) modeling methods for the NDVI-rainfall relationship. We developed linear mixed-effects models that considered the random effects of sample points nested in soil units for nested two-level modeling and single-level modeling of soil units and sample points, respectively. Additionally, three functions, including the exponential function (exp), the power function (power), and the constant plus power function (CPP), were tested to remove heterogeneity, and an additional three correlation structures, including the first-order autoregressive structure [AR(1)], a combination of first-order autoregressive and moving average structures [ARMA(1,1)] and the compound symmetry structure (CS), were used to address the spatiotemporal correlations. It was concluded that the nested two-level model considering both heteroscedasticity with (CPP) and spatiotemporal correlation with [ARMA(1,1)] showed the best performance (AMR = 0.1881, RMSE = 0.2576, adj-R (2) = 0.9593). Variations between soil units and sample points that may have an effect on the NDVI-rainfall relationship should be included in model structures, and linear mixed-effects modeling achieves this in an effective and accurate way.

TI  - A Preliminary Analysis of Wind Retrieval, Based on GF-3 Wave Mode Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of measurements of the normalized radar cross-(NRCS) in Wave Mode for Chinese C-band Gaofen-3(GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Based on 2779 images from GF-3 quad-polarization SAR in Wave Mode and collocated wind vectors from ERA-Interim, this experiment verifies the feasibility of using ocean surface wind fields and VV-polarized NRCS to perform normalized calibration. The method uses well-validated empirical C-band geophysical model function (CMOD4) to estimate the calibration constant for each beam. In addition, the relationship between cross-pol NRCS and wind vectors is discussed. The cross-pol NRCS increases linearly with wind speed and it is obviously modulated by the wind direction when the wind speed is greater than 8 m/s. Furthermore, the properties of the polarization ratio, denoted PR, are also investigated. The PR is dependent on incidence angle and azimuth angle. Two empirical models of the PR are fitted, one as a function of incidence angle only, the other with additional dependence on azimuth angle. Assessments show that the sigma(0)(VV) retrieved from new PR models as well as sigma(0)(HH) is in good agreement with sigma(0)(VV) extracted from SAR images directly.

TI  - Topography-Related Glacier Area Changes in Central Tianshan from 1989 to 2015 Derived from Landsat Images and ASTER GDEM Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies have investigated the glacier projected area (2D Area) on a horizontal plane, which is much smaller than the glacier topographic surface extent (3D Area) in steep terrains. This study maps the glacier outline in Central Tianshan using Landsat images from four periods, i.e., 1989, 2002, 2007 and 2015, by an object-based classification approach, and analyzes the glacier 2D and 3D area changes related to topographic factors based on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global DEM data. This approach shows an accuracy of 90.8% for clean ice mapping. The derived clean ice outlines are in good agreement with the 2nd Chinese Glacier Inventory (CGI2) and the Global Land Ice Measurements from Space (GLIMS). The fields with a northern aspect receive the least surface solar radiation, leading to dominant existing glaciers. Glaciers are near evenly distributed in slope zones of 0 degrees to 50 degrees and have a mean slope angle of 28.8 degrees, resulting in a 30.3% larger 3D area than the 2D area in 2015 in Central Tianshan. The glacier 2D area decreased by 404 km(2) (-8.1%) between 1989 and 2015, while the 3D area declined by 516 km(2) (-7.9%). The glacier 2D area showed a reduction of -1.8% between 1989 and 2002, -3.8% between 2002 and 2007, and -2.7% between 2007 and 2015, and these retreating rates closely responded to the variations of regional mean air temperature and precipitation. Topographically, most reductions occurred in elevation bands of 3000-4000 m and in slope zones of 10-20 degrees and 40-50 degrees, and in the eastern aspect fields. The northern Tekes River catchment had the largest shrinking rate of -17.0% (2D area), followed by the southern Karasu River (-14.2%) and Muzart River (-7.7%) catchments. In contrast, glaciers in the Kumerik/Aksu and Tailan River catchments in the Tuomuer region showed little change (-2%).

TI  - A Review on Applications of Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in Water Resources and Flood Risk Management
T2  - WATER
M3  - Review
AB  - Water is one of the most critical natural resources that maintain the ecosystem and support people's daily life. Pressures on water resources and disaster management are rising primarily due to the unequal spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and pollution, and also partially due to our poor knowledge about the distribution of water resources and poor management of their usage. Remote sensing provides critical data for mapping water resources, measuring hydrological fluxes, monitoring drought and flooding inundation, while geographic information systems (GIS) provide the best tools for water resources, drought and flood risk management. This special issue presents the best practices, cutting-edge technologies and applications of remote sensing, GIS and hydrological models for water resource mapping, satellite rainfall measurements, runoff simulation, water body and flood inundation mapping, and risk management. The latest technologies applied include 3D surface model analysis and visualization of glaciers, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) video image classification for turfgrass mapping and irrigation planning, ground penetration radar for soil moisture estimation, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite rainfall measurements, storm hyetography analysis, rainfall runoff and urban flooding simulation, and satellite radar and optical image classification for urban water bodies and flooding inundation. The application of those technologies is expected to greatly relieve the pressures on water resources and allow better mitigation of and adaptation to the disastrous impact of droughts and flooding.

TI  - Snow Cover Mapping for Complex Mountainous Forested Environments Based on a Multi-Index Technique
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal snow cover is a critical component of the energy and water budgets of mountainous watersheds. Capturing the snow cover in complex environments is crucial for monitoring and understanding the temporal and spatial effects of climate change on alpine snow cover. The normalized difference snow index (NDSI) can be used to effectively and accurately estimate snow cover information from satellite images. However, the NDSI has limited utility for estimating the snow cover in heavily forested areas and relating this information to snowmelt-based runoff. In this study, a new algorithm based on a multi-index technique is proposed. The technique combines the NDSI, the normalized difference forest snow index, and the normalized difference vegetation index, and decision rules are established to increase the accuracy of snow mapping in forested areas. The new algorithm based on a multi-index technique is tested in the mountainous forested areas of North Xinjiang, China. In a winter image with full snow and a spring image with patchy snow, most of the forest snow, which is underestimated by the NDSI, is recognized by the multi-index technique. The accuracy of snow detection in forested areas is more than 90%. Additionally, in an experiment using a summer image without snow in forested areas no commission errors were detected. The snow detection algorithm based on a multi-index technique uses a simple set of decision rules for snow and can be run automatically without a priori knowledge of the surface characteristics.

TI  - Estimating and mapping forest biomass in northeast China using joint forest resources inventory and remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Being able to accurately estimate and map forest biomass at large scales is important for a better understanding of the terrestrial carbon cycle and for improving the effectiveness of forest management. In this study, forest plot sample data, forest resources inventory (FRI) data, and SPOT Vegetation (SPOT-VGT) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were used to estimate total forest biomass and spatial distribution of forest biomass in northeast China (with 1 km resolution). Total forest biomass at both county and provincial scales was estimated using FRI data of 11 different forest types obtained by sampling 1156 forest plots, and newly-created volume to biomass conversion models. The biomass density at the county scale and SPOT-VGT NDVI data were used to estimate the spatial distribution of forest biomass. The results suggest that the total forest biomass was 2.4 Pg (1 Pg = 10(15) g), with an average of 77.2 Mg ha(-1), during the study period. Forests having greater biomass density were located in the middle mountain ranges in the study area. Human activities affected forest biomass at different elevations, slopes and aspects. The results suggest that the volume to biomass conversion models that could be developed using more plot samples and more detailed forest type classifications would be better suited for the study area and would provide more accurate biomass estimates. Use of both FRI and remote sensing data allowed the down-scaling of regional forest biomass statistics to forest cover pixels to produce a relatively fine-resolution biomass map.

TI  - A Range Ambiguity Suppression Processing Method for Spaceborne SAR with Up and Down Chirp Modulation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Range ambiguity is one of the factors which affect the SAR image quality. Alternately transmitting up and down chirp modulation pulses is one of the methods used to suppress the range ambiguity. However, the defocusing range ambiguous signal can still hold the stronger backscattering intensity than the mainlobe imaging area in some case, which has a severe impact on visual effects and subsequent applications. In this paper, a novel hybrid range ambiguity suppression method for up and down chirp modulation is proposed. The method can obtain the ambiguity area image and reduce the ambiguity signal power appropriately, by applying pulse compression using a contrary modulation rate and CFAR detecting method. The effectiveness and correctness of the approach is demonstrated by processing the archive images acquired by Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR sensor in full-polarization mode.

TI  - Nonuniform Time-Lag Effects of Asymmetric Warming on Net Primary Productivity across Global Terrestrial Biomes
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming exhibits asymmetric patterns over a diel time, with the trend of nighttime warming exceeding that of daytime warming, a phenomenon commonly known as asymmetric warming. Recently, increasing studies have documented the significant instantaneous impacts of asymmetric warming on terrestrial vegetation growth, but the indirect effects of asymmetric warming carrying over vegetation growth (referred to here as time-lag effects) remain unknown. Here, we quantitatively studied the time-lag effects (within 1 year) of asymmetric warming on global plant biomes by using terrestrial vegetation net primary production (NPP) derived by the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model and accumulated daytime and nighttime temperature (ATmax and ATmin) from 1982 to 2013. Partial correlation and time-lag analyses were conducted at a monthly scale to obtain the partial correlation coefficients between NPP and ATmax/ATmin and the lagged durations of NPP responses to ATmax/ATmin. The results showed that (i) asymmetric warming has nonuniform time-lag effects on single plant biomes, and distinguishing correlations exist in different vegetation biomes' associations to asymmetric warming; (ii) terrestrial biomes respond to ATmax (4.63 +/- 3.92 months) with a shorter protracted duration than to ATmin (6.06 +/- 4.27 months); (iii) forest biomes exhibit longer prolonged duration in responding to asymmetric warming than nonforest biomes do; (iv) mosses and lichens (Mosses), evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF), deciduous needleleaf forests (DNF), and mixed forests (MF) tend to positively correlate with ATmax, whereas the other biomes associate with ATmax with near-equal splits of positive and negative correlation; and (v) ATmin has a predominantly positive influence on terrestrial biomes, except for Mosses and DNF. This study provides a new perspective on terrestrial ecosystem responses to asymmetric warming and highlights the importance of including such nonuniform time-lag effects into currently used terrestrial ecosystem models during future investigations of vegetation-climate interactions.

TI  - Metastatic pathways and lymph node dissection in lower lip cancer
T2  - MKG-CHIRURG
M3  - Article
AB  - The most common histologic entity among lower lip neoplasms is squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Nodal metastasis is found in approximately 8% of patients, a figure which lies between the dissemination prevalence rates of cutaneous (4-5%) and oral SCC (20-40%). The submental and submandibular lymph nodes (level IaEuroa and IaEurob) are most often involved, and nodal metastases are found with decreasing frequency in the cervical nodes of levels II, III and IV along the jugular and carotid sheath. The risk for nodal dissemination rises with increasing tumor depth and dedifferentiation (histologic grading), factors which can be combined to identify patients with a higher risk for nodal metastases. Further risk factors are tumor size, immunosuppression, perineural spread, lymph vessel invasion, and frequent tumor recurrence. In patients with a higher risk for nodal metastases elective lymph node surgery/dissection (ELND) should be considered, even if staging shows no evidence for dissemination (cN0). Selective lymph node dissection (SLND) of level I and II (suprahyoidal SLND) or level I-III (supraomohyoidal SLND) are adequate in cN0 cases. Extension to further levels or modified radical neck dissection is only necessary when metastases are present. Alternatively, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) can be performed, although adequate evidence-based data on SLNB are currently unavailable. Lymph node surgery in lip cancer can be performed together with resection of the primary tumor and lip reconstruction, or later in a secondary procedure.

TI  - Coefficient of variation for use in crop area classification across multiple climates
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the coefficient of variation (CV) is introduced as a unitless statistical measurement for the classification of croplands using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. As a measurement of change, the CV is able to capture changing backscatter responses caused by cycles of planting, growing, and harvesting, and thus is able to differentiate these areas from a more static forest or urban area. Pixels with CV values above a given threshold are classified as crops, and below the threshold are non-crops. This paper uses cross-polarized L-band SAR data from the ALOS PALSAR satellite to classify eleven regions across the United States, covering a wide range of major crops and climates. Two separate sets of classification were done, with the first targeting the optimum classification thresholds for each dataset, and the second using a generalized threshold for all datasets to simulate a large-scale operationalized situation. Overall accuracies for the first phase of classification ranged from 66%-81%, and 62%-84% for the second phase. Visual inspection of the results shows numerous possibilities for improving the classifications while still using the same classification method, including increasing the number and temporal frequency of input images in order to better capture phenological events and mitigate the effects of major precipitation events, as well as more accurate ground truth data. These improvements would make the CV method a viable tool for monitoring agriculture throughout the year on a global scale.

TI  - A Semianalytical Model of the Synthetic Aperture, Interferometric Radar Altimeter Mean Echo, and Echo Cross-Product and Its Statistical Fluctuations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper develops a model of the synthetic aperture, interferometric satellite radar altimeter echo power, and echo cross-product. The model uses the smallness of the satellite pitch and roll angles, and the limited range of satellite altitude to provide a semianalytical echo model, whose numerical dimensions are limited to two in the synthetic aperture case or three in the interferometric case at large roll angles, making its application to extensive data practical. By not implementing the synthetic beam formation, it is demonstrated that the model recovers the conventional case of a pulse-limited altimeter. A theoretical description of the fluctuations in the multilooked, interferometric cross-product, and the synthetic aperture and pulse-limited powers is given by extending the model to describe correlations between individual looks in each case. The model offers the potential to retrieve ocean-surface parameters from synthetic aperture and pulse-limited altimeter data simultaneously, with obvious application to the new generation of altimeters onboard CryoSat-2, Sentinel-3, and Sentinel-6 during the transition to operational synthetic aperture radar altimetry.

TI  - Use of bio-optical profiling float data in validation of ocean colour satellite products in a remote ocean region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Utility of data from autonomous profiling floats for the validation of satellite ocean colour products from current satellite ocean colour sensors was assessed using radiometric and chlorophyll a fluorescence data from bio-geochemical profiling floats (BGC-Argo) deployed in the subtropical gyre of the Indian Ocean. One of the floats was equipped with downward irradiance and upwelling radiance sensors, allowing the remote sensing reflectance, R-rs, to be determined. Comparisons between satellite and in situ R-rs, indicated good agreement for the shorter wavelengths, but weak relationships for both satellites for the 555 nm channel, and showed that radiometers deployed on multipurpose, off-the-shelf BGC-Argo floats can provide validation-quality measurements. About 300 chlorophyll a concentration match-ups were achieved within 18 months, which increased the number of validation data points available for the Indian Ocean as a whole by a factor of similar to 4 from the previous historical record. Generally, the satellite data agreed with the float-derived chlorophyll concentration within the uncertainty of +/- 35%, for the band-difference (OCI) and band-ratio (OC3) algorithms, but not for a semi analytical ocean colour model (GSM) that exhibited significantly higher chlorophyll values (> 100% mean difference). Our results indicate that autonomous float-based measurements provide substantial potential for improving regional validation of satellite ocean colour products in remote areas.

TI  - Ultraclean Layers and Optically Thin Clouds in the Stratocumulus-to-Cumulus Transition. Part I: Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A common feature of the stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition (SCT) is the presence of layers in which the concentration of particles larger than 0.1 mu m is below 10 cm(-3). These ultraclean layers (UCLs) are explored using aircraft observations from 14 flights of the NSF-NCARGulfstreamV(G-V) aircraft between California and Hawaii. UCLs are commonly located in the upper part of decoupled boundary layers, with coverage increasing from less than 5% within 500 km of the California coast to; similar to 30%-60% west of 1308W. Most clouds in UCLs are thin, horizontally extensive layers containing drops with median volume radii ranging from 15 to 30 mm. Many UCL clouds are optically thin and do not fully attenuate the G-V lidar and yet are frequently detected with a 94-GHz radar with a sensitivity of around -30 dBZ. Satellite data indicate that UCL clouds have visible reflectances of; similar to 0.1-0.2 and are often quasi laminar, giving them a veil-like appearance. These optically thin veil clouds exist for 1-3 h or more, are associated with mesoscale cumulus clusters, and likely grow by spreading under strong inversions. Active updrafts in cumulus (Cu) clouds have droplet concentrations of; similar to 25-50 cm(-3). Collision-coalescence in the Cu and later sedimentation in the thinner UCL clouds are likely the key processes that remove droplets in UCL clouds. UCLs are relatively quiescent, and a lack of mixing with dry air above and below the cloud may help to explain their longevity. The very low and highly variable droplet concentrations in UCL clouds, together with their low geometrical and optical thickness, make these clouds particularly challenging to represent in large-scale models.

TI  - Structure is more important than physiology for estimating intracanopy distributions of leaf temperatures
T2  - ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating leaf temperature distributions (LTDs) in canopies is crucial in forest ecology. Leaf temperature affects the exchange of heat, water, and gases, and it alters the performance of leaf-dwelling species such as arthropods, including pests and invaders. LTDs provide spatial variation that may allow arthropods to thermoregulate in the face of long-term changes in mean temperature or incidence of extreme temperatures. Yet, recording LTDs for entire canopies remains challenging. Here, we use an energy-exchange model (RATP) to examine the relative roles of climatic, structural, and physiological factors in influencing three-dimensional LTDs in tree canopies. A Morris sensitivity analysis of 13 parameters showed, not surprisingly, that climatic factors had the greatest overall effect on LTDs. In addition, however, structural parameters had greater effects on LTDs than did leaf physiological parameters. Our results suggest that it is possible to infer forest canopy LTDs from the LTDs measured or simulated just at the surface of the canopy cover over a reasonable range of parameter values. This conclusion suggests that remote sensing data can be used to estimate 3D patterns of temperature variation from 2D images of vegetation surface temperatures. Synthesis and applications. Estimating the effects of LTDs on natural plant-insect communities will require extending canopy models beyond their current focus on individual species or crops. These models, however, contain many parameters, and applying the models to new species or to mixed natural canopies depends on identifying the parameters that matter most. Our results suggest that canopy structural parameters are more important determinants of LTDs than are the physiological parameters that tend to receive the most empirical attention.

TI  - Study on the relationship between urbanization and fine particulate matter (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) concentration and its implication in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Correlation between urbanization and environmental pollution is a major focus of study in geography, environmental science, and economics. Particulate matter is the primary pollutant of air pollution and made up of heavy metal, organic carbon and aromatic hydrocarbon and complicated chemicals. PM2.5 are fine particulate matter with diameters that are less than 2.5 pm. The aim of this study on the relationship between urbanization and PM2.(5) concentration is to achieve a win-win situation of both economic development and environmental protection, which is of great significance to sustainable development in China. This paper uses PM2.5 remote sensing data and statistical yearbook data from 2000 to 2011 to build four panel data models within the urbanization-PM2.5 concentration Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) framework. The goal is to find out the correlations between PM2.5 concentration and economic urbanization, population urbanization, and space urbanization. Furthermore, scenario simulations are set to predict when China will reach inflection point and achieve its target concentration. Results show that the relationship between economic urbanization and PM(2.5)concentration is an inverted N-shaped or inverted U-shaped curve. Most cities in East China have reached the second inflection point of inverted-N curve to step into the win-win stage while many cities in Middle China still need 10-15 years to arrive at the inflection point of the inverted-U curve. Therefore, China is under great pressure to prevent PM2.5 pollution and pursue more targeted PM2.5-reduction policies for air quality improvement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Discrimination of Algal-Bloom Using Spaceborne SAR Observations of Great Lakes in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although optical remote sensing can intuitively detect algal bloom, it is limited by the weather conditions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is not affected by inadequate weather conditions. According to visual interpretation of SAR images and comparisons of quasi-synchronized optical images, the gathering areas of algal bloom present as dark regions on SAR images. It is shown that using SAR to monitor the water surface is workable. However, dark regions may also be caused by other factors, such as low wind speeds. This challenges with SAR monitoring of algal bloom on the water surface. In this study, an improved K-means algorithm, combined with multi-Otsu thresholding algorithm, was proposed to segment the dark regions. After feature analysis and extraction of Sentinel-1A images, an algal bloom recognition model with a support vector machine (SVM) was applied to discriminate the algal bloom dark regions from the low wind dark regions. According the experimental results, the overall accuracy achieved 74.00% in Taihu Lake. Additionally, this method was also validated in Chaohu Lake and Danjiangkou Reservoir. Therefore, it can be concluded that SAR can provide a new technical means for monitoring algal bloom of inland lakes, particularly when it is cloudy and unsuitable for optical remote sensing. To obtain more information about algal bloom, multi-band and multi-polarization SAR images can be considered for future.

TI  - Scaling Correction of Remotely Sensed Leaf Area Index for Farmland Landscape Pattern With Multitype Spatial Heterogeneities Using Fractal Dimension and Contextural Parameters
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-accuracy retrieval of the crop leaf area index (LAI) in farmlands via remote sensing is the premise of reflecting the true growth condition of the crop. This paper aimed at scaling correction of LAI retrieval and developed an LAI scaling transfer model for farmland landscape pattern with multitype spatial heterogeneities according to the multiple types of farmland underlying surfaces in China. The interclass heterogeneity (caused by the alternate distribution of different cover types) and intraclass heterogeneity (caused by the difference in growth conditions within the same crop) both exist in the farmland landscape. The contextural parameters (fractions of components) and fractal dimension of the up-scaling pixel were used to quantitatively describe and correct the scaling effect caused by the two types of spatial heterogeneity, respectively. A scaling transfer model of inversed LAI was built by comprehensively considering intraclass and interclass heterogeneities. Results indicated that the LAI scaling bias of the up-scaling mixed pixel was mainly caused by the interclass heterogeneity even when the areal proportion of the noncrop component was low. The scaling transfer model corrected the scaling effect of LAI, with the root-mean-square error and mean absolute percentage error decreasing from 0.599 and 10.00% to 0.077 and 1.11%, respectively. The developed method based on fractal theory and contextural parameters effectively weakened the influence of the scaling effect on the accuracy of LAI retrieval.

TI  - Land Cover Classification Using Features Generated From Annual Time-Series Landsat Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this letter is to investigate and demonstrate potential accuracy improvements in land cover classification using Landsat data, by integrating time-series features with a specially designed classification method. We present a new framework, mapping land cover types using annual time-series Landsat data (LandUTime), which adopts a two-stage approach. First, to generate pattern features, regression analysis is conducted on annual time-series Landsat data at the pixel level. Second, all features are packed into "blocks" and delivered to "UniBagging," which organizes base classifiers in separated sets according to the feature subspace, and conducts classification by integrating the results of many base classifiers. To evaluate the effectiveness of LandUTime, we performed a series of experiments on six Landsat bands. The results show marked improvements in both overall classification accuracy and Cohen's kappa coefficient. LandUTime is particularly promising for distinguishing objects whose spectral characteristics show temporal differences, such as deciduous or evergreen forest and cultivated crops.

TI  - Vegetation Indices Combining the Red and Red-Edge Spectral Information for Leaf Area Index Retrieval
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial biophysical variable for agroecosystems monitoring. Conventional vegetation indices (VIs) based on red and near infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are commonly used to estimate the LAI. However, these indices commonly saturate at moderate-to-dense canopies (e.g., NDVI saturates when LAI exceeds three). Modified VIs have then been proposed to replace the typical red/green spectral region with the red-edge spectral region. One significant and often ignored aspect of this modification is that the reflectance in the red-edge spectral region is comparatively sensitive to chlorophyll content which is highly variable between different crops and different phenological states. In this study, three improved indices are proposed combining reflectance both in the red and red-edge spectral regions into the NDVI, the modified simple ratio index (MSR), and the green chlorophyll index (CIgreen) formula. These improved indices are termed NDVIred&RE (red and red-edge NDVI), MSRred&RE (red and red-edgeMSR index), and CIred&RE (red and red-edge CI). The indices were tested using RapidEye images and in-situ data from campaigns at Maccarese Farm (Central Rome, Italy), in which four crop types at four different growth stages were measured. We investigated the predictive power of nine VIs for crop LAI estimation, including NDVI, MSR, and CIgreen; the red-edge modified indices: NDVIRed-edge, MSRRed-edge, and CIRed-edge (generally represented by VIRed-edge); and the newly improved indices: NDVIred&RE, MSRred&RE, and CIred&RE (generally represented by VIred&RE). The results show that VIred&RE improves the coefficient of determination (R-2) for LAI estimation by 10% in comparison to VIRed-edge. The newly improved indices prove to be the powerful alternatives for the LAI estimation of crops with wide chlorophyll range, and may provide valuable information for satellites equipped with red-edge channels (such as Sentinel-2) when applied to precision agriculture.

T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a three-dimensional (3-D) force sensor based on fiber Bragg grating (FBG) for robot plantar force measuring. A classical Maltese-cross beam with multiplexed FBGs has been designed for 3-D force sensing. Strain distribution characteristics and dynamic performance of the Maltese-cross elastomer have been investigated by using finite element analysis. Through ingenious design, 3-D forces of Fx, Fy, and Fz have been measured by only five sensitive elements of FBG, meanwhile, decoupling and temperature compensation have also been realized, which greatly reduces the number of sensitive element compared with the traditional resistance strain gauge based multi-axis force sensor. Comprehensive performance test has been carried out, and the experimental results demonstrate that the sensor possesses good linearity, weak coupling, and creep resistance.

TI  - Subpixel Surface Water Extraction (SSWE) Using Landsat 8 OLI Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water extraction from remote sensing imagery has been a very active research topic in recent years, as this problem is essential for monitoring the environment, ecosystems, climate, and so on. In order to extract surface water accurately, we developed a new subpixel surface water extraction (SSWE) method, which includes three steps. Firstly, a new all bands water index (ABWI) was developed for pure water pixel extraction. Secondly, the mixed water-land pixels were extracted by a morphological dilation operation. Thirdly, the water fractions within the mixed water-land pixels were estimated by local multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). The proposed ABWI and SSWE have been evaluated by using three data sets collected by the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI). Results show that the accuracy of ABWI is higher than that of the normalized difference water index (NDWI). According to the obtained surface water maps, the proposed SSWE shows better performance than the automated subpixel water mapping method (ASWM). Specifically, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) obtained by our SSWE for the data sets considered in experiments is 0.117, which is better than that obtained by ASWM (0.143). In conclusion, the SSWE can be used to extract surface water with high accuracy, especially in areas with optically complex aquatic environments.

TI  - An integrated method for validating long-term leaf area index products using global networks of site-based measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term ground LAI measurements from the global networks of sites (e.g. FLUXNET) have emerged as a promising data source to validate remotely sensed global LAI product time-series. However, the spatial scale-mismatch issue between site and satellite observations hampers the use of such invaluable ground measurements in validation practice. Here, we propose an approach (Grading and Upscaling of Ground Measurements, GUGM) that integrates a spatial representativeness grading criterion and a spatial upscaling strategy to resolve this scale-mismatch issue and maximize the utility of time-series of site-based LAI measurements. The performance of GUGM was carefully evaluated by comparing this method to both benchmark LAI and other widely used conventional approaches. The uncertainty of three global LAI products (i.e. MODIS, GLASS and GEOV1) was also assessed based on the LAI time-series validation dataset derived from GUGM. Considering all the evaluation results together, this study suggests that the proposed GUGM approach can significantly reduce the uncertainty from spatial scale mismatch and increase the size of the available validation dataset. In particular, the proposed approach outperformed other widely used approaches in these two respects. Furthermore, GUGM was successfully implemented to validate global LAI products in various ways with advantaging frequent time-series validation dataset. The validation results of the global LAI products show that GLASS has the lowest uncertainty, followed by GEOV1 and MODIS for the overall biome types. However, MODIS provides more consistent uncertainties across different years than GLASS and GEOV1. We believe that GUGM enables us to better understand the structure of LAI product uncertainties and their evolution across seasonal or annual contexts. In turn, this method can provide fundamental information for further LAI algorithm improvements and the broad application of LAI product time-series.

TI  - Observations of Total Columns of CO Based on Solar Absorption Spectra
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of the total columns of carbon monoxide(CO) in Hefei area are performed based on ground -based high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and we continuously collect the near -infrared solar absorption spectra and obtain time series of total column of CO through the atmosphere from September 2015 to July 2016. The observation results show that the column-averaged dry air mole fraction XCO in this area has obvious seasonal variation during the measurement period. Observation result shows that in the measured period XCO in Hefei area has obvious seasonal change. In October 2015 it has a smaller value, and then it gradually increases, in March 2016 it reaches the maximum at the end of July. Then it declines gradually, and gets to the minimum. We also analyze the reason of the XCO seasonal variation. In order to verify the observations based on the near-infrared region, we use MOPITT satellite data and CO total columns retrieved from the mid-infrared spectra collected by the same spectrometer at Hefei site to compare with the simultaneous measurements. The comparison results show that the seasonal variation of MOPITT data is similar to that of ground -based near -infrared observations, and overall MOPITT observations are higher than ground -based FTS observations. The seasonal variation and variation range of column values of CO retrieved from the mid -infrared spectra agree with those from the near-infrared spectra. The correlation coefficients between the daily averaged CO total columns of the ground-based near-infrared observations with those of satellite and mid-infrared observations are 0. 85 and 0. 91, respectively, which shows the high correlation and proves the accuracy of the CO total columns of the ground-based near-infrared observations. It is the first time to observe the total columns of carbon monoxide(CO) in Hefei area by using ground-based high resolution Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and compare them with MOPITT satellite data to get precise result. It provides the theoretical basis to understand the time and space distribution and changes of CO in atmospheric and trace source-sink distribution of CO in Hefei area.

TI  - Multisource Earth Observation Data for Land-Cover Classification Using Random Forest
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, multisource earth observation (EO) data sets, including multitemporal Landsat-8, digital surface model, and spatial information, were integrated for land-cover classification by random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVMs). We demonstrated in this letter that both RF and SVM are useful tools for classification of land cover in the local climate zones featured with highly heterogeneous landscape. Classification of land cover by RF was with an overall accuracy (OA) of 86.2%, while the OA was 85.5% for SVM. However, we found that RF was more stable than SVM for multisource EO data in classifying land cover without normalizing different feature data sets. Experiments showed that the thermal features were more important than temporal and spatial ones in discriminating impervious objects, while the temporal and spatial features were generally better than thermal ones in separating the distinct vegetation categories. Another finding was that our experiments indicated that spectral features were the most important in classification of land cover, followed by temporal, thermal, and spatial features, respectively. As to the spectral features, red channels were the most important, followed by short-wave infrared, near-infrared, and green channels. Thus, it could be concluded that the combination of spectral, thermal, spatial, and temporal information would be an optimal approach to increase the OA of land-cover classification in the zones featured with highly heterogeneous landscape.

TI  - Delineating Urban Boundaries Using Landsat 8 Multispectral Data and VIIRS Nighttime Light Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Administering an urban boundary (UB) is increasingly important for curbing disorderly urban land expansion. The traditionally manual digitalization is time-consuming, and it is difficult to connect UB in the urban fringe due to the fragmented urban pattern in daytime data. Nighttime light (NTL) data is a powerful tool used to map the urban extent, but both the blooming effect and the coarse spatial resolution make the urban product unable to meet the requirements of high-precision urban study. In this study, precise UB is extracted by a practical and effective method using NTL data and Landsat 8 data. Hangzhou, a megacity experiencing rapid urban sprawl, was selected to test the proposed method. Firstly, the rough UB was identified by the search mode of the concentric zones model (CZM) and the variance-based approach. Secondly, a buffer area was constructed to encompass the precise UB that is near the rough UB within a certain distance. Finally, the edge detection method was adopted to obtain the precise UB with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The experimental results show that a good performance was achieved and that it solved the largest disadvantage of the NTL data-blooming effect. The findings indicated that cities with a similar level of socio-economic status can be processed together when applied to larger-scale applications.

AB  - Persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI) detects and analyses PS points from multitemporal SAR images for scene deformation monitoring. We propose a novel technique to identify disappearing and emerging PS points, which are regarded as building changes in cities. A spatiotemporal analysis is implemented as both spatial position and occurrence time are obtained for each change point. We first estimate each pixel's temporal coherences in different image subsets. Computed from temporal coherences, a change index sequence is introduced to quantify each pixel's probabilities of being change points at different times. All pixels' change indices are then utilized to extract change points by a global, automatic, and statistical-based scheme. We then eliminate blunders by a spatial filtering. Finally, the occurrence times of the change points are detected based on the temporal variation in their change index sequences. We implement a simulated data test to validate and assess our method. Using TerraSAR-X images, our real data test successfully recognizes steady, disappearing, and emerging buildings in Berlin, Germany within 2013.

TI  - Deformation at longyao ground fissure and its surroundings, north China plain, revealed by ALOS PALSAR PS-InSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Longyao ground fissure (LGF) is the longest and most active among more than 1000 ground fissures on the North China Plain. There have been many studies on the formation mechanism of the LGF, due to its scientific importance and its potential for damage to the environment. These studies have been based on both regional tectonic analysis and numerical simulations. In order to provide a better understanding of the formation mechanism, the deformation of the crack and its surrounding environment should be taken into consideration. In this paper, PS-InSAR technology was employed to assess the ground deformation of LGF and its surrounding area, using L-band ALOS-1 PALSAR images from 2007 to 2011. The characteristics of ground deformation, relationships between fissure activity and surrounding faults and groundwater exploitation were analyzed. This study shows that the north side of Longyao fault (LF) is uplifting while the south side is subsiding. This provides the tectonic conditions responsible for the activity of the ground fissure. Local groundwater exploitation also plays an important role in the development of ground fissures. InSAR observations were modeled to infer the loading depth (-2.8 km) and the slip rate (31.1 mm/yr) of LF.

TI  - A Simulation-Based Study on the Comparison of Statistical and Time Series Forecasting Methods for Early Detection of Infectious Disease Outbreaks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Early detection of infectious disease outbreaks is one of the important and significant issues in syndromic surveillance systems. It helps to provide a rapid epidemiological response and reduce morbidity and mortality. In order to upgrade the current system at the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), a comparative study of state-of-the-art techniques is required. We compared four different temporal outbreak detection algorithms: the CUmulative SUM (CUSUM), the Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS), the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and the Holt-Winters algorithm. The comparison was performed based on not only 42 different time series generated taking into account trends, seasonality, and randomly occurring outbreaks, but also real-world daily and weekly data related to diarrhea infection. The algorithms were evaluated using different metrics. These were namely, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), F1 score, symmetric mean absolute percent error (sMAPE), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and mean absolute deviation (MAD). Although the comparison results showed better performance for the EARS C3 method with respect to the other algorithms, despite the characteristics of the underlying time series data, Holt-Winters showed better performance when the baseline frequency and the dispersion parameter values were both less than 1.5 and 2, respectively.

TI  - Preliminary Investigation of a New AHI Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) Retrieval Algorithm and Evaluation with Multiple Source AOD Measurements in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himawari-8 geostationary weather satellite, which is an Earth observing satellite launched in October 2014, has been applied in climate, environment, and air quality studies. Using hourly observation data from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board Himawari-8, a new dark target algorithm was proposed to retrieve the aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 1 km and 5 km resolutions over mainland China. Because of the short satellite operation time and lack of AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) sites across China, we cannot derive robust and representative surface reflectance relationships for the visible to near-infrared channels by atmospheric correction. Therefore, we inherited the empirical reflectance relationship from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and we used the AHI and MODIS spectral response functions to make the relationship more suitable for AHI. Ultimately, our AOD products can better reflect the regional characteristics with the AHI sensor. Seasonal averages showed that our product is more similar to MODIS Collection 6 (C6) Dark Target (DT) AOD than the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) AHI AOD, but the difference is largest in winter. In addition, we evaluated several satellite retrieval products (our AHI AOD, JAXA AHI AOD, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) VIIRS AOD, MODIS DT AOD, and MODIS DB AOD) against AERONET AOD from July 2016 to June 2017. The results showed that our AHI measurements demonstrate good agreement with, but exhibit a little overestimation, as compared to ground-based AERONET measurements with a correlation coefficient of 0.83 and an root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.112. The hourly validation also showed stable statistical results. A time series comparison with ground-based observations from two AERONET sites (Beijing-CAMS and XiangHe) showed that our AHI AOD products have trends as those in MODIS DB AOD, but that the bias in Beijing-CAMS is positive and higher than that in XiangHe. This error and the slight overestimation may be caused by the single continental aerosol model assumption and not considering the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI).

TI  - Convolutional Neural Network-Based Embarrassing Situation Detection under Camera for Social Robot in Smart Homes
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent research has shown that the ubiquitous use of cameras and voice monitoring equipment in a home environment can raise privacy concerns and affect human mental health. This can be a major obstacle to the deployment of smart home systems for elderly or disabled care. This study uses a social robot to detect embarrassing situations. Firstly, we designed an improved neural network structure based on the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to obtain feature information. By focusing on reducing area redundancy and computation time, we proposed a bounding-box merging algorithm based on region proposal networks (B-RPN), to merge the areas that have similar features and determine the borders of the bounding box. Thereafter, we designed a feature extraction algorithm based on our improved YOLO and B-RPN, called F-YOLO, for our training datasets, and then proposed a real-time object detection algorithm based on F-YOLO (RODA-FY). We implemented RODA-FY and compared models on our MAT social robot. Secondly, we considered six types of situations in smart homes, and developed training and validation datasets, containing 2580 and 360 images, respectively. Meanwhile, we designed three types of experiments with four types of test datasets composed of 960 sample images. Thirdly, we analyzed how a different number of training iterations affects our prediction estimation, and then we explored the relationship between recognition accuracy and learning rates. Our results show that our proposed privacy detection system can recognize designed situations in the smart home with an acceptable recognition accuracy of 94.48%. Finally, we compared the results among RODA-FY, Inception V3, and YOLO, which indicate that our proposed RODA-FY outperforms the other comparison models in recognition accuracy.

TI  - Amazon drought and forest response: Largely reduced forest photosynthesis but slightly increased canopy greenness during the extreme drought of 2015/2016
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazon droughts have impacted regional ecosystem functioning as well as global carbon cycling. The severe dry-season droughts in 2005 and 2010, driven by Atlantic sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly, have been widely investigated in terms of drought severity and impacts on ecosystems. Although the influence of Pacific SST anomaly on wet-season precipitation has been well recognized, it remains uncertain to what extent the droughts driven by Pacific SST anomaly could affect forest greenness and photosynthesis in the Amazon. Here, we examined the monthly and annual dynamics of forest greenness and photosynthetic capacity when Amazon ecosystems experienced an extreme drought in 2015/2016 driven by a strong El Nino event. We found that the drought during August 2015-July 2016 was one of the two most severe meteorological droughts since 1901. Due to the enhanced solar radiation during this drought, overall forest greenness showed a small increase, and 21.6% of forests even greened up (greenness index anomaly >= 1 standard deviation). In contrast, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), an indicator of vegetation photosynthetic capacity, showed a significant decrease. Responses of forest greenness and photosynthesis decoupled during this drought, indicating that forest photosynthesis could still be suppressed regardless of the variation in canopy greenness. If future El Nino frequency increases as projected by earth system models, droughts would result in persistent reduction in Amazon forest productivity, substantial changes in tree composition, and considerable carbon emissions from Amazon.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Multispectral Image Fusion via Deep Two-Branches Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Enhancing the spatial resolution of hyperspectral image (HSI) is of significance for applications. Fusing HSI with a high resolution (HR) multispectral image (MSI) is an important technology for HSI enhancement. Inspired by the success of deep learning in image enhancement, in this paper, we propose a HSI-MSI fusion method by designing a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with two branches which are devoted to features of HSI and MSI. In order to exploit spectral correlation and fuse the MSI, we extract the features from the spectrum of each pixel in low resolution HSI, and its corresponding spatial neighborhood in MSI, with the two CNN branches. The extracted features are then concatenated and fed to fully connected (FC) layers, where the information of HSI and MSI could be fully fused. The output of the FC layers is the spectrum of the expected HR HSI. In the experiment, we evaluate the proposed method on Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), and Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data. We also apply it to real Hyperion-Sentinel data fusion. The results on the simulated and the real data demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive with other state-of-the-art fusion methods.

TI  - Deriving time-series three-dimensional displacements of mining areas from a single-geometry InSAR dataset
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a method for deriving time-series three-dimensional (3-D) displacements of mining areas from a single-geometry interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) dataset (hereafter referred to as the SGI-based method). This is mainly aimed at overcoming the limitation of the traditional multi-temporal InSAR techniques that require SAR data from at least three significantly different imaging geometries to fully retrieve time-series 3-D displacements of mining areas. The SGI-based method first generates the multi-temporal observations of the mining-induced vertical subsidence from the single-geometry InSAR data, using a previously developed method for retrieving 3-D mining-related displacements from a single InSAR pair (SIP). The weighted least-squares solutions of the time series of vertical subsidence are estimated from these generated multi-temporal observations of vertical subsidence. Finally, the time series of horizontal motions in the east and north directions are estimated using the proportional relationship between the horizontal motion and the subsidence gradient of the mining area, on the basis of the SGI-derived time series of vertical subsidence. Seven ascending ALOS PALSAR images from the Datong mining area of China were used to test the proposed SGI-based method. The results suggest that the SGI-based method is effective. The SGI-based method not only extends the SIP-based method to time-series 3-D displacement retrieval from a single-geometry InSAR dataset, but also limits the uncertainty propagation from InSAR-derived deformation to the estimated 3-D displacements.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 15th International Coastal Symposium (ICS)
CL  - Busan, SOUTH KOREA
AB  - In 2005 and 2008, Hurricanes Rita and Ike made landfalls as category 3 and 2 hurricanes to the west of Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge (RWR) in southwestern Louisiana. In 2013, three 30 cm sediment monoliths dominated by brown clay were recovered along a 30 m transect perpendicular to the shoreline from the RWR. Each monolith contains two distinct light-colored calcareous storm deposits that are attributable to these two landfalling hurricanes. Loss-on-ignition and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analyses were performed on all three sediment monoliths to study the sedimentological and geochemical characteristics of these two storm deposits. The geochemical results show that the storm deposits are characterized by higher-than-average values of Ca, Sr, Zr, and carbonates and low percentages of water and organics. In addition, remote sensing images show that the rate of average shoreline retreat at the RWR is 14.5 m/yr from 1998 to 2017, and 19 m/year and 25.5 m/yr during the Hurricane Rita and Ike years, respectively. Both loss-on-ignition and XRF results also show that despite being a stronger storm, the Hurricane Rita layers are much thinner than those of Hurricane Ike in all monoliths. Remote sensing data support our interpretation that Hurricane Rita caused significant shoreline erosion and coastal recession in 2005, rendering the sampling locations at least 30 m closer to the ocean and thereby more susceptible to storm surges when Hurricane Ike struck in 2008. Thus, these results suggest that site-to-sea distance is an important factor in determining the thicknesses of storm deposits in coastal wetlands, particularly along shorelines undergoing rapid marine transgression.

TI  - Overflow probability of the Salt Lake in Hoh Xil Region
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - After the bursting of Huiten Nor in Hoh Xil Region in September, 2011, the topic on whether the water overflowed from the Salt Lake would enter into the Chumaer River and become the northernmost source of the Yangtze River has aroused wide concern from public and academic field. Based on Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI remote sensing images during 2010-2015, SRTM 1 arc-second data, Google Earth elevation data and the observation data from the Wudaoliang meteorological station, the study initially analyzed the variations of the Salt Lake and its overflowing condition and probability. The results showed that the area of the Salt Lake expanded sharply from October 2011 to April 2013, and then it stepped into a stable expansion period. On October 27, 2015, the area of the Salt Lake had arrived at 151.38 km(2), which was about 3.35 times the area of the lake on March 3, 2010. The Salt Lake will overflow when its area reaches the range from 218.90 km(2) to 220.63 km(2). Due to the differences between SRTM DEM and Google Earth elevation data, the water level of the Salt Lake simulated would be 12 m or 9.6 m higher than the current level when the lake overflowed, and its reservoir capacity would increase by 23.71 km(3) or 17.27 km(3), respectively. Meanwhile, the overflowed water of the Salt Lake would run into the Qingshui River basin from its eastern part. Although the Salt Lake does not overflow in the coming decade, with watershed expansion of the Salt Lake and the projected precipitation increase in Hoh Xil region, the probability of water overflow from the Salt Lake and becoming a tributary of the Yangtze River will exist in the long term.

TI  - Updating Absolute Radiometric Characteristics for KOMPSAT-3 and KOMPSAT-3A Multispectral Imaging Sensors Using Well-Characterized Pseudo-Invariant Tarps and Microtops II
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric calibration of satellite imaging sensors should be performed periodically to account for the effect of sensor degradation in the space environment on image accuracy. In this study, we performed vicarious radiometric calibrations (relying on in situ data) of multispectral imaging sensors on the Korea multi-purpose satellite-3 and -3A (KOMPSAT-3 and -3A) to adjust the existing radiometric conversion coefficients according to time delay integration (TDI) adjustments and sensor degradation over time. The Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer model was used to obtain theoretical top of atmosphere radiances for both satellites. As input parameters for the 6S model, surface reflectance values of well-characterized pseudo-invariant tarps were measured using dual ASD FieldSpec((R)) 3 hyperspectral radiometers, and atmospheric conditions were measured using Microtops II (R) Sunphotometer and Ozonometer. We updated the digital number (DN) of the radiance coefficients of the satellites; these had been used to calibrate the sensors during in-orbit test periods in 2013 and 2015. The coefficients of determination, R-2, values between observed DNs of the sensors, and simulated radiances for the tarps were more than 0.999. The calibration errors were approximately 5.7% based on manifested error sources. We expect that the updated coefficients will be an important reference for KOMPSAT-3 and -3A users.

TI  - Daily Evapotranspiration Estimation at the Field Scale: Using the Modified SEBS Model and HJ-1 Data in a Desert-Oasis Area, Northwestern China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate continuous daily evapotranspiration (ET) at the field scale is crucial for allocating and managing water resources in irrigation areas, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. The authors integrated the modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) as an indicator of water stress into surface energy balance system (SEBS) to improve ET estimation under water-limited conditions. The new approach fed with Chinese satellite HJ-1 (environmental and disaster monitoring and forecasting with a small satellite constellation) images was used to map daily ET on the desert-oasis irrigation fields in the middle of the Heihe River Basin. The outputs, including instantaneous sensible heat flux (H) and daily ET from the MPDI-integrated SEBS and the original SEBS model, were compared with the eddy covariance observations. The results indicate that the MPDI-integrated SEBS significantly improved the surface turbulent fluxes in water-limited regions, especially for sparsely vegetated areas. The new approach only uses one optical satellite data and meteorological data as inputs, providing a considerable operational improvement for ET mapping. Moreover, HJ-1 high-resolution data promised continuous daily ET at the field scale, which helps in understanding the corresponding relationships among field, crop, and water consumption. Such detailed ET information can greatly serve water resources management in the study area as well as other arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Open Data for Global Multimodal Land Use Classification: Outcome of the 2017 IEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we present the scientific outcomes of the 2017 Data Fusion Contest organized by the Image Analysis and Data Fusion Technical Committee of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society. The 2017 Contest was aimed at addressing the problem of local climate zones classification based on a multi-temporal and multimodal dataset, including image (Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2) and vector data (from OpenStreetMap). The competition, based on separate geographical locations for the training and testing of the proposed solution, aimed at models that were accurate (assessed by accuracy metrics on an undisclosed reference for the test cities), general (assessed by spreading the test cities across the globe), and computationally feasible (assessed by having a test phase of limited time). The techniques proposed by the participants to the Contest spanned across a rather broad range of topics, and of mixed ideas and methodologies deriving from computer vision and machine learning but also deeply rooted in the specificities of remote sensing. In particular, rigorous atmospheric correction, the use of multidate images, and the use of ensemble methods fusing results obtained from different data sources/time instants made the difference.

TI  - Geographic Spread of Influenza under the Influence of Community Population Size, Which Differed from That of Measles and Rubella
T2  - JAPANESE JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The influenza season is defined as the period from week 36 of the year to week 20 of the subsequent year in this report. The population size of prefectures (x) and number of patients per prefecture (y) were initially uncorrelated, but a correlation developed as the season advanced. The correlation with correlation coefficient > 0.7 emerged increasingly earlier over time; it developed in week 5 of the subsequent year in 2001/2002, but in week 47 of the same year in 2014/2015. Once x and y were correlated, plots of y on the vertical axis against x on the horizontal axis resulted in a straight line, y = Cx(s), where s was the slope of the plot and C was a constant. The slope was high (s > 1) initially, but decreased (s < 1) later, indicating that influenza first spread to populated prefectures and then nationwide, involving less populated prefectures. This spread pattern was the same for the seasonal influenza and AHlpdm2009, although the progression of the latter was much faster. For measles and rubella epidemics, the number of patients per prefecture was proportional to the square of the population size from the start to the end of the season.

TI  - Analysis of satellite-derived landslide at Central Nepal from 2011 to 2016
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Practical landslide detection has been a challenging task for decades due to the limitations of algorithms and complicated landslide cases. Visual interpretation is still one of the most reliable methods for landslide detection. Owing to the development of machine learning, Google Earth Engine platform and free access to Landsat series images, this paper presents a pixel-level landslide detection model based on change detection using the random forest method in Nepal. From the year 2012-2016, the annual Landsat images are synthesized into one image based on a ranking sequence of NDVI (normalized differential vegetation index). Six more indexes and texture information are calculated as features, covering water, snow and vegetation enhancement. DEM (digital elevation model) is used to provide landscape pattern. The synthesized features and Landsat images of every 2 nearby years, and DEM are used to detect landslides in the latter year. Our model achieves an average producer's accuracy of 68.20% and user's accuracy of 77.01% for landslide detection in terms of the 9278 x 7443 pixel study image through the 5 years. Moreover, based on the landslide detection results, we analyzed the landslide event pattern in Central Nepal from 2012 to 2016, which accords with the actual cases.

TI  - Small Magnitude Co-Seismic Deformation of the 2017 Mw 6.4 Nyingchi Earthquake Revealed by InSAR Measurements with Atmospheric Correction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nyingchi Mw 6.4 earthquake on 17 November 2017 is the first large event since 1950 at the southeast end of the Jiali fault. This event was captured by interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) measurements from the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-1A radar satellite, which provide the potential to determine the fault plane, as well as the co-seismic slip distribution, and understand future seismic hazards. However, due to the limited magnitude of surface displacements and the strong topography variations, InSAR-derived co-seismic signals are contaminated by strong tropospheric effects which makes it difficult (if not impossible) to determine the source parameters and co-seismic slip distribution. In this paper, we employ the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service for InSAR (GACOS) to generate correction maps for the co-seismic interferograms, and successfully extract co-seismic surface displacements for this large event. The phase standard deviation after correction for a seriously-contaminated interferogram reaches 0.8 cm, significantly improved from the traditional phase correlation analysis (1.13 cm) or bilinear interpolation (1.28 cm) methods. Our best model suggests that the seismogenic fault is a NW-SE striking back-thrust fault with a right-lateral strike slip component. This reflects the strain partitioning of NE shortening and eastward movement of the Eastern Tibetan plateau due to the oblique convergence between the Indian and Eurasian plates.

TI  - Quantifying grazing patterns using a new growth function based on MODIS Leaf Area Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring grazing activities on grassland is crucial for ensuring sustainable grassland development and for protecting it from grazing-led degradation. The Leaf Area Index (LAI), which measures leaf coverage over a surface area, is commonly used as a proxy for grassland condition. However, current studies focus on the year-round or seasonal aggregated LAI change rather than the change that can be attributed explicitly to grazing, which is the important indicator for quantifying grassland grazing. This paper presents a new exponential growth function under grazing with an estimation algorithm, the purpose of which is to extract grazing-led LAI changes for every 8 days' satellite observations. All the analyses are based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD15A2H products. An improved MODIS LAI and an expected LAI are produced separately, considering both current and previous grazing-led LAI changes. The differences between expected LAI and improved LAI are then converted to the equivalent carbon mass of grazed material. This grazed carbon mass is then aggregated within the growing season, and compared with the expected carbon mass consumed by livestock (calculated from statistics yearbooks). In addition, Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is produced using the improved LAI, simulated by a Light Use Efficiency with Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (LUE-VPM). This is compared with the NPP produced by LUE-VPM based on original MODIS LAI, MODIS NPP products (MOD17A2H) and grassland monitoring stations' in situ measured data. Results show that the NPP calculated from the improved LAI is statistically the same as in situ converted NPP with a p-value equalling 0.998 (the RMSE between the two is 97.77 gC/m(2)). Conversely, the p-value between converted in situ measured carbon mass and the MODIS NPP product is 0.011 (the RMSE between the two is 133.98 gC/m(2)), indicating they are statistically different. The results detailed in this paper provide precise and almost real-time grassland grazing monitoring information for policy makers managing grassland.

TI  - Understanding Mountain-Wave Phases in ERS Tandem DInSAR Interferogram Using WRF Model Simulation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeat-pass spaceborne differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) is commonly used to measure surface deformation. However, the phase delay due to the atmospheric water vapor has a significant influence on the accuracy of DInSAR results. On the other hand, the signal delay in DInSAR can give the spatial variation information of water vapor during the two image acquisitions. There are some ripple-like phase signals in DInSAR, which are probably due to the mountain wave in the study area. In this paper, the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model is used to simulate the atmospheric delay and compared to the phase delay derived from DInSAR results to understand the mountain-wave phases in interferograms. The results indicate that the ripple-like phase signal in the DInSAR phase is due to different intensities of the mountain wave in two acquisitions. The WRF model can be used to explain the mechanism of mountain-wave phase in DInSAR, which may then, hopefully, he used for DInSAR atmospheric correction.

TI  - Recognizing the Relationship between Spatial Patterns in Water Quality and Land-Use/Cover Types: A Case Study of the Jinghe Oasis in Xinjiang, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the relationship between spatial water quality patterns and changes in land-use/cover types in the Jinghe Oasis, 47 water sampling sites measured in May and October 2015 were divided into six cluster layers using the self-organizing map method, which is based on non-hierarchical k-means classification. The water quality indices included the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), suspended solids (SS), total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N), chromaticity (SD), and turbidity (NUT). Data was also collected on the changes in the farmland, forest-grassland, water body, salinized land, and other land types during the wet and dry seasons. Then, we combined these data with the classification results of the GF-1 remote sensing satellite data obtained in May and October 2015 and analyzed the influences of land-use/cover type on water quality for different layers and seasons. The results indicate that Clusters 1 to 3 included monitoring samples from the wet season (May 2015), whereas Clusters 4 to 6 included monitoring samples from the dry season (October 2015). In general, the COD, SS, NUT, TN, and NH3-N values were high around the Ganjia Lake Haloxylon natural conservation area in the southern Ebinur Lake region, east of Ebinur Lake, and around the Kuitun River during the wet season. The SD values around these areas were high. Moreover, high BOD and TP values were mainly concentrated around the Ganjia Lake Haloxylon natural conservation area, as well as the Kuitun River, during the dry season. In the discussion on the relationship between the different water quality parameters and land-use/cover type changes, we determined that farmland, forest-grassland, and salinized land significantly influenced the water quality parameters in the Jinghe Oasis. In addition, the influences of various land-use/cover types on the water quality parameters in the research zone during the different seasons exhibited the following descending order of magnitude: farmland forest-grassland salinized land water body others. Moreover, their influences were lower during the wet season than the dry season. In conclusion, developing research on the relationship between the spatial framework of the water quality in the Jinghe Oasis and land-use/cover type changes is significant for the time sequence distribution of water quality in arid regions from both theoretical and practical perspectives.

TI  - Physical evolution of the Three Gorges Reservoir using advanced SVM on Landsat images and SRTM DEM data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) is one of the largest hydropower reservoirs in the world. However, changes of the important physical characteristics of the reservoir covering pre-, during-, and post- dam have not been well studied. This study analyzed the lengths and water surface areas of the TGR using advanced support vector machine method (SVM) combined Landsat images with the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model (DEM), which showed an increasing trend of lengths and surface areas with variable growth rates from pre-dam period to post-dam period. The highest water level (ca. 171.5 m) was reported in 1st Jan, 2015, with the longest length of 687.8 km and largest water surface area of 1106.2 km(2) during the study period. The lowest increasing magnitude of the reservoir length occurred in the first stage (2000-2005) but with the fastest magnitude of water surface area increase. The third stage (2010-2015) showed highest increase magnitude of length and lowest increase magnitude of water surface area. Meanwhile, the increased reservoir areas were mainly from cultivated land, forest land, and building land, with the biggest increase rate of cultivated land regardless of periods. Specifically, cultivated land contributed 39.1-46.0% to increased reservoir water area; the proportions were 22.6-29.6%, 22.1-24.1%, and 5.6-9.4% for forest, building land, and grassland, respectively. The study provides important data for the TGR physical evolution in the Holocene.

TI  - FY-3A Microwave Data Assimilation Based on the POD-4DEnVar Method
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A four-dimensional ensemble variational assimilation system for FY-3A satellite data is constructed using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD)-based ensemble four-dimensional variational (4DVar) assimilation method (referred to as POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System). Using the community radiative transfer model (CRTM) as the observation operator for satellite data, ensemble samples are mapped to the observation space and observation perturbations are generated. The observation perturbations matrix of satellite data is then decomposed to obtain the orthogonal eigenvectors and the eigenvalues for the observation perturbations matrix. The observation perturbations matrix and model perturbations matrix are transformed using orthogonal eigenvectors as basis functions and an explicit expression for the analysis increment is obtained. The expression includes the flow-dependent background error covariance and avoids the difficulty of solving the adjoint model for four-dimensional variational assimilation. In order to evaluate the capability of POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System, single observation experiments and observation system simulation experiments (OSSEs) for FY-3A MWHS and MWTS sensor data were designed to simulate a large-scale precipitation event occurring over the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. The results of single observation experiments show that POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System can assimilate satellite data correctly, and the background error covariance of POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System has obvious flow-dependent characteristics. The results of the OSSEs show that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the assimilation analysis field with respect to the true field are lower than those of the background field, which indicates that the POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System can assimilate satellite data effectively. The sensitivity of the POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System to the percentage of truncated eigenvalues, the number of ensemble members, assimilation time window length, and the horizontal localization scale (which are key parameters for POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System) was tested in sensitivity experiments. These experiments show that if the percentage of truncated eigenvalues for POD decomposition is more than 80%, POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System has strong assimilation skill. Increasing the number of initial ensemble members has little influence on the assimilation ability of POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System. But, increasing the number of the physical ensemble members can clearly increase the assimilation ability. The assimilation skill of POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System is optimal when the length of the assimilation time window is 5 h or 3 h and the horizontal localization scale is 500 km or above. The assimilation ability of POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System is preliminarily tested by single observation experiments and OSSEs. The results show that it is feasible to assimilate satellite data using the POD-4DEnVar method. In the future, a variety of real satellite data and a variety of mesoscale weather cases will be used to further verify the stability of POD-4DEnVar Satellite Assimilation System.

TI  - Integrating forest inventory data and MODIS data to map species-level biomass in Chinese boreal forests
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate knowledge of species-level biomass is essential for forest managers to sustain forest resources and respond to various forest disturbance regimes. In this study, maps of species-level biomass in Chinese boreal forests were generated by integrating Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images with forest inventory data using k nearest neighbor (kNN) methods and evaluated at different scales. The performance of 630 kNN models based on different distance metrics, k values, and temporal MODIS predictor variables were compared. Random Forest (RF) showed the best performance among the six distance metrics: RF, Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, most similar neighbor in canonical correlation space, most similar neighbor computed using projection pursuit, and gradient nearest neighbor. No appreciable improvement was observed using multi-month MODIS data compared with using single-month MODIS data. At the pixel scale, species-level biomass for larch and white birch had relatively good accuracy (root mean square deviation < 62.1%), while the other species had poorer accuracy. The accuracy of most species except for willow and spruce was improved up to the ecoregion scale. The maps of species-level biomass captured the effects of disturbances including fire and harvest and can provide useful information for broad-scale forest monitoring over time.

AB  - Remote sensing data from different sensors have different advantages in wave band, space resolution, time resolution, imaging mode and different adaptabilities. The ecological environment and dynamic change monitoring of coast zones requires mutual image data coordinative computation. First, the earth observation net is introduced which can provide the cooperative observation ability. Second, this paper studies coordinative computing method of multi-source images which integrates multiple imaging advantages. This paper tests fine extraction and quantitative computing for pattern patches of the non-point source polluted scenery centralized layout in the coast zone, Fujian province, China. The results show that this method improves spatio-temporal recognition precision and quantitation precision.

TI  - Inter-satellite calibration of FengYun 3 medium energy electron fluxes with POES electron measurements
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We perform an L-shell dependent inter-satellite calibration of FengYun 3 medium energy electron measurements with POES measurements based on rough orbital conjunctions within 5 min x 0.1 L x 0.5 MLT. By comparing electron flux data between the U.S. Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) and Chinese sun-synchronous satellites including FY-3B and FY-3C for a whole year of 2014, we attempt to remove less reliable data and evaluate systematic uncertainties associated with the FY-3B and FY-3C datasets, expecting to quantify the inter-satellite calibration factors for the 150-350 keV energy channel at L = 2-7. Compared to the POES data, the FY-3B and FY-3C data generally exhibit a similar trend of electron flux variations but more or less underestimate them within a factor of 5 for the medium electron energy 150-350 keV channel. Good consistency in the flux conjunctions after the inter-calibration procedures gives us certain confidence to generalize our method to calibrate electron flux measurements from various satellite instruments.

TI  - Estimation of all-sky instantaneous surface incident shortwave radiation from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data using optimization method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface incident shortwave radiation (ISR) is a crucial parameter in the land surface radiation budget. Many reanalysis, observation-based, and satellite-derived global radiation products have been developed but often have insufficient accuracy and spatial resolution for many applications. In this paper, we propose a method based on a radiative transfer model for estimating surface ISR from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Top of Atmosphere (TOA) observations by optimizing the surface and atmospheric variables with a cost function. This approach consisted of two steps: retrieving surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function parameters, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and cloud optical depth (COD); and subsequently calculating surface ISR. Validation against measurements at seven Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD) sites resulted in an R-2 of 0.91, a bias of -6.47 W/m(2), and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 84.17 W/m(2) (15.12%) for the instantaneous results. Validation at eight high-latitude snow-covered Greenland Climate Network (GC-Net) sites resulted in an R-2 of 0.86, a bias of 21.40 W/m(2), and an RMSE of 84.77 W/m(2) (20.96%). These validation results show that the proposed method is much more accurate than the previous studies (usually with RMSEs of 80-150 W/m(2)). We further investigated whether incorporating additional satellite products, such as the MODIS surface broadband albedo (MCD43), aerosol (MOD/MYNA), and cloud products (MOD/MYD06), as constraints in the cost function would improve the accuracy. When the AOD and COD estimates were constrained, RMSEs were reduced to 62.19 W/m(2) (12.12%) and 71.70 W/m(2) (17.74%) at the SURFRAD and GC-Net sites, respectively. This algorithm could estimate surface ISR with MODIS TOA observations over both snow-free and seasonal/permanent snow-covered surfaces. The algorithm performed well at high-latitude sites, which is very useful for radiation budget research in the polar regions.

TI  - Effects of Urban Growth on Architectural Heritage: The Case of Buddhist Monasteries in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is unavoidable on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and it directly influences the region's architectural heritage. This study aims to evaluate the changes in urbanization around 152 Buddhist monasteries (3 km x 3 km) from 1993 to 2013 located in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. To evaluate the changes, we adopt both nighttime light data and data from the Geographic Information System, which were verified by the spatial relationship between urban areas of Lhasa and monasteries on a meso-scale and the environmental changes around monasteries by visual interpretation on a micro-scale in the same phase. The results show that the level of urbanization around 43 monasteries has increased between 1993 and 2013, and the areas of significant influence from urban growth have expanded from Lhasa between 1993 and 2003 to the Yarlung Tsangpo River, Nyangqu, and Lhasa River regions, as well as to the surrounding areas of Xining, and Tibetan areas in Sichuan between 2003 and 2013. This study explores a method of monitoring the architectural heritage of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau using "remote sensing big data", which can provide data support for policy formulation, technical intervention, and targeted field investigation on architectural heritage by screening research objects.

TI  - Monitoring of chlorophyll-a and sea surface silicate concentrations in the south part of Cheju island in the East China sea using MODIS data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Continually supplied with nutrients, phytoplankton maintains high productivity under ideal illumination and temperature conditions. Data in the south part of Cheju Island in the East China Sea (ECS), which has experienced a spring bloom since the 2000s, were acquired during a research cruise in the spring of 2007. Compared with in-situ measurements, MODIS chlorophyll-a measurements showed high stability in this area. Excluding some invalid stations data, the relationships between nutrients and chlorophyll-a concentrations in the study area were examined and compared with the results in 2015. A high positive correlation between silicate and chlorophyll-a concentration was identified, and a regression relationship was proposed. MODIS chlorophyll-a measurements and sea surface temperature were utilized to determine surface silicate distribution. The silicate concentration retrieved from MODIS exhibited good agreement with in-situ measurements with R-2 of 0.803, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.326 mu mol/L (8.23%), and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.9251 mu mol/L (23.38%). The study provides a new solution to identify nutrient distributions using satellite data such as MODIS for water bodies, but the method still needs to be refined to determine the relationship of chlorophyll-a and nutrients during other seasons to monitor water quality in this and other areas.

TI  - Development of Landsat-based annual US forest disturbance history maps (1986-2010) in support of the North American Carbon Program (NACP)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In Phase III of the North American Forest Dynamics (NAFD) study an automatic workflow has been developed for evaluating forest disturbance history using Landsat observations. It has four major components: an automated approach for image selection and preprocessing, the vegetation change tracker (VCT) forest disturbance analysis, postprocessing, and validation. This approach has been applied to the conterminous US (CONUS) to produce a comprehensive analysis of US forest disturbance history using the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) cloud computing system. The resultant NAFD-NEX product includes 25 annual forest disturbance maps for 1986-2010 and two time-integrated maps to provide spatial-temporal synoptic view of disturbances over this time period. These maps were derived based on 24,000 + scenes selected from 350,000 + available Landsat images at 30-m resolution, and were validated using a visual assessment of Landsat time-series images in combination with high resolution and other ancillary data sources over samples selected using a probability based sampling method. The validation revealed no major biases in the NAFD-NEX maps for disturbance events that resulted in at least 20% canopy cover loss. The average user's and producer's accuracies for the disturbance class were 53.6% and 53.3%, respectively, with the individual year's user's accuracy varying from 42.8% to 73.6% and producer's accuracy from 39.0% to 84.8% over the 25-year period. The NAFD-NEX disturbance maps are available from a web portal of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL-DAAC).

TI  - Analyses of Land Surface Emissivity Characteristics in Mid-Infrared Bands
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays an important role in the process of ground-air interaction and is an parameter in global change research. At the same time, the emissivity of land surface is the key input parameter of LST inversion. Mid-infrared spectrum (3 similar to 5 p.m) is between visible-near infrared (0. 38 similar to 2. 5 p.m) and thermal infrared spectrum (8 similar to 14 tan). The emissivities of terrestrial materials exhibit unique characteristics in mid-infrared spectrum, which can be used for frost monitoring and mineral composition analysis et al. Energy detected with sensor in the mid-infrared region, however, is a combination of emitted radiation from terrestrial materials and reflected radiation due to sun irradiance. The energy separation mechanism of these two parts is complicated. Therefore, there are few relevant literatures about researches on emissivities of terrestrial materials in mid infrared spectrum. In this paper, the effective emissivities of MODIS infrared channels were calculated for a single uniform surface and a complex region with mixed pixel. It is found that the effect of surface temperature is insignificant for effective emissivity calculation in a single uniform surface. Under complex surface, the effective emissivity has a coupling effect with composition ratio of materials in the mixed pixel and surface temperatures of these materials. Within the allowable range of error, the effective emissivity of mixed pixel can ignore the effect of materials' surface temperature. The sensitivity of emissivity error to the precision of LST inversion varies with wavelength. An accuracy of 1 K in LST retrieval requires emissivity error be constrained to within 0. 04 in mid-infrared region, while within 0. 02 in thermal infrared region. It can be seen that mid-infrared spectrum has much potentials in LST retrieval.

T2  - OCEANOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of two approaches to radiometric correction of Landsat data and their further classification has made it possible to compile maps of the distribution pattern of sea grass at the East Site of the Far East National Marine Reserve (FEMR). The mapping accuracy, evaluated with the use of field data, has shown that the bottom reflectance index makes it possible to increase the accuracy of maps compared to the depth-invariant index. The areas of aquatic plants have been calculated from 2001, 2013, and 2014 data. It has been shown that the approaches for processing remote data are useful for monitoring nearshore vegetation.

AB  - Objectives: The article analyzes the Aksenov's interpretation of Ben Jonson's plays << Sejanus. His Fall >> and Volpone. Methods: When studying the subject, we used some cultural-historical, comparative historical and historical-typological approaches, as well as elements of the sodo-psychological method, for recreating certain biographical realities, often necessary to make an objective perception of the literary text. Findings: The activities of I.A.Aksenov as an editor, researcher and translator in the late 1910s - early 1930s contributed to Ben Jonson discovery in Russia (he prepared and published a two-volume edition of Ben Jonson's works, translated the plays << Sejanus. His Fall >> and Volpone, wrote literary critical essays). In his articles Ben Jonson: Life and Creativity and << Ben Jonson in the struggle for theaten >>, I.A.Aksenov recognized the English playwright as the most outstanding representative of the literature of the Elizabethan era, who influenced the shaping of the worldview aspects of contemporary dramaturgy. Novelty: I.A.Aksenov's organizing, editing, literary, and translating activities contributed to the promotion of Shakespeare's younger contemporary legacy among the Russian readers. I.A.Aksenov was one of the first, who started to interpret Ben Jonson's works in Russia in the first post-revolutionary years. Recognizing the low quality of the translations of << Sejanus >> and << Volpone >> and the failure of the conclusions, made by I.A.Aksenov as a literary critic, one cannot but admit that his activities became the basis for the further literal activities of Russian translators and researchers of Ben Jonson's biographies and plays.

TI  - An analytical framework for remote sensing satellite networks based on the model predictive control with convex optimization
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we consider the problem of maximizing the throughput of remote sensing satellite networks. In such networks, the link capacities and routing matrices are varying over time. We propose a convex optimization-based analytical framework for the problem. To maximize the network throughput under the premise of satisfying the delay constraint, we formulate the data transmission schedule into an optimization problem aiming at maximizing the delay-constrained throughput. Considering the fact that the future link capacities cannot be accurately known in the actual situation, we propose a heuristic and distributed framework on the basis of model predictive control for approximately solving the problem. This framework can be used to design remote sensing data transmission schedules under various scenarios. We adopt a generic example to simulate and analyze the framework. The simulation results show that the proposed analytic framework can obtain the approximate solution that is very close to the optimal solution by solving the convex optimization problem step-by-step. The heuristic algorithm based on model predictive control can obtain the approximate solution, which is very close to the optimal solution in distributed scenario.

AB  - Karst area in southwestern China is characterized with complex topography, low soil water capacity, and fragile ecosystem. Accurate estimation of regional evapotranspiration is essential for ecological restoration and water resources management in southwestern China. Based on observed evapotranspiration and meteorological data, this study aimed to estimate spatial upscale evapotranspiration using the MOD15A2 LAI and Penman. Monteith. Leuning (PML) model, within which the stomatal conductance and soil wetness index were optimized by the least. square method. The results showed that the modeled ET well fitted with the observations, with the determination coefficient, Nash efficiency coefficient and RMSE being 0.85, 0.75 and 1.56 mm . d(-1), respectively. The ET exhibited clear seasonality and reached to its maximum in summer, coinciding with vegetation phenology. The annual ET ranged from 534 to 1035 mm . a(-1), with strong spatial heterogeneity which highly related to the precipitation. Evapotranspiration may be affected by precipitation as well as land use types.

TI  - Identifying Flood Events over the Poyang Lake Basin Using Multiple Satellite Remote Sensing Observations, Hydrological Models and In Situ Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is famous for its ecological and economic importance as well as frequent flood characteristics. In this study, multiple satellite remote sensing observations (e.g., GRACE, MODIS, Altimetry, and TRMM), hydrological models, and in situ data are used to characterize the flood phenomena over the Poyang Lake basin between 2003 and 2016. To improve the accuracy of the terrestrial water storage (TWS) estimates over the Poyang Lake basin, a modified forward-modeling method is introduced in the GRACE processing. The method is evaluated using the contaminated noise onboard observations for the first time. The results in both spectral and spatial domains infer a good performance of the method on the suppression of high-frequency noise while reducing the signal loss. After applying forward-modeling method, the TWS derived from the GRACE spherical harmonic coefficients presents a comparable performance with the solution derived from the newly released CSR Release05 mascon product over the Poyang Lake basin. The flood events in 2010 and 2016 are identified from the positive anomalies in non-seasonal TWSs derived by GRACE and hydrological models. The flood signatures also coincide with the largest inundated areas estimated from MODIS data, and the observed areas in 2010 and 2016 are 3370.3 km(2) (30% higher than the long-term mean) and 3445.0 km(2) (33% higher), respectively. The water levels in the Hukou station exceed the warning water level for 25 days in 2010 and 28 days in 2016. These continuous warning-exceeded water levels also imply the severe flood events, which are primarily driven by the local plenteous precipitation in the rainy season (1528 mm in 2010, 1522 mm in 2016).

TI  - The Impact of Ecological Restoration Projects in Dry Lands: Data-based Assessment and Human Perceptions in the Lower Reaches of Heihe River Basin, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Desertification is a critical environmental problem in China's northwestern region. In this context, since the early 2000s, projects targeting ecological restoration have been implemented in the lower reaches of the Heihe River basin. Using multi-scale remote sensing data and field observations, this paper examines the outcomes of the ecological restoration projects. Specifically, this paper examines the vegetation change through remote sensing and local perceptions of the projects through semi-structured questionnaires. The results from remote sensing reveal that during the restoration projects, vegetation coverage in riparian areas of the lower reaches of the Heihe River basin increased. However, this increase cannot be simply equated with ecological recovery. Expansion of farmland and afforested areas have also contributed to the increase in vegetation coverage. Questionnaire results reveal that although locals perceived improvements in the ecological conditions of the lower reaches, most of them were more about future environmental changes. Additionally, results indicate that ecological restoration projects redistributed water resources in the local river reaches and, as a result, local residents living in riparian areas perceive greater benefit. Therefore, the implementation of the project may have actually negatively impacted the water accessibility of those living in the drier Gobi Desert areas.

TI  - Bacterial pathogen spectrum of acute diarrheal outpatients in an urbanized rural district in Southwest China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To conduct a one-year pathogen surveillance of acute diarrheal disease based on outpatient clinics in township hospitals in rural Hongta District of Yunnan Province, China.Methods: Fecal specimens of acute diarrhea cases and relevant epidemiological information were collected. Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio, Aeromonas, Plesiomonas shigelloides and diarrheogenic Escherichia coli (DEC) were examined.Results: Among the 797 stool specimens sampled, 198 samples (24.8%) were positive in pathogen isolation, and 223 strains were isolated. The order of isolation rates from high to low were DEC, Aeromonas, P. shigelloides, Salmonella, Shigella and Vibrio. The overall positive rate in middle school students and preschool children was relatively high; while the overall positive rate of less than 1-year-old infants and above 55 years olds was relatively low. The isolates were analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Some cases had the same or very close onset time, and the isolates had similar PFGE patterns, suggesting a possible outbreak once occurred but was not detected by the current infectious disease reporting system.Conclusions: Pathogen infection and transmission in rapidly urbanized rural areas is a serious issue. There is a great need for a more sensitive and accurate mode of monitoring, reporting and outbreak identification of diarrheal disease. (C) 2018 The Author(s).

TI  - A High-Speed Imaging Method Based on Compressive Sensing for Sound Extraction Using a Low-Speed Camera
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports an efficient method for sound extraction from high-speed light spot videos reconstructed from the coded light spot images captured with a low-speed camera based on compressive sensing, but at the expense of consuming time. The proposed method first gets the high-speed video of the light spot that is illuminated on the vibrating target caused by sound. Then the centroid of the light spot is used to recover the sound. Simulations of the proposed method are carried out and experimental results are demonstrated. The results show that high-speed videos with a frame rate of 2000 Hz can be reconstructed with a low-speed (100 Hz) charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which is randomly modulated by a digital micro-mirror device (DMD) 20 times during each exposure time. This means a speed improvement of 20 times is achieved. The effects of synchronization between CCD image recording and DMD modulation, the optimal sampling patterns of DMD, and sound vibration amplitudes on the performance of the proposed method are evaluated. Using this compressive camera, speech (counting from one to four in Chinese) was recovered well. This has been confirmed by directly listening to the recovered sound, and the intelligibility value (0-1) that evaluated the similarity between them was 0.8185. Although we use this compressive camera for sound detection, we expect it to be useful in applications related to vibration and motion.

TI  - Sidelobe Suppression with Resolution Maintenance for SAR Images via Sparse Representation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe sidelobe interference is one of the major problems with traditional Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging. In the observation scene of sea areas, the number of targets in the observation scene is so small that targets can be regarded as sparse. Taking this into account, a method of sidelobe suppression, on the basis of sparsity constraint regularization, is proposed to reduce sidelobes of Gaofen-3 (GF-3) images in sea areas of the image domain. This proposed method has a prominent sidelobe suppression effect with resolution maintenance and without destruction of amplitude and phase information. This method can also be applied to SAR images of other satellites. In addition to the employment of peak sidelobe ratio (PSLR) and integrated sidelobe ratio (ISLR) in evaluating sidelobe suppression level, AE (amplitude error) and PE (phase error) are firstly defined for the evaluation of amplitude and phase-preserving quality, respectively. Through the proposed method, AE and PE values are nearly unchanged and the PSLR and ISLR are significantly reduced. The method, as an important part of the quality-improvement project of GF-3, has been successfully applied to the sidelobe suppression of GF-3 data.

TI  - Estimation of actual evapotranspiration in the Nagqu river basin of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a critical component of the energy and water cycle, terrestrial actual evapotranspiration (ET) can be influenced by many factors. This study was mainly devoted to providing accurate and continuous estimations of actual ET for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and analyzing the effects of its impact factors. In this study, summer observational data from the Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) Asia-Australia Monsoon Project (CAMP) on the Tibetan Plateau (CAMP/Tibet) for 2003 to 2004 was selected to determine actual ET and investigate its relationship with energy, hydrological, and dynamical parameters. Multiple-layer air temperature, relative humidity, net radiation flux, wind speed, precipitation, and soil moisture were used to estimate actual ET. The regression model simulation results were validated with independent data retrieved using the combinatory method. The results suggested that significant correlations exist between actual ET and hydro-meteorological parameters in the surface layer of the Nagqu river basin, among which the most important factors are energy-related elements (net radiation flux and air temperature). The results also suggested that how ET is eventually affected by precipitation and two-layer wind speed difference depends on whether their positive or negative feedback processes have a more important role. The multivariate linear regression method provided reliable estimations of actual ET; thus, 6-parameter simplified schemes and 14-parameter regular schemes were established.

TI  - Evaluation of variable rate irrigation using a remote-sensing-based model
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Improvements in soil water balance modeling can be beneficial for optimizing irrigation management to account for spatial variability in soil properties and evapotranspiration (ET). A remote-sensing-based ET and water balance model was tested for irrigation management in an experiment at two University of Nebraska-Lincoln research sites located near Mead and Brule, Nebraska. Both fields included a center pivot equipped with variable rate irrigation (VRI). The study included maize in 2015 and 2016 and soybean in 2016 at Mead, and maize in 2016 at Brule, for a total of 210 plot-years. Four irrigation treatments were applied at Mead, including: VRI based on a remote sensing model (VRI-RS); VRI based on neutron probe soil water content measurement (VRI-NP); uniform irrigation based on neutron probe measurement; and rainfed. Only the VRI-RS and uniform treatments were applied at Brule. Landsat 7 and 8 imagery were used for model input. In 2015, the remote sensing model included reflectance-based crop coefficients for ET estimation in the water balance. In 2016, a hybrid component of the model was activated, which included energy-balance-modeled ET as an input. Both 2015 and 2016 had above-average precipitation at Mead; subsequently, irrigation amounts were relatively low. Seasonal irrigation was greatest for the VRI-RS treatment in all cases because of drift in the water balance model. This was likely caused by excessive soil evaporation estimates. Irrigation application for the VRI-NP at Mead was about 0 mm, 6 mm, and 12 mm less in separate analyses than for the uniform treatment. Irrigation for the VRIRS was about 40 mm, 50 mm, and 98 mm greater in separate analyses than the uniform at Mead and about 18 mm greater at Brute. For maize at Mead, treatment effects were primarily limited to hydrologic responses (e.g., ET), with differences in yield generally attributed to random error. Rainfed soybean yields were greater than VRI-RS yields, which may have been related to yield loss from lodging, perhaps due to over-irrigation. Regarding the magnitude of spatial variability in the fields, soil available water capacity generally ranked above ET, precipitation, and yield. Future research should include increased cloud-free imagery frequency, incorporation of soil water content measurements into the model, and improved wet soil evaporation and drainage estimates.

TI  - Variations of transparency derived from GOCI in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)), represents water transparency which is an intuitive indicator of water quality and can be used to derive inherent optical properties, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and primary productivity. In this study, the Z(sd) was derived from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data over the Bohai Sea (BHS) and the Yellow Sea (YS) using a regional tuned model. To validate the GOCI derived Zsd observations, in situ data, were collected for the BHS and YS regions. Results showed a good agreement between the GOCI derived Z(sd) observations and in situ measurements with a determination coefficient of 0.90, root mean square error of 2.17 m and mean absolute percent error of 24.56%. Results for diurnal variations showed an increasing trend of Z(sd) at the first and then decreasing, and all the maxima of Z(sd) in the central areas of the BHS and YS were found in the midday. For seasonal variations, higher values of Z(sd), both in range and intensity, were observed in summer compared with those in winter. The reasons to explain the variations of Z(sd) have also been explored. Solar zenith angle (SOLZ) has an impact on the daily dynamics of Z(sd), due to the influence of SOLZ on the attenuation of light radiation in water. The influence level of SOLZ on Z(sd) is largely determined by the water bodies' composition. The significant seasonal variations are mainly controlled by the stability of the water column stratification, because it can lead to the sediment resuspension and influence the growth and distribution of phytoplankton. Runoff and sediment discharge are not the main factors that impact the seasonal dynamics of Z(sd). Tidal currents and mean currents may have influences on the variations of Z(sd). However, due to the lack of in situ measurements to support, further studies are still needed. (C) 2018 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement

TI  - Change Detection in Bitemporal Remote Sensing Images by using Feature Fusion and Fuzzy C-Means
T2  - KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection of remote sensing images is a profound challenge in the field of remote sensing image analysis. This paper proposes a novel change detection method for bitemporal remote sensing images based on feature fusion and fuzzy c-means (FCM). Different from the state-of-the-art methods that mainly utilize a single image feature for difference image construction, the proposed method investigates the fusion of multiple image features for the task. The subsequent problem is regarded as the difference image classification problem, where a modified fuzzy c-means approach is proposed to analyze the difference image. The proposed method has been validated on real bitemporal remote sensing data sets. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Toward Global Mapping of Methane With TROPOMI: First Results and Intersatellite Comparison to GOSAT
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), launched on 13 October 2017, aboard the Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, measures reflected sunlight in the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared spectral range. It enables daily global mapping of key atmospheric species for monitoring air quality and climate. We present the first methane observations from November and December 2017, using TROPOMI radiance measurements in the shortwave infrared band around 2.3 mu m. We compare our results with the methane product obtained from the Greenhouse gases Observing SAT-ellite (GOSAT). Although different spectral ranges and retrieval methods are used, we find excellent agreement between the methane products acquired from the two satellites with a mean difference of 13.6 ppb, standard deviation of 19.6 ppb, and Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.95. Our preliminary results capture the latitudinal gradient and show expected regional enhancements, for example, in the African Sudd wetlands, with much more detail than has been observed before.Plain Language Summary Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Improved knowledge about methane variations and detection of localized sources is of great importance for scientists, policy makers, and private companies. One of the goals of the recently launched European Space Agency Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite, with on board the cutting-edge TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), is to measure methane with an unprecedented combination of accuracy, spatial coverage, and resolution. This work presents the first TROPOMI methane measurements and shows that these are in excellent agreement with methane measurements from the validated Japanese Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite satellite.

TI  - Assessing Satellite-Derived Radiative Forcing From Snow Impurities Through Inverse Hydrologic Modeling
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light-absorbing impurities in snow and ice (LAISI) lower the snow albedo and cause accelerated snowmelt. The radiative forcing caused by LAISI is in this connection the key variable in understanding LAISI-snowpack dynamics. Here we present an approach combining distributed hydrologic model simulations and remotely sensed radiative forcing from LAISI in order to improve model predictions of radiative forcing impacts. In a case study, we assess the seasonal cycle of instantaneous at-surface clear-sky radiative forcing from LAISI as predicted by model and satellite observations for a river basin located at the southern slope of the Himalayas. By scaling dust depositions, we optimize simulated radiative forcing conditioned on satellite observations. The optimized model predicts that LAISI-induced radiative forcing in snow contributes to 4.1% to 5.8% of the annual discharge. The presented approach has a wide range of applications as it provides a novel method to constrain and evaluate measures of LAISI-induced radiative forcing.Plain Language Summary Certain particles that have the ability to absorb sunlight deposit onto mountain snow via atmospheric transport mechanisms. The presence of such particles in snow leads to a reduction of the snow's ability to reflect sunlight, which increases snowmelt. The key variable to understand these processes is hereby the additional energy that is taken up by the snow due to the presence of these particles. In this study, we present a method that allows the comparison of this additional energy measured by satellites with those predicted by numerical models. In a case study, we use the satellite data to improve the model representation of this variable by adapting the amount of particles in the snow of an area located at the southern slope of the Himalayas. Using the improved model, we estimate the increase in streamflow resulting from increased snowmelt in the area. We find that in the study region, light-absorbing particles in snow are responsible for 4.1% to 5.8% of the annual streamflow.

TI  - Surface Creep Rate and Moment Accumulation Rate Along the Aceh Segment of the Sumatran Fault From L-band ALOS-1/PALSAR-1 Observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the interferometric synthetic aperture radar data from the ALOS-1/PALSAR-1 satellite to image the interseismic deformation along the Sumatran fault. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar time series analysis reveals up to similar to 20 mm/year of aseismic creep on the Aceh segment along the Northern Sumatran fault. This is a large fraction of the total slip rate across this fault. The spatial extent of the aseismic creep extends for similar to 100 km. The along-strike variation of the aseismic creep has an inverse "U" shape. An analysis of the moment accumulation rate shows that the central part of the creeping section accumulates moment at approximately 50% of the rate of the surrounding locked segments. An initial analysis of temporal variations suggests that the creep rate may be decelerating with time, suggesting that the creep rate is adjusting to a stress perturbation from nearby seismic activity. Our study has implications to the earthquake hazard along the northern Sumatran fault.

TI  - Scaling of Drizzle Virga Depth With Cloud Thickness for Marine Stratocumulus Clouds
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drizzle is frequently observed in marine stratocumulus clouds and plays a crucial role in cloud lifetime and the radiation budget. Most drizzling stratocumulus clouds form drizzle virga below cloud base, where subcloud scavenging and evaporative cooling are important. We use unique ground-based cloud radar observations (1) to examine the statistical properties of drizzle frequency and virga depth and (2) to test a simple analytical relationship derived between drizzle virga thickness (Hv) and cloud thickness (Hc). Observations show that 83% of marine stratocumulus clouds are drizzling although only 31% generate surface precipitation. The analytical expression for Hv is derived as a function of Hc and subcloud relative humidity considering in-cloud accretion and subcloud evaporation of drizzle drops. The derived third-order power law relationship, H-v similar to H-3(c), shows good agreement with long-term observational data. Our formula provides a simple parameterization for drizzle virga of stratocumulus clouds suitable for use in models.Plain Language Summary Drizzle plays a crucial role in cloud lifetime and radiation properties of marine stratocumulus clouds. Understanding where drizzle exists in the subcloud layer, which depends on drizzle virga depth, can help us better understand where below-cloud scavenging and evaporative cooling and moisturizing occur. Here we examine the statistical properties of drizzle frequency and virga depth of marine stratocumulus based on unique ground-based remote sensing data. Results show that marine stratocumulus clouds are drizzling nearly all the time. In addition, we derive a simple scaling analysis between drizzle virga thickness and cloud thickness. Our analytical expression agrees with the observational data reasonably well, which suggests that our formula provides a simple parameterization for drizzle virga of stratocumulus clouds suitable for use in other models.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Convergence of Maximum Daily Light-Use Efficiency Based on Radiation Absorption by Canopy Chlorophyll
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Light-use efficiency (LUE), which quantifies the plants' efficiency in utilizing solar radiation for photosynthetic carbon fixation, is an important factor for gross primary production estimation. Here we use satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence as a proxy for photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll (APAR(chl)) and derive an estimation of the fraction of APAR(chl) (fPAR(chl)) from four remotely sensed vegetation indicators. By comparing maximum LUE estimated at different scales from 127 eddy flux sites, we found that the maximum daily LUE based on PAR absorption by canopy chlorophyll (epsilon(chl)(max) ), unlike other expressions of LUE, tends to converge across biome types. The photosynthetic seasonality in tropical forests can also be tracked by the change of fPAR(chl), suggesting the corresponding epsilon(chl)(max) to have less seasonal variation. This spatio-temporal convergence of LUE derived from fPAR(chl) can be used to build simple but robust gross primary production models and to better constrain process-based models.Plain Language Summary Plants absorb light to fix carbon dioxide; the efficiency of this process is termed as light-use efficiency and can be calculated based on different light absorption definitions. Among the light being absorbed by plants, only a fraction is captured by chlorophyll and can be further used for photosynthesis. In this study, we used satellite data and derived an estimation of the fraction of light that is absorbed by chlorophyll. We found that different plants have a similar efficiency using chlorophyll-absorbed light to fix carbon dioxide; this efficiency is also found to be stable throughout the season in tropical forest. The results of this study can be used to improve models' capability to estimate the total carbon fixed by plants at global scale.

TI  - Foehn Event Triggered by an Atmospheric River Underlies Record-Setting Temperature Along Continental Antarctica
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - A record-setting temperature of 17.5 degrees C occurred on 24 March 2015 at the Esperanza station located near the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (AP). We studied the event using surface station data, satellite imagery, reanalysis data, and numerical simulations. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Antarctic Ice Shelf Image Archive provides clear evidence for disintegration and advection of sea ice, as well as the formation of melt ponds on the ice sheet surface at the base of the AP mountain range. A deep low-pressure center over the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea and a blocking ridge over the southeast Pacific provided favorable conditions for the development of an atmospheric river with a northwest-southeast orientation, directing warm and moist air toward the AP, and triggering a widespread foehn episode. A control simulation using a regional climate model shows the existence of local topographically induced warming along the northern tip of the AP (approximate to 60% of the full temperature signal) and the central part of the eastern AP (>90% of the full temperature signal) with respect to a simulation without topography. These modeling results suggest that more than half of the warming experienced at Esperanza can be attributed to the foehn effect (a local process), rather than to the large-scale advection of warm air from the midlatitudes. Nevertheless, the local foehn effect also has a large-scale advection component, since the atmospheric river provides water vapor for orographic precipitation enhancement and latent heat release, which makes it difficult to completely disentangle the role of local versus large-scale processes in explaining the extreme event.

T2  - Oncotarget
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - An intraductal carcinoma, 55 mm across, was diagnosed on a total mastectomy in a 45-year-old woman. The 2 micro-invasive areas found were too small for reliable immunostainings for estrogen, progesterone, and HER2 receptors. In the sentinel lymph-node, a subcapsular tumor embole of about 50 cancer cells was identified on the extemporaneous cryo-cut section, but not on further sections after paraffin-embedding of the sample. Considering this tumor metastatic potential, we decided to assess HER2 status on the metastatic embole using pathological and molecular micro-methods. We laser-microdissected the tumor cells, extracted their DNA, and performed droplet-digital-PCR (ddPCR) for HER2 gene copy number variation. The HER2/RNaseP allele ratio was 5.2 in the laser-microdissected tumor cells, similar to the 5.3 ratio in the HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cell line BT-474. We thus optimized the adjuvant treatment of our patient and she received a trastuzumab-based adjuvant chemotherapy.

TI  - CALIPSO IIR Version 2 Level 1b calibrated radiances: analysis and reduction of residual biases in the Northern Hemisphere
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Version 2 of the Level 1b calibrated radiances of the Imaging Infrared Radiometer (IIR) on board the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite has been released recently. This new version incorporates corrections of small but systematic seasonal calibration biases previously revealed in Version 1 data products mostly north of 30 degrees N. These biases - of different amplitudes in the three IIR channels 8.65 mu m (IIR1), 10.6 mu m (IIR2), and 12.05 mu m (IIR3) - were made apparent by a striping effect in images of IIR inter-channel brightness temperature differences (BTDs) and through seasonal warm biases of night-time IIR brightness temperatures in the 30-60 degrees N latitude range. The latter were highlighted through observed and simulated comparisons with similar channels of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Aqua spacecraft. To characterize the calibration biases affecting Version 1 data, a semi-empirical approach is developed, which is based on the in-depth analysis of the IIR internal calibration procedure in conjunction with observations such as statistical comparisons with similar MODIS/Aqua channels. Two types of calibration biases are revealed: an equalization bias affecting part of the individual IIR images and a global bias affecting the radiometric level of each image. These biases are observed only when the temperature of the instrument increases, and they are found to be functions of elapsed time since night-to-day transition, regard-less of the season. Correction coefficients of Version 1 radiances could thus be defined and implemented in the Version 2 code. As a result, the striping effect seen in Version 1 is significantly attenuated in Version 2. Systematic discrepancies between nighttime and daytime IIR-MODIS BTDs in the 30-60 degrees N latitude range in summer are reduced from 0.2 K in Version 1 to 0.1 K in Version 2 for IIR1-MODIS29. For IIR2-MODIS31 and IIR3-MODIS32, they are reduced from 0.4 K to close to zero, except for IIR3-MODIS32 in June, where the night-minus-day difference is around -0.1 K.

TI  - Clarifying regional hydrologic controls of the Maranon River, Peru through rapid assessment to inform system-wide basin planning approaches
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - We use remote sensing to enhance the interpretation of the first baseline dataset of hydrologic, isotopic and hydrochemical variables spanning 620 km of the upper Maranon River, in Andean Peru, from the steep alpine canyons to the lower lying jungle. Remote, data-scarce river systems are under increased hydro-power development pressure to meet rising energy demands. The upstream-downstream river continuum, which serves as a conduit for resource exchange across ecosystems, is at risk, potentially endangering the people, environments, and economies that rely on river resources. The Maranon River, one of the final free-flowing headwater connections between the Andes and the Amazon, is the subject of myriad large-scale hydropower proposals. Due to challenging access, environmental data are scarce in the upper Maranon, limiting our ability to do system-wide river basin planning. We capture key processes and transitions in the context of hydropower development. Two hydrologic regimes control the Maranon dry-season flow: in the higher-elevation upper reaches, a substantial baseflow is fed by groundwater recharged from wet season rains, in contrast to the lower reaches where the mainstem discharge is controlled by rain-fed tributaries that receive rain from lowland Amazon moisture systems. Sustainability of the upper corridor's dry-season baseflow appears to be more highly connected to the massive natural storage capacity of extensive wetlands in the puna (alpine grasslands) than with cryospheric water inputs. The extent and conservation of puna ecosystems and glacier reservoirs may be interdependent, bringing to bear important conservation questions in the context of changing climate and land use in the region. More generally, this case study demonstrates an efficient combined remote sensing and field observation approach to address data scarcity across regional scales in mountain basins facing imminent rapid change.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of surface oil volume during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico: scaling up AVIRIS observations with MODIS measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil blowout in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) led to the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history. The accident resulted in oil slicks that covered between 10,000 and upward of 40,000 km 2 of the Gulf between April and July 2010. Quantifying the actual spatial extent of oil over such synoptic scales on an operational basis and, in particular, estimating the oil volume (or slick thickness) of large oil slicks on the ocean surface has proven to be a challenge to researchers and responders alike. This challenge must be addressed to assess and understand impacts on marine and coastal resources and to prepare a response to future spills. We estimated surface oil volume and probability of occurrence of different oil thicknesses during the DWH blowout in the GoM by combining synoptic measurements (2330-km swath) from the satellite-borne NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and near-concurrent, much narrower swath (similar to 5 km) hyperspectral observations from the NASA Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS). A histogram-matching approach was used to transfer AVIRIS-derived oil volume to MODIS pixel-scale dimensions, after masking clouds under both sun glint and nonglint conditions. Probability functions were used to apply the transformation to 19 MODIS images collected during the DWH event. This generated three types of MODIS oil maps: maps of surface oil volume, maps of relative oil thickness with four different classes (i.e., 0 pm, <0.08 mu m, 0.08 to 8 mu m, and >8 mu m), and maps of probability distributions of different thicknesses. The results were compared with satellite-based synthetic aperture radar measurements and evaluated with concurrent aerial photographs. Although the methods may not be ideal and the results may contain large uncertainties, the current attempt suggests that coarse-resolution optical remote sensing observations can provide estimates of relative oil thickness/volume for large oil slicks captured by satellites.

TI  - Regional Regime-Based Evaluation of Present-Day General Circulation Model Cloud Simulations Using Self-Organizing Maps
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Global clusters are derived by applying the self-organizing map technique to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud top pressure-cloud optical thickness joint histograms. These cloud clusters are then used to classify Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project Observation Simulator Package output from the HadGEM3 (Global Atmosphere version 7) atmosphere-only climate model. Discrepancies in the Global Atmosphere version 7 representation of particular clusters can be established by examining the two sets of cluster's occurrence rate and radiative effect. The overall differences in the occurrence rates show major discrepancies in several of the clusters, resulting in a shift from five dominant clusters in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (above 10% occurrence rate) to two dominant clusters in the model. A comparison of the geographic distributions of occurrence rate shows that the differences are strongly regional and unique to each cluster. While comparisons of the global mean longwave and shortwave cloud radiative effect (CRE) show strong agreement, examination of the CRE of individual cloud types reveals larger errors that highlight the role of compensating errors in masking model deficiencies. CRE data for each of the clusters is further partitioned into regions. This establishes that the bias associated with a cluster is highly variable globally, with no clusters showing consistent biases across all regions. Therefore, regional level phenomena likely play an important role in the creation of these errors.

TI  - Quantifying the Impacts of Subpixel Reflectance Variability on Cloud Optical Thickness and Effective Radius Retrievals Based On High-Resolution ASTER Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, Zhang et al. (2016, ) presented a mathematical framework based on a second-order Taylor series expansion in order to quantify the plane-parallel homogeneous bias (PPHB) in cloud optical thickness () and effective droplet radius (r(eff)) retrieved from the bispectral solar reflective method. This study provides observational validation of the aforementioned framework, using high-resolution reflectance observations from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) over 48 marine boundary layer cloud scenes. ASTER reflectances at a horizontal resolution of 30m are aggregated up to a scale of 1,920m, providing retrievals of and r(eff) at different spatial resolutions. A comparison between the PPHB derived from these retrievals and the predicted PPHB from the mathematical framework reveals a good agreement with correlation coefficients of r > 0.97 (for ) and r > 0.79 (for r(eff)). To test the feasibility of PPHB predictions for present and future satellite missions, a scale analysis with varying horizontal resolutions of the subpixel and pixel-level observations is performed, followed by tests of corrections with only limited observational high-resolution data. It is shown that for reasonably thick clouds with a mean subpixel larger than 5, correlations between observed and predicted PPHB remain high, even if the number of available subpixels decreases or just a single band provides the information about subpixel reflectance variability. Only for thin clouds the predicted r(eff) become less reliable, which can be attributed primarily to an increased retrieval uncertainty for r(eff).

TI  - How Accurately Can the Air Temperature Lapse Rate Over the Tibetan Plateau Be Estimated From MODIS LSTs?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The air temperature lapse rate (TLR) is a key parameter for interpolating air temperature data in high mountainous regions such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) has been frequently used for estimating air temperature during the past decade, but its performance in estimating the TLR in the TP has seldom been investigated. This study employed two methods in estimating the TLR based on MODIS LSTs compared with the observed TLR derived from 86 stations across the TP. The two methods include a method for directly computing the lapse rate from MODIS LST (DFM) and a second method for calculating the lapse rate of estimated air temperatures based on air temperature estimation from MODIS LST (TEM). The results show that the MODIS LST-estimated TLR for daily mean air temperature (Tmean) using both DFM and TEM is more accurate than that for daily minimum and maximum air temperatures. When using MODIS nighttime LSTs, both DFM and TEM show acceptable accuracies for estimating the TLR of Tmean with averaged root-mean-square deviations of 0.21 and 0.19 degrees C/100m, respectively. The spatial and seasonal patterns of MODIS LST-estimated TLRs of Tmean from both DFM and TEM are found to be highly consistent with the observed TLRs. This study can help alleviate the data-sparse problem in downscaling air temperature or hydrological modeling studies in ungauged areas, especially for the western TP where station data are extremely scarce.

TI  - Quantitative Verification and Calibration of Volcanic Ash Ensemble Forecasts Using Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we address the problem of verifying and calibrating ensemble-based probabilistic volcanic ash forecasts. The ensemble members are constructed from dispersion model simulations with different meteorological fields obtained from an ensemble meteorological forecast model and different values of ash source parameters such as ash column height and vertical mass distribution. The Brier score is employed to verify the probabilistic forecasts relative to binary-valued ash detection fields and fully quantitative satellite-retrieved ash mass load fields. A new ensemble forecast calibration methodology, which treats the meteorological and source term variations on equal footing, is also developed. This enables the creation of an ensemble subset yielding higher Brier skill scores than the uncalibrated ensemble during a calibration time window of about 6hr after the start of an eruption. It is shown that this can be used to improve probabilistic forecasts up to 24hr after the start of the eruption using the Indonesian 13 February 2014 Kelut and 6 November 2015 Rinjani eruptions as case studies.

TI  - Comparison of Two Satellite-Based Evapotranspiration Models of the Nagqu River Basin of the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the major uncertain components of the energy and water cycle and was derived for the Nagqu River Basin based on remote sensing data and atmospheric surface layer observations under cloudless conditions. Two process-based models were used to determine the ET: a Priestley-Taylor (PT)-based model and a topographical enhanced surface energy balance system (TESEBS) model. Improved broadband albedo, downward shortwave radiation flux, and reconstructed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were coupled into the TESEBS model and PT-based model to estimate the actual ET. The atmospheric surface layer meteorological data, SPOT Vegetation (VGT) data, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data were used as inputs for 10-day ET calculations. The model-estimated results were compared with ground truths calculated via the combinatory method. The results indicated that the ET determined by both models well fit the actual ET, with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.88 and 0.82, respectively. However, the TESEBS model showed a better performance than the PT model, with a lower mean bias error (-0.02mm/hr) and lower root-mean-square error (0.08mm/hr). Although the PT model is computationally simple and requires few parameters, the strong weighting of the NDVI may lead to some overestimations, especially during the growing season.

TI  - The thermal signature of Aso Volcano during unrest episodes detected from space and ground-based measurements
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The thermal signature of Aso Volcano (Nakadake) during unrest episodes has been analyzed by combining the MODIS-MIROVA data set (2000-2017) with high-resolution images (LANDSAT 8 OLI and Sentinel 2) and ground-based thermal observations (2013-2017). The site of major activity (crater 1) is located at the summit of the volcano and is composed by a fumarole field (located in the South Area) and an acidic lake (replaced by a Central Pit during Strom-bolian phases). The volcanic radiative power (VRP) obtained by nighttime satellite data during the reference period was mainly below 3 MW. This thermal threshold marks the transition from high fumarole activity (HFA) to Strom-bolian eruptions (SE). However, periods characterized by sporadic phreatic eruptions (PE, eventually bearing phreatomagmatic episodes), which is the prevalent phase during unrest episodes, exhibit very low VRP values, being around 0.5 MW, or below. The statistical analysis of satellite data shows that the transition from HFA to Strombolian activity (which started on August 2014 and ceased in May 2015) occurs when VRP values are above the cited 3 MW threshold. In particular during marked Strombolian phases (November-December 2014), the radiative power was higher than 4 MW, reaching peak values up to 15.6 MW (on December 7, 2014, i.e., 10 days after the major Strombolian explosion of November 27). Conversely, ground-based measurements show that heat fluxes recorded by FLIR T440 Therm-ocamera on the fumarole field of the South Area has been relatively stable around 2 MW until February 2015. Their apparent temperatures were fluctuating around 490-575 degrees C before the major Strombolian explosive event, whereas those recorded at the active vent, named Central Pit, reached their maxima slightly above 600 degrees C; then both exhibited a decreasing trend in the following days. During the Strombolian activity, the crater lake dried out and was then replenished by early July, 2016. Then, volcanic activity shifted back to phreatic-phreatomagmatic and the eruptive cycle was completed. During this period, the MIROVA system detected very few thermal alerts and the ground-based measurements were fluctuating around 1 MW. The most violent explosion occurred on October 8, 2016, and within the following weeks measured VRP were moderately above 2 MW. This is coeval with a thermal increase at the fumarole field of the South Area, with temperatures well above 300 degrees C. Thermal monitoring at Aso Volcano is an additional tool in volcano surveillance that may contribute to near-real-time hazard assessment.

TI  - Algorithm theoretical baseline for formaldehyde retrievals from S5P TROPOMI and from the QA4ECV project
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - On board the Copernicus Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) platform, the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) is a double-channel, nadir-viewing grating spectrometer measuring solar back-scattered earthshine radiances in the ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and shor-twave infrared with global daily coverage. In the ultraviolet range, its spectral resolution and radiometric performance are equivalent to those of its predecessor OMI, but its horizontal resolution at true nadir is improved by an order of magnitude. This paper introduces the formaldehyde (HCHO) tropospheric vertical column retrieval algorithm implemented in the S5P operational processor and comprehensively describes its various retrieval steps. Furthermore, algorithmic improvements developed in the framework of the EU FP7-project QA4ECV are described for future updates of the processor. Detailed error estimates are discussed in the light of Copernicus user requirements and needs for validation are highlighted. Finally, verification results based on the application of the algorithm to OMI measurements are presented, demonstrating the performances expected for TROPOMI.

TI  - One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA): A fast molecular test based on CK19 mRNA concentration for assessment of lymph-nodes metastases in early stage endometrial cancer
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe aim of the current study is to evaluate the detection rate of micro- and macro-metastases of the One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) compared to frozen section examination and subsequent ultra-staging examination in early stage endometrial cancer (EC).Material and methodsFrom March 2016 to June 2016, data of 40 consecutive FIGO stage I EC patients were prospectively collected in an electronic database. The sentinel lymph node mapping was performed in all patients. All mapped nodes were removed and processed. Sentinel lymph nodes were sectioned and alternate sections were respectively examined by OSNA and by frozen section analysis. After frozen section, the residual tissue from each block was processed with step-level sections (each step at 200 micron) including H&E and IHC slides.ResultsSentinel lymph nodes mapping was successful in 29 patients (72.5%). In the remaining 11 patients (27.5%), a systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy was performed. OSNA assay sensitivity and specificity were 87.5% and 100% respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were 100% and 99% respectively, with a diagnostic accuracy of 99%. As far as frozen section examination and subsequent ultra-staging analysis was concerned, we reported sensitivity and specificity of 50% and 94.4% respectively; positive and negative predictive values were 14.3% and 99%, respectively, with an accuracy of 93.6%. In one patient, despite negative OSNA and frozen section analysis of the sentinel node, a macro-metastasis in 1 non-sentinel node was found.ConclusionsThe combination of OSNA procedure with the sentinel lymph node mapping could represent an efficient intra-operative tool for the selection of early-stage EC patients to be submitted to systematic lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Aerosol midlatitude cyclone indirect effects in observations and high-resolution simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interactions are a major source of uncertainty in inferring the climate sensitivity from the observational record of temperature. The adjustment of clouds to aerosol is a poorly constrained aspect of these aerosolcloud interactions. Here, we examine the response of midlatitude cyclone cloud properties to a change in cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC). Idealized experiments in high-resolution, convection-permitting global aquaplanet simulations with constant CDNC are compared to 13 years of remote-sensing observations. Observations and idealized aquaplanet simulations agree that increased warm conveyor belt (WCB) moisture flux into cyclones is consistent with higher cyclone liquid water path (CLWP). When CDNC is increased a larger LWP is needed to give the same rain rate. The LWP adjusts to allow the rain rate to be equal to the moisture flux into the cyclone along the WCB. This results in an increased CLWP for higher CDNC at a fixed WCB moisture flux in both observations and simulations. If observed cyclones in the top and bottom tercile of CDNC are contrasted it is found that they have not only higher CLWP but also cloud cover and albedo. The difference in cyclone albedo between the cyclones in the top and bottom third of CDNC is observed by CERES to be between 0.018 and 0.032, which is consistent with a 4.6-8.3Wm(-2) in-cyclone enhancement in upwelling shortwave when scaled by annualmean insolation. Based on a regression model to observed cyclone properties, roughly 60% of the observed variability in CLWP can be explained by CDNC and WCB moisture flux.

TI  - Geomagnetic field declination: from decadal to centennial scales
T2  - SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Declination annual mean time series longer than 1 century provided by 24 geomagnetic observatories worldwide, together with 5 Western European reconstructed declination series over the last 4 centuries, have been analyzed in terms of the frequency constituents of the secular variation at inter-decadal and sub-centennial timescales of 20-35 and 70-90 years. Observatory and reconstructed time series have been processed by several types of filtering, namely Hodrick-Prescott, running averages, and Butterworth. The Hodrick-Prescott filtering allows us to separate a quasioscillation at a decadal timescale, which is assumed to be related to external variations and called the "11-year constituent", from a long-term trend. The latter has been decomposed into two other oscillations called "inter-decadal" and "sub-centennial" constituents by applying a Butterworth filtering with cutoffs at 30 and 73 years, respectively. The analysis shows that the generally accepted geomagnetic jerks occur around extrema in the time derivative of the trend and coincide with extrema in the time derivative of the 11-year constituent. The sub-centennial constituent is traced back to 1600 in the five 400-year-long time series and seems to be a major constituent of the secular variation, geomagnetic jerks included.

TI  - A Library of Phosphoproteomic and Chromatin Signatures for Characterizing Cellular Responses to Drug Perturbations
T2  - CELL SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the value of proteomics has been demonstrated, cost and scale are typically prohibitive, and gene expression profiling remains dominant for characterizing cellular responses to perturbations. However, high-throughput sentinel assays provide an opportunity for proteomics to contribute at a meaningful scale. We present a systematic library resource (90 drugs x 6 cell lines) of proteomic signatures that measure changes in the reduced-representation phosphoproteome (P100) and changes in epigenetic marks on histones (GCP). A majority of these drugs elicited reproducible signatures, but notable cell line- and assay-specific differences were observed. Using the "connectivity" framework, we compared signatures across cell types and integrated data across assays, including a transcriptional assay (L1000). Consistent connectivity among cell types revealed cellular responses that transcended lineage, and consistent connectivity among assays revealed unexpected associations between drugs. We further leveraged the resource against public data to formulate hypotheses for treatment of multiple myeloma and acute lymphocytic leukemia. This resource is publicly available at https://clue.io/proteomics.

TI  - Variation of Landscape Pattern and Its Influences on Ecosystem Service in Value in Three Gorges Reservoir Area (Chongqing Section)
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chongqing Section of the Three-Gorge Reservoir Area with important eco-geographical significance was hence selected as subject of study. The method of statistics and network analysis was applied with the Landsat TM Remote Sensing Data of the region dated from 2000 to 2015 to study variation of the landscape pattern and ecosystem service value from the spatio-temporal aspect and their relationship. Results show ; ( 1) On the whole, cultivated land and forest land still accounted for a large portion, while the other fractions of landscape, like grassland, water surface and construction land, only for small portions, separately. However, the fraction of construction land expanded the fastest; (2) Temporally speaking, during the period from 2000 to 2015 the indices of patch density and largest patch area decreased first and came backwards, and the maximum value of Landscape aggregation index and the minimum value of Shanon's diversity index appeared in 2010; and the total ecosystem service value exhibited a rising and then falling trend, and peaked in 2010; (3) Spatially speaking, the center of landscape fragmentation shifted gradually from the northeast and southeast of the region to well-built areas of the districts and counties and the main urban zone and the index of landscape integrity gradually increased in the northeast and southeast; The areas low in ecosystem service value were concentrated in the well-built areas, and the main urban zone was the lowest and the area on the west of the Yangtze River was lower than that on the east. All the findings demonstrate that a reasonable landscape pattern is of great significance to increasing ecosystem service value of a place like the Three-Gorge Reservoir Area (Chongqing Section).

TI  - A review of potential methods for monitoring rangeland degradation in Libya
T2  - PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Review
AB  - Natural and human factors exert a profound impact on the degradation of rangelands, human effects being the most significant factor in increasing the severity of deterioration. This occurs through agricultural expansion at the expense of rangelands, and with the number of domestic and wildlife animals exceeding the natural carrying capacity. This raises concerns about the ongoing sustainability of these land resources, as well as the sustainability of traditional pastoral land practices. Rangelands require effective management, which is dependent upon accurate and timely monitoring data to support the assessment of rangeland deterioration. Natural rangelands provide one of the significant pillars of support for the Libyan national economy. Despite the important role of rangeland in Libya from both economic and environmental perspectives, the vegetation cover of Libyan rangeland has changed adversely qualitatively and quantitatively over the past four decades.Ground-based observation methods are widely used to assess rangeland degradation in Libya. However, multi-temporal observations are often not integrated nor repeatable, making it difficult for rangeland managers to detect degradation consistently. Field study costs are also significantly high in comparison with their accuracy and reliability, both in terms of the time and resources required. Remote-sensing approaches offer the advantage of spanning large geographical areas with multiple spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions. These data can play a significant role in rangeland monitoring, permitting observation, monitoring and prediction of vegetation changes, productivity assessment, fire extent, vegetation and soil moisture measurement and quantifying the proliferation of invasive plant species. This paper reviews the factors causing rangeland degradation in Libya, identifying appropriate remote-sensing methods that can be used to implement appropriate monitoring procedures.

TI  - A methodological framework for the evaluation of syndromic surveillance systems: a case study of England
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Syndromic surveillance complements traditional public health surveillance by collecting and analysing health indicators in near real time. The rationale of syndromic surveillance is that it may detect health threats faster than traditional surveillance systems permitting more timely, and hence potentially more effective public health action. The effectiveness of syndromic surveillance largely relies on the methods used to detect aberrations. Very few studies have evaluated the performance of syndromic surveillance systems and consequently little is known about the types of events that such systems can and cannot detect.Methods: We introduce a framework for the evaluation of syndromic surveillance systems that can be used in any setting based upon the use of simulated scenarios. For a range of scenarios this allows the time and probability of detection to be determined and uncertainty is fully incorporated. In addition, we demonstrate how such a framework can model the benefits of increases in the number of centres reporting syndromic data and also determine the minimum size of outbreaks that can or cannot be detected. Here, we demonstrate its utility using simulations of national influenza outbreaks and localised outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis.Results: Influenza outbreaks are consistently detected with larger outbreaks being detected in a more timely manner. Small cryptosporidiosis outbreaks (< 1000 symptomatic individuals) are unlikely to be detected. We also demonstrate the advantages of having multiple syndromic data streams (e.g. emergency attendance data, telephone helpline data, general practice consultation data) as different streams are able to detect different outbreak types with different efficacy (e.g. emergency attendance data are useful for the detection of pandemic influenza but not for outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis). We also highlight that for any one disease, the utility of data streams may vary geographically, and that the detection ability of syndromic surveillance varies seasonally (e.g. an influenza outbreak starting in July is detected sooner than one starting later in the year). We argue that our framework constitutes a useful tool for public health emergency preparedness in multiple settings.Conclusions: The proposed framework allows the exhaustive evaluation of any syndromic surveillance system and constitutes a useful tool for emergency preparedness and response.

TI  - Elimination of onchocerciasis in Ecuador: findings of post-treatment surveillance
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Esmeraldas focus of onchocerciasis in Ecuador expanded geographically during the 1980s and was associated with severe ocular and skin disease. Mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin started in 1991, initially once but later twice a year, in the principle endemic focus followed by all satellite foci. Treatment was stopped in 2009 when entomological assessments determined that transmission of Onchocerca volvulus had been interrupted.Methods: Three years after the cessation of ivermectin treatment in 2012, as defined by the WHO guidelines for onchocerciasis elimination, blackfly collections were done in four sentinel sites in former hyperendemic areas. The presence of infective larvae in local vectors, Simulium exiguum and Simulum quadrivittatum, was assessed by detection of O. volvulus DNA by PCR. Additional flies captured in four extra-sentinel sites located in former hyper- and mesoendemic dispersed isolated areas were also assessed.Results: The results from 68,310 captured blackflies, 40,114 from four sentinel villages in the previously hyperendemic areas (Corriente Grande, El Tigre, San Miguel on Rio Cayapas and Naranjal on Rio Canande) and 28,197 from extra-sentinel locations, were all negative for the presence of O. volvulus. These extra-sentinel sites (Hualpi on Rio Hoja Blanca, Capuli on Rio Onzole, La Ceiba on Rio Tululvi and Mediania on Rio Verde) were included to provide additional evidence of the impact of MDA on the transmission of O. volvulus in isolated endemic areas.Conclusions: Our data indicate that transmission of O. volvulus has been stopped in all endemic areas in Ecuador, including all satellite foci outside the main focus. These findings indicate that a strategy of ivermectin distribution twice a year to over 85% of the treatment-eligible population was effective in eliminating the infection from Ecuador in a focus with a highly competent primary vector, S. exiguum, and where the infection rates were equal to or greater than observed in many onchocerciasis foci in Africa.

TI  - The G20 at a crossroads: the future of global governance
T2  - ECONOMICS-THE OPEN ACCESS OPEN-ASSESSMENT E-JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The G20 is at a crossroads. It can retreat to a reaffirmation of nationalisms or commit to a new form of multilateralism, guided by the primacy of social prosperity and the principle of subsidiarity. The G20 has traditionally focused on economic policy issues - economic growth and financial stability. This is appropriate as along as social progress is closely tied to economic progress, for then the achievement of material prosperity will promote human flourishing. But when economic and social progress becomes decoupled - as we commonly observe through growing income disparities, growing disempowerment and disintegrating social affiliations - then an exclusive preoccupation with economic policy issues is unlikely to quell the widespread public discontent. On this account, it is appropriate for the G20 objectives to be broadened to include resilient, inclusive and sustainable prosperity. This wider conception of human needs calls for a new worldview to underlie G20 policymaking, one that generates social acceptance for multilateral cooperation in tackling multilateral problems, while allowing different countries to nourish different national, cultural and religious identities.

TI  - Exploring the spatio-temporal processes of communal rangeland grabbing in Sudan
T2  - PASTORALISM-RESEARCH POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The persistent policy of successive Sudanese governments in favouring large-scale agricultural investments at the expense of traditional land use is creating material differences among significant groups of the population. A significant share of this type of investment falls within the territories of the communal rangelands of the country. The aim of this paper is to provide analytical insights of the geographical allocation and the temporal evolution of land grabbing on the expanses of communal land utilized by local inhabitants in Butana area in eastern Sudan. The study relies on multi-temporal Landsat satellite imagery (2000, 2005, 2009, and 2014), ground surveys, and key informant interviews. The results show that large-scale mechanized agriculture (LSMA) in Butana communal rangeland increased incrementally from 2.5% in 2000 to 17.6% in 2014. The starting location of the expansion of LSMA was in surrounding valleys. From the images, it is clear that land grabbing is converting the natural vegetation cover of Butana communal rangeland into spatially fragmented patches. Large-scale farmers (LSFs) involved in the process included wealthy pastoralists who own large numbers of livestock and absentee farmers who rely on hired representatives to manage their agricultural operations. Without a fundamental change in governmental policy, which currently turns a blind eye to the illegal activities of LSFs on communal rangeland, the gloomy scenario of land-based conflict may erupt in the eastern part of the country.

TI  - [The influence of lumpectomy on the axillary lymph node status of breast cancer patients].
T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the influence of lumpectomy on axillary lymph node status of breast cancer patients. Methods: The clinical data of 738 invasive breast cancer patients with non-palpable axillary lymph node and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy from November 2011 to August 2013 in Henan Provincial Cancer Hospital were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 136 patients underwent preoperative lumpectomy (lumpectomy group) and 602 patients underwent puncture biopsy only (biopsy group). The difference of axillary lymph node status and positive ratio of SLN detected by color Doppler ultrasound were compared between these two groups. Results: Among the 738 breast cancer patients, the axillary lymph nodes of 444 (60.2%) cases could be detected by ultrasound. Among them, 92 cases belonged to lumpectomy group, significantly less than 352 cases of biopsy group (P=0.048). Among the patients with ultrasound-visible lymph nodes, the proportion of the biggest diameter of axillary lymph node >1 cm of lumpectomy group or biopsy group was 58.7% (54/92) or 52.8% (186/352), respectively, without significant difference (P=0.316). The proportion of patients with the ratio of long diameter to short diameter <2 of lumpectomy group or biopsy group was 37.0% (34/92) or 38.6% (136/352), respectively, with marginal difference (P=0.768). The positive rate of SLN of lumpectomy group or biopsy group was 23.5% (32/136) or 26.9% (162/602), respectively, without significant difference (P=0.419). The incidence rate of the ultrasound visible axillary lymph nodes of patients whose postoperative time ≤ 7 days or > 7days was 71.1% (64/90) or 60.9% (8/46), respectively, without significant difference (P=0.227). However, the positive rate of SLN of these two groups was 28.9% (26/90) and 13.0% (6/46), respectively, with significant difference (P=0.039). The number of ultrasound visible axillary lymph nodes, the biggest diameter of axillary lymph nodes and the ratio of the long diameter to short diameter <2 were substantially correlated with the positive rate of SLN (P<0.05). Conclusions: The incidence rate of ultrasound visible axillary lymph node in the patients with lumpectomy is higher than that of patients with puncture biopsy only. The positive rate of SLN of the patients with a long postoperative time is lower than that of patients with a short postoperative time, even though the axillary lymph nodes are ultrasound visible.

TI  - High-resolution inversion of OMI formaldehyde columns to quantify isoprene emission on ecosystem-relevant scales: application to the southeast US
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Isoprene emissions from vegetation have a large effect on atmospheric chemistry and air quality. "Bottomup" isoprene emission inventories used in atmospheric models are based on limited vegetation information and uncertain land cover data, leading to potentially large errors. Satellite observations of atmospheric formaldehyde (HCHO), a high-yield isoprene oxidation product, provide "top-down" information to evaluate isoprene emission inventories through inverse analyses. Past inverse analyses have however been hampered by uncertainty in the HCHO satellite data, uncertainty in the time-and NOx-dependent yield of HCHO from isoprene oxidation, and coarse resolution of the atmospheric models used for the inversion. Here we demonstrate the ability to use HCHO satellite data from OMI in a high-resolution inversion to constrain isoprene emissions on ecosystem-relevant scales. The inversion uses the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model at 0.25 degrees x 0.3125 degrees horizon-tal resolution to interpret observations over the southeast US in August-September 2013. It takes advantage of concurrent NASA SEAC(4)RS aircraft observations of isoprene and its oxidation products including HCHO to validate the OMI HCHO data over the region, test the GEOS-Chem isoprene oxidation mechanism and NOx environment, and independently evaluate the inversion. This evaluation shows in particular that local model errors in NOx concentrations propagate to biases in inferring isoprene emissions from HCHO data. It is thus essential to correct model NOx biases, which was done here using SEAC(4)RS observations but can be done more generally using satellite NO2 data concurrently with HCHO. We find in our inversion that isoprene emissions from the widely used MEGAN v2.1 inventory are biased high over the southeast US by 40% on average, although the broad-scale distributions are correct including maximum emissions in Arkansas/Louisiana and high base emission factors in the oak-covered Ozarks of southeast Missouri. A particularly large discrepancy is in the Edwards Plateau of central Texas where MEGAN v2.1 is too high by a factor of 3, possibly reflecting errors in land cover. The lower isoprene emissions inferred from our inversion, when implemented into GEOS-Chem, decrease surface ozone over the southeast US by 1-3 ppb and decrease the isoprene contribution to organic aerosol from 40 to 20 %.

TI  - Comparisons of spectral aerosol single scattering albedo in Seoul, South Korea
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying aerosol absorption at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths is important for monitoring air pollution and aerosol amounts using current (e.g., Aura/OMI) and future (e.g., TROPOMI, TEMPO, GEMS, and Sentinel-4) satellite measurements. Measurements of column average atmospheric aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) are performed on the ground by the NASA AERONET in the visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths and in the UV-VISNIR by the SKYNET networks. Previous comparison studies have focused on VIS and NIR wavelengths due to the lack of co-incident measurements of aerosol and gaseous absorption properties in the UV. This study compares the SKYNET-retrieved SSA in the UV with the SSA derived from a combination of AERONET, MFRSR, and Pandora (AMP) retrievals in Seoul, South Korea, in spring and summer 2016. The results show that the spectrally invariant surface albedo assumed in the SKYNET SSA retrievals leads to underestimated SSA compared to AMP values at near UV wavelengths. Re-processed SKYNET inversions using spectrally varying surface albedo, consistent with the AERONET retrieval improve agreement with AMP SSA. The combined AMP inversions allow for separating aerosol and gaseous (NO2 and O-3) absorption and provide aerosol retrievals from the shortest UVB (305 nm) through VIS to NIR wavelengths (870 nm).

T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - New satellites are now revealing InSAR-based surface deformation within a week after natural hazard events. Quick hazard responses will be more publically accessible and provide information to responding agencies. Here we used Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to investigate coseismic deformation associated with the 2017 Sangsefid earthquake, which occurred in the southeast margin of the Kopeh Dagh fault system. The ascending and descending interferograms indicate thrust-dominated slip, with the maximum line-of-sight displacement of 10.5 and 13.7 cm, respectively. The detailed slip-distribution of the 2017 Sangsefid Mw 6.1 earthquake inferred from geodetic data is presented here for the first time. Although the InSAR interferograms themselves do not uniquely constrain what the primary slip surface is, we infer that the source fault dips to southwest by analyzing the 2.5 D displacement field decomposed from the InSAR observations. The determined uniform slip fault model shows that the dip angle of the seimogenic fault is approximately 40 degrees, with a strike of 120 degrees except for a narrower fault width than that predicted by the empirical scaling law. We suggest that geometric complexities near the Kopeh Dagh fault system obstruct the rupture propagation, resulting in high slip occurred within a small area and much higher stress drop than global estimates. The InSAR-determined moment is 1.71 x 10(18) Nm with a shear modulus of 3.32 x 10(10 )N/m(2), equivalent to Mw 6.12, which is consistent with seismological results. The finite fault model (the west-dipping fault plane) reveals that the peak slip of 0.90 m occurred at a depth of 6.3 km, with substantial slip at a depth of 4-10 km and a near-uniform slip of 0.1 m at a depth of 0-2.5 km. We suggest that the Sangsefid earthquake occurred on an unknown blind reverse fault dipping southwest, which can also be recognised through observing the long-term surface effects due to the existence of the blind fault.

TI  - Big data from electronic health records for early and late translational cardiovascular research: challenges and potential
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Aims Cohorts of millions of people's health records, whole genome sequencing, imaging, sensor, societal and publicly available data present a rapidly expanding digital trace of health. We aimed to critically review, for the first time, the challenges and potential of big data across early and late stages of translational cardiovascular disease research.Methods and results We sought exemplars based on literature reviews and expertise across the BigData@Heart Consortium. We identified formidable challenges including: data quality, knowing what data exist, the legal and ethical framework for their use, data sharing, building and maintaining public trust, developing standards for defining disease, developing tools for scalable, replicable science and equipping the clinical and scientific work force with new inter-disciplinary skills. Opportunities claimed for big health record data include: richer profiles of health and disease from birth to death and from the molecular to the societal scale; accelerated understanding of disease causation and progression, discovery of new mechanisms and treatment-relevant disease sub-phenotypes, understanding health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems and returning actionable feedback loops to improve (and potentially disrupt) existing models of research and care, with greater efficiency. In early translational research we identified exemplars including: discovery of fundamental biological processes e.g. linking exome sequences to lifelong electronic health records (EHR) (e.g. human knockout experiments); drug development: genomic approaches to drug target validation; precision medicine: e.g. DNA integrated into hospital EHR for pre-emptive pharmacogenomics. In late translational research we identified exemplars including: learning health systems with outcome trials integrated into clinical care; citizen driven health with 24/7 multi-parameter patient monitoring to improve outcomes and population-based linkages of multiple EHR sources for higher resolution clinical epidemiology and public health.Conclusion High volumes of inherently diverse ('big') EHR data are beginning to disrupt the nature of cardiovascular research and care. Such big data have the potential to improve our understanding of disease causation and classification relevant for early translation and to contribute actionable analytics to improve health and healthcare.

TI  - Comparison of aerosol optical depth from satellite (MODIS), sun photometer and broadband pyrheliometer ground-based observations in Cuba
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, we report the first comparison between the aerosol optical depth (AOD) and angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on the Terra (AOD(t)) and Aqua (AOD(a)) satellites and those measured using a sun photometer (AOD(SP)) at Camaguey, Cuba, for the period 2008 to 2014. The comparison of Terra and Aqua data includes AOD derived with both deep blue (DB) and dark target (DT) algorithms from MODIS Collection 6. Combined Terra and Aqua (AOD(ta)) data were also considered. Assuming an interval of +/- 30 min around the overpass time and an area of 25 km around the sun photometer site, two coincidence criteria were considered: individual pairs of observations and both spatial and temporal mean values, which we call collocated daily means. The usual statistics (root mean square error, RMSE; mean absolute error, MAE; median bias, BIAS), together with linear regression analysis, are used for this comparison. Results show very similar values for both coincidence criteria: the DT algorithm generally displays better statistics and higher homogeneity than the DB algorithm in the behaviour of AOD(t), AOD(a), AOD(ta) compared to AOD(SP). For collocated daily means, (a) RMSEs of 0.060 and 0.062 were obtained for Terra and Aqua with the DT algorithm and 0.084 and 0.065 for the DB algorithm, (b) MAE follows the same patterns, (c) BIAS for both Terra and Aqua presents positive and negative values but its absolute values are lower for the DT algorithm; (d) combined AOD(ta) data also give lower values of these three statistical indicators for the DT algorithm; (e) both algorithms present good correlations for comparing AOD(t) , AOD(a), AOD(ta) vs. AOD(SP), with a slight overestimation of satellite data compared to AOD(SP), (f). The DT algorithm yields better figures with slopes of 0.96 (Terra), 0.96 (Aqua) and 0.96 (Terra C Aqua) compared to the DB algorithm (1.07, 0.90, 0.99), which displays greater variability. Multi-annual monthly means of AOD(ta) establish a first climatology that is more comparable to that given by the sun photometer and their statistical evaluation reveals better agreement with AOD(SP) for the DT algorithm. Results of the AE comparison showed similar results to those reported in the literature concerning the two algorithms' capacity for retrieval. A comparison between broadband aerosol optical depth (BAOD), derived from broadband pyrheliometer observations at the Camaguey site and three other meteorological stations in Cuba, and AOD observations from MODIS on board Terra and Aqua show a poor correlation with slopes below 0.4 for both algorithms. Aqua (Terra) showed RMSE values of 0.073 (0.080) and 0.088 (0.087) for the DB and DT algorithms. As expected, RMSE values are higher than those from the MODIS-sun photometer comparison, but within the same order of magnitude. Results from the BAOD derived from solar radiation measurements demonstrate its reliability in describing climatological AOD series estimates.

TI  - Using the Fire Weather Index (FWI) to improve the estimation of fire emissions from fire radiative power (FRP) observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric composition analysis and forecast for the European Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Services (CAMS) relies on biomass-burning fire emission estimates from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS). The GFAS is a global system and converts fire radiative power (FRP) observations from MODIS satellites into smoke constituents. Missing observations are filled in using persistence, whereby observed FRP values from the previous day are progressed in time until a new observation is recorded. One of the consequences of this assumption is an increase of fire duration, which in turn translates into an increase of emissions estimated from fires compared to what is available from observations. In this study persistence is replaced by modelled predictions using the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), which describes how atmospheric conditions affect the vegetation moisture content and ultimately fire duration. The skill in predicting emissions from biomass burning is improved with the new technique, which indicates that using an FWI-based model to infer emissions from FRP is better than persistence when observations are not available.

TI  - Developing Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment methodology by applying values-based sustainability weighting - Tested on biomass based and fossil transportation fuels
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The production and use of transportation fuels can lead to sustainability impacts. Assessing them simultaneously in a holistic way is a challenge. This paper examines methodology for assessing the sustainability performance of products in a more integrated way, including a broad range of social impacts. Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment (LCSA) methodology is applied for this assessment. LSCA often constitutes of the integration of results from social LCA (S-LCA), environmental life cycle assessment (E-LCA) and life cycle costing (LCC). In this study, an S-LCA from an earlier project is extended with a positive social aspect, as well as refined and detailed. E-LCA and LCC results are built from LCA database and literature. Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methodology is applied to integrate the results from the three different assessments into an LCSA. The weighting of key sustainability dimensions in the MCDA is performed in different ways, where the sustainability dimensions are prioritized differently priority based on the assumed values of different stakeholder profiles (Egalitarian, Hierarchist, and Individualist). The developed methodology is tested on selected biomass based and fossil transportation fuels - ethanol produced from Brazilian sugarcane and US corn/maize, and petrol produced from Russian and Nigerian crude oils, where it delineates differences in sustainability performance between products assessed. The outcome in terms of relative ranking of the transportation fuel chains based on sustain ability performance differs when applying different decision-maker profiles. This result highlights and supports views that there is no one single answer regarding which of the alternatives that is most sustainable. Rather, it depends strongly upon the worldview and values held by the decision maker. A key conclusion is that sustainability assessments should pay more attention to potential differences in underlying values held by key stakeholders in relevant societal contexts. The LCSA methodology still faces challenges regarding results integration but MCDA in combination with stakeholder profiles appears to be a useful approach to build on further. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Bio-inspired imager improves sensitivity in near-infrared fluorescence image-guided surgery
T2  - OPTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Image-guided surgery can enhance cancer treatment by decreasing, and ideally eliminating, positive tumor margins and iatrogenic damage to healthy tissue. Current state-of-the-art near-infrared fluorescence imaging systems are bulky and costly, lack sensitivity under surgical illumination, and lack co-registration accuracy between multimodal images. As a result, an overwhelming majority of physicians still rely on their unaided eyes and palpation as the primary sensing modalities for distinguishing cancerous from healthy tissue. Here we introduce an innovative design, comprising an artificial multispectral sensor inspired by the Morpho butterfly's compound eye, which can significantly improve image-guided surgery. By monolithically integrating spectral tapetal filters with photodetectors, we have realized a single-chip multispectral imager with 1000 x higher sensitivity and 7 x better spatial co-registration accuracy compared to clinical imaging systems in current use. Preclinical and clinical data demonstrate that this technology seamlessly integrates into the surgical workflow while providing surgeons with real-time information on the location of cancerous tissue and sentinel lymph nodes. Due to its low manufacturing cost, our bio-inspired sensor will provide resource-limited hospitals with much-needed technology to enable more accurate value-based health care.

TI  - ALOHA From the Edge: Reconciling Three Decades of <i>in Situ</i> Eulerian Observations and Geographic Variability in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Global analyses of satellite and modeled data suggest decreased phytoplankton abundance and primary productivity in oligotrophic gyres as they expand in response to increased surface temperatures, shoaling of surface mixed layers, and decreased supply of subsurface macronutrients. However, analogous changes in the phytoplankton have not been evident in situ at Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) Station ALOHA (22 degrees 45'N, 158 degrees 00'W), suggesting that physiological or structural reorganization not observed from space, uncorrected sensor drift, or uncharacterized geographic variability may be responsible for the apparent discrepancy. To address the latter, we compared interannual patterns of in situ phytoplankton dynamics and mixed layer properties to gyre extent and boundary location based on multiple definitions including dynamic topography, a threshold of satellite surface chlorophyll (chl a) <= 0.07 mg m(-3) , and multivariate biophysical seascapes using modeled or satellite data. Secular increases in gyre extent were apparent, although the rate of expansion was much slower than previously reported, whereas strong interannual oscillations were evident for all definitions of the gyre. Modeled and satellite-based multivariate seascapes agreed well in terms of expansion (surface area of seascapes) and isolation of Station ALOHA (distance to seascape boundary) resulting in a combined data record of nearly three decades. Isolation was associated positively with the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), and negatively with Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The converse was true for the gyre's expansion. Expansion followed a shoaling and freshening of the surface mixed layer and declines of in situ net primary production (PP) suggesting that Station ALOHA may serve as an early indicator of gyre biogeographic patterns. Lags between geographic indicators and in situ conditions appear to partially explain past observed discrepancies between patterns from satellite remote sensing and those from in situ conditions at Station ALOHA.

TI  - Large- to submesoscale surface circulation and its implications on biogeochemical/biological horizontal distributions during the OUTPACE cruise (southwest Pacific)
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The patterns of the large-scale, meso- and sub-mesoscale surface circulation on biogeochemical and biological distributions are examined in the western tropical South Pacific (WTSP) in the context of the OUTPACE cruise (February-April 2015). Multi-disciplinary original in situ observations were achieved along a zonal transect through the WTSP and their analysis was coupled with satellite data. The use of Lagrangian diagnostics allows for the identification of water mass pathways, mesoscale structures, and submesoscale features such as fronts. In particular, we confirmed the existence of a global wind-driven southward circulation of surface waters in the entire WTSP, using a new high-resolution altimetry-derived product, validated by in situ drifters, that includes cyclogeostrophy and Ekman components with geostrophy. The mesoscale activity is shown to be responsible for counter-intuitive water mass trajectories in two subregions: (i) the Coral Sea, with surface exchanges between the North Vanuatu Jet and the North Caledonian Jet, and (ii) around 170 degrees W, with an eastward pathway, whereas a westward general direction dominates. Fronts and small-scale features, detected with finite-size Lyapunov exponents (FSLEs), are correlated with 25% of surface tracer gradients, which reveals the significance of such structures in the generation of submesoscale surface gradients. Additionally, two high-frequency sampling transects of biogeochemical parameters and microorganism abundances demonstrate the influence of fronts in controlling the spatial distribution of bacteria and phytoplankton, and as a consequence the microbial community structure. All circulation scales play an important role that has to be taken into account not only when analysing the data from OUTPACE but also, more generally, for understanding the global distribution of biogeochemical components.

TI  - The personal context of student learning for sustainability: Results of a multi-university research study
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The UN Decade of Education for Sustainable Development (DESD, 2005-2014) was an important framework and catalyst for increasing Sustainable Development (SD) efforts within academic institutions, worldwide. Tertiary institutions began to embed sustainability into the curriculum, although the extent has varied within and between institutions with many adopting an ad hoc approach. Previous studies of student learning outcomes were generally limited in scope and reported mixed results. Few studies systematically investigated the influence of sustainability education (SE) on student views, attitudes and behaviour across a range of contexts. This study adds to the field by using a common instrument that explored how SE contributed to student learning across multiple disciplines, institutions and countries. A quasi-experimental approach was adopted with tertiary students in 'intervention' and 'control' units. Data was collected using an online two-stage pre-post survey and included the Inclusion of Nature in Self (INS) and New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scales and measures of selfreported behaviour. A series of snapshots of pre-test and post-test perspectives were taken across various terms of study during 2013-2015. Students' initial sustainability perspectives were found to be influenced by personal and educational factors such as gender, age, "culture" and discipline of study. Environmental worldviews were characterised by jointly strong ecocentric and anthropocentric orientations that represented a "utilitarian" view of human-nature relations. After controlling for pre-test scores, SE significantly increased post-test scores for several NEP dimensions compared to the control group however, the effect was weak and moderated by students' personal and educational context. Students exposed to SE also reported a cognitive shift in their attitudes/perceptions to sustainability that was linked to an increased INS score. The ad hoc approach to SE, combined with students' strong utilitarian worldview and mixed effects of SE indicated learning outcomes were far from certain and probably weak. The paper argued for a rethink of current educational approaches towards a more coherent and targeted educational strategy and concluded with recommendations for policy and praxis to enhance student learning for sustain ability in higher education.

TI  - MODIS estimates of pasture productivity in the Cerrado based on ground and Landsat-8 data extrapolations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With similar to 175 Mha (38% of which is in the Cerrado biome), pastures are the main land use forms in Brazil. Aiming at improving pasture utilization, in this study we combined field and satellite data to assess the biophysical characteristics and productivity patterns of the Cerrado pasturelands. From October 2013 to September 2014, field data of total and green biomass and percent green cover (%GC) were collected in two study areas located in the municipality of Uberlandia, Minas Gerais State. These data were extrapolated to the entire Cerrado biome through regression equations involving normalized vegetation index values derived from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Terra MODIS sensors for the year 2014. Total green biomass in the growing season was used to estimate potential livestock intensification in terms of animal unit (AU) per hectare. Average green biomass values ranged from 1482 kg ha(-1) in August (dry season peak) to 2878 kg ha(-1) in March (end of the rainy season), whereas %GC ranged from 49% in August to 66% in January and April 2014. Considering the estimated availability of green forage, cattle stocking rate in the Cerrado could increase, on average, from 1.11 to 2.56 AU ha(-1).

T2  - Acta Entomologica Sinica
M3  - Article
AB  - [Aim] To clarify the effects of agricultural landscape pattern on ladybeetle community in wheat fields, so as to provide theoretical proofs for ecological regulation and management of insect pests. [Methods] Based on the remote sensing data, land cover classification and the survey data of ladybeetle abundance in wheat fields in 22 counties and cities in Shandong, the planting region of wheat was taken as a typical example, the landscape pattern metrics were calculated, and the effects of landscape pattern of farmland, non-crop habitat and regional agricultural landscape on ladybeetle abundance were analyzed using negative binomial generalized linear model. [Results] The ladybeetle abundance was positively correlated with mean patch area (AREA_MN) and area-weighted mean patch fractal dimension (FRAC_AM) of grassland and patch richness density (PRD) of regional landscape, and was negatively correlated with area-weighted mean Euclidean nearest neighbor distance (ENN_AM) of non-crop habitat. Grassland, clustered non-crop habitats and diverse regional landscapes benefited ladybeetle abundance. AREA_MN of grassland and ENN_AM of non-crop habitat could best predict ladybeetle occurrence. [Conclusion] Grassland, spatial distribution of non-crop habitats and regional landscape diversity are important landscape factors affecting the occurrence of ladybeetles in wheat fields.

TI  - Spatial distribution analysis of the OMI aerosol layer height: a pixel-by-pixel comparison to CALIOP observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - A global picture of atmospheric aerosol vertical distribution with a high temporal resolution is of key importance not only for climate, cloud formation, and air quality research studies but also for correcting scattered radiation induced by aerosols in absorbing trace gas retrievals from passive satellite sensors. Aerosol layer height (ALH) was retrieved from the OMI 477 nm O-2-O-2 band and its spatial pattern evaluated over selected cloud-free scenes. Such retrievals benefit from a synergy with MODIS data to provide complementary information on aerosols and cloudy pixels. We used a neural network approach previously trained and developed. Comparison with CALIOP aerosol level 2 products over urban and industrial pollution in eastern China shows consistent spatial patterns with an uncertainty in the range of 462-648 m. In addition, we show the possibility to determine the height of thick aerosol layers released by intensive biomass burning events in South America and Russia from OMI visible measurements. A Saharan dust outbreak over sea is finally discussed. Complementary detailed analyses show that the assumed aerosol properties in the forward modelling are the key factors affecting the accuracy of the results, together with potential cloud residuals in the observation pixels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the physical meaning of the retrieved ALH scalar corresponds to the weighted average of the vertical aerosol extinction profile. These encouraging findings strongly suggest the potential of the OMI ALH product, and in more general the use of the 477 nm O-2-O-2 band from present and future similar satellite sensors, for climate studies as well as for future aerosol correction in air quality trace gas retrievals.

TI  - Identification and Characterization of a Novel Hepta-Segmented dsRNA Virus From the Phytopathogenic Fungus <i>Colletotrichum fructicola</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel hepta-segmented double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus was isolated and characterized from the strain FJ-4 of the phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum fructicola, and was named Colletotrichum fructicola chrysovirus 1 (CfCV1). The full-length cDNAs of dsRNA1-7 were 3620, 2801, 2687, 2437, 1750, 1536, and 1211 bp, respectively. The 5 '- and 3 '-untranslated regions of the seven dsRNAs share highly similar internal sequence and contain conserved sequence stretches, indicating that they have a common virus origin. The 5 '- and 3 '-UTRs of the seven dsRNAs were predicted to fold into stable stem-loop structures. CfCV1 contains spherical virions that are 35 nm in diameter consisting of seven segments. The largest dsRNA of CfCV1 encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the second dsRNA encodes a viral capsid protein (CP). The dsRNA5 encodes a C2H2-type zinc finger protein containing an R-rich region and a G-rich region. The smallest dsRNA is a satellite-like RNA. The functions of the other proteins encoded by dsRNA3, dsRNA4, dsRNA6 are unknown. Phylogenetic analysis, based on RdRp and CP, indicated that CfCV1 is phylogenetically related to Botryosphaeria dothidea chrysovirus 1 (BdCV1), and Penicillium janczewskii chrysovirus 2 (PjCV2), a cluster of an independent cluster II group in the family Chrysoviridae. Importantly, all the seven segments of CfCV1 were transmitted successfully to other virus-free strains with an all-or-none fashion. CfCV1 exerts minor influence on the growth of C. fructicola but can confer hypovirulence to the fungal host. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a hepta-segmented tentative chrysovirus in C. fructicola.

TI  - Regional evapotranspiration from an image-based implementation of the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC1.2) model and its validation across an aridity gradient in the conterminous US
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have highlighted the need for improved characterizations of aerodynamic conductance and temperature (g(Lambda) and T-0) in thermal remote-sensing-based surface energy balance (SEB) models to reduce uncertainties in regional-scale evapotranspiration (ET) mapping. By integrating radiometric surface temperature (T-R) into the Penman-Monteith (PM) equation and finding analytical solutions of g(Lambda) and T-0, this need was recently addressed by the Surface Temperature Initiated Closure (STIC) model. However, previous implementations of STIC were confined to the ecosystem-scale using flux tower observations of infrared temperature. This study demonstrates the first regional-scale implementation of the most recent version of the STIC model (STIC1.2) that integrates the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived T-R and ancillary land surface variables in conjunction with NLDAS (North American Land Data Assimilation System) atmospheric variables into a combined structure of the PM and Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW) framework for estimating ET at 1 km x 1 km spatial resolution. Evaluation of STIC1.2 at 13 core AmeriFlux sites covering a broad spectrum of climates and biomes across an aridity gradient in the conterminous US suggests that STIC1.2 can provide spatially explicit ET maps with reliable accuracies from dry to wet extremes. When observed ET from one wet, one dry, and one normal precipitation year from all sites were combined, STIC1.2 explained 66% of the variability in observed 8-day cumulative ET with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.4 mm/8-day, mean absolute error (MAE) of 5 mm/8-day, and percent bias (PBIAS) of -4%. These error statistics showed relatively better accuracies than a widely used but previous version of the SEB-based Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model, which utilized a simple NDVI-based parameterization of surface roughness (zOM), and the PM-based MOD16 ET. SEBS was found to overestimate (PBIAS = 28 %) and MOD16 was found to underestimate ET (PBIAS = -26 %). The performance of STIC1.2 was better in forest and grassland ecosystems as compared to cropland (20% underestimation) and woody savanna (40% overestimation). Model inter-comparison suggested that ET differences between the models are robustly correlated with g(Lambda) and associated roughness length estimation uncertainties which are intrinsically connected to T-R uncertainties, vapor pressure deficit (D-A), and vegetation cover. A consistent performance of STIC1.2 in a broad range of hydrological and biome categories, as well as the capacity to capture spatio-temporal ET signatures across an aridity gradient, points to the potential for this simplified analytical model for near-real-time ET mapping from regional to continental scales.

TI  - InSAR analysis for detecting the route of hydrothermal fluid to the surface during the 2015 phreatic eruption of Hakone Volcano, Japan
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the 2015 Hakone Volcano eruption was a small-scale phreatic eruption with a discharged mass of only about 100 tons, interferometric synthetic aperture radar successfully detected surface deformations related to the eruption. Inversion model of the underground hydrothermal system based on measured ground displacements by ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 images showed that a crack opened at an elevation of about 530-830 m, probably at the time of the eruption. A geomorphological analysis detected several old NW-SE trending fissures, and the open crack was located just beneath one of the fissures. Thus, the crack that opened during the 2015 eruption could have been a preexisting crack that formed during a more voluminous hydrothermal eruption. In addition, the inversion model implies that a sill deflation occurred at an elevation of about 225 m, probably at the time of the eruption. The deflation of sill-like body represents a preexisting hydrothermal reservoir at an elevation of 100-400 m, which intruded fluid in the open crack prior to eruption. The volume changes of the open crack and the sill were calculated to be 1.14 x 10(5) m(3) (inflation) and 0.49 x 10(5) m(3) (deflation), respectively. A very local swelling (about 200 m in diameter) was also detected at the eruption center 2 months before the eruption. The local swelling, whose rate in satellite lineof-sight was 0.7-0.9 cm/day during May 2015 and declined in June, had been monitored until the time of the eruption, when its uplift halted. This was modeled as a point pressure source at an elevation of about 900 m (at a depth of about 80-90 m from the ground surface) and is considered to be a minor hydrothermal reservoir just beneath the fumarolic field. Our analysis shows that the northernmost tip of the open crack reached within 200 m of the surface. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the hydrothermal fluid in the open crack found a way to the surface and formed the eruption.

TI  - The Great Debate at "Melanoma Bridge", Napoli, December 2nd, 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of the 2017 Melanoma Bridge congress (November 30-December 2, 2017, Napoli, Italy), the great debate session featured counterpoint views from leading experts on three contemporary controversial clinical issues in the care of the melanoma patient. These were: (1) whether complete lymph node dissection should be routinely offered to all melanoma patients with sentinel lymph node-positive disease; (2) whether first-line treatment of BRAF-mutated melanoma should consist of BRAF-targeted therapy or immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors; and (3) whether combined or sequential administration of treatments should be the preferred option in the management of patients with advanced melanoma. Discussion of these three important issues and audience responses are reported here.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop a bionic animal skin and evaluate its detective effect of Schistosoma japonicum cercariae so as to provide a new technique for the monitoring of the schistosome susceptibility water body.METHODS: A bionic animal skin was made with pigskin and the experiments were carried out for evaluating its detective effects of S. japonicum cercariae in laboratory and simulate fields, and at the same time, the sentinel mouse method was used as the control.RESULTS: In the laboratory, the cercariae were found in 10-, 30-, 60-cercaria subgroups in the bionic animal skin group after 1 and 2 hours, but the cercariae were found only in the 60-cercaria subgroup in the sentinel mouse group. In the simulate fields, in the water body with 5 schistosome-infected Oncomelania hupensis snails, the cercariae were found in 2 bionic animal skin devices (2/4) and 3 bionic animal skin devices (3/4) after 2 hours and 4 hours respectively, and in the water body with 10 schistosome-infected O. hupensis snails, the cercariae were found in 4 bionic animal skin devices (4/4) and 3 bionic animal skin devices (3/4) after 2 hours and 4 hours respectively in the bionic animal skin group. In the the sentinel mouse group, in the above-mentioned water bodies (with 5 or 10 schistosome-infected O. hupensis snails), the cercariae were found in 2 sentinel mice (2/4) and 1 sentinel mice (1/4) after 2 hours and 4 hours respectively; and the cercariae were found in 2 sentinel mice (2/4) and 3 sentinel mice (3/4) after 2 hours and 4 hours respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The bionic animal skin device can be used to detect the S. japonicum cercariae, and its sensibility and efficiency are superior to the traditional sentinel mouse method.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to explore the effect of land uses on urban heat island (UHI), the correlation between land-use pattern and land surface temperature (LST) is quantitatively analyzed separately in the urban and suburban areas. In the case of the Changsha-Zhuzhou-Xiangtan city group of China, the LST is retrieved by the Landsat-5 TM image acquired on September 2009, and the land-use composition and configuration are described by five landscape metrics: the percentage of landscape, edge density, mean patch area, the mean Euclidean nearest-neighbor distance, and Shannon's evenness index. Pearson's correlation coefficients and an ordinary least squares multiple linear regression model are utilized to evaluate the correlation between each landscape metric and LST, respectively, and to select the optimal combination of landscape metrics to describe the LST at an optimal scale in the whole and the urban/suburban parts of the study area. According to the conclusions, it is suggested that, in order to restrain the aggravating UHI and its influence, all land uses should be reasonably distributed, and the proportion of critical land-use types should be optimized.

TI  - The Cloud Top Distribution and Diurnal Variation of Clouds Over East Asia: Preliminary Results From Advanced Himawari Imager
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds, as one of the most uncertain factors in climate system, have been intensively studied as satellites with advanced instruments emerged in recent years. However, few studies examine the vertical distributions of cloud top and their temporal variations over East Asia based on geostationary satellite data. In this study, the vertical structures of cloud top and its diurnal variations in summer of 2016 are analyzed using the Advanced Himawari Imager/Himawari-8 cloud products. Results show that clouds occur most frequently over the southern Tibetan Plateau and the Bay of Bengal. We find a steep gradient of cloud occurrence frequency extending from southwest to northeast China and low-value centers over the eastern Pacific and the Inner Mongolia Plateau. The vertical structures of cloud top are highly dependent on latitude, in addition to the nonnegligible roles of both terrain and land-sea thermal contrast. In terms of the diurnal cycle, clouds tend to occur more often in the afternoon, peaking around 1700 local time over land and ocean. The amplitude of cloud diurnal variation over ocean is much smaller than that over land, and complex terrain tends to be linked to larger amplitude. In vertical, the diurnal cycle of cloud frequency exhibits bimodal pattern over both land and ocean. The high-level peaks occur at almost the same altitude over land and ocean. In contrast, the low-level peaks over ocean mainly reside in the boundary layer, much lower than those over land, which could be indicative of the frequent occurrence of marine boundary layer clouds.

TI  - Regional to Global Biogenic Isoprene Emission Responses to Changes in Vegetation From 2000 to 2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Isoprene, a dominant biogenic volatile organic compound that is mainly emitted by trees, has a significant impact on the atmospheric chemistry. Regional to global changes in biogenic isoprene emission associated with vegetation variations between 2000 and 2015 were estimated using the MEGAN model with satellite land cover data for inputs in this study. The satellite data estimates of land cover changes were compared to results from previous investigators that have either conducted regional studies or have used lower resolution land cover data. The analysis indicates that tree coverage increases of >5% occurred in 13% of locations including in central China and Europe. In contrast, a decrease of >5% was observed in about 5% of locations, especially in tropical regions. The trends in global tree coverage from 2000 to 2015 resulted in a global isoprene emission decrease of only 1.5%, but there were significant regional variations. Obvious decreases in tree coverage in some tropical areas (e.g., Amazon Basin, Western Africa, Southeast Asia) resulted in a similar to 10% reduction of regional isoprene emission due to agricultural expansion. Distinct increments of isoprene emission (5-10%) were mainly found in Northeast China and India and were associated with afforestation efforts. Deforestation and afforestation associated with managed plantations does not only affect the total forest coverage but also impacts average isoprene emission capacity, which can result in accelerated isoprene emission variations. Consequently, isoprene variation assessments are needed that not only account for changes in vegetation fractions but also consider the changes in plant species compositions of forests and other landscapes.

TI  - Aerosol Optical Depth Over India
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) over India was simulated by Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem, a global 3-D chemical-transport model, using SMOG (Speciated Multi-pOllutant Generator from Indian Institute of Technology Bombay) and GEOS-Chem (GC) (current inventories used in the GEOS-Chem model) inventories for 2012. The simulated AODs were similar to 80% (SMOG) and 60% (GC) of those measured by the satellites (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer). There is no strong seasonal variation in AOD over India. The peak AOD values are observed/simulated during summer. The simulated AOD using SMOG inventory has particulate black and organic carbon AOD higher by a factor similar to 5 and 3, respectively, compared to GC inventory. The model underpredicted coarse-mode AOD but agreed for fine-mode AOD with Aerosol Robotic Network data. It captured dust only over Western India, which is a desert, and not elsewhere, probably due to inaccurate dust transport and/or noninclusion of other dust sources. The calculated AOD, after dust correction, showed the general features in its observed spatial variation. Highest AOD values were observed over the Indo-Gangetic Plain followed by Central and Southern India with lowest values in Northern India. Transport of aerosols from Indo-Gangetic Plain and Central India into Eastern India, where emissions are low, is significant. The major contributors to total AOD over India are inorganic aerosol (41-64%), organic carbon (14-26%), and dust (7-32%). AOD over most regions of India is a factor of 5 or higher than over the United States.Plain Language Summary Overhead amounts of particulate matter, their chemical make up, and their variations over India, a highly polluted and fast developing country, were calculated using a global model. It shows that the particulate pollution levels over the Indo-Gangetic Plain is more than 5 times higher than over the United States. The use of the most recent available emission inventory shows that there is more black carbon, from incomplete combustion, than estimated using the existing regional inventory. The calculations also show that the cleanest part is the very Northern India and that pollution over Eastern India is significantly influenced by what happens over the Indo-Gangetic Plain.

TI  - Reconstructed Solar-Induced Fluorescence: A Machine Learning Vegetation Product Based on MODIS Surface Reflectance to Reproduce GOME-2 Solar-Induced Fluorescence
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) observations from space have resulted in major advancements in estimating gross primary productivity (GPP). However, current SIF observations remain spatially coarse, infrequent, and noisy. Here we develop a machine learning approach using surface reflectances from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) channels to reproduce SIF normalized by clear sky surface irradiance from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2). The resulting product is a proxy for ecosystem photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by chlorophyll (fAPARCh). Multiplying this new product with a MODIS estimate of photosynthetically active radiation provides a new MODIS-only reconstruction of SIF called Reconstructed SIF (RSIF). RSIF exhibits much higher seasonal and interannual correlation than the original SIF when compared with eddy covariance estimates of GPP and two reference global GPP products, especially in dry and cold regions. RSIF also reproduces intense productivity regions such as the U.S. Corn Belt contrary to typical vegetation indices and similarly to SIF.Plain Language Summary A new proxy for photosynthesis is developed using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer observations and a machine learning approach. The new product is able to effectively reproduce observations from eddy covariance towers and more sophisticated photosynthesis models that rely on more information (such as weather information).

TI  - An Uncertainty Data Set for Passive Microwave Satellite Observations of Warm Cloud Liquid Water Path
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The first extended comprehensive data set of the retrieval uncertainties in passive microwave observations of cloud liquid water path (CLWP) for warm oceanic clouds has been created for practical use in climate applications. Four major sources of systematic errors were considered over the 9-year record of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E): clear-sky bias, cloud-rain partition (CRP) bias, cloud-fraction-dependent bias, and cloud temperature bias. Errors were estimated using a unique merged AMSR-E/Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Level 2 data set as well as observations from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization and the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar. To quantify the CRP bias more accurately, a new parameterization was developed to improve the inference of CLWP in warm rain. The cloud-fraction-dependent bias was found to be a combination of the CRP bias, an in-cloud bias, and an adjacent precipitation bias. Globally, the mean net bias was 0.012kg/m(2), dominated by the CRP and in-cloud biases, but with considerable regional and seasonal variation. Good qualitative agreement between a bias-corrected AMSR-E CLWP climatology and ship observations in the Northeast Pacific suggests that the bias estimates are reasonable. However, a possible underestimation of the net bias in certain conditions may be due in part to the crude method used in classifying precipitation, underscoring the need for an independent method of detecting rain in warm clouds. This study demonstrates the importance of combining visible-infrared imager data and passive microwave CLWP observations for estimating uncertainties and improving the accuracy of these observations.

TI  - Saturation of water reflectance in extremely turbid media based on field measurements, satellite data and bio-optical modelling
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evidence of water reflectance saturation in extremely turbid media is highlighted based on both field measurements and satellite data corrected for atmospheric effects. This saturation is obvious in visible spectral bands, i.e., in the blue, green and even red spectral regions when the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM) reaches then exceeds 100 to 1000 g.m(-3). The validity of several bio-optical semi-analytical models is assessed in the case of highly turbid waters, based on comparisons with outputs of the Hydrolight radiative transfer model. The most suitable models allow to reproduce the observed saturation and. by inversion, to retrieve information on the SPM mass-specific inherent optical properties.

TI  - Assimilating InSAR Maps of Water Vapor to Improve Heavy Rainfall Forecasts: A Case Study With Two Successive Storms
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high resolution precipitable water vapor maps obtained by the Sentinel-1 A synthetic aperture radar (SAR), using the SAR interferometry (InSAR) technique, are here shown to have a positive impact on the performance of severe weather forecasts. A case study of deep convection which affected the city of Adra, Spain, on 6-7 September 2015, is successfully forecasted by the Weather Research and Forecasting model initialized with InSAR data assimilated by the three-dimensional variational technique, with improved space and time distributions of precipitation, as observed by the local weather radar and rain gauge. This case study is exceptional because it consisted of two severe events 12hr apart, with a timing that allows for the assimilation of both the ascending and descending satellite images, each for the initialization of each event. The same methodology applied to the network of Global Navigation Satellite System observations in Iberia, at the same times, failed to reproduce observed precipitation, although it also improved, in a more modest way, the forecast skill. The impact of precipitable water vapor data is shown to result from a direct increment of convective available potential energy, associated with important adjustments in the low-level wind field, favoring its release in deep convection. It is suggested that InSAR images, complemented by dense Global Navigation Satellite System data, may provide a new source of water vapor data for weather forecasting, since their sampling frequency could reach the subdaily scale by merging different SAR platforms, or when future geosynchronous radar missions become operational.

TI  - Estimation of suspended particulate matter in turbid coastal waters: application to hyperspectral satellite imagery
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - An empirical algorithm is proposed to estimate suspended particulate matter (SPM) ranging from 0.675 to 25.7 mg L-1 in the turbid Pearl River estuary (PRE). Comparisons between model predicted and in situ measured SPM resulted in R(2)s of 0.97 and 0.88 and mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs) of 23.96% and 29.69% by using the calibration and validation data sets, respectively The developed algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy when compared with existing ones for turbid coastal waters. The diurnal dynamics of SPM was revealed by applying the proposed algorithm to reflectance data collected by a moored buoy in the PRE. The established algorithm was implemented to Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) data and the distribution pattern of SPM in the PRE was elucidated. Validation of HICO-derived reflectance data by using concurrent MODIS/Aqua data as a benchmark indicated their reliability. Factors influencing variability of SPM in the PRE were analyzed. which implicated the combined effects of wind, tide. rainfall. and circulation as the cause.

TI  - A potential microRNA regulation of immune-related genes in invertebrate haemocytes
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Bivalve mollusks have been employed as sentinel organisms in environmental health programs due to their sedentary lifestyle, filter-feeding behavior and their ability to accumulate pathogens or toxin molecules inside tissues. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can be up taken and bioaccumulated, and due to sensibility of mollusks to these EDCs, being able to cause immune alterations. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) were shown to be involved in modulation and buffering developmental processes against the effects of environmental alterations and pathogenic microorganisms. Moreover, it is suggested that this miRNAs are incorporated into the estrogen-controlled immune network, regulating mechanism of immune gene expression at the posttranscriptional level, modulating immune responses as phagocytosis, redox reaction and apoptosis in bivalve haemocytes. Thus, miRNAs can be used as biomarkers that specifically elucidate immunotoxic effects caused by exogenous biotic or abiotic factors, and can act as useful tools in integrated monitoring environmental health programs. In this review, we aim to describe the investigations that have been carried out on miRNAs in bivalve mollusks, especially those associated with immune responses against infectious agents and xenobiotic exposure.

TI  - Spatial prediction of soil water retention in a Paramo landscape: Methodological insight into machine learning using random forest
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils of Paramo ecosystems regulate the water supply to many Andean populations. In spite of being a necessary input to distributed hydrological models, regionalized soil water retention data from these areas are currently not available. The investigated catchment of the Quinuas River has a size of about 90 km(2) and comprises parts of the Cajas National Park in southern Ecuador. It is dominated by soils with high organic carbon contents, which display characteristics of volcanic influence. Besides providing spatial predictions of soil water retention at the catchment scale, the study presents a detailed methodological insight to model setup and validation of the underlying machine learning approach with random forest. The developed models performed well predicting volumetric water contents between 0.55 and 0.9 cm(3) cm(-3). Among the predictors derived from a digital elevation model and a Landsat image, altitude and several vegetation indices provided the most information content. The regionalized maps show particularly low water retention values in the lower Quinuas valley, which go along with high prediction uncertainties. Due to the small size of the dataset, mineral soils could not be separated from organic soils, leading to a high prediction uncertainty in the lower part of the valley, where the soils are influenced by anthropogenic land use.

TI  - Limitations to winter and spring photosynthesis of a Rocky Mountain subalpine forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperate and boreal conifer forests are dormant for many months during the cold season. Climate change is altering the winter environment, with increased temperature, altered precipitation, and earlier snowmelt in many locations. If significant enough, these changes may alter patterns of dormancy and activity of evergreens. Here we studied the factors limiting photosynthetic activity of a high-elevation subalpine forest that has undergone substantial warming in recent decades. We tested the hypothesis that this warming has been significant enough to allow photosynthesis during sunny warm days in winter. Using thermal imagery, we found that foliage in winter was sometimes near the temperature optimum for photosynthesis, but no net carbon gain occurred for most of the cold season. Water transport was limited by blockage of sap transport by frozen boles, but not by frozen soils. Foliar carotenoid content was much higher during winter, driven largely by increases in the pool size of the photoprotective xanthophyll cycle. There was no seasonal change in chlorophyll or lutein content. Net carbon uptake began only as boles thawed, with no difference in timing among tree species, and the spring increase in canopy-level photosynthetic capacity occurred before sap transport was detected. The seasonality of gross primary productivity (GPP) was strongly linked to seasonality of xanthophyll cycle deepoxidation state in all species. Seasonality of GPP was detectable with two metrics of canopy color - the Green Chromatic Coordinate and Green-Red Vegetation Index (a proxy for the newly proposed MODIS-based chlorophyll/carotenoid index or CCI). Both indices were significantly correlated with GPP. Together these results indicate the potential for airborne or near-surface remote sensing of leaf color to serve as a metric of photosynthetic activity in evergreen forests, and to monitor physiological changes associated with the progression in and out of winter dormancy.

TI  - Stress determination by <i>in situ</i> X-ray diffraction - Influence of water vapour on the Zircaloy-4 oxidation at high temperature
T2  - CORROSION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A key parameter for the understanding the effect of water vapour on the oxidation mechanism is the determination of the stress level in the zirconia scale formed on Zircaloy-4 (Zy-4) at the operating temperature. In order to provide an accurate description of the structure and microstructure of the oxide layers, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses have been performed in situ under dry and wet oxidizing environments at high temperature on Zy-4 flat sheet samples. The aim of the present work is to show the influence of water vapour on the stress developed at high temperature in the oxide scale as well as inside the alloy. In situ growth stress determination in the oxide scale has shown that the compressive stress is larger in dry air compared to the wet air environment at 500 degrees C. In wet air, the lower growth stress is due to stress relaxation after the pre-transition stage. This is related to the effect of water vapour on the zirconia chemical state and change in the oxide mechanical properties leading to an earlier scale cracking.

TI  - Assessing the potential impacts of a revised set of on-farm nutrient and sediment 'basic' control measures for reducing agricultural diffuse pollution across England
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for improved abatement of agricultural diffuse water pollution represents cause for concern throughout the world. A critical aspect in the design of on-farm intervention programmes concerns the potential technical cost-effectiveness of packages of control measures. The European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive (WFD) calls for Programmes of Measures (PoMs) to protect freshwater environments and these comprise 'basic' (mandatory) and 'supplementary' (incentivised) options. Recent work has used measure review, elicitation of stakeholder attitudes and a process-based modelling framework to identify a new alternative set of 'basic' agricultural sector control measures for nutrient and sediment abatement across England. Following an initial scientific review of 708 measures, 90 were identified for further consideration at an industry workshop and 63 had industry support. Optimisation modelling was undertaken to identify a shortlist of measures using the Demonstration Test Catchments as sentinel agricultural landscapes. Optimisation selected 12 measures relevant to livestock or arable systems. Model simulations of 95% implementation of these 12 candidate 'basic' measures, in addition to business-as-usual, suggested reductions in the national agricultural nitrate load of 2.5%, whilst corresponding reductions in phosphorus and sediment were 11.9% and 5.6%, respectively. The total cost of applying the candidate 'basic' measures across the whole of England was estimated to be 450 pound million per annum, which is equivalent to 52 pound per hectare of agricultural land.

TI  - Lava delta deformation as a proxy for submarine slope instability
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The instability of lava deltas is a recurrent phenomenon affecting volcanic islands, which can potentially cause secondary events such as littoral explosions (due to interactions between hot lava and seawater) and tsunamis. It has been shown that Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a powerful technique to forecast the collapse of newly emplaced lava deltas. This work goes further, demonstrating that the monitoring of lava deltas is a successful strategy by which to observe the long-term deformation of subaerial-submarine landslide systems on unstable volcanic flanks. In this paper, displacement measurements derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery were used to detect lava delta instability at Stromboli volcano (Italy). Recent flank eruptions (2002-2003, 2007 and 2014) affected the Sciara del Fuoco (SdF) depression, created a "stacked" lava delta, which overlies a pre-existing scar produced by a submarine-subaerial tsunamigenic landslide that occurred on 30 December 2002. Space-borne X-band COSMO-SkyMED (CSK) and C-band SENTINEL-1A (SNT) SAR data collected between February 2010 and October 2016 were processed using the SqueeSAR algorithm. The obtained ground displacement maps revealed the differential ground motion of the lava delta in both CSK and SNT datasets, identifying a stable area (characterized by less than 2 mm/y in both datasets) within the northern sector of the SdF and an unstable area (characterized by velocity fields on the order of 30 mm/y and 160 mm/y in the CSK and SNT datasets, respectively) in the central sector of the SdF. The slope stability of the offshore part of the SdF, as reconstructed based on a recently performed multibeam bathymetric survey, was evaluated using a 3D Limit Equilibrium Method (LEM). In all the simulations, Factor of Safety (F) values between 0.9 and 1.1 always characterized the submarine slope between the coastline and -250 m a.s.l. The critical surfaces for all the search volumes corresponded to the 30 December 2002 landslide, which involved the lava delta and its surrounding areas. InSAR data provided the post-effusive deformation field after the 2007 and 2014 flank eruptions, whereas LEM results highlighted that the accumulation of lava flows on the prone-to-failure SdF submarine slope is the main cause of the detected lava delta deformation. Lava delta instability, measured also at Pico Island (Azores) and Kilauea volcano (Hawaii), is evidence of the broader spectrum of instability phenomena that take place in the coastal or submarine area of the flanks of the volcanoes. At Kilauea, past lava deltas have moved faster than the surrounding slope and the recorded movements relate only to the collapses of the deltas themselves, producing rapid mass wasting near the coasts. In contrast, at Stromboli and Pico, lava deltas move at the same velocity as the surrounding slope. In these cases, the displacement at lava deltas can be considered as a proxy for the deformation of submarine slides. There are very few studies dealing with lava delta deformation, thus, the analysis presented in this work will benefit the monitoring of submarine slopes in other prone-to-failure coastal or island volcanic systems which have the potential to generate tsunamis.

TI  - Simulation of the Spatio-temporally Resolved PM<sub>2.5</sub> Aerosol Mass Concentration over the Inland Plain of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Region
T2  - Huanjing Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, haze pollution in China is becoming increasingly serious, especially in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. In order to identify the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of PM2.5 aerosol mass concentration in the region, this study selected the inland plain of the Beijing-Tranjin-Hebei region as the research area, and used MODIS AOD as the main predictor in a mixed effects model to establish the daily relationship of AOD-PM2.5 in the study area, from 2013 to 2014. The model was validated by a ten-fold cross validation method. The results showed that the correlation between AOD-PM2.5 can be improved by daily calibration of the mixed effects model (R-2 = 0.78); the cross-validated R-2 was 0.70, and RMSE and RPE were 20.80 mu g.m(-3) and 28.76%, respectively. Considering the importance of unbaised PM2.5, predictions, the correction factors calculated from the surface PM2.5 measurements were applied to correct the biases in the predicted annual average PM2.5 concentrations introduced by non-stochastic missing AOD measurements. The results showed that the annual average concentration of PM2.5 in the study area was higher than 75 mu g.m(-3), and the spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentration was higher in the southern and western regions, and lower in the northern and eastern regions. These results suggest that the mixed effects model can be used to monitor ground PM2.5, and also provide a scientific basis for the control of atmospheric particulate pollution in the region.

TI  - Physical assessment of coastal vulnerability under enhanced land subsidence in Semarang, Indonesia, using multi-sensor satellite data
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Research has been conducted in Semarang, Indonesia, to assess coastal vulnerability under enhanced land subsidence using multi sensor satellite data, including the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band SAR (PALSAR), Landsat TM, IKONOS, and TOPEX/Poseidon. A coastal vulnerability index (CVI) was constructed to estimate the level of vulnerability of a coastline approximately 48.68 km in length using seven physical variables, namely, land subsidence, relative sea level change, coastal geomorphology, coastal slope, shoreline change, mean tidal range, and significant wave height. A comparison was also performed between a CVI calculated using seven parameters and a CVI using six parameters, the latter of which excludes the land subsidence parameter, to determine the effects of land subsidence during the coastal vulnerability assessment. This study showed that the accuracy of coastal vulnerability was increased 40% by adding the land subsidence factor (i.e., CVI 6 parameters = 53%, CVI 7 parameters = 93%). Moreover, Kappa coefficient indicated very good agreement (0.90) for CVI 7 parameters and fair agreement (0.3) for CVI 6 parameters. The results indicate that the area of very high vulnerability increased by 7% when land subsidence was added. Hence, using the CVI calculation including land subsidence parameters, the very high vulnerability area is determined to be 20% of the total coastline or 9.7 km of the total 48.7 km of coastline. This study proved that land subsidence has significant influence on coastal vulnerability in Semarang. (C) 2018 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Stand-alone uncertainty characterization of GLEAM, GLDAS and MOD16 evapotranspiration products using an extended triple collocation approach
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An optimal use of the global scale actual evapotranspiration (AET) products for various hydro-meteorological applications requires a systematic characterization of their uncertainties. This study presents the first application of an extended triple collocation (TC) approach to provide mutually uncorrelated absolute and relative error structure among three readily available AET (MOD16, GLEAM, and GLDAS) products on the point and spatial scale within the extent of Asia. The physical evaluation results of GLEAM, GLDAS and MOD16 exhibited reasonable accuracy compared to the in-situ AET with mean Index of Agreement > 0.71, 0.59 and 0.58, respectively, thereby yielding Root Mean Square Error between similar to 4-13 mm/8 day over nine AsiaFlux sites representing forest, rice paddy, and grassland biomes. Theoretical uncertainty assessment of four AET dataset combinations revealed that an average similar to 1.5-5.5 mm/8 day random error was contributed from in-situ AET, thereby reducing the accuracy of other datasets. GLEAM performed consistently better with least absolute and relative uncertainties over forest compared with rice paddy and grassland surfaces where GLDAS had almost similar errors as those obtained from GLEAM, while MOD16 showed high uncertainties over all vegetation conditions. Interestingly, all four datasets had large relative uncertainties ( > 25%) for low vegetation compared to the errors of tall canopies. A spatially merged product generated from the least uncertainties showed better agreement in order of GLDAS > GLEAM > MOD16 over 47%, 42% and 11% of the study area. Overall, the application of extended TC approach on the quality of three AET products is a step forward to develop the merged near real-time accurate AET dataset by processing of theoretical and systematic uncertainties in the current AET algorithms.

TI  - Potential of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence to estimate transpiration in a temperate forest
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - By utilizing continuous measurements of water fluxes and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) over the entire growing season, we exploit the potential of broadband SIF in predicting plant transpiration (T) in a temperate forest. After reconstructing the full SIF spectrum from the selected absorption lines and simulations from the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) model, linear regression (LR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) models are used to analyze the relation between T and combinations of different SIF bands. We find that SIF emissions in the near-infrared spectrum (at 720 nm, 740 nm and 760 nm) are more sensitive to T than SIF emissions in the red spectrum (at 685 nm and 687 nm). While conditions such as light and heat stress decouple the relationship between single-band SIF and T, the combination of different SIF bands allows the retrieval of reliable T estimates even in these conditions. Overall, we find that the use of SIF as a proxy for T yields estimates that are at least as accurate as those from traditional transpiration models such as the Penman-Monteith equation, which are input demanding and complex to apply to in situ and satellite data. Specifically, we find that (1) the SIF-T relationship deteriorates when Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), vapor pressure deficit and air temperature exceed biological optimal thresholds; (2) a high leaf area index exerts a negative impact on the SIF-T correlation due to increasing scattering and (re)absorption of the SIF signal; (3) the SIF-T relationship does not change depending on the observation time during the day; and (4) temporal aggregation to days further enhanced the SIF-T correlations. Altogether, our results provide the first ground based evidence that SIF emission has potential to be a close predictor of plant transpiration, especially when a combination of different SIF bands is considered.

TI  - Management strategies for coastal erosion problems in west Africa: Analysis, issues, and constraints drawn from the examples of Senegal and Benin
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In West Africa, coastal erosion remains a problem for the socio-economic development of the coastal zone. Case studies in Senegal and Benin indicate a strong intensification of coastal erosion, in relation to human influence, as shown by the analysis of shoreline change rates from satellite data. The "Langue deBarbaric," a sand spit bounding the mouth of the Senegal River delta in the Saint-Louis Region, Senegal, is relatively densely inhabited and developed. The spit was artificially breached in 2003 to alleviate potential river flooding that threatened the historical city of Saint-Louis. The analysis covers two periods: the pre-breach period (1984-2003) characterized by sectors alternating between erosion and accretion, and the post-breach period (2003-2016) indicating a generalization of the erosion process, with a noteworthy average rate of -3.72 m/yr affecting the entire spit, strongly destabilized by the artificial breach. In Benin, shoreline evolution is equally affected by human interventions. Following the construction of the Nangbeto Dam on the Mono River, the "Bouche du Roi," outlet of this river, has been characterized by marked instability, with an eastward migration exceeding 700 m/yr. Other human alterations of the coastal system include the installment of major seaports and groins that have resulted in some erosion downdrift near Cotonou. These examples highlight the limits of governance regarding the coast in West Africa, including adaptation strategies developed at regional, national and local levels, which often produce more setbacks than solutions.

TI  - Coastal erosion and accretion in Kuwait - Problems and management strategies
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Kuwait is a coastal country with 496 km coast. It is located in the Arabian Peninsula, at the north-western part of Arabian Gulf. Many coastal infrastructures are close to high water line and hence attract erosion, especially in the south. The northern part is significantly dominated by sedimentation. Remote sensing is used to identify the hot spot of erosion and accretion. Kuwait does not have good quality natural stones and needs to be imported from other countries for any coastal structure project and is expensive. Hence innovative coastal protection solutions, which are cost competitive, environment friendly, easy to fabricate, install and reorient, are needed. Geo-bags, filled with sand are field tested. New type of floating breakwaters are developed which has reduced width compared to conventional pontoon breakwaters, by introducing skirt walls at the keel of the floating breakwater. It is found that material saving of more than 60%-75% is possible when compared to rubble mound offshore breakwaters. Many coastal infrastructures in the northern part of Kuwait are suffering due to sedimentation. Detailed field, lab and numerical modeling studies were carried out to understand the sedimentation problem and for providing solutions to reduce the degree of accretion in the marinas and seawater intake structures. Work is in progress for rolling out the Integrated Coastal Zone Management Plan for Kuwait. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Developmental signature, synaptic connectivity and neurotransmission are conserved between vertebrate hair cells and tunicate coronal cells
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In tunicates, the coronal organ represents a sentinel checking particle entrance into the pharynx. The organ differentiates from an anterior embryonic area considered a proto-placode. For their embryonic origin, morphological features and function, coronal sensory cells have been hypothesized to be homologues to vertebrate hair cells. However, vertebrate hair cells derive from a posterior placode. This contradicts one of the principle historical criteria for homology, similarity of position, which could be taken as evidence against coronal cells/hair cells homology. In the tunicates Ciona intestinalis and C. robusta, we found that the coronal organ expresses genes (Atoh, Notch, Delta-like, Hairy-b, and Musashi) characterizing vertebrate neural and hair cell development. Moreover, coronal cells exhibit a complex synaptic connectivity pattern, and express neurotransmitters (Glu, ACh, GABA, 5-HT, and catecholamines), or enzymes for their synthetic machinery, involved in hair cell activity. Lastly, coronal cells express the Trpa gene, which encodes an ion channel expressed in hair cells. These data lead us to hypothesize a model in which competence to make secondary mechanoreceptors was initially broadly distributed through placode territories, but has become confined to different placodes during the evolution of the vertebrate and tunicate lineages.

TI  - Exploring Drivers of Forest Degradation and Fragmentation in Sudan: The Case of Erawashda Forest and its Surrounding Community
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sudan is a hot spot for forest degradation. Efforts to maintain what remains of its forests should be of the highest priority. However, precise information on its forests' current state is very limited. Therefore, in order to effectively intervene in support of existing resources, it is important to have a better understanding of processes taking place in the country and impacting those resources. The objectives of this study are to quantify the consequences of land use and land cover (LULC) changes on forest degradation and fragmentation and to analyze the anthropogenic factors causing it, taking Erawashda Forest, eastern Sudan, as an example. The study utilized a series of Landsat imageries, field surveys and interviews with informants to analyze the decrease in forest cover. The years between 1973 and 2015 saw a 16.9% and 5.4% increase in bare land and large-scale mechanized agriculture respectively. During the same period there was a 37% decrease in dense forest cover and a 20% increase in light forest cover. The trajectory analysis showed that all LULC categories are subjected to very rapid changes from one class to another throughout the period of the study and the most dynamic class is light forest cover. Computed fragmentation indices showed that large core is the dominant category. Key informants identified the main factors of degradation and fragmentation as the expansion of mechanized rain-fed agriculture, felling of trees and wood cutting, bad grazing activities, and construction of infrastructure. Information garnered from this study can provide a good basis for forest rehabilitation programs and can also be used for developing proper management plans that take into account the needs of the communities utilizing the forest.

TI  - Methods for sandy land detection based on multispectral remote sensing data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sandification is becoming a serious threat to the sustainability of human habitation. The potential of remote sensing in sandy land detection has been previously demonstrated, but transitional sandy land is difficult to detect because of vegetation cover. The aim of this study, therefore, was to propose methods for sandy land detection based on mixed pixel decomposition and soil particle composition to determine the effects of vegetation coverage and transitional sandy land, using Zhenglan Banner of China as the study area and GF-1 multispectral images as the main data. Results showed that the pixel purity index (PPI) is a viable indicator for pure endmember extraction for sandy land detection via remote sensing. A linear spectral unmixing (LSU) model was established to distinguish sandy land coverage from vegetation, alkaline land, etc. Results showed that without considering the vegetation proportion, when the endmember proportion of sandy land accounted for > 50% of the total (except for the vegetation), a pixel would be detected as sandy land, its extraction accuracy was verified to be 86.42% by field data. The results derived from soil particle composition showed that silt was the best indicator for sandy land detection, and clay was secondary to it. Through Partial Least Squares Analysis (PLSA), the percentage of silt content was determined as the dependent variable; 8676 and 8774 were selected as independent variables to establish the inversion model according to the model effect weights and VIP value. The minimum Prediction Residual Error Sum of Squares (PRESS) was 0.824 tested by leave one out cross validation. The threshold of silt content was determined finally as 3.5%, namely, when the silt content was < 3.5%, the pixel would be classified as sandy land, its extraction accuracy was 80.86% that was verified using the same field data.

TI  - Coaxial nanowires as plasmon-mediated remote nanosensors
T2  - NANOSCALE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports on the plasmon-mediated remote Raman sensing promoted by specially designed coaxial nanowires. This unusual geometry for Raman study is based on the separation, by several micrometres, of the excitation laser spot, on one tip of the nanowire, and the Raman detection at the other tip. The very weak efficiency of Raman emission makes it challenging in a remote configuration. For the proof-of-concept, we designed coaxial nanowires consisting of a gold core to propagate surface plasmon polaritons and a Raman-emitting shell of poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene). The success of the fabrication was demonstrated by correlating, for the same single nanowire, a morphological analysis by electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy analysis. Importantly for probing the remote-Raman effect, the original hard template-based process allows one to control the location of the polymer shell all along the nanowire, or only close to one or the two nanowire tips. Such all-in-one single nanowires could have applications in the remote detection of photo-degradable substances and for exploring 1D nanosources for integrated photonic and plasmonic systems.

T2  - BMC research notes
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Plan of Information on Acute Respiratory Infections in Catalonia (PIDIRAC) included the surveillance of severe hospitalized cases of laboratory-confirmed influenza (SHCLCI) in 2009. The objective of this study was to determine the clinical, epidemiological and virological features of SHCLCI recorded in 12 sentinel hospitals during five influenza seasons.RESULTS: From a sample of SHCLCI recorded during the 5 influenza epidemics seasons from 2010-2011 to 2014-2015, Cases were confirmed by PCR and/or viral isolation in cell cultures from respiratory samples. A total of 1400 SHCLCI were recorded, 33% required ICU admission and 12% died. The median age of cases was 61years (range 0-101years); 70.5% were unvaccinated; 80.4% received antiviral treatment (in 79.6 and 24% of cases within 48h after hospital admission and the onset of symptoms, respectively); influenza virus A [37.9% A (H1N1)pdm09, 29.3% A (H3N2)] was identified in 87.7% of cases. Surveillance of SHCLCI provides an estimate of the severity of seasonal influenza epidemics and the identification and characterization of at-risk groups in order to facilitate preventive measures such as vaccination and early antiviral treatment.

TI  - Recent dynamic changes on Fleming Glacier after the disintegration of Wordie Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic Peninsula is one of the world's regions most affected by climate change. Several ice shelves have retreated, thinned or completely disintegrated during recent decades, leading to acceleration and increased calving of their tributary glaciers. Wordie Ice Shelf, located in Marguerite Bay at the south-western side of the Antarctic Peninsula, completely disintegrated in a series of events between the 1960s and the late 1990s. We investigate the longterm dynamics (1994-2016) of Fleming Glacier after the disintegration of Wordie Ice Shelf by analysing various multisensor remote sensing data sets. We present a dense time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) surface velocities that reveals a rapid acceleration of Fleming Glacier in 2008 and a phase of further gradual acceleration and upstream propagation of high velocities in 2010-2011. The timing in acceleration correlates with strong upwelling events of warm circumpolar deep water (CDW) into Wordie Bay, most likely leading to increased submarine melt. This, together with continuous dynamic thinning and a deep subglacial trough with a retrograde bed slope close to the terminus probably, has induced unpinning of the glacier tongue in 2008 and gradual grounding line retreat between 2010 and 2011. Our data suggest that the glacier's grounding line had retreated by similar to 6-9 km between 1996 and 2011, which caused similar to 56 km(2) of the glacier tongue to go afloat. The resulting reduction in buttressing explains a median speedup of similar to 1.3 m d(-1) (similar to 27 %) between 2008 and 2011, which we observed along a centre line extending between the grounding line in 1996 and similar to 16 km upstream. Current median ice thinning rates (2011-2014) along profiles in areas below 1000m altitude range between similar to 2.6 to 3.2m a(-1) and are similar to 70% higher than between 2004 and 2008. Our study shows that Fleming Glacier is far away from approaching a new equilibrium and that the glacier dynamics are not primarily controlled by the loss of the former ice shelf anymore. Currently, the tongue of Fleming Glacier is grounded in a zone of bedrock elevation between similar to -400 and -500 m. However, about 3-4 km upstream modelled bedrock topography indicates a retrograde bed which transitions into a deep trough of up to similar to -1100m at similar to 10 km upstream. Hence, this endangers upstream ice masses, which can significantly increase the contribution of Fleming Glacier to sea level rise in the future.

TI  - Landsat TM/ETM<SUP>+</SUP> and machine-learning algorithms for limnological studies and algal bloom management of inland lakes
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accumulating remotely sensed and ground-measured data and improvements in data mining such as machine-learning techniques open new opportunities for monitoring and managing algal blooms over large spatial scales. The goal of this study was to test the accuracy of remotely sensed algal biomass determined with machine-learning algorithms and Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery. We used chlorophyll-a concentration data from the 2007 National Lake Assessment (NLA) (lake N = 1157) by the US Environmental Protection Agency to train and test Landsat TM/ETM+ algorithms. Results showed significant improvements in chlorophyll-a retrieval accuracy using machine-learning algorithms compared with traditional empirical models using linear regression. Specifically, the results from boosted regression trees and random forest explained, respectively, 45.8% and 44.5% of chlorophyll-a variation. Multiple linear regression could only explain 39.8% of chlorophyll-a variation. The chlorophyll-a concentration derived from Landsat TM/ETM+ and a simple to use Google Earth Engine application, accurately characterized a 2009 algal bloom in western Lake Erie to show the model worked well for the analysis of temporal changes in algal conditions. Compared with chlorophyll-a data from the NLA, chlorophyll-a measurements with our Landsat TM/ETM+ model had almost the same correlation with lake's total phosphorus concentrations, especially when using multiple Landsat images. Therefore, Landsat measurements of chlorophyll-a have value for ecological assessments and managing algal problems in lakes. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - In-field and in-vitro study of the moss <i>Leptodictyum riparium</i> as bioindicator of toxic metal pollution in the aquatic environment: Ultrastructural damage, oxidative stress and HSP70 induction
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the effects of toxic metal pollution in the highly contaminated Sarno River (South Italy), by using the aquatic moss Leptodictyum riparium in bags at 3 representative sites of the river. Biological effects were assessed by metal bioaccumulation, ultra structural changes, oxidative stress, as Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production and Glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity, as well as Heat Shock Proteins 70 (HSP70s) induction. The results showed that L. riparium is a valuable bioindicator for toxic metal pollution of water ecosystem, accumulating different amounts of toxic metals from the aquatic environment. Toxic metal pollution caused severe ultrastructural damage, as well as increased ROS production and induction of GST and HSP70s, in the samples exposed at the polluted sites. To assess the role and the effect of toxic metals on L. riparium, were also cultured in vitro with Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn at the same concentrations as measured at the 3 sites. Ultrastructure, ROS, GST, and HSP70s resulted severely affected by toxic metals. Based on our findings, we confirm L. riparium as a model organism in freshwater biomonitoring surveys, and GST and HSP70s as promising biomarkers of metal toxicity.

TI  - Increased aerosol content in the atmosphere over Ukraine during summer 2010
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we assessed the influence of biomass burning during forest fires throughout summer (1 June-31 August) 2010 on aerosol abundance, dynamics, and its properties over Ukraine. We also considered influences and effects over neighboring countries: European Russia, Estonia, Belarus, Poland, Moldova, and Romania.We used MODIS satellite instrument data to study fire distribution. We also used ground-based remote measurements from the international sun photometer network AERONET plus MODIS and CALIOP satellite instrument data to determine the aerosol content and optical properties in the atmosphere over Eastern Europe. We applied the HYSPLIT model to investigate atmospheric dynamics and model pathways of particle transport.As with previous studies, we found that the highest aerosol content was observed over Moscow in the first half of August 2010 due to the proximity of the most active fires. Large temporal variability of the aerosol content with pronounced pollution peaks during 7-17 August was observed at the Ukrainian (Kyiv and Sevastopol), Belarusian (Minsk), Estonian (Toravere), and Romanian (Bucharest) AERONET sites. We analyzed aerosol spatiotemporal distribution over Ukraine using MODIS AOD 550 nm and further compared with the Kyiv AERONET site sun photometer measurements; we also compared CALIOP AOD 532 nm with MODIS AOD data.We analyzed vertical distribution of aerosol extinction at 532 nm, retrieved from CALIOP measurements, for the territory of Ukraine at locations where high AOD values were observed during intense fires. We estimated the influence of fires on the spectral single scattering albedo, size distribution, and complex refractive indices using Kyiv AERONET measurements performed during summer 2010.In this study we showed that the maximum AOD in the atmosphere over Ukraine recorded in summer 2010 was caused by particle transport from the forest fires in Russia. Those fires caused the highest AOD 500 nm over the Kyiv site, which in August 2010 exceeded multiannual monthly mean for the entire observational period (2008-2016, excluding 2010) by a factor of 2.2. Also, the influence of fires resulted in a change of the particle microphysics in the polluted regions.

TI  - Space-based vegetation health for wheat yield modeling and prediction in Australia
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An early warning of crop losses in response to weather fluctuations helps farmers, governments, traders, and policy makers better monitor global food supply and demand and identifies nations in need of aid. This paper discusses the utility of vegetation health (VH) indices, derived from the advance very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS), as a proxy for modeling Australian wheat from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) operational afternoon polar-orbiting satellites. These models are used to assess wheat production and to provide an early warning of drought-related losses. The NOAA AVHRR-and VIIRS-based VH indices were used to model wheat yield in Australia. A strong correlation (>= 0.7) between wheat yield and VH indices was found during the critical reproductive stage of development (enhanced crops sensitivity to weather), which starts 2 to 3 weeks before and ends 2 to 3 weeks after wheat heading. The results of modeling and independent testing proved that the VH indices (especially those estimating thermal and health conditions) are a good proxy providing 1 to 2 months before harvest yield prediction (with 3% to 6% error). With the new generation of NOAA-20 operational polar-orbiting satellites, launched in November 2017, the VH method will be improved considerably both in an advanced crop/pasture prediction, spatial resolution, and accuracy.

TI  - An assessment of aerosol optical properties from remote-sensing observations and regional chemistry-climate coupled models over Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric aerosols modify the radiative budget of the Earth due to their optical, microphysical and chemical properties, and are considered one of the most uncertain climate forcing agents. In order to characterise the uncertainties associated with satellite and modelling approaches to represent aerosol optical properties, mainly aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Angstrom exponent (AE), their representation by different remote-sensing sensors and regional online coupled chemistry-climate models over Europe are evaluated. This work also characterises whether the inclusion of aerosolradiation (ARI) or/and aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) help improve the skills of modelling outputs.Two case studies were selected within the EuMetChem COST Action ES1004 framework when important aerosol episodes in 2010 all over Europe took place: a Russian wild-fire episode and a Saharan desert dust outbreak that covered most of the Mediterranean Sea. The model data came from different regional air-quality-climate simulations performed by working group 2 of EuMetChem, which differed according to whether ARI or ACI was included or not. The remote-sensing data came from three different sensors: MODIS, OMI and SeaWIFS. The evaluation used classical statistical metrics to first compare satellite data versus the ground-based instrument network (AERONET) and then to evaluate model versus the observational data (both satellite and ground-based data).Regarding the uncertainty in the satellite representation of AOD, MODIS presented the best agreement with the AERONET observations compared to other satellite AOD observations. The differences found between remote-sensing sensors highlighted the uncertainty in the observations, which have to be taken into account when evaluating models. When modelling results were considered, a common trend for underestimating high AOD levels was observed. For the AE, models tended to underestimate its variability, except when considering a sectional approach in the aerosol representation. The modelling results showed better skills when ARI+ACI interactions were included; hence this improvement in the representation of AOD (above 30% in the model error) and AE (between 20 and 75 %) is important to provide a better description of aerosol-radiation-cloud interactions in regional climate models.

TI  - Evaluation of intraoperative touch imprint cytology on axillary sentinel lymph nodes in invasive breast carcinomas, a retrospective study of 1227 patients comparing sensitivity in the different tumor subtypes
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIntraoperative evaluation of the axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with breast carcinoma reduces the need of re-operations in cases where an axillary completion lymph node dissection (CLND) is indicated. Different methods have been used to determine the SLN status intraoperatively, e.g. frozen section histology (FS) and touch imprint cytology (TIC). The sensitivity of intraoperative TIC examination on SLN is not consistent between different studies and varies according to different tumor histologic subtypes, tumor size and the age of the patient. The aim of this study was to describe the specificity and sensitivity of TIC and to compare TIC sensitivity in the different histological subtypes of breast carcinoma.MethodsA retrospective review was performed of 1227 consecutive clinically node negative breast cancer patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) with intraoperative TIC between the years 2003 and 2008. The SLN was bisected and stained using the May-Grun-wald-Giemsa method and immunocytochemically with the antibody MNF-116.ResultsThe overall sensitivity of the TIC test was 68.6% and the specificity was 99.8%. There was no statistically significant difference between the detection of SLN metastases from ductal carcinoma versus lobular carcinoma. The sensitivity improved over the period of the study.ConclusionTIC is highly specific with an acceptable overall sensitivity. The sensitivity increased under the period of the study and it was higher in cases with larger size of the primary tumor. There was no difference in TIC sensitivity between the different histological subtypes.

TI  - Development of a mouse model for the visual and quantitative assessment of lymphatic trafficking and function by <i>in vivo</i> imaging
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Methods for quantitative analysis of long distance lymphatic transport of nanoparticles in live animals are yet to be established. We established a mouse model for analysis of time-dependent transport just beneath the abdominal skin to investigate lymph node-to-lymph node trafficking by in vivo imaging. For this purpose, popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs) as well as efferent and afferent lymphatic vessels, marginal veins, and feeding blood vessels were surgically resected to change the lymphatic flow from footpad injections. Using this model, we observed a novel lymphatic flow from the footpad to the proper axillary lymph node (ALN) via the inguinal lymph node (ILN). This drainage pathway was maintained over 12 weeks. Time-dependent transportation of 1,1'-dioctadecyltetramethyl indotricarbocyanine iodide-labelled liposomes from the footpad to the ILN was successfully quantified by an in vivo imaging system. Moreover, congestion and development of a new collateral lymphatic route was visualised under a lymphedema status. Histological analysis of abdominal skin tissues of this model revealed that PLN resection had no effect on the abdominal lymphatic system between the ILN and ALN. These data indicate that this model might be useful to clarify the mechanisms of lymphedema and study direct transportation of lymph or other substances between lymph nodes.

TI  - Taguchi-fuzzy multi-response optimization in fly cutting process and applying in the actual hobbing process
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL AND MATERIALS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Applying nanofluid made by adding alumina nanoparticles to industrial oil may reduce the cutting force, friction, and cutting temperature and, from that, improve the tool life in the hobbing process. However, it is difficult to set up the experiment for the actual gear hobbing process, because measuring the cutting force and temperature in the hobbing process is very complicated and expensive. Therefore, a fly hobbing test on the horizontal milling machine was performed to simulate the actual hobbing process.Methods: In this research, the fuzzy theory was combined with the Taguchi method in order to optimize multi-responses of the fly hobbing process as the total cutting force, the force ratio F-z/F-y, the cutting temperature, and the surface roughness.Results: The optimal condition-A1B1C3 (the cutting speed 38 mpm\, the nanoparticle size 20 nm, and concentration 0.5%)-was determined by analyzing the performance index (FRTS) of the fuzzy model. Furthermore, this condition was applied to the actual hobbing process in the FUTU1 Company and compared with the actual conditions of this company and other conditions using the nanolubricant with 0.3% Al2O3, 20 nm. The results show that it can reduce a maximum 39.3% of the flank wear and 59.4% of the crater wear on the hob when using the optimal conditions.Conclusions: The study indicates that the optimal condition determined by using Taguchi-Fuzzy method can be applied in the FUTU1 company with the high efficiency.

TI  - The regional climate model REMO (v2015) coupled with the 1-D freshwater lake model FLake (v1): Fenno-Scandinavian climate and lakes
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The regional climate model REMO was coupled with the FLake lake model to include an interactive treatment of lakes. Using this new version, the Fenno-Scandinavian climate and lake characteristics were studied in a set of 35-year hindcast simulations. Additionally, sensitivity tests related to the parameterization of snow albedo were conducted. Our results show that overall the new model version improves the representation of the Fenno-Scandinavian climate in terms of 2m temperature and precipitation, but the downside is that an existing wintertime cold bias in the model is enhanced. The lake surface water temperature, ice depth and ice season length were analyzed in detail for 10 Finnish, 4 Swedish and 2 Russian lakes and 1 Estonian lake. The results show that the model can reproduce these characteristics with reasonably high accuracy. The cold bias during winter causes overestimation of ice layer thickness, for example, at several of the studied lakes, but overall the values from the model are realistic and represent the lake physics well in a longterm simulation. We also analyzed the snow depth on ice from 10 Finnish lakes and vertical temperature profiles from 5 Finnish lakes and the model results are realistic.

TI  - LakeSST: Lake Skin Surface Temperature in French inland water bodies for 1999-2016 from Landsat archives
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal coverage of the Landsat satellite imagery make it an ideal resource for the monitoring of water temperature over large territories at a moderate spatial and temporal scale at a low cost. We used Landsat 5 and Landsat 7 archive images to create the Lake Skin Surface Temperature (LakeSST) data set, which contains skin water surface temperature data for 442 French water bodies (natural lakes, reservoirs, ponds, gravel pit lakes and quarry lakes) for the period 1999-2016. We assessed the quality of the satellite temperature measurements by comparing them to in situ measurements and taking into account the cool skin and warm layer effects. To estimate these effects and to investigate the theoretical differences between the freshwater and seawater cases, we adapted the COARE 3.0 algorithm to the freshwater environment. We also estimated the warm layer effect using in situ data. At the reservoir of Bimont, the estimated cool skin effect was about -0.3 and -0.6 degrees C most of time, while the warm layer effect at 0.55 m was negligible on average, but could occasionally attain several degrees, and a cool layer was often observed in the night. The overall RMSE of the satellite-derived temperature measurements was about 1.2 degrees C, similar to other applications of satellite images to estimate freshwater surface temperatures. The LakeSST data can be used for studies on the temporal evolution of lake water temperature and for geographical studies of temperature patterns.

TI  - Changing pattern of ice flow and mass balance for glaciers discharging into the Larsen A and B embayments, Antarctic Peninsula, 2011 to 2016
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We analysed volume change and mass balance of outlet glaciers on the northern Antarctic Peninsula over the periods 2011 to 2013 and 2013 to 2016, using high-resolution topographic data from the bistatic interferometric radar satellite mission TanDEM-X. Complementary to the geodetic method that applies DEM differencing, we computed the net mass balance of the main outlet glaciers using the mass budget method, accounting for the difference between the surface mass balance (SMB) and the discharge of ice into an ocean or ice shelf. The SMB values are based on output of the regional climate model RACMO version 2.3p2. To study glacier flow and retrieve ice discharge we generated time series of ice velocity from data from different satellite radar sensors, with radar images of the satellites TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X as the main source. The study area comprises tributaries to the Larsen A, Larsen Inlet and Prince Gustav Channel embayments (region A), the glaciers calving into the Larsen B embayment (region B) and the glaciers draining into the remnant part of the Larsen B ice shelf in Scar Inlet (region C). The glaciers of region A, where the buttressing ice shelf disintegrated in 1995, and of region B (ice shelf break-up in 2002) show continuing losses in ice mass, with significant reduction of losses after 2013. The mass balance numbers for the grounded glacier area of region A are -3.98 +/- 0.33 Gt a(-1) from 2011 to 2013 and -2.38 +/- 0.18 Gt a(-1) from 2013 to 2016. The corresponding numbers for region B are -5.75 +/- 0.45 and -2.32 +/- 0.25 Gt a(-1). The mass balance in region C during the two periods was slightly negative, at -0.54 +/- 0.38 Gt a(-1) and -0.58 +/- 0.25 Gt a(-1). The main share in the overall mass losses of the region was contributed by two glaciers: Drygalski Glacier contributing 61% to the mass deficit of region A, and Hektoria and Green glaciers accounting for 67% to the mass deficit of region B. Hektoria and Green glaciers accelerated significantly in 2010-2011, triggering elevation losses up to 19.5 ma(-1) on the lower terminus during the period 2011 to 2013 and resulting in a mass balance of -3.88 Gt a(-1). Slowdown of calving velocities and reduced calving fluxes in 2013 to 2016 coincided with years in which ice melange and sea ice cover persisted in proglacial fjords and bays during summer.

T2  - Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To standardize the reporting system on hepatitis B in order to improve the quality of monitoring program in Henan province. Methods: A total of 6 sites of Hepatitis B pilot surveillance were selected in Xinzheng of Zhengzhou city, Linzhou of Anyang city, Shanyang district of Jiaozuo city, Shaoling district of Luohe city, Yongcheng of Shangqiu city, Pingqiao district of Xinyang city in Henan province. Subjects under study were those reported hepatitis B cases, from 2012 to 2016. Cases diagnosed in 2011 were chosen as controls. Data on classification of hepatitis B, time that HBsAg became positive and ALT value of the cases were analyzed annually. 5 ml venous blood was collected and anti-HBc IgM confirmed test was made for those suspected acute cases on hepatitis B. Based on the 2016 data from the monitoring system, the incidence of acute hepatitis B in Henan province was estimated. Results: The number of reported hepatitis B cases had declined in 6 sites of Hepatitis B pilot surveillance substantially. A total of 17 436 hepatitis B reported in 2011 but only 2 632 cases were reported in 2016, with a reduction of 84.90%(14 804/17 436) in these six monitoring sites. The number of unclassified hepatitis B cases also dropped sharply. In 2011, 36.87% of the cases were unclassified, but the figure reduced to 0.08% in 2016, from the six sites. The rate on ALT detection also gradually improved. The rate of misdiagnosis on HBV carrier from hepatitis B almost disappeared. From 2013 to 2016, 777 blood samples were collected from six pilot sites. 29.34% (228/777) of the blood samples were tested positive for anti-HBc IgM after confirmed by the hepatitis laboratory of the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Conclusions: Since the development of the pilot surveillance program, the quality of reporting system on hepatitis B had been improved, as well as the accuracy of diagnosis. Rate on the accuracy of reporting on hepatitis B and the methods of testing should be improved at the monitoring sites.

TI  - Tundra landform and vegetation productivity trend maps for the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Arctic tundra landscapes are composed of a complex mosaic of patterned ground features, varying in soil moisture, vegetation composition, and surface hydrology over small spatial scales (10-100 m). The importance of microtopography and associated geomorphic landforms in influencing ecosystem structure and function is well founded, however, spatial data products describing local to regional scale distribution of patterned ground or polygonal tundra geomorphology are largely unavailable. Thus, our understanding of local impacts on regional scale processes (e.g., carbon dynamics) may be limited. We produced two key spatiotemporal datasets spanning the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska (similar to 60,000 km(2)) to evaluate climate-geomorphological controls on arctic tundra productivity change, using (1) a novel 30m classification of polygonal tundra geomorphology and (2) decadal-trends in surface greenness using the Landsat archive (1999-2014). These datasets can be easily integrated and adapted in an array of local to regional applications such as (1) upscaling plot-level measurements (e.g., carbon/energy fluxes), (2) mapping of soils, vegetation, or permafrost, and/or (3) initializing ecosystem biogeochemistry, hydrology, and/or habitat modeling.

TI  - Seasonal abundance, blood meal sources and insecticide susceptibility in major anopheline malaria vectors from southern Mauritania
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malaria is endemic in the southernmost Sahelian zone of Mauritania where the major known mosquito vector is Anopheles arabiensis. Understanding seasonal population dynamics, feeding preferences and insecticide resistance status of these vectors in the area is essential to improve vector control measures implemented at a local scale. Here, malaria vector populations' bionomics is described in two sentinel sites located in the Sahelian zone of Mauritania.Methods: Between September 2014 and December 2016, longitudinal entomological surveys were conducted in Kobeni (15 degrees 49'N, 09 degrees 24'W) and Rosso (16 degrees 30'N; 15 degrees 48'W), two localities in the southern Sahelian zone of Mauritania. Adult mosquitoes were collected using indoor pyrethrum spray catch (PSC). Morphological and PCR-based methods were used to identify the species, detect Plasmodium parasites and analyze blood meals in individual mosquitoes. WHO insecticide susceptibility tests were performed with malathion (5%), bendiocarb (0.1%), permethrin (0.75%) and deltamethrin (0.05%) using female An. gambiae (s.l.) reared from larval and pupal collections from natural breeding sites.Results: A total of 2702 Anopheles mosquitoes were collected by PSC during the study period comprising 2291 Anopheles gambiae (s.l.), 376 Anopheles rufipes and 35 Anopheles pharoensis. In Rosso, all mosquitoes from the An. gambiae (s.l.) complex were molecularly identified as An. arabiensis (n = 455/455, 100%). Anopheles pharoensis represented 2.5% (n = 35/1420) of the specimens collected by PSC in Rosso. In Kobeni, An. arabiensis was dominant (n = 278/301, 92.3%) and occurred together with Anopheles coluzzii (n = 18/301, 6%) and An. gambiae (s.s.) (n = 3/301, 1%). Two An. coluzzii x An. arabiensis hybrids were also detected (0.7%) in Kobeni, and An. rufipes was the only other Anopheles species found resting indoors (n = 376/1277, 29.4%). There was an average of 5.6 and 3.6 indoor resting female An. gambiae (s.l.) per room in Kobeni and Rosso, respectively. Indoor resting female An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes in both sites fed most frequently on bovine blood (35.5% in Rosso and 37% in Kobeni). The proportion of An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes that took human blood was significantly higher in Kobeni (HBI = 37%) than in Rosso (HBI = 5.6%) and 32% of An. gambiae (s.l.) mosquitoes contained blood from more than one host species. None of the 1414 tested mosquitoes in both sites were found positive for Plasmodium spp. sporozoites. WHO insecticide resistance tests revealed resistance to permethrin in the An. arabiensis population from Rosso (mortality = 64%) as well as reduced mortality to deltamethrin (mortality = 97%).Conclusion: This study provides updated information on the composition and dynamics of the malaria vector system in southern Mauritania where malaria is endemic. Such data are a necessary prerequisite to devise and implement tailored malaria elimination strategies in areas of low residual transmission.

TI  - Observed warming of sea surface temperature in response to tropical cyclone <i>Thane</i> in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - An unusual near-surface warming was seen in observations from a moored buoy BD11 at 14 degrees N/83 degrees E, and a nearby Argo profiling float in the Bay of Bengal, during the passage of tropical cyclone Thane, during 25-31 December 2011. The cyclone induced a warming of sea surface temperature (SST) by 0.6. degrees C to the right of the track. Heat budget analysis based on moored observations and satellite data rules out the role of horizontal advection and net heat flux in warming the surface layer. We find that vertical mixing/entrainment in response to the cyclone, in conjunction with a pre-storm temperature inversion (subsurface ocean warmer than SST) led to the observed warming. Pre-storm and post-storm salinity and temperature profiles from an Argo float close to the mooring BD11 have higher vertical resolution than the moored data; they suggest vertical mixing of the upper 70 m of the water column. The moored observations show that the thermal inversion, erased by storm-induced mixing, reappears in a few days.

TI  - Unraveling InSAR Observed Antarctic Ice-Shelf Flexure Using 2-D Elastic and Viscoelastic Modeling
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice-shelf grounding zones link the Antarctic ice-sheets to the ocean. Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) is commonly used to monitor grounding-line locations, but also contains information on grounding-zone ice thickness, ice properties and tidal conditions beneath the ice shelf. Here, we combine in situ data with numerical modeling of ice-shelf flexure to investigate 2-D controls on the tidal bending pattern on the Southern McMurdo Ice Shelf. We validate our results with 9 double-differential TerraSAR-X interferograms. It is necessary to make adjustments to the tidal forcing to directly compare observations with model output and we find that when these adjustments are small (<1.5 cm) a viscoelastic model matches better, while an elastic model is more robust overall. Within landward embayments, where lateral stresses from surrounding protrusions damp the flexural response, a 2-D model captures behavior that is missed in simple 1-D models. We conclude that improvements in current tide models are required to allow for the full exploitation of DInSAR in grounding-zone glaciology.

TI  - A Semi-Supervised Dimension Reduction Method for Polarimetric SAR Image Classification
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problem of feature redundancy in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) application, a semi-supervised dimension reduction algorithm: semi-supervised local discriminant analysis (SliDA) is proposed by combining the thoughts of linear discriminant analysis (FDA) and locally linear embedding (LLE). Firstly, the regularization term is established based on local preserving property of LLE to avoid overfitting problem during learning. Then, discriminant analysis with regularization is performed on labeled data set in order to improve the generalization ability and preserve the local geometric structure in original space for the whole data. Dimension reduction experiments arc performed on all polarimetric SAR data from Flevoland regions obtained by RADARSAT-2 and AIRSAR satellites. The results show that the low dimensional features extracted by SLDA has the characteristics of "intra compactness and inter separation". Further classification experiment results show that SliDA can make the classification accuracy reach about 90% only with 1 parts per thousand-2 parts per thousand labeled samples, and the classification performance of SliDA is superior to other comparison algorithms.

TI  - Divergent trends of open-surface water body area in the contiguous United States from 1984 to 2016
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The contiguous United States (CONUS), especially the West, faces challenges of increasing water stress and uncertain impacts of climate change. The historical information of surface water body distribution, variation, and multidecadal trends documented in remote-sensing images can aid in water-resource planning and management, yet is not well explored. Here, we detected open-surface water bodies in all Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images (similar to 370,000 images, > 200 TB) of the CONUS and generated 30-meter annual water body frequency maps for 1984-2016. We analyzed the interannual variations and trends of year-long water body area, examined the impacts of climatic and anthropogenic drivers on water body area dynamics, and explored the relationships between water body area and land water storage (LWS). Generally, the western half of the United States is prone to water stress, with small water body area and large interannual variability. During 19842016, water-poor regions of the Southwest and Northwest had decreasing trends in water body area, while water-rich regions of the Southeast and far north Great Plains had increasing trends. These divergent trends, mainly driven by climate, enlargedwater-resource gaps and are likely to continue according to climate projections. Water body area change is a good indicator of LWS dynamics in 58% of the CONUS. Following the 2012 prolonged drought, LWS in California and the southern Great Plains had a larger decrease than surface water body area, likely caused by massive groundwater withdrawals. Our findings provide valuable information for surface water-resource planning and management across the CONUS.

TI  - Surveillance of travel-associated diseases at two referral centres in Marseille, France: a 12-year survey
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: With increasing international travel and historically high numbers of residents visiting friends and relatives overseas, travel-associated illnesses are frequent in Marseille, France. We report the changing epidemiology of travel-related illnesses over a 12-year period.Methods: A single site GeoSentinel surveillance analysis was undertaken for 3460 ill returned travellers presenting to two public hospitals in Marseille, France from March 2003 to October 2015, with travel-related illnesses. Demographic characteristics, travel history, presenting symptoms and information on pre-travel consultations were collected.Results: There was a predominance of travel to sub-Saharan Africa, in particular to Comoros archipelago. Tourism was the main reason for travel (1591/3460, 46%), followed by visiting friends or relatives (VFR) (895/3460, 26%), with a mean duration of 29 days; 35% (1212/3460) of travellers reported a pre-travel health consultation. The most common syndromic diagnoses were febrile systemic illness (1343, 39%), dermatologic (716, 21%), gastrointestinal (340, 10%) and respiratory/ear-nose-throat (331, ENT) (10%). Hospitalization rates were highest amongst travellers from sub-Saharan Africa (858/1632, 53%), and VFR (573/895, 64%, P < 0.001). Frequent diagnoses included malaria (797, 23%), dengue (96, 2.77%) and chikungunya (75, 2.17%), reflecting global trends. Comparison of two periods (2003-10 to 2011-15) demonstrated an increase in chikungunya and decrease in malaria and influenza-like illness. We report an increase in ill travellers from the Caribbean, Middle East and South-East Asia.Conclusion: Surveillance of travellers provides relevant sentinel information on the changing epidemiology of infectious diseases across the globe, most notably for malaria, dengue and chikungunya. We demonstrate the use of travel surveillance in improving pre-travel consultation needs and to address autochthonous vector-borne viral risks.

TI  - Weak population structure and no genetic erosion in <i>Pilosocereus aureispinus</i>: A microendemic and threatened cactus species from eastern Brazil
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Succulent cacti (Cactaceae) are among the most threatened taxonomic groups assessed to date. Here we evaluated the genetic diversity and population structure of a narrow endemic columnar cactus Pilosocereus aureispinus. This species is only found in a small area of c. 300 km(2) of rocky savanna from eastern Brazil and it is currently classified as vulnerable (VU) on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list. Eight microsatellite loci were genotyped for 91 individuals from four localities of the known P. aureispinus range. In contrast with expectations for narrow endemic species, we found relatively high levels of genetic diversity (e.g., H-E = 0.390 to 0.525; H-O = 0.394 to 0.572) and very low population structure based on the variation of six loci. All the analyzed individuals were clustered in one unique genetic group in assignment tests. We also generated the sequences of two plastid markers (trnT-trnL and psbD-trnT) and found no variation on a subsample of 39 individuals. We used Landsat 8 images and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to estimate a potential extent of occurrence of c. 750 km(2) for this species. Our results showed that P. aureispinus is not suffering from erosion of nuclear genetic variability due to its narrow distribution. However, we advocate that because of the extremely limited extent of occurrence, the ongoing anthropogenic disturbances in its habitat, and phylogenetic distinctiveness of P. aureispinus, this species should be classified as endangered (EN) on the IUCN Red List.

TI  - Intercomparison of phenological transition dates derived from the PhenoCam Dataset V1.0 and MODIS satellite remote sensing
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology is a valuable diagnostic of ecosystem health, and has applications to environmental monitoring and management. Here, we conduct an intercomparison analysis using phenological transition dates derived from near-surface PhenoCam imagery and MODIS satellite remote sensing. We used approximately 600 site-years of data, from 128 camera sites covering a wide range of vegetation types and climate zones. During both "greenness rising" and "greenness falling" transition phases, we found generally good agreement between PhenoCam and MODIS transition dates for agricultural, deciduous forest, and grassland sites, provided that the vegetation in the camera field of view was representative of the broader landscape. The correlation between PhenoCam and MODIS transition dates was poor for evergreen forest sites. We discuss potential reasons (including sub-pixel spatial heterogeneity, flexibility of the transition date extraction method, vegetation index sensitivity in evergreen systems, and PhenoCam geolocation uncertainty) for varying agreement between time series of vegetation indices derived from PhenoCam and MODIS imagery. This analysis increases our confidence in the ability of satellite remote sensing to accurately characterize seasonal dynamics in a range of ecosystems, and provides a basis for interpreting those dynamics in the context of tangible phenological changes occurring on the ground.

TI  - Assessment of actual evapotranspiration over a semiarid heterogeneous land surface by means of coupled low-resolution remote sensing data with an energy balance model: comparison to extra-large aperture scintillometer measurements
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In semiarid areas, agricultural production is restricted by water availability; hence, efficient agricultural water management is a major issue. The design of tools providing regional estimates of evapotranspiration (ET), one of the most relevant water balance fluxes, may help the sustainable management of water resources.Remote sensing provides periodic data about actual vegetation temporal dynamics (through the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) and water availability under water stress (through the surface temperature T-surf), which are crucial factors controlling ET.In this study, spatially distributed estimates of ET (or its energy equivalent, the latent heat flux LE) in the Kairouan plain (central Tunisia) were computed by applying the Soil Plant Atmosphere and Remote Sensing Evapotranspiration (SPARSE) model fed by low-resolution remote sensing data (Terra and Aqua MODIS). The work's goal was to assess the operational use of the SPARSE model and the accuracy of the modeled (i) sensible heat flux (H) and (ii) daily ET over a heterogeneous semiarid landscape with complex land cover (i.e., trees, winter cereals, summer vegetables).SPARSE was run to compute instantaneous estimates of H and LE fluxes at the satellite overpass times. The good correspondence (R-2 = 0.60 and 0.63 and RMSE = 57.89 and 53.85 W m(-2) for Terra and Aqua, respectively) between instantaneous H estimates and large aperture scintillometer (XLAS) H measurements along a path length of 4 km over the study area showed that the SPARSE model presents satisfactory accuracy. Results showed that, despite the fairly large scatter, the instantaneous LE can be suitably estimated at large scales (RMSE D 47.20 and 43.20 W m(-2) for Terra and Aqua, respectively, and R-2 = 0.55 for both satellites). Additionally, water stress was investigated by comparing modeled (SPARSE) and observed (XLAS) water stress values; we found that most points were located within a 0.2 confidence interval, thus the general tendencies are well reproduced. Even though extrapolation of instantaneous latent heat flux values to daily totals was less obvious, daily ET estimates are deemed acceptable.

TI  - Response of Aquatic Bacterial Communities to Hydraulic Fracturing in Northwestern Pennsylvania: A Five-Year Study
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing extraction procedures have become increasingly present in Pennsylvania where the Marcellus Shale play is largely located. The potential for long-term environmental impacts to nearby headwater stream ecosystems and aquatic bacterial assemblages is still incompletely understood. Here, we perform high-throughput sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene to characterize the bacterial community structure of water, sediment, and other environmental samples (n = 189) from 31 headwater stream sites exhibiting different histories of fracking activity in northwestern Pennsylvania over five years (2012-2016). Stream pH was identified as a main driver of bacterial changes within the streams and fracking activity acted as an environmental selector for certain members at lower taxonomic levels within stream sediment. Methanotrophic and methanogenic bacteria (i.e. Methylocystaceae, Beijerinckiaceae, and Methanobacterium) were significantly enriched in sites exhibiting Marcellus shale activity (MSA+) compared to MSA-streams. This study highlighted potential sentinel taxa associated with nascent Marcellus shale activity and some of these taxa remained as stable biomarkers across this five-year study. Identifying the presence and functionality of specific microbial consortia within fracking-impacted streams will provide a clearer understanding of the natural microbial community's response to fracking and inform in situ remediation strategies.

TI  - Mega Clonality in an Aquatic Plant-A Potential Survival Strategy in a Changing Environment
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many ecosystems are experiencing rapid transformations due to global environmental change. Understanding how ecological shifts affect species persistence is critical to modern management strategies. The edge of a species range is often where physiological tolerances are in conflict with ability to persist. Extreme examples of clonality over large spatial and temporal scales can occur where the life history of a species allows for it. We examine extreme clonality in an aquatic plant species at the edge if its range. Here we describe an ancient seagrass clone of unprecedented size inhabiting a 47 km stretch of a central Florida estuary, the Indian River Lagoon (IRL). Amongst the largest clones on earth detected, this Thalassia testudinum (turtlegrass) genet had ramets dispersed across 47 km of this water body. Indeed among 382 samples collections along the length of the IRL, 89% were a single shared multilocus genotype. Furthermore, this clone was the only genet detected at 63% of sample sites. The presence of such a large clone demonstrates they can form and persist over long periods. In addition, we must challenge the paradigm that fragmentation is not possible in this species. Reliance on clonality is an expected component of a classic 'bet-hedging' strategy enabling persistence on timescales typically not considered, including millennia. At locations near ocean inlets we did find a few other individuals of T. testudinum supporting the concept that recruitment is dispersal limited. These additional clones indicate there is the potential, albeit limited, for seeds based recruitment to occur when environmental conditions are favorable during a "window of opportunity." Extreme clonality represents a potential strategy for survival such that in the extreme, clonal populations of a species would be the first to decline or disappear if conditions extend beyond the adaptability of the local genotype. This disappearance possibility makes the species a potential sentinel of system decline.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a multi-layer, multi-temporal flood map of the event occurred on December 2013 in Basilicata (southern Italy), documenting the spatial evolution of the inundated areas through time, as well as some ground effects of floodwaters inferred from the imagery. The map, developed within a GIS and consisting of four, 1:20,000 scale, different layers, was prepared using image processing, visual image interpretation and field survey controls. We used two COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, acquired during the event, and a Pleiades-1B High-Resolution optical image, acquired at the end of the event. We also used the information derived from the satellite imagery to update some local features of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) geospatial database, and then integrated it within the flood map. A classified multi-temporal dynamic map of inundation and flood effects has been produced in the form of a multi-layer pdf file (Main Map).

TI  - Impact of five annual rounds of mass drug administration with ivermectin on onchocerciasis in Sierra Leone
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Onchocerciasis is endemic in 12 of the 14 health districts of Sierra Leone. Good treatment coverage of community-directed treatment with ivermectin was achieved between 2005 and 2009 after the 11-year civil conflict. Sentinel site surveys were conducted in 2010 to evaluate the impact of five annual rounds of ivermectin distribution.Methods: In total, 39 sentinel villages from hyper- and meso-endemic areas across the 12 endemic districts were surveyed using skin snips in 2010. Results were analyzed and compared with the baseline data from the same 39 villages.Results: The average microfilaridermia (MF) prevalence across 39 sentinel villages was 53.10% at baseline. The MF prevalence was higher in older age groups, with the lowest in the age group of 1-9 years (11.00%) and the highest in the age group of 40-49 years (82.31%). Overall mean MF density among the positives was 28.87 microfilariae (mf)/snip, increasing with age with the lowest in the age group of 1-9 years and the highest in the age group of 40-49 years. Males had higher MF prevalence and density than females. In 2010 after five rounds of mass drug administration, the overall MF prevalence decreased by 60.26% from 53.10% to 21.10%; the overall mean MF density among the positives decreased by 71.29% from 28.87 mf/snip to 8.29 mf/snip; and the overall mean MF density among all persons examined decreased by 88.58% from 15.33 mf/snip to 1.75 mf/snip. Ten of 12 endemic districts had > 50% reduction in MF prevalence. Eleven of 12 districts had >= 50% reduction in mean MF density among the positives.Conclusions: A significant reduction of onchocerciasis MF prevalence and mean density was recorded in all 12 districts of Sierra Leone after five annual MDAs with effective treatment coverage. The results suggested that the onchocerciasis elimination programme in Sierra Leone was on course to reach the objective of eliminating onchocerciasis in the country by the year 2025. Annual MDA with ivermectin should continue in all 12 districts and further evaluations are needed across the country to assist the NTDP with programme decision making.

TI  - Methodology and results of integrated WNV surveillance programmes in Serbia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies conducted during the past few years have confirmed active West Nile virus (WNV) circulation in Serbia. Based on these studies and the epidemiological situation, the Veterinary Directorate of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environmental Protection launched national WNV surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015. The programmes encompassed the territory of Serbia and were conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the programmes was early detection of WNV and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase both clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The WNV surveillance programmes were based on direct and indirect surveillance of the presence of WNV by the serological testing of initially seronegative sentinel horses and chickens as well as through viral detection in pooled mosquito and wild bird samples. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in all seven districts of Vojvodina Province (northern Serbia) and Belgrade City, where most of the positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The West Nile virus surveillance programmes in 2014 and 2015 showed satisfactory results in their capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and their sensitivity to early detect viral circulation at the enzootic level. Most of the human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation as part of the surveillance programmes. According to the existing data, it can be reasonably assumed that WNV infection, now an endemic infection in Serbia, will continue to present a significant problem for the veterinary service and public health.

TI  - Reconstructing volcanic plume evolution integrating satellite and ground-based data: application to the 23 November 2013 Etna eruption
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent explosive volcanic eruptions recorded worldwide (e.g. Hekla in 2000, Eyjafjallajokull in 2010, Cordon-Caulle in 2011) demonstrated the necessity for a better assessment of the eruption source parameters (ESPs; e.g. column height, mass eruption rate, eruption duration, and total grain-size distribution - TGSD) to reduce the uncertainties associated with the far-travelling airborne ash mass. Volcanological studies started to integrate observations to use more realistic numerical inputs, crucial for taking robust volcanic risk mitigation actions. On 23 November 2013, Etna (Italy) erupted, producing a 10 km height plume, from which two volcanic clouds were observed at different altitudes from satellites (SEVIRI, MODIS). One was retrieved as mainly composed of very fine ash (i.e. PM20), and the second one as made of ice/SO2 droplets (i.e. not measurable in terms of ash mass). An atypical north-easterly wind direction transported the tephra from Etna towards the Calabria and Apulia regions (southern Italy), permitting tephra sampling in proximal (i.e. similar to 5-25 km from the source) and medial areas (i.e. the Calabria region, similar to 160 km). A primary TGSD was derived from the field measurement analysis, but the paucity of data (especially related to the fine ash fraction) prevented it from being entirely representative of the initial magma fragmentation. To better constrain the TGSD assessment, we also estimated the distribution from the X-band weather radar data. We integrated the field and radar-derived TGSDs by inverting the relative weighting averages to best fit the tephra loading measurements. The resulting TGSD is used as input for the FALL3D tephra dispersal model to reconstruct the whole tephra loading. Furthermore, we empirically modified the integrated TGSD by enriching the PM20 classes until the numerical results were able to reproduce the airborne ash mass retrieved from satellite data. The resulting TGSD is inverted by best-fitting the field, ground-based, and satellite-based measurements. The results indicate a total erupted mass of 1.2 x 10(9) kg, being similar to the field-derived value of 1.3 x 10(9) kg, and an initial PM20 fraction between 3.6 and 9.0 wt %, constituting the tail of the TGSD.

TI  - Comparison of Remotely-Sensed Sea Surface Temperature and Salinity Products With <i>in Situ</i> Measurements From British Columbia, Canada
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) are essential variables at the ocean and atmosphere interface when considering risk factors for disease in farmed and wild fish stocks. Ecological research has witnessed a recent trend in use of digital and satellite technologies, including remote-sensing tools. We explored spatial coverage of remotely-sensed SST and SSS data and compared them with in situ measurements of water temperatures and salinity, which led to suggested adjustments to the remotely-sensed data for its use in aquaculture research. The in situ data were from farms and wild surveillance sites in coastal British Columbia, Canada, from 2003 to 2016. Concurrent SST and SSS values were extracted from remotely-sensed products and compared with 20,513 and 20,038 in situ records for water temperature and salinity, respectively, from 232 different sites. Among nine SST products evaluated, the UKMO OSTIA SST (UK Meteorological Office) had the highest retrieval, and highest concordance correlation coefficient (0.86), highest index of agreement (0.93), fewest missing values, and smallest mean and SD values for bias, when compared to in situ measurements. A mixed linear regression model with UKMO OSTIA SST as the predictor for in situ measurements estimated an adjustment coefficient of 0.89 degrees C for UKMO OSTIA SST. None of the three SSS products evaluated provided appropriate corresponding values for in situ sites, suggesting that spatial coverage for the study area is currently lacking. This study demonstrates that, among SST products, UKMO OSTIA SST is currently best suited for aquaculture studies in coastal BC. The near real-time availability of these data with the estimated adjustment would allow their use in forecast models, surveillance of pathogens, and the creation of risk maps.

TI  - Challenges of DHS and MIS to capture the entire pattern of malaria parasite risk and intervention effects in countries with different ecological zones: the case of Cameroon
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2011, the demographic and health survey (DHS) in Cameroon was combined with the multiple indicator cluster survey. Malaria parasitological data were collected, but the survey period did not overlap with the high malaria transmission season. A malaria indicator survey (MIS) was also conducted during the same year, within the malaria peak transmission season. This study compares estimates of the geographical distribution of malaria parasite risk and of the effects of interventions obtained from the DHS and MIS survey data.Methods: Bayesian geostatistical models were applied on DHS and MIS data to obtain georeferenced estimates of the malaria parasite prevalence and to assess the effects of interventions. Climatic predictors were retrieved from satellite sources. Geostatistical variable selection was used to identify the most important climatic predictors and indicators of malaria interventions.Results: The overall observed malaria parasite risk among children was 33 and 30% in the DHS and MIS data, respectively. Both datasets identified the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the altitude as important predictors of the geographical distribution of the disease. However, MIS selected additional climatic factors as important disease predictors. The magnitude of the estimated malaria parasite risk at national level was similar in both surveys. Nevertheless, DHS estimates lower risk in the North and Coastal areas. MIS did not find any important intervention effects, although DHS revealed that the proportion of population with an insecticide-treated nets access in their household was statistically important. An important negative relationship between malaria parasitaemia and socioeconomic factors, such as the level of mother's education, place of residence and the household welfare were captured by both surveys.Conclusion: Timing of the malaria survey influences estimates of the geographical distribution of disease risk, especially in settings with seasonal transmission. In countries with different ecological zones and thus different seasonal patterns, a single survey may not be able to identify all high risk areas. A continuous MIS or a combination of MIS, health information system data and data from sentinel sites may be able to capture the disease risk distribution in space across different seasons.

TI  - Differential accumulation of proteins in oil palms affected by fatal yellowing disease
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is still no consensus on the true origin of fatal yellowing, one of the most important diseases affecting oil palm (Elaeis guineensis Jacq.) plantations. This study involved two-dimensional liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MSE) analyses to identify changes in protein profiles of oil palms affected by FY disease. Oil palm roots were sampled from two growing areas. Differential accumulation of proteins was assessed by comparing plants with and without symptoms and between plants at different stages of FY development. Most of the proteins identified with differential accumulation were those related to stress response and energy metabolism. The latter proteins include the enzymes alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase, related to alcohol fermentation, which were identified in plants with and without symptoms. The presence of these enzymes suggests an anaerobic condition before or during FY. Transketolase, isoflavone reductase, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine synthase, aldehyde dehydrogenase and ferritin, among others, were identified as potential marker proteins and could be used to guide selection of FY-tolerant oil palm genotypes or to understand the source of this anomaly. When comparing different stages of FY, we observed high accumulation of alcohol dehydrogenase and other abiotic stress related-proteins at all disease stages. On the other hand, biological stress-related proteins were more accumulated at later stages of the disease. These results suggest that changes in abiotic factors can trigger FY development, creating conditions for the establishment of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  - Estimation of settling velocity of sediment particles in estuarine and coastal waters
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A model for estimating the settling velocity of sediment particles (spherical and non-spherical) in estuarine and coastal waters is developed and validated using experimental data. The model combines the physical, optical and hydrodynamic properties of the particles and medium to estimate the sediment settling velocity. The well-known Stokes law is broadened to account for the influencing factors of settling velocity such as particle size, shape and density. To derive the model parameters, laboratory experiments were conducted using natural flaky seashells, spherical beach sands and ball-milled seashell powders. Spectral light backscattering measurements of settling particles in a water tank were made showing a distinct optical feature with a peak shifting from 470-490 nm to 500-520 nm for particle populations from spherical to flaky grains. This significant optical feature was used as a proxy to make a shape determination in the present model. Other parameters experimentally determined included specific gravity (Delta(SG)), Corey shape factor (CSF), median grain diameter (D-50), drag coefficient (C-d) and Reynolds number (Re). The CSF values considered ranged from 0.2 for flaky to 1.0 for perfectly spherical grains and Reynolds numbers from 2.0 to 10(5) for the laminar to turbulent flow regimes. The specific gravity of submerged particles was optically derived and used along with these parameters to estimate the sediment settling velocity. Comparison with the experiment data showed that the present model estimated settling velocities of spherical and non-spherical particles that were closely consistent with the measured values. Findings revealed that for a given D-50, the flaky particles caused a greater decrease in settling velocity than the spherical particles which suggests that the particle shape factor has a profound role in influencing the sediment settling velocity and drag coefficients, especially in transitional and turbulent flow regimes. The present model can be easily adopted for various scientific and operational applications since the required parameters are readily measurable with the commercially available instrumentations.

TI  - Assessment of the safety of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccine administered orally to badgers (&ITMeles meles&IT)
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - European badgers (Meles meles) are a wildlife reservoir for Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) in parts of England, Wales and Ireland, constituting a potential source of tuberculosis (TB) infection for cattle. Vaccination of badgers against TB is one of the tools available for helping reduce the prevalence of bovine TB in badgers, made possible by the licensing in 2010 of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for intramuscular administration to badgers (BadgerBCG). However, practical limitations associated with administering an injected vaccine to wild animals make an oral, bait-delivered form of the vaccine highly desirable. Evaluation of the safety of oral BCG to badgers and the environment is a mandatory step on the road to licensing an oral vaccine. This study had the following objectives: (a) to determine whether adverse effects followed the oral administration of BCG vaccine to badgers; (b) to measure the quantity and frequency of BCG excreted in the faeces of vaccinated badgers; and (c) to assess whether there was evidence of the vaccine spreading to unvaccinated, 'sentinel' badgers sharing the same environment as vaccinated animals. We report here that the oral administration per badger of >= 6.4 x 10(9) cfu BCG, followed 14 days later by a single oral dose of >= 6.4 x 10(7) cfu BCG caused no adverse physical effects and did not affect the social behaviour and feeding habits of the vaccinated animals. BCG was cultured from the faeces of two of nine vaccinated animals (372 cfu/g and 996 cfu/g, respectively) approximately 48 h after the higher dose of BCG was administered and by one of the nine vaccinated animal (80 cfu/g) approximately 24 h after receiving the lower dose of BCG. We found no evidence for the transmission of BCG to unvaccinated, sentinel, badgers housed with the vaccinated animals despite the occasional excretion of BCG in faeces.

M3  - Review
AB  - Systemic cancer therapies take into account breast cancer (BC) heterogeneity by targeting pathways specifically involved in some BC subtypes. On the other hand, BC intrinsic radiosensitivity is poorly understood and studied. Hence, radiotherapy personalization in BC is still "work in progress". In this review, we will summarize the existing data on the management of axillary lymph nodes in BC, the impact of BC radiotherapy on axillary management, the indications for axillary radiotherapy, and biomarkers to predict patients' outcome (tumor control and late toxicities) after axillary irradiation.

TI  - Predicting <i>Pinus monophylla</i> forest cover in the Baja California Desert by remote sensing
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The Californian single-leaf pinyon (Pinus manophyna var. californiarum), a subspecies of the single-leaf pinyon (the world's only one-needled pine), inhabits semi-arid zones of the Mojave Desert (southern Nevada and southeastern California, US) and also of northern Baja California (Mexico). This tree is distributed as a relict subspecies, at elevations of between 1,010 and 1,631 m in the geographically isolated arid Sierra La Asamblea, an area characterized by mean annual precipitation levels of between 184 and 288 mm. The aim of this research was (1) to estimate the distribution of P. monophylla var. californiaruin in Sierra La Asamblea by using Sentinel-2 images, and (ii) to test arid de scribe the relationship between the distribution of P. monophylla and five topographic and 18 climate variables. We hypothesized that (i) Sentinel-2, images can be used to predict the P. monophylla distribution in the study site due to the finer resolution (x3) and greater number of bands (x2) relative to Landsat-8 data,which is publically available free of charge and has been demonstrated to be useful for estimating forest cover, and (ii) the topographical variables aspect, ruggedness and lope are particularly important important because they represent important microhabitat factors that can determine the sites where conifers can become established and persist. An atmospherically corrected a 12-bit Sentinel-2A MSI image with 10 spectral bands in the visible, near infrared, and short-wave infrared light region was used in combination with the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Supervised classification of this image was carried out using a backpropagation-type artificial neural network algorithm. Stepwise multiple linear binominal logistical regression and Random Forest classification including cross validation were used to model the associations between presence/absence of monophylla and the five topographical and 18 climate variables. Using supervised classification of Sentinel-2 satellite images, we estimated that P. monophylla covers 6,653 319 ha in the isolated Sierra La Asamblea. The NDVI was one of the variables that contributed most to the prediction and clearly separated the forest cover (NDVI > 0.35) from the other vegetation cover (NDVI < 0.20). Ruggedness was the most influential environmental predictor variable, indicating that the probability of occurrence of P. monophylla was greater than 50% when the degree of ruggedness terrain ruggedness index was greater than 17.5 m. The probability of occurrence of the species decreased when the mean temperature in the warmest month increased from 23.5 to 25.2 degrees C. Ruggedness is known to create microclimates and provides shade that minimizes evapotranspiration from pines in desert environments. Identification of the P. monophylla stands in Sierra La Asamblea as the most southern populations represents an opportunity for research on climatic tolerance and community responses to climate variability and change.

TI  - Pre-seismic anomalies from optical satellite observations: a review
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Detecting various anomalies using optical satellite data prior to strong earthquakes is key to understanding and forecasting earthquake activities because of its recognition of thermal-radiation-related phenomena in seismic preparation phases. Data from satellite observations serve as a powerful tool in monitoring earthquake preparation areas at a global scale and in a nearly real-time manner. Over the past several decades, many new different data sources have been utilized in this field, and progressive anomaly detection approaches have been developed. This paper reviews the progress and development of pre-seismic anomaly detection technology in this decade. First, precursor parameters, including parameters from the top of the atmosphere, in the atmosphere, and on the Earth's surface, are stated and discussed. Second, different anomaly detection methods, which are used to extract anomalous signals that probably indicate future seismic events, are presented. Finally, certain critical problems with the current research are highlighted, and new developing trends and perspectives for future work are discussed. The development of Earth observation satellites and anomaly detection algorithms can enrich available information sources, provide advanced tools for multilevel earthquake monitoring, and improve short-and medium-term forecasting, which play a large and growing role in pre-seismic anomaly detection research.

TI  - HIV prevalence among female sex workers in Guigang City, Guangxi, China: an 8-year consecutive cross-sectional study
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Female sex workers (FSW) are a population that are at high risk for HIV infection, and their HIV/AIDS knowledge levels and sexual behaviors are of concern. This study describes changes in HIV prevalence and factors associated among female sex workers in Guigang City, Guangxi, one of the highest HIV prevalence areas in China.Methods: Data were derived from an annual cross-sectional venue-based survey, 2008 to 2015, in the form of sentinel surveillance. The participants were recruited using cluster sampling. FSW aged 16 years and above who completed a questionnaire and HIV testing. Both descriptive and multi-level analyses were used to explore factors associated with changes in HIV prevalence.Results: Seven thousand four hundred ninety-six FSW were recruited in this study. HIV prevalence among FSW in Guigang City fell into two periods, one with an increasing trend (2008-2011) and one with a decline (2012-2015). Differences between these time periods included age, relationship status, HIV knowledge, consistent condom use, lifetime illicit drug use, history of sexually transmitted infection in the past year, HIV testing, receipt of a condom distribution and education program or HIV counseling and testing, and peer education services.Conclusions: Since 2012, a reduction in HIV prevalence among FSW in Guigang City has been observed. The decline of HIV prevalence was associated with coinciding changes in demographic characteristics of FSW, improvement of HIV knowledge and safer sexual behaviors, and a program that promotes condom use, HIV counseling & testing, and peer education.

TI  - Atmospheric heat source/sink dataset over the Tibetan Plateau based on satellite and routine meteorological observations
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP), acting as a large elevated land surface and atmospheric heat source during spring and summer, has a substantial impact on regional and global weather and climate. To explore the multi-scale temporal variation in the thermal forcing effect of the TP, here we calculated the surface sensible heat and latent heat release based on 6-h routine observations at 80 (32) meteorological stations during the period 1979-2016 (1960-2016). Meanwhile, in situ air-column net radiation cooling during the period 1984-2015 was derived from satellite data. This new dataset provides continuous, robust, and the longest observational atmospheric heat source/sink data over the third pole, which will be helpful to better understand the spatial-temporal structure and multi-scale variation in TP diabatic heating and its influence on the earth's climatic system.

Sixty-eight images from Envisat (2004-2008), ALOS-1 (2006-2010), TerraSAR-X (2012-2013) and Sentinel-1 (2015-2017) were acquired, and 227 filtered interferograms were generated using the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique. The rate of line-of-sight (LOS) subsidence of the LUC peaked at 90 mm/year between 2012 and 2013, mainly due to the loss of most of the water in Lake Urmia. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on 200 randomly selected time series of the LUC, and the results are presented in the form of the three major components. The InSAR scores obtained from the PCA were used in a hydro-thermal model to investigate the dynamics of consolidation settlement along the LUC based on detrended water level and temperature data. The results can be used to establish a geodetic network around the LUC to identify more detailed deformation patterns and to help plan future efforts to reduce the possible costs of damage.

TI  - Comparing airborne and satellite retrievals of cloud optical thickness and particle effective radius using a spectral radiance ratio technique: two case studies for cirrus and deep convective clouds
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar radiation reflected by cirrus and deep convective clouds (DCCs) was measured by the Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation Measurement System (SMART) installed on the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO) during the Mid-Latitude Cirrus (ML-CIRRUS) and the Aerosol, Cloud, Precipitation, and Radiation Interaction and Dynamic of Convective Clouds System - Cloud Processes of the Main Precipitation Systems in Brazil: A Contribution to Cloud Resolving Modelling and to the Global Precipitation Measurement (ACRIDICON-CHUVA) campaigns. On particular flights, HALO performed measurements closely collocated with overpasses of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. A cirrus cloud located above liquid water clouds and a DCC topped by an anvil cirrus are analyzed in this paper. Based on the nadir spectral upward radiance measured above the two clouds, the optical thickness tau and particle effective radius r(eff) of the cirrus and DCC are retrieved using a radiance ratio technique, which considers the cloud thermodynamic phase, the vertical profile of cloud microphysical properties, the presence of multilayer clouds, and the heterogeneity of the surface albedo. For the cirrus case, the comparison of tau and r(eff) retrieved on the basis of SMART and MODIS measurements yields a normalized mean absolute deviation of up to 1.2% for tau and 2.1% for r(eff). For the DCC case, deviations of up to 3.6% for tau and 6.2% for r(eff) are obtained. The larger deviations in the DCC case are mainly attributed to the fast cloud evolution and three-dimensional (3-D) radiative effects. Measurements of spectral upward radiance at near-infrared wavelengths are employed to investigate the vertical profile of r(eff) in the cirrus. The retrieved values of r(eff) are compared with corresponding in situ measurements using a vertical weighting method. Compared to the MODIS observations, measurements of SMART provide more information on the vertical distribution of particle sizes, which allow reconstructing the profile of r(eff) close to the cloud top. The comparison between retrieved and in situ r(eff) yields a normalized mean absolute deviation, which ranges between 1.5 and 10.3 %, and a robust correlation coefficient of 0.82.

TI  - Spatial distribution of arable and abandoned land across former Soviet Union countries
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Knowledge of the spatial distribution of agricultural abandonment following the collapse of the Soviet Union is highly uncertain. To help improve this situation, we have developed a new map of arable and abandoned land for 2010 at a 10 arc-second resolution. We have fused together existing land cover and land use maps at different temporal and spatial scales for the former Soviet Union (fSU) using a training data set collected from visual interpretation of very high resolution (VHR) imagery. We have also collected an independent validation data set to assess the map accuracy. The overall accuracies of the map by region and country, i.e. Caucasus, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Republic of Moldova, Russian Federation and Ukraine, are 90 +/- 2%, 84 +/- 2%, 92 +/- 1%, 78 +/- 3%, 95 +/- 1%, 83 +/- 2%, respectively. This new product can be used for numerous applications including the modelling of biogeochemical cycles, land-use modelling, the assessment of trade-offs between ecosystem services and land-use potentials (e.g., agricultural production), among others.

TI  - Malaria burden and treatment targets in Kachin Special Region II, Myanmar from 2008 to 2016: A retrospective analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although drug-based treatment is the primary intervention for malaria control and elimination, optimal use of targeted treatments remains unclear. From 2008 to 2016, three targeted programs on treatment were undertaken in Kachin Special Region II (KR2), Myanmar. Program I (2008-2011) treated all confirmed, clinical and suspected cases; program II (2012-2013) treated confirmed and clinical cases; and program III (2014-2016) targeted confirmed cases only. This study aims to evaluate the impacts of the three programs on malaria burden individually based on the annual parasite incidence (API), slide positivity rate (SPR) and their relative values. The API is calculated from original collected data and the incidence rate ratio (IRR) for each year is calculated by using the first-year API as a reference in each program phase across the KR2. Same method is applied to calculate SPR and risk ratio (RR) at the sentinel hospital too. During program I (2008-2011), malaria burden was reduced by 61% (95%CI: 58%-74%) and the actual API decreased from 9.8 (95%CI: 9.6-10.1) per 100 person-years in 2008 to 3.8 (3.6-4.1) per 100 person-years in 2011. Amid program II (2012-2013), the malaria burden increased by 33% (95%CI: 22%-46%) and the actual API increased from 2.1(95%CI: 2.0-2.3) per 100 person-years in 2012 to 2.8 (95%CI: 2.7-2.9) per 100 person-years in 2013. During program III (2014-2016) the malaria burden increased furtherly by 60% (95%CI: 51% - 69%) and the actual API increased from 3.2(95%CI: 3.0-3.3) per 100 person-years in 2014 to 5.1 (95%CI: 4.9-5.2) per 100 person-years in 2016. Results of the slide positivity of the sentinel hospital also confirm these results. Resurgence of malaria was mainly due to Plasmodium vivax during program II and III. This study indicates that strategy adopted in program I (2008-2011) should be more appropriate for the KR2. Quality-assured treatment of all confirmed, clinical and suspected malaria cases may be helpful for the reduction of malaria burden.

TI  - Large drainages from short-lived glacial lakes in the Teskey Range, Tien Shan Mountains, Central Asia
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Four large drainages from glacial lakes occurred during 2006-2014 in the western Teskey Range, Kyrgyzstan. These floods caused extensive damage, killing people and livestock as well as destroying property and crops. Using satellite data analysis and field surveys of this area, we find that the water volume that drained at Kashkasuu glacial lake in 2006 was 194 000 m3, at western Zyndan lake in 2008 was 437 000m(3), at Jeruy lake in 2013 was 182 000m(3), and at Karateke lake in 2014 was 123 000m(3). Due to their subsurface outlet, we refer to these short-lived glacial lakes as the "tunnel-type", a type that drastically grows and drains over a few months. From spring to early summer, these lakes either appear, or in some cases, significantly expand from an existing lake (but non-stationary), and then drain during summer. Our field surveys show that the short-lived lakes form when an ice tunnel through a debris landform gets blocked. The blocking is caused either by the freezing of stored water inside the tunnel during winter or by the collapse of ice and debris around the ice tunnel. The draining then occurs through an opened ice tunnel during summer. The growth-drain cycle can repeat when the ice-tunnel closure behaves like that of typical supraglacial lakes on debris-covered glaciers. We argue here that the geomorphological characteristics under which such short-lived glacial lakes appear are (i) a debris landform containing ice (ice-cored moraine complex), (ii) a depression with water supply on a debris landform as a potential lake basin, and (iii) no visible surface outflow channel from the depression, indicating the existence of an ice tunnel. Applying these characteristics, we examine 60 depressions (>0.01 km(2)) in the study region and identify here 53 of them that may become short-lived glacial lakes, with 34 of these having a potential drainage exceeding 10m(3) s(-1) at peak discharge.

TI  - Noninvasive Multimodal Imaging of Osteosarcoma and Lymph Nodes.Using a <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-Labeled Biomineralization Nanoprobe
T2  - ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate imaging of the lymph nodes represents a critical indicator for tumor staging and surgical planning (e.g., osteosarcoma). Clinically, nodal tracing using a radio-nanocolloid is often limited by the inaccessibility of real-time images and inadequate anatomical information. Herein, we present a Tc-99m-labeled biomineralization nanoprobe for the advanced detection of osteosarcoma and lymph nodes with multimodal imaging. Through the exploitation of the complementary strengths of MRI/SPECT/NIR fluorescence, the fabricated nanoprobe exhibited suitable stability and biocompatibility characteristics and was shown to be able to be located in osteosarcoma. The lymphatic drainage and network in healthy mice were imaged in real-time using NW fluorescence and SPECT/CT. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our Tc-99m-biomineralization nanoprobe could be used for the high-resolution and high-sensitivity imaging analysis of lymphatic drainage in an orthotopic osteosarcoma model. Overall, the Tc-99m-labeled biomineralization nanoprobe features promising characteristics to be used as an intraoperative visualization tool to aid in precise tumor imaging and nodal resection.

TI  - Gender Differences in the Prevalence of Fibromyalgia and in Concomitant Medical and Psychiatric Disorders: A National Veterans Health Administration Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Fibromyalgia is a poorly understood, chronically disabling pain syndrome. While research has focused on its clinical presentation and treatment, less is known about fibromyalgia's clinical epidemiology in real-world healthcare systems. Gender differences have been difficult to study because relatively few males are diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Methods: Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia nationwide in FY 2012 were compared to Veterans with other pain diagnoses on sociodemographic characteristics, medical and psychiatric diagnoses, health service use, and opioid and psychotropic prescription fills. Additional analyses compared characteristics of men and women diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Risk ratios and Cohen's d were used for bivariate comparisons, followed by logistic regression analyses to identify independent factors associated with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia in the VHA. Results: Altogether, 77,087 of 2,216,621 Veterans with pain diagnoses (3.48%) were diagnosed with fibromyalgia. They were more likely to be female, younger than patients with other pain conditions, more likely to have multiple psychiatric comorbidities and other types of pain, and used more medical outpatient services. Women diagnosed with fibromyalgia were younger and more likely to have headaches, connective tissue diseases (CTD), and psychiatric comorbidities, while men had more comorbid medical conditions. Conclusions: In this large, predominantly older male sample of Veterans with pain diagnoses, those with fibromyalgia were far more likely to be women. Gender comparisons showed women with fibromyalgia were more likely to be diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and CTD, while males were more likely to be diagnosed with medical conditions. Fibromyalgia shows a striking, gender-dependent picture of multimorbidity, which should be considered in treatment.

TI  - Tie2 protects the vasculature against thrombus formation in systemic inflammation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL INVESTIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Disordered coagulation contributes to death in sepsis and lacks effective treatments. Existing markers of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) reflect its sequelae rather than its causes, delaying diagnosis and treatment. Here we show that disruption of the endothelial Tie2 axis is a sentinel event in septic DIC. Proteomics in septic DIC patients revealed a network involving inflammation and coagulation with the Tie2 antagonist, angiopoietin-2 (Angpt-2), occupying a central node. Angpt-2 was strongly associated with traditional DIC markers including platelet counts, yet more accurately predicted mortality in 2 large independent cohorts (combined N = 1,077). In endotoxemic mice, reduced Tie2 signaling preceded signs of overt DIC. During this early phase, intravital imaging of microvascular injury revealed excessive fibrin accumulation, a pattern remarkably mimicked by Tie2 deficiency even without inflammation. Conversely, Tie2 activation normalized prothrombotic responses by inhibiting endothelial tissue factor and phosphatidylserine exposure. Critically, Tie2 activation had no adverse effects on bleeding. These results mechanistically implicate Tie2 signaling as a central regulator of microvascular thrombus formation in septic DIC and indicate that circulating markers of the Tie2 axis could facilitate earlier diagnosis. Finally, interventions targeting Tie2 may normalize coagulation in inflammatory states while averting the bleeding risks of current DIC therapies.

TI  - Rule of Law and Avoided Deforestation from Protected Areas
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global efforts to protect biodiversity and slow deforestation rely heavily on the establishment of protected areas; land set aside that cannot be deforested or developed. This paper studies the macro-level relationship between rule of law and variation in avoided deforestation from protected areas. Using recent global satellite data from 2000 to 2012, I estimate the country-level avoided deforestation of protected areas established in this period via nearest-neighbor matching. I then use weighted least-squares regressions to explain country-level variation in estimated avoided deforestation as a function of a country's governance characteristics as well as other country level controls. Across 71 countries in this study period, protected areas were more effective in countries with higher levels of corruption control and protection of property rights, protected areas were more effective in more democratic countries, and there appears to be no relationship between political stability and avoided deforestation from protected areas.

TI  - The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Monthly Analysis (New Version 2.3) and a Review of 2017 Global Precipitation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Review
AB  - The new Version 2.3 of the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) Monthly analysis is described in terms of changes made to improve the homogeneity of the product, especially after 2002. These changes include corrections to cross-calibration of satellite data inputs and updates to the gauge analysis. Over-ocean changes starting in 2003 resulted in an overall precipitation increase of 1.8% after 2009. Updating the gauge analysis to its final, high-quality version increases the global land total by 1.8% for the post-2002 period. These changes correct a small, incorrect dip in the estimated global precipitation over the last decade given by the earlier Version 2.2. The GPCP analysis is also used to describe global precipitation in 2017. The general La Nina pattern for 2017 is noted and the evolution from the early 2016 El Nino pattern is described. The 2017 global value is one of the highest for the 1979-2017 period, exceeded only by 2016 and 1998 (both El Nino years), and reinforces the small positive trend. Results for 2017 also reinforce significant trends in precipitation intensity (on a monthly scale) in the tropics. These results for 2017 indicate the value of the GPCP analysis, in addition to research, for climate monitoring.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the important roles of seagrass habitat in the marine environment is as habitat for various types of marine biota. In Indonesia, the availability of spatial information of seagrass beds still leave a large gap, so it is necessary to keep on developing methods and mapping the seagrass ecosystems. This research utilized SPOT-7 imagery as the input to obtain spatial information of seagrass distribution in the coastal area of Wawonii Island, Southeast Sulawesi. The imagery also used to obtain water depth, especially the location where seagrass beds were found. Image transformation into depth was done using band ratio algorithm, while for seagrass distribution was obtained by supervised classification using MLH algorithm on pixel-based method. Both methods were applied using field information and secondary data obtained from several sources as references in performing digital image processing. The study focused on the western and northern sides of Wawonii Island, particularly in the shallow waters of Wawonii Barat, Wawonii Utara, and Wawonii Timur Laut Subdistrict. The result of satellite image classification shows the distribution of seagrass alongside the focused study of the Island with different thickness. The seagrass distribution zone is mainly determined by depth, where the distribution in this location is commonly less than 2m of water depth.

TI  - Termite Mounds as Bio-Indicators of Groundwater: Prospects and Constraints
T2  - PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Reliance on modern sophisticated equipment for making 'discoveries' has limited the human power of observing subtle clues in the environment that are capable of saving cost and labour that come with researching new resources and methods to improve life for all. Due to the growing scarcity of potable water, especially in African and Asian countries, newer, cheaper and reliable methods of investigating groundwater resources are becoming critical. One such potentially promising method is mapping the distribution of termite mounds in the environment. Termite mounds are conspicuous landscape features in tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Built from surrounding soils by several species of termite, the properties of mound soil are relatively different from the surrounding soil in most cases, indicating improved hydraulic properties. In this paper, the aim is to review the possibility of employing termite mounds as prospecting tools for groundwater search from three spatial scales of observation. From assessing the smallest to the highest scale of observation, it can be concluded that termite mounds' prospect as surface indicators of groundwater is apparent. Review findings indicate increased surface water infiltration, presence of riparian tree vegetation and other trees with tap-root system around termite mounds, linear assemblage of termite mounds along aquiferous dykes and seep-lines as well as the dependence of termites on water but avoidance of places with risk of inundation. Whether they indicate permanent groundwater reserves in all cases or whether all species depend largely on water for their metabolism is a subject for further research.

TI  - Assessment of urban heat islands and impact of climate change on socioeconomic over Suez Governorate using remote sensing and GIS techniques
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and its effect on human life and comfort have taken increase attraction. In this paper effect of UHI is analyzed using quantitative thermal, temporal remote sensing and GIS techniques. Series of Landsat TM/ETM, 8 and ASTER images of Suez Governorate acquired in winter season were used to investigate the variation in land surface temperature (LST) from 1988 to 2014 as well as land-use/cover change. NDVI NDBI and LST have been used for classification of the study area. Vulnerable areas for UHI have been assessed over Suez district. The effect of UHI was quantitatively described using urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI). Results indicate that there are increases in the overall temperature between years 1988 and 2014. Suez and Al-Arbin districts which are the most populated, highly density built-up and rarely vegetation zones in Suez governorate experiences a huge problem of UHI. UHI phenomenon represents total weight of 40.84% and 46.3% of their areas respectively. It is found that the mean temperature of UHI areas of Al-Arbin and Al-Suez districts was 7.5 above mean of District temperature. While the value of UHI of suburban zone e.g. Ataqa and AL-Ganayin was 2.5 degree above district mean. The results indicate that changes in UTFVI distribution can be predominantly related to the expansion of urban area during the study time period. The hot spot of UTFVI were found mainly in the built-up areas especially densely populated district and in heavily industrial district. It is the vulnerable areas to UHI.

TI  - SPATIO-TEMPORAL ANALYSIS OF LAND USE AND LAND COVER CHANGES IN ARID REGION OF SAUDI ARABIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land use/land cover (LU/LC) are a major factor driving global environmental change, especially in arid and semi-arid regions. As a result, expansion of agriculture and urbanization is occurring in ecologically fragile lands. This paper analyzed and assessed land use/land cover changes in an agricultural center Tabuk in Saudi Arabia, object-based classification technique (OBC) using Landsat images for seven years (1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2009, and 2015) were used for LU/LC analysis. The urban growth type for Tabuk was measured using Urban Growth Analysis Tool (UGAT) within a GIS. The study found an increase in urban areas from 48 km(2) in 1985 to 315 km(2) in 2015. A significant increase of 61% in agricultural land, from 1985 (112 km(2)) to (577 km(2)) in 2015. This expansion is occurring at the expense of the barren land with a loss of 768 km(2). An overall classification accuracy ranged from 94% to 97% across all images. The urban growth type for Tabuk was determined as 72% to be of the extension-type over the study period, with urban areas expanding in a direction towards the northwest and west area. Assessing spatial and temporal LU/LC change has aided to understand the impacts of expanding agriculture and urban areas. The LU/LC maps could aid government planners and decision-makers to analyze and manage agricultural and urban growth.

TI  - Temperature and Humidity Regime Changes on the Black Sea Coast in 1982-2014
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Specific features of climate change in the Black Sea and on its northeastern coast for the period of 1982-2014 are investigated based on weather station data, ERA-Interim reanalysis, and satellite data on sea surface temperature. The main trends in air temperature and precipitation are revealed from weather station data and are compared with reanalysis data. The spatial peculiarities of variations in air temperature, integrated water vapor, moisture flux divergence, CAPE, and vertical velocity are analyzed. It is shown that air temperature variations on the coast highly correlate with sea surface temperature. In general, surface air temperature in the region has risen, especially in summer. Despite the increase in integrated water vapor and CAPE, no statistically significant increase was revealed for the mean amount of precipitation, for its intensity and maximum values. This fact might be associated with the moisture flux divergence increase in the region due to the intensification of large-scale downdrafts.

TI  - Comparative analysis of some winter crops area estimation using landsat-8 and sentinal-2 satellite imagery
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating crop area is a key factor for any crop monitoring and agricultural management system. Having annual information on crop acreage and production change is sufficient for agricultural decision makers and planners. The aim of this study is to monitor changes in cultivated areas and to estimate wheat crop area using satellite imagery with different spatial resolutions and time series normalize different vegetation index (NDVITs). The study is focusing on using accuracy assessment from maximum likelihood classification methods applied to multi-spatial resolution scenes (30, 20 and 10 meters) derived from Landsat8 and Sentinel-2 satellites. More specifically, NDVITs estimates from Landsat 30m, Sentinel-2 (20m), and (10m) spatial resolutions are compared to discriminate wheat crop. The study area is located in El-Minya governorate, Egypt. The results showed that the accuracy of using NDVITs data from different imageries showed higher accuracy than using one single date. The NDVITs estimate from the Sentinel-2(10m) has (81%) as an overall accuracy and (0.74) as Kappa coefficient where Sentinel-2(20m) NDVITs data has (69.38%) as an overall accuracy and (0.58) as Kappa coefficient. The lowest accuracy (64.38%) and Kappa coefficient (0.51) resulted from occurred with Landsta8 (NDVITs) data.

TI  - Quantifying forest carbon stocks by integrating satellite images and forest inventory data
T2  - AUSTRIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable biomass and carbon stock estimation are central to obtain reference levels for quantifying carbon emissions. Forest inventory data combined with remote sensing data provides opportunities to map and monitor forest areas at various spatio-temporal scales. The current research is a pilot study focussed on the biomass and carbon estimation and mapping of subtropical scrub forests of Khanpur range, Haripur Forest Division, Pakistan considering 20 inventory plots using Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 data. Six forest areas (Garamthun, Chhoi, Moharagutta, Sanaba, Dobandi and Saradana) were considered covering a total area of 697.3 ha. Average biomass of the assessed plots was 104.6 t/ha and mean carbon stock was 49.7 t/ha. Garamthun forest had the highest values for both biomass (187.30 t/ha) and carbon (87.98 t/ha) followed by Choi with 148.22 t/ha of biomass and 69.6 t/ha carbon respectively. The total estimated carbon stock for these six forest types was 43570.9 t. The biomass was then correlated with spectral indices computed from Sentinel 2 image (NDVI, SAVI, DVI, PVI and MSAVI). NDVI performed significantly well among five other indices with the values of R2 of 0.81 followed by 0.7 and 0.58 for SAVI and DVI respectively. PVI and MSAVI responded poorly to biomass as compared to the other indices with the value of R2 of 0.20 and 0.11 respectively. Spatial distribution of biomass was mapped using NDVI, which was selected as the best model based on the values of R2. Further, Landsat-8 was also used and the similar five indices were derived for Landsat-8 imagery. Finally, both the indices derived from Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 were compared. Scrub forests of Khanpur showed the largest potential for carbon sequestration and storage. It is suggested that this method is not only used for the Haripur district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, whose forest division extends merely over the area of 42491 ha; rather it should be applied to the entire forest area of Pakistan for national forest inventory. The research concluded that Sentinel 2 has the best combination of spectral capabilities and broad spectrum of applicability.

TI  - Hospital heterogeneity: what drives the quality of health care
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A major feature of health care systems is substantial variation in health care quality across hospitals. The quality of stroke care widely varies across NHS hospitals. We investigate factors that may explain variations in health care quality using measures of quality of stroke care. We combine NHS trust data from the National Sentinel Stroke Audit with other data sets from the Office for National Statistics, NHS and census data to capture hospitals' human and physical assets and organisational characteristics. We employ a class of non-parametric methods to explore the complex structure of the data and a set of correlated random effects models to identify key determinants of the quality of stroke care. The organisational quality of the process of stroke care appears as a fundamental driver of clinical quality of stroke care. There are rich complementarities amongst drivers of quality of stroke care. The findings strengthen previous research on managerial and organisational determinants of health care quality.

TI  - Potential impact of invasive surgical procedures on primary tumor growth and metastasis
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical procedures such as tumor resection and biopsy are still the gold standard for diagnosis and (determination of) treatment of solid tumors, and are prognostically beneficial for patients. However, growing evidence suggests that even a minor surgical trauma can influence several (patho) physiological processes that might promote postoperative metastatic spread and tumor recurrence. Local effects include tumor seeding and a wound healing response that can promote tumor cell migration, proliferation, differentiation, extracellular matrix remodeling, angiogenesis and extravasation. In addition, local and systemic immunosuppression impairs antitumor immunity and contributes to tumor cell survival. Surgical manipulation of the tumor can result in cancer cell release into the circulation, thus increasing the chance of tumor cell dissemination. To prevent these undesired effects of surgical interventions, therapeutic strategies targeting immune response exacerbation or alteration have been proposed. This review summarizes the current literature regarding these local, systemic and secondary site effects of surgical interventions on tumor progression and dissemination, and discusses studies that aimed to identify potential therapeutic approaches to prevent these effects in order to further increase the clinical benefit from surgical procedures.

TI  - Appraising city-scale pollution monitoring capabilities of multi-satellite datasets using portable pollutant monitors
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval characteristics for a city-scale satellite experiment was explored over a Nigerian city. The study evaluated carbon monoxide and aerosol contents in the city atmosphere. We utilized the MSA Altair 5 x gas detector and CW-HAT200 particulate counter to investigate the city-scale monitoring capabilities of satellite pollution observing instruments; atmospheric infrared sounder (AIRS), measurement of pollution in the troposphere (MOPITT), moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR) and ozone monitoring instrument (OMI). To achieve this, we employed the Kriging interpolation technique to collocate the satellite pollutant estimations over 19 ground sample sites for the period of 2015-2016. The portable pollutant devices were validated using the WHO air filter sampling model. To determine the city-scale performance of the satellite datasets, performance indicators: correlation coefficient, model efficiency, reliability index and root mean square error, were adopted as measures. The comparative analysis revealed that MOPITT carbon monoxide (CO) and MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) estimates are the appropriate satellite measurements for ground equivalents in Zaria, Nigeria. Our findings were within the acceptable limits of similar studies that utilized reference stations. In conclusion, this study offers direction to Nigeria's air quality policy organizers about available alternative air pollution measurements for mitigating air quality effects within its limited resource environment.

TI  - Continent-wide estimates of Antarctic strain rates from Landsat 8-derived velocity grids
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Strain rates are fundamental measures of ice flow and are used in a wide variety of glacio-logical applications including investigations of bed properties, calculations of basal mass balance on ice shelves, and constraints on ice rheological models. However, despite their extensive application, strain rates are calculated using a variety of methods and length scales and the details are often not specified. In this study, we compare the results of nominal and logarithmic strain-rate calculations based on a satellite-derived velocity field of the Antarctic ice sheet generated from Landsat 8 satellite data. Our comparison highlights the differences between the two common approaches in the glaciological literature. We evaluate the errors introduced by each approach and their impacts on the results. We also demonstrate the importance of choosing and specifying a length scale over which strain-rate calculations are made, which can strongly influence other derived quantities such as basal mass balance on ice shelves. Finally, we present strain-rate data products calculated using an approximate viscous length-scale with satellite observations of ice velocity for the Antarctic continent.

TI  - Intensive care unit drug costs in the context of total hospital drug expenditures with suggestions for targeted cost containment efforts
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRITICAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To assess costs of intensive care unit (ICU) related pharmacotherapy relative to hospital drug expenditures, and to identify potential targets for cost-effectiveness investigations. We offer the unique advantage of comparing ICU drug costs with previously published data a decade earlier to describe changes over time.Materials and methods: Financial transactions for all ICU patients during fiscal years (FY) 2009-2012 were retrieved from the hospital's data repository. ICU drug costs were evaluated for each FY. ICU departments' charges were also retrieved and calculated as percentages of total ICU charges.Results: Albumin, prismasate (dialysate), voriconazole, factor VII and alteplase denoted the highest percentages of ICU drug costs. ICU drug costs contributed to an average of 31% (SD 1.0%) of the hospital's total drug costs. ICU drug costs per patient day increased by 5.8% yearly versus 7.8% yearly for non-ICU drugs. This rate was higher for ICU drugs costs at 12% a decade previous. Pharmacy charges contributed to 17.7% of the total ICU charges.Conclusions: Growth rates of costs per year have declined but still drug expenditures in the ICU are consistently a significant driver in this resource intensive environment with a high impact on hospital drug expenditures.

TI  - Chart validation of inpatient ICD-9-CM administrative diagnosis codes for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) among intravenous immune globulin (IGIV) users in the Sentinel Distributed Database
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe Sentinel Distributed Database (SDD) is a large database of patient-level administrative health care records, primarily derived from insurance claims and electronic health records, and is sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration for medical product safety evaluations. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common study endpoint for drug safety studies that rely on health records from the SDD and other administrative databases.PurposeIn this chart validation study, we report on the positive predictive value (PPV) of inpatient International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification AMI administrative diagnosis codes (410.x1 and 410.x0) in the SDD.MethodsAs part of an assessment of thromboembolic adverse event risk following treatment with intravenous immune globulin, charts were obtained for 103 potential post-intravenous immune globulin AMI cases. Charts were abstracted by trained nurses and physician-adjudicated based on prespecified diagnostic criteria.ResultsAcute myocardial infarction status could be determined for 89 potential cases. The PPVs for the inpatient AMI diagnoses recorded in the SDD were 75% overall (95% CI, 65-84%), 93% (95% CI, 78-99%) for principal-position diagnoses, 88% (95% CI, 72-97%) for secondary diagnoses, and 38% (95% CI, 20-59%) for position-unspecified diagnoses (eg, diagnoses originating from separate physician claims associated with an inpatient stay). Of the confirmed AMI cases, demand ischemia was the suspected etiology more often for those coded in secondary or unspecified positions (72% and 40%, respectively) than for principal-position AMI diagnoses (21%).ConclusionsThe PPVs for principal and secondary AMI diagnoses were high and similar to estimates from prior chart validation studies. Position-unspecified diagnosis codes were less likely to represent true AMI cases.

TI  - Asymmetric Adaptation of Deep Features for Cross-Domain Classification in Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we introduce an asymmetric adaptation neural network (AANN) method for cross-domain classification in remote sensing images. Before the adaptation process, we feed the features obtained from a pretrained convolutional neural network to a denoising autoencoder (DAE) to perform dimensionality reduction. Then the first hidden layer of AANN (placed on the top of DAE) maps the labeled source data to the target space, while the subsequent layers control the separation between the available land-cover classes. To learn its weights, the network minimizes an objective function composed of two losses related to the distance between the source and target data distributions and class separation. The results of experiments conducted on six scenarios built from three benchmark scene remote sensing data sets (i.e., Merced, KSA, and AID data sets) are reported and discussed.

TI  - The use of satellite data to measure ultraviolet-B penetrance and its potential association with age of multiple sclerosis onset
T2  - MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AND RELATED DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Studies have indicated an association between low Ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure and an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS). Few studies, however, have explored whether UVB exposure is associated with the age at MS symptom onset.Objective: We investigated the potential association between cumulative early life ambient UVB exposure and age at MS onset, using satellite data to measure ambient UVB exposure.Methods: Adult onset MS patients were selected from the University of British Columbia's MS genetic database (1980-2005). Patients' places of residence from birth to age 18 years were geocoded (latitude and longitude) and assigned UVB values using NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) dataset. Linear regression was used to explore the relationship between cumulative UVB exposure (measured for age periods 0-6, 7-12, 13-18, 0-12, and 0-18) and age at MS onset.Results: 3226 patients were included in the analysis. Of these, 74% were female, with an overall mean symptom onset age of 33.3 years. At onset, a total of 2944 (91%) had a relapsing-remitting disease course, 254 (8%) had primary progressive and the disease course for 28 (1%) was unknown. No significant associations between cumulative early life ambient UVB exposure and age at MS onset were observed. Patient sex, MS phenotype, and immigration to Canada after age 18 were significantly associated with age of onset (p < 0.01).Conclusions: Early life ambient UVB, as measured by satellite imagery, was not significantly associated with the age at MS onset.

TI  - Modeling Surface Energy Fluxes over a Dehesa (Oak Savanna) Ecosystem Using a Thermal Based Two Source Energy Balance Model (TSEB) II-Integration of Remote Sensing Medium and Low Spatial Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dehesas are highly valuable agro-forestry ecosystems, widely distributed over Mediterranean-type climate areas, which play a key role in rural development, basing their productivity on a sustainable use of multiple resources (crops, livestock, wildlife, etc.). The information derived from remote sensing based models addressing ecosystem water consumption, at different scales, can be used by institutions and private landowners to support management decisions. In this study, the Two-Source Energy Balance (TSEB) model is analyzed over two Spanish dehesa areas integrating multiple satellites (MODIS and Landsat) for estimating water use (ET), vegetation ground cover, leaf area and phenology. Instantaneous latent heat (LE) values are derived on a regional scale and compared with eddy covariance tower (ECT) measurements, yielding accurate results (RMSDMODIS Las Majadas 44 Wm(-2), Santa Clotilde RMSDMODIS 47 Wm(-2) and RMSDLandsat 64 Wm(-2)). Daily ET(mm) is estimated using daily return interval of MODIS for both study sites and compared with the flux measurements of the ECTs, with RMSD of 1 mm day(-1) over Las Majadas and 0.99 mm day(-1) over Santa Clotilde. Distributed ET over Andalusian dehesa (15% of the region) is successfully mapped using MODIS images, as an approach to monitor the ecosystem status and the vegetation water stress on a regular basis.

TI  - Thaw Subsidence of a Yedoma Landscape in Northern Siberia, Measured In Situ and Estimated from TerraSAR-X Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In permafrost areas, seasonal freeze-thaw cycles result in upward and downward movements of the ground. For some permafrost areas, long-term downward movements were reported during the last decade. We measured seasonal and multi-year ground movements in a yedoma region of the Lena River Delta, Siberia, in 2013-2017, using reference rods installed deep in the permafrost. The seasonal subsidence was 1.7 +/- 1.5 cm in the cold summer of 2013 and 4.8 +/- 2 cm in the warm summer of 2014. Furthermore, we measured a pronounced multi-year net subsidence of 9.3 +/- 5.7 cm from spring 2013 to the end of summer 2017. Importantly, we observed a high spatial variability of subsidence of up to 6 cm across a sub-meter horizontal scale. In summer 2013, we accompanied our field measurements with Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) on repeat-pass TerraSAR-X (TSX) data from the summer of 2013 to detect summer thaw subsidence over the same study area. Interferometry was strongly affected by a fast phase coherence loss, atmospheric artifacts, and possibly the choice of reference point. A cumulative ground movement map, built from a continuous interferogram stack, did not reveal a subsidence on the upland but showed a distinct subsidence of up to 2 cm in most of the thermokarst basins. There, the spatial pattern of DInSAR-measured subsidence corresponded well with relative surface wetness identified with the near infra-red band of a high-resolution optical image. Our study suggests that (i) although X-band SAR has serious limitations for ground movement monitoring in permafrost landscapes, it can provide valuable information for specific environments like thermokarst basins, and (ii) due to the high sub-pixel spatial variability of ground movements, a validation scheme needs to be developed and implemented for future DInSAR studies in permafrost environments.

TI  - A TOPSIS approach-based morphometric analysis for sub-watersheds prioritization of high Oum Er-Rbia basin, Morocco
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study area covers 1871 km(2) is located in the upstream of Oum Er-Rbia river basin, between latitudes 33 degrees and 34 degrees North, and longitudes 4 degrees 30' and 5 degrees 20' East. Watersheds prioritization based on morphometric parameters through the analysis of linear, areal and relief aspects is necessary in order to develop a sustainable watersheds management plan. The High Oum Er-Rbia basin has been subdivided into 17 sub-watersheds using remote sensing data (Aster-DEM) and Geographic Information System. For prioritization of sub-watersheds. The Multi-Criteria Analysis through the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), were applied to determine the relative weights of various parameters. Linear parameters; such as bifurcation ratio (Rb), drainage density (Dd), stream frequency (Fs), drainage texture (Dt), and shape parameters such as form factor (Rf), shape basin (Bs), elongation ratio (Re), compactness constant (Cc), and circularity ratio (Rc). The present study is an attempt to use TOPSIS approach based morphometric indices for prioritization of watersheds for water and soil resources conservation and management. The results show that sub-watersheds 2 and 6 have been ranked 1 and 2 assigned to highest closeness (C-i(+)) to ideal solution with 0.6838 and 0.6788 respectively. These sub-watersheds must be given the highest priority for soil and water conservation measures, to insure future sustainable agriculture, water quality and to prevent silting of Ahmed El-Hansali Dam.

TI  - Open and scalable analytics of large Earth observation datasets: From scenes to multidimensional arrays using SciDB and GDAL
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation (EO) datasets are commonly provided as collection of scenes, where individual scenes represent a temporal snapshot and cover a particular region on the Earth's surface. Using these data in complex spatiotemporal modeling becomes difficult as soon as data volumes exceed a certain capacity or analyses include many scenes, which may spatially overlap and may have been recorded at different dates. In order to facilitate analytics on large EO datasets, we combine and extend the geospatial data abstraction library (GDAL) and the array-based data management and analytics system SciDB. We present an approach to automatically convert collections of scenes to multidimensional arrays and use SciDB to scale computationally intensive analytics. We evaluate the approach in three study cases on national scale land use change monitoring with Landsat imagery, global empirical orthogonal function analysis of daily precipitation, and combining historical climate model projections with satellite-based observations. Results indicate that the approach can be used to represent various EO datasets and that analyses in SciDB scale well with available computational resources. To simplify analyses of higher dimensional datasets as from climate model output, however, a generalization of the GDAL data model might be needed. All parts of this work have been implemented as open-source software and we discuss how this may facilitate open and reproducible EO analyses. (C) 2018 The Authors.

T2  - REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE GEOMATIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation is a rapidly evolving domain. The European Space Agency recently launched the satellites of the Sentinel series, which will deliver between 8 and 10 TB of data per day, opening emerging opportunities in domains ranging from agriculture and environmental monitoring to urban planning, oceanography and climate studies. Domain-oriented applications require that images be enriched with data coming from various sources, that allow to better support decision-making processes related to the observed areas. One of the challenges to be addressed then concerns the integration of heterogeneous data. In this context, semantic technologies play a key role by providing an infrastructure based on standard models for representing data and on ontologies. We present a semantic approach to integrate data with the aim of enriching metadata of satellite imagery with data from various sources that are relevant to describe Earth observations for a particular need. We propose a semantic vocabulary, a formalization of spatio-temporal relationships as well as an integration process of various geospatial data sets. We illustrate our approach through a case study exploiting meteorological data.

TI  - Prediction of river bank erosion and protection works in a reach of Chenab River, Pakistan
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of floods on river bank erosion are generally significant in the alluvial river reaches. This paper presents the prediction of the river bank erosion along the right bank in the reach of Chenab River (starting from downstream of Marala Barrage) where excessive erosion had been reported. The bank erosion is predicted due to flow/flood events of 2010 by coupling the output from the two- dimensional numerical model to the excess shear stress approach. The predicted bank erosion was compared with the one estimated from Landsat images. The Landsat ETM+ images were processed in the ArcGIS software to assess the external bank erosion. The results show that the excess shear stress approach underpredicts the bank erosion. Therefore, the erodibility coefficient was modified by forcing the best agreement between predicted and estimated (i.e., from Landsat images) bank erosion which was used for further analysis. The results reveal that coupling the output from the numerical model to the excess shear stress approach (by modifying the erodibility coefficient) predicts the river bank erosion with a reasonable level of accuracy, thus helpful to identify the locations for the protection works. The predicted river bank erosion presents good coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.82 when compared with the estimated bank erosion from Landsat images. The findings of the present study will help to implement the river protection works at the identified locations in the selected reach of River Chenab and will also act as a guideline for similar river reaches.

TI  - Investigating the use of Alos Prism data in detecting mangrove succession through canopy height estimation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangroves have been massively degraded and deforested throughout the world, despite their known ecological and economic values. This study demonstrates the use of ALOS Global Digital Surface Model World (AW3D30) DSM dataset acquired between 2006 and 2011 to map canopy height of different succession stages of mangroves. We employed our previously developed canopy height model for assessing mangrove canopy height in three sites that vary in latitudinal position and mangrove degradation levels, ranging from relatively pristine mangrove ecosystems in Mimika Papua, Indonesia and Sundarbans, Bangladesh to severely degraded mangrove ecosystems in the Mahakam Delta, Indonesia. The study demonstrates good agreement between modeled and measured canopy height from these three sites as indicated by small mean absolute errors of 3.38 m at Mimika, 2.54 m at Sundarbans, and 2.89 m in the Mahakam Delta site. These findings further showed that, in the absence of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based elevation data (such as SRTM and TanDEM-X), the ALOS PRISM data can be used to map mangrove heights (or in combination with SAR-based elevation data). Our results also pointed out that the ALOS data can differentiate the variability of canopy height estimation between an intact mangrove and severely degraded mangrove ecosystem.

TI  - Late Quaternary glaciation of the northern Urals: a review and new observations
T2  - BOREAS
M3  - Review
AB  - This is a synthesis of the glacial history of the northern Urals undertaken using published works and the results of geological surveys as well as recent geochronometric and remote sensing data. The conclusions differ from the classical model that considers the Urals as an important source of glacial ice and partly from the modern reconstructions. The principal supporting evidence for the conventional model - Uralian erratics found on the adjacent plains - is ambiguous because Uralian clasts were also delivered by a thick external ice sheet overriding the mountains during the Middle Pleistocene. Alternative evidence presented in this paper indicates that in the late Quaternary the Ural mountains produced only valley glaciers that partly coalesced in the western piedmont to form large piedmont lobes. The last maximum glaciation occurred in the Early Valdaian time at c. 70-90 ka when glacial ice from the Kara shelf invaded the lowlands and some montane valleys but an icecap over the mountains was not formed. The moraines of the alpine glaciation are preserved only beyond the limits of the Kara ice sheet and therefore cannot be younger than MIS 4. More limited glaciation during MIS 2 generated small alpine moraines around the cirques of the western Urals (Mangerud etal. 2008: Quaternary Science Reviews 27, 1047). The largest moraines of Transuralia were probably produced by the outlet glaciers of a Middle Pleistocene ice sheet that formed on the western plains and discharged across the Polar Urals. The resultant scheme of limited mountain glaciation is possibly also applicable as a model for older glacial cycles.

TI  - Blind technique for point spread function equalization with application to the Multi-Order Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph
T2  - JOURNAL OF ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES INSTRUMENTS AND SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - When combining remote sensing data from multiple instruments or multiple imaging channels, differences in point spread function (PSF) can lead to systematic error. If the PSFs are not well known, then it is difficult to determine which differences in the image data are meaningful for the object being observed and which are artifacts of PSF. Direct PSF measurements can be problematic. For example, in a sounding rocket payload, launch vibrations and acceleration, subsequent operations in micro gravity, and the impact on return to Earth may all affect PSFs. We have developed a blind method to equalize the PSFs of three distinct instrument channels, as found in the Multi-Order Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrograph (MOSES). To validate our technique, we generate three synthetic images with three different PSFs, with some spectrally interesting features. Thence, we demonstrate the successful removal of PSF-induced artifacts is possible, with the genuine spectral features left intact. We also perform blind PSF equalizations on three copies of the same solar image, but with differing PSFs, after applying independent noise to each. The results accurately reproduce corrections performed in the absence of noise, with full knowledge of the PSFs. Finally, we apply PSF equalization to solar images obtained in the 2006 MOSES flight and demonstrate the removal of artifacts. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Association between US features of primary tumor and axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with clinical T1-T2N0 breast cancer
T2  - ACTA RADIOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Most patients with early-stage breast cancer have clinically negative lymph nodes (LNs). However, 15-20% of patients have axillary nodal metastasis based on the sentinel LN biopsy.Purpose: To assess whether ultrasound (US) features of a primary tumor are associated with axillary LN metastasis in patients with clinical T1-T2N0 breast cancer.Material and Methods: This retrospective study included 138 consecutive patients (median age = 51 years; age range = 27-78 years) who underwent breast surgery with axillary LN evaluation for clinically node-negative T1-T2 breast cancer. Three radiologists blinded to the axillary surgery results independently reviewed the US images. Tumor distance from the skin and distance from the nipple were determined based on the US report. Association between US features of a breast tumor and axillary LN metastasis was assessed using a multivariate logistic regression model after controlling for clinicopathologic variables.Results: Of the 138 patients, 28 (20.3%) had nodal metastasis. At univariate analysis, tumor distance from the skin (P = 0.019), tumor size on US (P = 0.023), calcifications (P = 0.036), architectural distortion (P = 0.001), and lymphovascular invasion (P = 0.049) were associated with axillary LN metastasis. At multivariate analysis, shorter skin-to-tumor distance (odds ratio [OR] = 4.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01-16.19; P = 0.040) and masses with associated architectural distortion (OR = 3.80; 95% CI = 1.57-9.19; P = 0.003) were independent predictors of axillary LN metastasis.Conclusion: US features of breast cancer can be promising factors associated with axillary LN metastasis in patients with clinically node-negative early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - A hybrid approach for monitoring future thermal environment in tropical areas
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The manifestation of urban heat, due to changes in the surface physical components, is a well recognized example of man's alteration of the natural environment. In this study, an attempt was made to project the future urban thermal changes by integrating a statistical approach with remote sensing techniques. Landsat observed TM, ETM+, and TIRS/OLI data for the periods 1986, 2000, and 2014 were used to examine the spatio-temporal changes in land surface temperature associated with urbanization process in the tropical City of Akure, Nigeria. Quantitative analysis on the past and future (2028 and 2042) land surface temperature (LST) impacts of urban land cover change was carried out using a hybrid Cellular Automata/Markov (CA_Markov) model and a step-wise multiple regression model. The result of the projected LST ranged from 19.79 to 40.97 degrees C in 2028, and from 20.68 to 44.15 degrees C for 2042. It was found that there was no significant increase in the hybrid CA_Markov projected LST in the City centres when compared with earlier years. However, the sub-urban and rural areas that are undergoing rapid urbanisation processes, as confirmed in the literature, have been observed to transit from a low and medium to high thermal zones in 2028 and 2042.

TI  - Measurements on the Absolute 2-D and 3-D Localization Accuracy of TerraSAR-X
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The German TerraSAR-X radar satellites TSX-1 and TDX-1 are well-regarded for their unprecedented geolocation accuracy. However, to access their full potential, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based location measurements have to be carefully corrected for effects that are well-known in the area of geodesy but were previously often neglected in the area of SAR, such as wave propagation and Earth dynamics. Our measurements indicate that in this way, when SAR is handled as a geodetic measurement instrument, absolute localization accuracy at better than centimeter level with respect to a given geodetic reference frame is obtained in 2-D and, when using stereo SAR techniques, also in 3-D. The TerraSAR-X measurement results presented in this study are based on a network of three globally distributed geodetic observatories. Each is equipped with one or two trihedral comer reflectors with accurately (<5 mm) known reference coordinates, used as a reference for the verification of the SAR measured coordinates. Because these observatories are located in distant parts of the world, they give us evidence on the worldwide reproducibility of the obtained results. In this paper we report the achieved results of measurements performed over 6 1/2 years (from July 2011 to January 2018) and refer to some first new application areas for geodetic SAR.

TI  - PSMA-11-Derived Dual-Labeled PSMA Inhibitors for Preoperative PET Imaging and Precise Fluorescence-Guided Surgery of Prostate Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Resection of tumors using targeted dual-modality probes combining preoperative imaging with intraoperative guidance is of high clinical relevance and might considerably affect the outcome of prostate cancer therapy. This work aimed at the development of dual-labeled prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) inhibitors derived from the established N,N'-bis[2-hydroxy-5-(carboxyethyl)benzyl]ethylenediamine-N, N'-diacetic acid (HBED-CC)-based PET tracer Ga-68-Glu-urea-Lys (Ahx)-HBED-CC (Ga-68-PSMA-11) to allow accurate intraoperative detection of PSMA-positive tumors. Methods: A series of novel PSMA-targeting fluorescent dye conjugates of Glu-urea-Lys-HBED-CC was synthesized, and their biologic properties were determined in cell-based assays and confocal microscopy. As a preclinical proof of concept, specific tumor uptake, pharmacokinetics, and feasibility for intraoperative fluorescence guidance were investigated in tumor-bearing mice and healthy pigs. Results: The designed dual-labeled PSMA inhibitors exhibited high binding affinity and PSMA-specific effective internalization. Conjugation of fluorescein isothiocyanate (10.86 +/- 0.94 percentage injected dose [%ID]/g), IRDye800CW (13.66 +/- 3.73 %ID/g), and DyLight800 (15.62 +/- 5.52 % ID/g) resulted in a significantly increased specific tumor uptake, whereas Ga-68-Glu-urea-Lys-HBED-CC-AlexaFluor488 (9.12 +/- 5.47 % ID/g) revealed a tumor uptake similar to that of Ga-68-PSMA-11 (4.89 +/- 1.34 %ID/g). The first proof-of-concept studies with the clinically relevant candidate Ga-68-Glu-urea-Lys-HBED-CC-IRDye800CW reinforced a fast, specific enrichment in PSMA-positive tumors, with rapid background clearance. With regard to intraoperative navigation, a specific fluorescence signal was detected in PSMA-expressing tissue. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that PSMA-11-derived dual-labeled dye conjugates are feasible for providing PSMA-specific pre-, intra-, and postoperative detection of prostate cancer lesions and have high potential for future clinical translation.

TI  - Current land use and hydrogeomorphological quality of the San Antonio River: alternatives for the fluvial restoration in northern Peru
T2  - REVISTA INVESTIGACIONES ALTOANDINAS-JOURNAL OF HIGH ANDEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the study was to evaluate the current land use and hydrogeomorphological quality in the San Antonio River, located between the provinces of Chachapoyas and Rodriguez de Mendoza in the Department of Amazonas (Peru). The land uses were estimated using the supervised classification method for the Sentinel 2A images, while the assessment of the quality of the fluvial system was carried out through the application of the hydrogeomorphological index (IHG) in each functional sector. The results reported that the soil cover in the San Antonio microbasin is managed in the following way: 44.50% occupied by crops, 36.09% by forests, 11.24% by pasture, 7.56% by grassland and shrubs, and 0.61% is an urban area and water bodies. In turn, the hydrogeomorphological quality of the San Antonio River is in a range of quality from Very Good to Deficient, with a greater anthropic impact in the middle and lower sections of the river. It is concluded that the use of soil influences hydrogeomorphological quality due to agricultural activities, urban use and extraction of construction materials in the riverbed, which contributes to the degradation of the fluvial system.

TI  - Inferring Water Table Depth Dynamics from ENVISAT-ASAR C-Band Backscatter over a Range of Peatlands from Deeply-Drained to Natural Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water table depth (WTD) is one of the key variables controlling many processes in peatlands. Reliable WTD estimates based on remote sensing data would advance peatland research from global-scale climate monitoring to field-scale ecosystem management. Here, we evaluate the relationship between ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) C-band backscatter (sigma degrees) and in situ observed WTD dynamics over 17 peatlands in Germany covering deeply-drained to natural conditions, excluding peatlands dominated by forest or inundation periods. The results show increasing sigma degrees with shallower WTD (= wetter conditions), with average temporal Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.38 and 0.54 (-) for natural (also including disturbed and rewetted/restored states) and agriculturally-used drained peatlands, respectively. The anomaly correlation further highlights the potential of ASAR backscatter to capture interannual variations with values of 0.33 and 0.43 (-), for natural and drained peatlands. The skill metrics, which are similar to those for evaluations of top soil moisture from C-band over mineral soils, indicate a strong capillary connection between WTD and the ' C-band-sensitive' top 1-2 cm of peat soils, even during dry periods with WTD at around -1 m. Various backscatter processing algorithms were tested without significant differences. The cross-over angle concept for correcting dynamical vegetation effects was tested, but not superior, to constant incidence angle correction.

TI  - CHILDREN'S LITERATURE OF THE SOVIET PERIOD AS A SOURCE OF PHILOSOPHICAL IDEAS (CASE OF NIKOLAI NOSOV)
T2  - HUMAN AFFAIRS-POSTDISCIPLINARY HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the research is due to the interest of modern science in the successful experience of comprehending social reality and of social forecasting in forms nontrivial for systematic rational thinking. T topic is especially important in the context of global instability, in which human civilization has been living for the last decades. The main question is the possible existence of a critical philosophy in terms of the ideological pressure of the Soviet period. The author substantiates the hypothesis that children's literature could be a form of free development of philosophical thinking, permissible in these circumstances. The research is of practical value to humanities scholars studying Soviet and post-Soviet period Russian culture, literature, philosophy, regardless of their theoretical and ideological orientations, since it examines the philosophical aspects in the works by the Soviet children's writer Nikolai Nosov, author of trilogy about Dunno (rus. Neznajka), and not well-known abroad. The article justifies the opinion that Nosov's creative heritage is underestimated both in Russian and foreign humanities and not sufficiently analyzed. Through the analysis of N. Nosov's texts, undertaken by Russian and foreign scholars and publicists (among which L. Abdel-Rahim and L. Karawan deserve a special mention), implicit social and philosophical ideas are revealed, and the basic social forecasting is determined in relation to the society of 'developed socialism'. Marxist philosophy had a significant impact on N. Nosov's worldview; however, the writer is alien to the ideological blinders of the dominant forms of Soviet philosophy. Nosov's Marxism in the form of popular 'children's' discourse suddenly finds itself able to effectively implement critical and prognostic function of philosophy. Being decades ahead of Soviet ideologists and philosophers in this respect, N. Nosov convincingly showed the problem nature of 'developed socialism'. An important diagnosis of this society and a forecast for its future is possible 'breakdown' of the historical process (despite scientific and technical achievements) due to the insufficient level of culture and consciousness, the immaturity of social relations.

TI  - Decision-Tree, Rule-Based, and Random Forest Classification of High-Resolution Multispectral Imagery for Wetland Mapping and Inventory
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Efforts are increasingly being made to classify the world's wetland resources, an important ecosystem and habitat that is diminishing in abundance. There are multiple remote sensing classification methods, including a suite of nonparametric classifiers such as decision-tree (DT), rule-based (RB), and random forest (RF). High-resolution satellite imagery can provide more specificity to the classified end product, and ancillary data layers such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and hydrogeomorphic layers such as distance-to-a-stream can be coupled to improve overall accuracy (OA) in wetland studies. In this paper, we contrast three nonparametric machine-learning algorithms (DT, RB, and RF) using a large field-based dataset (n = 228) from the Selenga River Delta of Lake Baikal, Russia. We also explore the use of ancillary data layers selected to improve OA, with a goal of providing end users with a recommended classifier to use and the most parsimonious suite of input parameters for classifying wetland-dominated landscapes. Though all classifiers appeared suitable, the RF classification outperformed both the DT and RB methods, achieving OA > 81%. Including a texture metric (homogeneity) substantially improved the classification OA. However, including vegetation/ soil/ water metrics (based on WorldView-2 band combinations), hydrogeomorphic data layers, and elevation data layers to increase the descriptive content of the input parameters surprisingly did not markedly improve the OA. We conclude that, in most cases, RF should be the classifier of choice. The potential exception to this recommendation is under the circumstance where the end user requires narrative rules to best manage his or her resource. Though not useful in this study, continuously increasing satellite imagery resolution and band availability suggests the inclusion of ancillary contextual data layers such as soil metrics or elevation data, the granularity of which may define its utility in subsequent wetland classifications.

TI  - Using Stereo Satellite Imagery to Account for Ablation, Entrainment, and Compaction in Volume Calculations for Rock Avalanches on Glaciers: Application to the 2016 Lamplugh Rock Avalanche in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of preevent and postevent digital elevation models (DEMs) to estimate the volume of rock avalanches on glaciers is complicated by ablation of ice before and after the rock avalanche, scour of material during rock avalanche emplacement, and postevent ablation and compaction of the rock avalanche deposit. We present a model to account for these processes in volume estimates of rock avalanches on glaciers. We applied our model by calculating the volume of the 28 June 2016 Lamplugh rock avalanche in Glacier Bay National Park, Alaska. We derived preevent and postevent 2-m resolution DEMs from WorldView satellite stereo imagery. Using data from DEM differencing, we reconstructed the rock avalanche and adjacent surfaces at the time of occurrence by accounting for elevation changes due to ablation and scour of the ice surface, and postevent deposit changes. We accounted for uncertainties in our DEMs through precise coregistration and an assessment of relative elevation accuracy in bedrock control areas. The rock avalanche initially displaced 51.7 +/- 1.5 Mm(3) of intact rock and then scoured and entrained 13.2 +/- 2.2 Mm(3) of snow and ice during emplacement. We calculated the total deposit volume to be 69.9 +/- 7.9 Mm(3). Volume estimates that did not account for topographic changes due to ablation, scour, and compaction underestimated the deposit volume by 31.0-46.8 Mm(3). Our model provides an improved framework for estimating uncertainties affecting rock avalanche volume measurements in glacial environments. These improvements can contribute to advances in the understanding of rock avalanche hazards and dynamics.

TI  - Multi-organ IgG4-related disease: Demystifying the diagnostic enigma
T2  - JOURNAL OF POSTGRADUATE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a multisystemic mass forming immune-mediated disease entity, commonly creating confusion and diagnostic challenges. We present a case of a 25-year-old female who presented with bilateral orbital masses, lymphadenopathy, paraspinal and renal masses, which clinicoradiologically simulated lymphoma. The lymph node biopsy revealed interfollicular sheets of plasma cells creating confusion with Castleman's disease and marginal zone lymphoma. The orbital biopsy revealed ductular destruction, periductular plasma cells, and fibrosis, mimicking Sjogren's syndrome and Castleman's disease. However, the correlation of the clinical features with histopathological findings, IgG4 immunopositivity, and serum studies helped in clinching the diagnosis. This case presents an uncommon combination of clinical features infrequently reported in literature. Furthermore, and more importantly, it highlights the need to keep a differential of IgG4-RD in mind, to aid early and correct treatment of the disease.

TI  - Axillary lymph node as sentinel for mammary neoplasia in bitches
T2  - PESQUISA VETERINARIA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - Mammary tumors research in bitches is important due to their high incidence. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the axillary lymph node as a sentinel lymph node for mammary neoplasms in female dogs. Forty-nine bitches with mammary neoplasia were submitted to total unilateral mastectomy, and the axillary lymph node was identified using the patent blue dye. This lymph node was processed routinely for histopathological analysis and stained with hematoxylin-eosin and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) with cytokeratin antibody (AE1/AE3) to search for metastasis. Eight dogs had axillary lymph node metastases, seven of which were detected by histopathology and by IHC and only one by IHC (micrometastasis). One dog who presented tumor in caudal and inguinal abdominal mammary glands had metastases in the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes. It is concluded that the mammary tumor can cause alteration in lymphatic drainage leading to metastases in lymph nodes which normally do not drain certain glands; so the removal of the axillary lymph node should be included as a routine technique to allow better staging of mammary neoplasms of bitches.

TI  - Applying fuzzy logic to open data for sustainable development decision-making: a case study of the planned city Amaravati
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indian State of Andhra Pradesh is in the process of designing and constructing a planned capital city on the southern banks of the Krishna River at Amaravati. This region will see a significant increase in urban land cover and impervious surface area (ISA) under the 2050 draft perspective plan from the Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority. As the city central zone sits on the former floodplain of the Krishna River and is subject to concentrated rainfall during monsoon seasons-this increase in ISA risks increasing flood risk through preventing infiltration of storm water and causing increased peak storm water flow (NRSC 2014). The State has announced plans for a "zero-flooding city" through implementation of technologies including green roofs, porous pavement, and detention ponds (ADC 2017). This study aims to facilitate these efforts through mapping of present and future land usage, regional flood risk, and environmental services utilizing open-source data in order to maximize efficiency of installed green infrastructure and minimize future flood damages. A map of relative soil infiltration capacity was created through fuzzy overlay of sand percentage, clay percentage, and bulk density at several depths. Relative flood risk maps for both present-day land cover and a 2050 scenario were developed using several factors: elevation, flow accumulation, surface runoff, and soil properties. A novel Relative Environmental Services Provided Index is proposed here to in order to encourage cost-effective and ecologically sound development through composite visualization of carbon storage, greenery, runoff coefficients, and soil flood prevention.

T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The central area of Argentina has been greatly affected mainly due to urbanization and intensive agriculture (corn, soybean and cattle). Age, longevity and growth were determined in populations of the common toad, Rhinella arenarum, from urban and agricultural sites in the central area of Argentina. Five sites in Rio Cuarto (33 degrees 05'52.95 '' S - 64 degrees 26'02.99 '' W, 471 m a.s.l.; Cordoba Province, Argentina) with different degree of anthropic disturbance were selected to evaluate the impact of urbanization and agriculture on common toad populations as sentinel species. The selected sites were chosen according to intensive to moderate agricultural and livestock activity, low influence of agricultural and an intensive to moderate urban influence. A total of 114 adults (males and females) were sampled. Skeletochronology was used to estimate toad's growth and age, which relies on the analysis of the annual Lines of Arrested Growth or LAGs in bones. Size, age and growth reductions occurrence in intensive agricultural systems could suggest long term impacts on fitness. In addition, intensive urban activity also affects life history of the population of R. arenarum, although to a lesser extent than the agricultural-livestock activity.

TI  - Evaluating static and dynamic landscape connectivity modelling using a 25-year remote sensing time series
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite calls for landscape connectivity research to account for spatiotemporal dynamics, studies have overwhelmingly evaluated the importance of habitats for connectivity at single or limited moments in time. Remote sensing time series represent a promising resource for studying connectivity within dynamic ecosystems. However, there is a critical need to assess how static and dynamic landscape connectivity modelling approaches compare for prioritising habitats for conservation within dynamic environments.To assess whether static landscape connectivity analyses can identify similar important areas for connectivity as analyses based on dynamic remotely sensed time series data.We compared degree and betweenness centrality graph theory metric distributions from four static scenarios against equivalent results from a dynamic 25-year remotely sensed surface-water time series. Metrics were compared at multiple spatial aggregation scales across south-eastern Australia's 1 million km(2) semi-arid Murray-Darling Basin and three sub-regions with varying levels of hydroclimatic variability and development.We revealed large differences between static and dynamic connectivity metric distributions that varied by static scenario, region, spatial scale and hydroclimatic conditions. Static and dynamic metrics showed particularly low overlap within unregulated and spatiotemporally variable regions, although similarities increased at coarse aggregation scales.In regions that exhibit high spatiotemporal variability, static connectivity modelling approaches are unlikely to serve as effective surrogates for more data intensive approaches based on dynamic, remotely sensed data. Although this limitation may be moderated by spatially aggregating static connectivity outputs, our results highlight the value of remotely sensed time series for assessing connectivity in dynamic landscapes.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has become one of the most crucial parameters for climate change assessment. This study presents long-term (2002-2016) spatio-temporal distributions and trends in AOD over East Africa (EA) retrieved from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua [Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB)] and multi-angle imaging spectroradiometer (MISR). An inter-comparison of AODs retrieved from different algorithms noticed significant positive correlations (r = 0.72-0.87) with MISR underestimating MODIS. Moderate (>0.5-0.8) to high (>= 0.8) correlations in AOD exhibited over EA, with a few regions representing low (0-0.5) positive correlations. The spatial patterns of annual mean AOD were generally characterized by low (<0.2), moderate (0.2-0.35) and high (>0.35) centres over EA. The seasonal mean AODs over EA were found high (low) during the local dry (wet) seasons, with annual mean (+/-sigma) values of 0.20 +/- 0.01, 0.18 +/- 0.01 and 0.20 +/- 0.02 as observed by DT, DB and MISR, respectively. A single peak distribution of frequencies in AOD was observed by the three sensors in the interval 0.1-0.2, signifying a generally less polluted environment dominated by particular aerosol type. Linear trend analysis revealed an increase in AOD by 0.52, 0.57 and 0.74% year(-1) as detected by MISR, DT and DB, respectively, and were consistent with those noted in key meteorological parameters. Furthermore, annual and seasonal spatial trends and tendencies revealed a general increase in AOD over EA, being positive and significant over the northern part of EA. Later, classification of major aerosol types over major cities in EA revealed dominance of continental (74.47%) followed by the mixed (16.22%) and biomass-burning/urban-industrial (8.02%) aerosols, with minor contributions from desert dust (1.03%) and clean maritime (0.32%) type of aerosols.

TI  - Updating stand-level forest inventories using airborne laser scanning and Landsat time series data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical forest structure can be mapped over large areas by combining samples of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data with wall-to-wall spatial data, such as Landsat imagery. Here, we use samples of ALS data and Landsat time series metrics to produce estimates of top height, basal area, and net stem volume for two timber supply areas near Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada, using an imputation approach. Both single-year and time series metrics were calculated from annual, gap-free Landsat reflectance composites representing 1984-2014. Metrics included long-term means of vegetation indices, as well as measures of the variance and slope of the indices through time. Terrain metrics, generated from a 30 m digital elevation model, were also included as predictors. We found that imputation models improved with the inclusion of Landsat time series metrics when compared to single-year Landsat metrics (relative RMSE decreased from 22.8% to 16.5% for top height, from 32.1% to 23.3% for basal area, and from 45.6% to 34.1% for net stem volume). Landsat metrics that characterized 30-years of stand history resulted in more accurate models (for all three structural attributes) than Landsat metrics that characterized only the most recent 10 or 20 years of stand history. To test model transferability, we compared imputed attributes against ALS-based estimates in nearby forest blocks (> 150,000 ha) that were not included in model training or testing. Landsat-imputed attributes correlated strongly to ALS-based estimates in these blocks (R-2 = 0.62 and relative RMSE = 13.1% for top height, R-2 = 0.75 and relative RMSE = 17.8% for basal area, and R-2 = 0.67 and relative RMSE = 26.5% for net stem volume), indicating model transferability. These findings suggest that in areas containing spatially-limited ALS data acquisitions, imputation models, and Landsat time series and terrain metrics can be effectively used to produce wall-to-wall estimates of key inventory attributes, providing an opportunity to update estimates of forest attributes in areas where inventory information is either out of date or non-existent.

TI  - A Methodology to Detect and Characterize Uplift Phenomena in Urban Areas Using Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a methodology to exploit the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry ( PSI) time series acquired by Sentinel-1 sensors for the detection and characterization of uplift phenomena in urban areas. The methodology has been applied to the Tower Hamlets Council area of London ( United Kingdom) using Sentinel-1 data covering the period 2015-2017. The test area is a representative high-urbanized site affected by geohazards due to natural processes such as compaction of recent deposits, and also anthropogenic causes due to groundwater management and engineering works. The methodology has allowed the detection and characterization of a 5 km 2 area recording average uplift rates of 7 mm/ year and a maximum rate of 18 mm/ year in the period May 2015-March 2017. Furthermore, the analysis of the Sentinel-1 time series highlights that starting from August 2016 uplift rates began to decrease. A comparison between the uplift rates and urban developments as well as geological, geotechnical, and hydrogeological factors suggests that the ground displacements occur in a particular geological context and are mainly attributed to the swelling of clayey soils. The detected uplift could be attributed to a transient effect of the groundwater rebound after completion of dewatering works for the recent underground constructions.

TI  - The Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) Part 1: Methodology and High Spectral Resolution Application
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As part of a National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) MEaSUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) Land Surface Temperature and Emissivity project, the Space Science and Engineering Center (UW-Madison) and the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed a global monthly mean emissivity Earth System Data Record (ESDR). This new Combined ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) and MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Emissivity over Land (CAMEL) ESDR was produced by merging two current state-of-the-art emissivity datasets: the UW-Madison MODIS Infrared emissivity dataset (UW BF) and the JPL ASTER Global Emissivity Dataset Version 4 (GEDv4). The dataset includes monthly global records of emissivity and related uncertainties at 13 hinge points between 3.6-14.3 [tm, as well as principal component analysis (PCA) coefficients at 5-km resolution for the years 2000 through 2016. A high spectral resolution (HSR) algorithm is provided for HSR applications. This paper describes the 13 hinge-points combination methodology and the high spectral resolutions algorithm, as well as reports the current status of the dataset.

TI  - A methodology for ground motion area detection (GMA-D) using A-DInSAR time series in landslide investigations
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the Advanced Differential Interferometric Synthetic-Aperture Radar (A-DInSAR) technique has advanced rapidly for detecting and monitoring ground surface deformations due to landslides. Identification of the areas affected by ground motion through A-DInSAR data is generally based on visual inspection and hotspot or cluster analysis of average displacement rates. However, interpreting A-DInSAR time series of a particular area can provide a better indication of the real trend of displacement of a landslide, while identifying the possible moment of acceleration of the deformation process as well. In this work, a novel methodology is proposed for identifying different typologies of ground motion areas mainly related to landslide phenomena at a regional scale, by means of A-DinSAR data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. This methodological approach was tested and validated in a wide area of the Piedmont region (northern Italy), by means of RADARSAT and COSMO-SkyMed satellite data, in both ascending and descending modes. These sensors have a high spatial resolution, allowing investigation of a higher number of landslides as compared to that of the older ERS-1/2 and Envisat data. Linear (constant in time displacement) and non-linear (acceleration or deceleration in the displacement rate) trends were recognised, allowing characterisation of the kinematic pattern of a landslide or a portion of it. Local and site-specific scale analyses, performed in an Alpine valley and in two hillslopes representative of the main geological/geomorphological contexts of the study area, validated the results obtained at the regional scale. This supported the interpretation of the driving mechanism for such known landslides, or other geological processes which can cause ground motion along slopes. The developed procedure can allow one to specify priority areas for prevention activities, in order to optimise the costs and benefits of designing a plan to monitor instability phenomena at regional and site-specific scales.

TI  - A comparison between multispectral aerial and satellite imagery in precision viticulture
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we tested consistency and reliability of satellite-derived Prescription Maps (PMs) respect to those that can be obtained by aerial imagery. Test design considered a vineyard of Moscato Reale sited in Apulia (South-Eastern Italy) and two growing seasons (2013 and 2014). Comparisons concerned Landsat 8 OLI images and aerial datasets from airborne RedLake MS4100 multispectral camera. We firstly investigated the role of spatial resolution in radiometric features of data and, in particular, of NDVI maps and consequently of vigour maps. We first measured the maximum expected correlation between satellite- and aerial-derived maps. We found that, without any pixel selection and spatial interpolation, correlation ranges between 0.35 and 0.60 depending on the degree of heterogeneity of the vineyard. We also found that this result can be improved by operating a selection of those pixels representing vines canopy in aerial imagery and spatially interpolating them. In this way correlation coefficient can be improved up to 0.85 (minimum 0.60) suggesting an excellent capability of satellite data to approximate aerial ones at vineyard level. Prescription maps derived from vigour one demonstrated to be spatially consistent; but we also found that the quantitative interpretation of mapped vigour was changing in strength according to datasets and time of acquisition. Therefore, in spite of a satisfying consistency of spatial distribution, results showed that vigour strength at vineyard level from aerial and satellite datasets is generally not consistent, partially for the presence of a bias (that we modelled).

TI  - Object-oriented soil erosion modelling: A possible paradigm shift from potential to actual risk assessments in agricultural environments
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last 2 decades, geospatial technologies such as Geographic Information System and spatial interpolation methods have facilitated the development of increasingly accurate spatially explicit assessments of soil erosion. Despite these advances, current modelling approaches rest on (a) an insufficient definition of the proportion of arable land that is exploited for crop production and (b) a neglect of the intra-annual variability of soil cover conditions in arable land. To overcome these inaccuracies, this study introduces a novel spatio-temporal approach to compute an enhanced cover-management factor (C) for revised universal soil loss equation-based models. It combines highly accurate agricultural parcel information contained in the Land Parcel Identification System with an object-oriented Landsat imagery classification technique to assess spatial conditions and interannual variability of soil cover conditions at field scale. With its strong link to Land Parcel Identification System and Earth observation satellite data, the approach documents an unprecedented representation of farming operations. This opens the door for the transition from the currently used potential soil erosion risk assessments towards the assessment of the actual soil erosion risk. Testing this method in a medium-size catchment located in the Swiss Plateau (Upper Enziwigger River Catchment), this study lays an important foundation for the application of the very same methods for large-scale or even pan-European applications. Soil loss rates modelled in this study were compared with the insights gained from emerging techniques to differentiate sediment source contribution through compound-specific isotope analysis on river sediments. The presented technique is adaptable beyond revised universal soil loss equation-type soil erosion models.

TI  - Comparison of SCS and Green-Ampt Distributed Models for Flood Modelling in a Small Cultivated Catchment in Senegal
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The vulnerability to floods in Africa has increased over the last decades, together with a modification of land cover as urbanized areas are increasing, agricultural practices are changing, and deforestation is increasing. Rainfall-runoff models that properly represent land use change and hydrologic response should be useful for the development of water management and mitigation plans. Although some studies have applied rainfall-runoff models in West Africa for flood modelling, there is still a need to develop such models, while many data are available and have not still been used for modelling improvement. The Ndiba catchment (16.2 km(2) ), which is located in an agricultural area in south Senegal, is such catchment, where a lot of hydro-climatic data has been collected between 1983 and 1992. Twenty-eight flood events have been extracted and modelled by two event-based rainfall-runoff models that are based on the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) or the Green-Ampt (GA) models for runoff, both coupled with the distributed Lag and Route (LR) for routing. Both models were able to reproduce the flood events after calibration, but they had to account for that the infiltration processes are highly dependent on the tillage of the soils and the growing of the crops during the rainy season, which made the initialization of the event-based models difficult. The most influent parameters for both models (the maximal water storage capacity for SCS, the hydraulic conductivity at saturation for Green-Ampt) were mostly related to the development stage of the vegetation, described by a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) anomaly. The SCS model performed finally better than the Green-Ampt model, because Green-Ampt was very sensitive to the variability of the hydraulic conductivity at saturation. The variability of the parameters of the models highlights the complexity of this kind of cultivated catchment, with highly non stationary conditions. The models could be improved by a better knowledge of the tillage practices, and a better integration of these practices in the parameters predictors.

TI  - Land surface temperature estimating in urbanized landscapes using artificial neural networks
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Scenario-based land surface temperature (LST) modeling is a powerful tool for adopting proper urban land use planning policies. In this study, using greater Isfahan as a case study, the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm was utilized to explore the non-linear relationships between urban LST and green cover spatial patterns derived from Landsat 8 OLI imagery. The model was calibrated using two sets of variables: Normalized Difference Built Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Furthermore, Compact Development Scenario (CDS) and Green Development Scenario (GDS) were defined. The results showed that GDS is more successful in mitigating urban LST (mean LST = 40.93) compared to CDS (mean LST = 44.88). In addition, urban LST retrieved from the CDS was more accurate in terms of ANOVA significance (sig = 0.043) than the GDS (sig = 0.010). The findings of this study suggest that developing green spaces is a key strategy to combat against the risk of LST concerns in urban areas.

AB  - BackgroundMinor basin or in transit node drainage can be found in patients with cutaneous melanoma who undergo sentinel node biopsy. Its clinical impact is still unclear. Our objective is to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients who presented with in transit sentinel node (ITN) drainage.Material and MethodsRetrospective analysis of patients who underwent sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in a single Brazilian institution between 2000 and 2015.ResultsOur cohort comprised 1223 SNB. There were 64 patients (5.2%) with ITN. Melanoma of the limbs (OR 10.61, P<0.0001) and acral subtype (OR 3.49, P<0.0001) were associated with ITN drainage. Among these 64 patients, 14 (21.9%) had a positive SNB. The ITN was positive for metastases in five patients, four in a popliteal basin and one on the trunk. Regarding completion node dissection (CND), two patients had positive non-sentinel nodes (NSN), both in major basins. In patients who developed recurrence, time to recurrence was shorter (mean time 18 vs 31.4 months, P=0.001) and time to death was shorter (mean time 31.6 vs 40 months, P=0.039) in those who had ITN drainage.ConclusionITN drainage was associated with earlier recurrences and deaths from melanoma.

TI  - Imaginal action: towards a Jungian conception of enactment, and an extraverted counterpart to active imagination
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This theoretical paper considers the fashion in which Jung's psychology radically challenges modern assumptions concerning the nature of subjectivity. With an eye for the clinical implications of Jung's late work, the author introduces the idea of imaginal action. In order to explain what is meant by this, the paper begins by exploring how Jung's thinking demonstrates an underlying bias towards introversion. It is argued that while Jung's interest in synchronicity ultimately resulted in his developing a worldview that might address the introverted biases of his psychology, the clinical implications of this shift have not been sufficiently clarified. With reference to some short examples from experience, the author outlines a conception of relational synchronicity wherein the intrapsychic emerges non-projectively within the interpersonal field itself. Comparing and contrasting these occurrences to the more introverted practice of active imagination, it is claimed that such a notion is implicit in Jung's work and is needed as a corrective to his emphasis on interiority. The author suggests that imaginal action might be conceived as a distinctly Jungian approach to the psychoanalytic notion of enactment. It is also shown how the idea outlined might find further support from recent developments in the field of transpersonal psychology.

TI  - Better together: Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar satellite imagery to inform biodiversity monitoring, ecological research and conservation science
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - 1. The availability and accessibility of multispectral and radar satellite remote sensing (SRS) imagery are at an unprecedented high. These data have both become standard source of information for investigating species ecology and ecosystems structure, composition and function at large scales. Since they capture complementary aspects of the Earth's surface, synergies between these two types of imagery have the potential to greatly expand research and monitoring opportunities. However, despite the benefits of combining multispectral and radar SRS data, data fusion techniques, including image fusion, are not commonly used in biodiversity monitoring, ecology and conservation.2. To help close this application gap, we provide for the first time an overview of the most common SRS data fusion techniques, discussing their benefits and drawbacks, and pull together case studies illustrating the added value for biodiversity research and monitoring.3.Integrating and fusing multispectral and radar images can significantly improve our ability to assess the distribution as well as the horizontal and vertical structure of ecosystems. Additionally, SRS data fusion has the potential to increase opportunities for mapping species distribution and community composition, as well as for monitoring threats to biodiversity. Uptake of these techniques will benefit from more effective collaboration between remote sensing and biodiversity experts, making the reporting of methodologies more transparent, expanding SRS image processing capacity and promoting widespread open access to satellite imagery.4. In the context of a global biodiversity crisis, being able to track subtle changes in the biosphere across adequate spatial and temporal extents and resolutions is crucial. By making key parameter estimates derived from SRS data more accurate, SRS data fusion promises to become a powerful tool to help address current monitoring needs, and could support the development of essential biodiversity variables.

TI  - Blind image fusion for hyperspectral imaging with the directional total variation
T2  - INVERSE PROBLEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imaging is a cutting-edge type of remote sensing used for mapping vegetation properties, rock minerals and other materials. A major drawback of hyperspectral imaging devices is their intrinsic low spatial resolution. In this paper, we propose a method for increasing the spatial resolution of a hyperspectral image by fusing it with an image of higher spatial resolution that was obtained with a different imaging modality. This is accomplished by solving a variational problem in which the regularization functional is the directional total variation. To accommodate for possible mis-registrations between the two images, we consider a non-convex blind super-resolution problem where both a fused image and the corresponding convolution kernel are estimated. Using this approach, our model can realign the given images if needed. Our experimental results indicate that the non-convexity is negligible in practice and that reliable solutions can be computed using a variety of different optimization algorithms. Numerical results on real remote sensing data from plant sciences and urban monitoring show the potential of the proposed method and suggests that it is robust with respect to the regularization parameters, mis-registration and the shape of the kernel.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Zika virus (ZIKV) remains a public health concern due to its association with fetal malformation and neurologic disease.Objective: To report a reference centre experience on ZIKA virus (ZIKV) infection in travelers from epidemic countries from January 1 to September, 30, 2016 in Italy North-West (a geographic area covering 4.424 million inhabitants, corresponding to almost 73% of Italy North-West area).Study design: One hundred and twelve febrile travelers were studied to rule out a tropical fever [e. g. malaria, dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV), West Nile (WNV) and ZIKV]. Molecular tests for detecting ZIKV RNA were applied on serum or urine as well as IgG and IgM specific serology.Results: ZIKV was the most frequent "tropical infection (11.6%) with 12 infected travelers and one sexual partner of an infected traveler. At the time of the diagnosis, ZIKV RNA was detected in the blood from 9 patients (69%) within 7 days from symptom onset; afterwards, the virus was detected only in urine (5 patients) and ZIKV IgM was reactive in 9 patients (69%). Travelers with ZIKV infection tested negative for DENV, CHIKV, WNV and malaria and completely recovered. Other infections identified in travelers were DENV (5 patients, 4.5%), CHIKV (1, 0.9%), malaria (Plasmodium vivax, 1, 0.9%), measles (1, 0.9%) and tuberculosis (1, 0.9%).Conclusions: The etiologic diagnosis of a febrile illness in travelers where ZIKV is endemic is highly desirable as they are sentinel of a challenging epidemiology including the risk of autochthonous transmission in non endemic countries where the competent or carrier vector is present.

TI  - Exploring the Difference in Post-Procedural Stroke Rates Between Patients with Aortic Stenosis Who Undergo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Versus Surgical Aortic Value Replacement
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a newer alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Clinical trials have investigated TAVR's safety and effectiveness. Cerebral embolization is a common complication leading to stroke after TAVR and SAVR; different cerebral protection methods have been studied to prevent this.This paper evaluates the rate of post-procedural stroke rates between TAVR and SAVR and investigates the effect of cerebral protective methods on the stroke risk post-TAVR.Publications on TAVR and SAVR were found using specific criteria on PubMed. The Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves 1 (PARTNER 1) and PARTNER 2, the Nordic Aortic Valve Intervention (NOTION), and Surgical Replacement and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (SURTAVI) trials compared the incidence of complications between TAVR and SAVR. The Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease: Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCED), CoreValve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN), Neurologic Complications of Unprotected Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (Neuro-TAVI), Repositionable Percutaneous Replacement of Stenotic Aortic Valve Through Implantation of Lotus (TM) Valve System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) - Randomized Clinical Evaluation (REPRISE II), and The Society of Thoracic Surgeons/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy (STC/ACC TVT) registry studies further explored the risk of stroke in TAVR. The Effect of Bivalirudin on Aortic Valve Intervention Outcomes (BRAVO)-3 MRI, a prospective randomized evaluation of the TriGuard (TM) HDH (Keystone Heart, Tampa, FL) Embolic Deflection Device During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (DEFLECT III), Claret Embolic Protection and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (CLEAN-TAVI), and Cerebral Protection in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (SENTINEL) trials investigated cerebral protection methods post-TAVR for stroke prevention.In the PARTNER 1 trial, the stroke rate was greater in the TAVR group than in the SAVR group at one year (8.3% vs. 4.3%, P=0.04); the PARTNER 2 trial showed a lower risk of stroke at two years (6.2% and 6.4%, respectively). The NOTION and SURTAVI trials showed no significant difference in stroke rate between TAVR and SAVR at one year (13.1% vs 16.3%, respectively; p = 0.43). An increase in stroke rate after TAVR was found in the ADVANCED trial (5.6% at 31 days two years) and CoreValve trial (4.3% in the late phase). The Neuro-TAVI trial showed ischemia after TAVR in 20% of patients at discharge. In the STC/ACC TVT Registry, the rate of post-procedure disabling stroke was 1.7% at 30 days. Finally, the BRAVO-3 MRI study showed no advantages between bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin in preventing cerebral lesion formation (65.5% vs 58.1%, respectively; p = 0.55). The DEFLECT III, CLEAN-TAVI, and SENTINEL trials assessed the safety and efficacy of transcatheter cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPDs); their results ranged from 50% improvement (CLEAN-TAVI) to none (DEFLECT III, SENTINEL), therefore, showing non-inferiority of cerebral embolic protection devices for TAVR patients.The clinical trials studied in this paper showed a similar incidence of stroke in both groups, with the majority of TAVR patients developing cerebral lesions. With the addition of cerebral embolic protective devices, this incidence has decreased.

TI  - Native woody vegetation in central Argentina: Classification of Chaco and Espinal forests
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Question: What are the composition and spatial patterns of native woody plant communities in the southern Great Chaco and Espinal?Location: Cordoba Province, central Argentina, an area of ca. 161,000 km(2).Methods: We collected 351 geo-referenced releves representative of the geographic, topographic and ecological variation of the Chaco and Espinal woody vegetation in central Argentina. The releves were classified into vegetation types using the hierarchical ISOPAM method. Forest and shrubland types were described on the basis of diagnostic species occurrences and their distribution in relation to environmental factors. A map of the actual vegetation derived from remote-sensed images (Landsat) and field data was used to describe the current distribution and abundance of the different vegetation types.Results: The classification of the 351 plots x 837 species matrix revealed two major clusters comprising seven woody vegetation types corresponding to Chaco lowland and mountain forests and shrublands, Espinal forests and edaphic vegetation. The most important gradients in woody vegetation types are related to elevation, temperature and rainfall variables.Conclusions: Subtropical seasonally dry woody plant communities from the southern extreme of the Great Chaco and Espinal forests were described for the first time based on complete floristic data. Our results show that lowland Chaco native forests, as well as replacement communities, are still present in its southern distribution range and are well distinguishable from other vegetation types such as the Espinal and mountain forests. Overall, extensive Espinal forests have almost disappeared while Chaco vegetation is highly fragmented and degraded.

TI  - Analgesic Plasma Concentrations of Oxycodone After Surgery for Breast CancerWhich Factors Matter?
T2  - CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated factors affecting analgesic oxycodone concentrations after breast cancer surgery in 1,000 women. Preoperatively, we studied heat and cold pain sensitivities and anxiety scores. Postoperatively, rest and motion pain intensities were measured and intravenous oxycodone was administered until satisfactory analgesia. At this point, the mean oxycodone concentration (variation coefficient) was 33.3 ng/mL (66%) and it was 21.7 ng/mL (69%) when the patient requested oxycodone again. At both time points, the concentrations varied >100-fold between individuals. The analgesic oxycodone concentration was increased by 21.3% per motion pain intensity score on a 0-10 scale and by 22.3% if axillary clearance was performed instead of sentinel node biopsy (P < 0.001). Forty-seven women who were older and less anxious than others (P < 0.01) required no oxycodone. Anxiety, age, chronic pain, or preoperative pain sensitivity were not independently associated with the analgesic oxycodone concentration. CYP2D6 and CYP3A genotypes did not affect analgesic concentration or duration of analgesia.

TI  - Macro and trace elements in <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i> gonads from South West Atlantic areas
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea urchin represents one of the most valuable seafood product being harvested and explored for their edible part, the gonads or roe. This species is generally considered a sentinel organism for ecotoxicological studies being widely used in monitoring programs to assess coastal aquatic environments quality, because is directly exposed to anthropogenic contaminants in their habitat. In this context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the concentrations of macro (Cl, K, P, Ca, S) and trace (Zn, Br, Fe, Sr, I, Se, Rb, Cu, Cr, Ni, As, iAs, Cd, Pb, Hg) elements in Paracentrotus lividus gonads from three South West Atlantic production areas subjected to distinct environmental and anthropogenic pressures. In all studied areas, the elements profile in sea urchin gonads was Cl > K > P > Ca > S > Zn > Br > Fe > Sr > I > Rb > Cu > Se > Cr > Ni, suggesting an element guide profile with special interest for sea urchin farming development. Concerning toxic elements, the profile was the following: As > Cd > Pb > Hg > iAs. The results evidenced higher levels of Pb and Hg in open areas. Distinct area characteristics and anthropogenic pressures of production areas evidence the importance of biomonitoring contaminants, particularly toxic elements. In general, the levels of these elements were below maximum levels in foodstuffs (MLs) which pose a minimal health risk to consumers.

TI  - Development of a serum neutralization assay to detect Pteropine Orthoreovirus Indonesia/2010 neutralizing antibodies
T2  - VETERINARIA ITALIANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Pteropine Orthoreoviruses (PRVs) are fusogenic bat-borne orthoreoviruses that cause flu-like upper respiratory tract infections in humans. The presence of this group of viruses in bats and humans has been well documented in areas where their biological reservoirs - fruit bats (family Pteropodidae) - live densely. In the present study, a serum neutralization (SN) assay to detect neutralizing antibodies against PRV Indonesia/2010 isolate was set up and used to assess the seroprevalence of this virus in Italian domestic animals. The new developed assay was able of detecting PRV neutralizing antibodies in the hyper-immune polyclonal serum produced in rabbits (titer of 1:160). The negative serum was negative at all tested dilutions. No cross-reactions have been evidenced neither against reference MRVs nor against their respective hyper-immune sera. Eight hundred and fifty-three serum samples collected from 524 bovines, 271 small ruminants, and 58 horses (all used as sentinel animals in the Bluetongue and West Nile disease National surveillance program) were also tested with the new developed SN assay. According to the results of this survey, neither PRV nor PRV cross-reacting viruses antibodies have been demonstrated in Italian domestic animals. However, the new developed SN assay could be a very valuable diagnostic tool to detect infection in animals and humans.

TI  - Extreme wind-wave modeling and analysis in the south Atlantic ocean
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - A set of wave hindcasts is constructed using two different types of wind calibration, followed by an additional test retuning the input source term S-in in the wave model. The goal is to improve the simulation in extreme wave events in the South Atlantic Ocean without compromising average conditions. Wind fields are based on Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR/NCEP). The first wind calibration applies a simple linear regression model, with coefficients obtained from the comparison of CFSR against buoy data. The second is a method where deficiencies of the CFSR associated with severe sea state events are remedied, whereby "defective" winds are replaced with satellite data within cyclones. A total of six wind datasets forced WAVEWATCH-III and additional three tests with modified S-in in WAVEWATCH III lead to a total of nine wave hindcasts that are evaluated against satellite and buoy data for ambient and extreme conditions. The target variable considered is the significant wave height (Hs). The increase of sea-state severity shows a progressive increase of the hindcast underestimation which could be calculated as a function of percentiles. The wind calibration using a linear regression function shows similar results to the adjustments to S-in term (increase of beta(max) parameter) in WAVEWATCH-III - it effectively reduces the average bias of Hs but cannot avoid the increase of errors with percentiles. The use of blended scatterometer winds within cyclones could reduce the increasing wave hindcast errors mainly above the 93rd percentile and leads to a better representation of Hs at the peak of the storms. The combination of linear regression calibration of non-cyclonic winds with scatterometer winds within the cyclones generated a wave hindcast with small errors from calm to extreme conditions. This approach led to a reduction of the percentage error of Hs from 14% to less than 8% for extreme waves, while also improving the RMSE.

TI  - Integrating Airborne LiDAR and Optical Data to Estimate Forest Aboveground Biomass in Arid and Semi-Arid Regions of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest Aboveground Biomass (AGB) is a key parameter for assessing forest productivity and global carbon content. In previous studies, AGB has been estimated using various prediction methods and types of remote sensing data. Increasingly, there is a trend towards integrating various data sources such as Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and optical data. In this study, we constructed and compared the accuracies of five models for estimating AGB of forests in the upper Heihe River Basin in Northwest China. The five models were constructed using field and remotely-sensed data (optical and LiDAR) and algorithms including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Back Propagation Neural Networks (BPNN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and the Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM). Models based on the RF algorithm emerged as being the best among the five algorithms irrespective of the datasets used. The Random Forest AGB model, using only LiDAR data (R-2 = 0.899, RMSE -14.0 t/ha) as the input data, was more effective than the one using optical data (R-2 = 0.835, RMSE = 22.724 t/ha). Compared to LiDAR or optical data alone, the AGB model (R-2 = 0.913, RMSE = 13.352 t/ha) that used the RF algorithm and integrated LiDAR and optical data was found to be optimal. Incorporation of terrain variables with optical data resulted in only slight improvements in accuracy. The models developed in this study could be useful for using integrated airborne LiDAR and passive optical data to accurately estimate forest biomass.

TI  - Sea surface temperatures and seagrass mortality in Florida Bay: Spatial and temporal patterns discerned from MODIS and AVHRR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Two major episodes of seagrass mortality have occurred in Florida Bay in the past 30 years: The first occurred between 1987 and 1991 and the second began in 2015. In both episodes, dense beds of turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) were decimated. Elevated water temperature and hypersalinity have been implicated as contributing factors in both mortality events. During both die-off events seagrass beds on shallow (Z approximate to 0.3 m) mudbanks in western Florida Bay were disproportionately affected when compared to neighboring seagrass in deeper basins (Z approximate to 1.5 m). A network of in situ monitoring stations has measured sea surface temperature and salinity at hourly intervals in 16 basins in Florida Bay from August 2009 to the present day and these data aided in diagnosing the 2015-2016 die-off event. However, very few in situ observations of sea surface temperature have been collected on Florida Bay's shallow mudbanks as most are inaccessible by boat. As a result, our understanding of the role of elevated SST in shaping the spatial patterns of seagrass mortality is hindered by the spatial distribution of the in situ monitoring data and its record length. Therefore, we turn to remotely sensed SST data to expand our spatial coverage to include the entire Florida Bay ecosystem and to extend the record length to include the 1987-1991 die-off event. 1 km MODIS SST shows that shallow mudbanks were consistently warmer (by up to 6 degrees C) than nearby deeper basins. While water depth is likely the primary driver of spatial variability in SST, Landsat-8 surface reflectance data suggest that shallow seagrass beds could have suffered from the added influence of low surface reflectance, which might have further contributed to their thermal stress. Daily 0.25 degrees AVHRR SST shows that the August maximum SST has increased by 1 degrees C from 1981 to 2016, which is a cause for concern for the future of seagrass in Florida Bay. Correlation of monthly AVHRR SST anomalies with the multivariate ENSO index shows that ENSO can only partially explain the anomalous temperatures. When viewed together, the in situ and remotely sensed SST suggests that both extended exposure to anomalously warm temperatures and large, rapid changes in temperature could have contributed to seagrass mortality during both events.

TI  - What is the potential of cropland albedo management in the fight against global warming? A case study based on the use of cover crops
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover management in agricultural areas is a powerful tool that could play a role in the mitigation of climate change and the counterbalance of global warming. First, we attempted to quantify the radiative forcing that would increase the surface albedo of croplands in Europe following the inclusion of cover crops during the fallow period. This is possible since the albedo of bare soil in many areas of Europe is lower than the albedo of vegetation. By using satellite data, we demonstrated that the introduction of cover crops into the crop rotation during the fallow period would increase the albedo over 4.17% of Europe's surface. According to our study, the effect resulting from this increase in the albedo of the croplands would be equivalent to a mitigation of 3.16 MtCO(2)-eq.year(-1) over a 100 year time horizon. This is equivalent to a mitigation potential per surface unit (m(2)) of introduced cover crop over Europe of 15.91 gCO(2)-eq.year(-1). m(-2). This value, obtained at the European scale, is consistent with previous estimates. We show that this mitigation potential could be increased by 27% if the cover crop is maintained for a longer period than 3 months and reduced by 28% in the case of no irrigation. In the second part of this work, based on recent studies estimating the impact of cover crops on soil carbon sequestration and the use of fertilizer, we added the albedo effect to those estimates, and we argued that, by considering areas favourable to their introduction, cover crops in Europe could mitigate human-induced agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by up to 7% per year, using 2011 as a reference. The impact of the albedo change per year would be between 10% and 13% of this total impact. The countries showing the greatest mitigation potentials are France, Bulgaria, Romania, and Germany.

TI  - The sign, magnitude and potential drivers of change in surface water extent in Canadian tundra
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accelerated rate of warming in the Arctic has considerable implications for all components of ecosystem functioning in the High Northern Latitudes. Changes to hydrological cycle in the Arctic are particularly complex as the observed and projected warming directly impacts permafrost and leads to variable responses in surface water extent which is currently poorly characterized at the regional scale. In this study we take advantage of the 30 plus years of medium resolution (30 m) Landsat data to quantify the spatial patterns of change in the extent of water bodies in the Arctic tundra in Nunavut, Canada. Our results show a divergent pattern of change-growing surface water extent in the north-west and shrinking in the south-east-which is not a function of the overall distribution of surface water in the region. The observed changes cannot be explained by latitudinal stratification, nor is it explained by available temperature and precipitation records. However, the sign of change appears to be consistent within the boundaries of individual watersheds defined by the Canada National Hydro Network based on the random forest analysis. Using land cover maps as a proxy for ecological function we were able to link shrinking tundra water bodies to substrates with shallow soil layers (i.e. bedrock and barren landscapes) with a moderate correlation (R-2 = 0.46, p < 0.001). It has previously been reported that rising temperatures are driving a deepening of the active layer and shrinking water bodies can be associated with coarse textured soils beneath the lakes. Unlike water bodies with soil, or gravel, beneath them the water bodies that are situated on bedrock are likely cut off from ground water. Drying water bodies clustered in areas of bedrock and thin soils points to evaporation as an important driver of surface water decrease in these cases.

TI  - The Coexistence of Multiple Worldviews in Livestock Farming Drives Agroecological Transition. A Case Study in French Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) Cheese Mountain Areas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Livestock systems contribute significantly to environmental issues and need to undergo an agroecological transition. This transition is not only technical, but also involves an evolution of farmers' ways of seeing and interpreting the world, i.e., worldviews. We investigate livestock farmers' worldviews and their relationships with farming practices (grazing and mowing management) in three Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) cheese areas in the French mountains. The study is based on quantitative and comprehensive qualitative surveys in 37 farms. We identify entities typically considered by farmers and the kind of relations they have with these entities, as well as the ontological background, sources of knowledge, and worlds of justifications. Four ideal-typical worldviews emerge: Modern; Traditional; Ecological Intensive; Holist. These four worldviews coexist in each area and also at the farm scale. Three selected farmer monographs illustrate this complexity in detail. The four worldviews are consistent with other typologies in literature. Both Ecological Intensive and Holist worldviews can be considered as "agroecological"; however, they correspond to very different conceptions of agroecology. Different worldviews imply different sustainability indicators and pathways, as well as alternative knowledge-management systems. Finally, the coexistence of multiple worldviews is a key driver of the agroecological transition, which can be enhanced by facilitating confrontation and exchanges between worldviews.

TI  - Feasibility of fluorescence lymph node imaging in colon cancer: FLICC
T2  - TECHNIQUES IN COLOPROCTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In colon cancer, appropriate tumour excision and associated lymphadenectomy directly impact recurrence and survival outcomes. Currently, there is no standard for mesenteric lymphadenectomy, with a lymph node yield of 12 acting as a surrogate quality marker. Our goal was to determine the safety and feasibility of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging to demonstrate lymphatic drainage in colon cancer in a dose-escalation study.Methods A prospective pilot study of colon cancer patients undergoing curative laparoscopic resection was performed. At surgery, peritumoural subserosal ICG injection was done to demonstrate lymphatic drainage of the tumour. A specialized fluorescence system excited the ICG and assessed lymphatics in real time. The primary outcome was the feasibility of ICG fluorescent lymphangiography for lymphatic drainage in colon cancer. Secondary outcomes were the optimal protocol for dose, injection site, and ICG lymphatic mapping timing.Results Ten consecutive patients were evaluated (six males, mean age 69.5 years). In all, lymphatic channels were seen around the tumour to a varying extent. Eight (80%) had drainage to the sentinel node. In all cases where the lymphatic map was seen, there was no further spread 10 min after injection. In 2 patients (20%), additional lymph nodes located outside of the proposed resection margins were demonstrated. In both cases the resection was extended to include the nodes and in both patients these nodes were positive on histopathology. Factors contributing to reduced lymphatic visualization were inadequate ICG concentrations, excess India ink blocking drainage, and inflammation from tattoo placement.Conclusions ICG can be safely injected into the peritumoural subserosal and demonstrate lymphatic drainage in colon cancer. This proof of concept and proposed standards for the procedure can lead to future studies to optimize the application of image-guided precision surgery in colon cancer. Furthermore, this technique may be of value in indicating the need for more extended lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Stratifying SLN incidence in intermediate thickness melanoma patients
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Guidelines for melanoma recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with melanomas >= 1 mm thickness. Recent single institution studies have found tumors <1.5 mm a low-risk group for positive SLNB.Methods: A retrospective review of the Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group multicenter database identified patients with intermediate thickness melanoma (1.01-4.00 mm) who had SLNB, and assessed predictors for positive SLNB.Results: 3460 patients were analyzed, 584 (17%) had a positive SLNB. Univariate factors associated with a positive SLNB included age <60 (p < .001), tumor on the trunk/lower extremity (p < .001), Breslow depth >= 2 mm(p < .001), ulceration (p < .001), mitotic rate >= 1/mm(2) (p = .01), and microsatellitosis (p <.001). Multivariate analysis revealed age, location, and Breslow depth as significant predictors. Patients >= 75 with lesions 1.01-1.49 mm on the head/neck/upper extremity and 1.5-1.99 mm without high-risk features had <5% risk of SLN positivity.Conclusions: Intermediate thickness melanoma has significant heterogeneity of SLNB positivity. Low- risk subgroups can be found among older patients in the absence of high-risk features. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Refined Crop Drought Monitoring Method Based on the Chinese GF-1 Wide Field View Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI) models based on the red-near infrared spectral space are established for the first time through the analysis of the spectral characteristics of GF-1 wide field view (WFV) data, with a high spatial resolution of 16 m and the highest frequency as high as once every 4 days. GF-1 data was from the Chinese-made, new-generation high-resolution GF-1 remote sensing satellites. Soil-type spatial data are introduced for simulating soil lines in different soil types for reducing errors of using same soil line. Multiple vegetation indices are employed to analyze the response to the MPDI models. Relative soil moisture content (RSMC) and precipitation data acquired at selected stations are used to optimize the drought models, and the best one is the Two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2)-based MPDI model. The crop area that was statistically significantly affected by drought from a local governmental department, and used for validation. High correlations and small differences in drought-affected crop area was detected between the field observation data from the local governmental department and the EVI2-based MPDI results. The percentage of bias is between 21.8% and 14.7% in five sub-areas, with an accuracy above 95% when evaluating the performance via the data for the whole study region. Generally the proposed EVI2-based MPDI for GF-1 WFV data has great potential for reliably monitoring crop drought at a relatively high frequency and spatial scale. Currently there is almost no drought model based on GF-1 data, a full exploitation of the advantages of GF-1 satellite data and further improvement of the capacity to observe ground surface objects can provide high temporal and spatial resolution data source for refined monitoring of crop droughts.

TI  - Mapping spatial variability of foliar nitrogen in coffee (<i>Coffea</i> <i>arabica</i> L.) plantations with multispectral Sentinel-2 MSI data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nitrogen (N) is the most limiting factor to coffee development and productivity. Therefore, development of rapid, spatially explicit and temporal remote sensing-based approaches to determine spatial variability of coffee foliar N are imperative for increasing yields, reducing production costs and mitigating environmental impacts associated with excessive N applications. This study sought to assess the value of Sentinel-2 MSI spectral bands and vegetation indices in empirical estimation of coffee foliar N content at landscape level. Results showed that coffee foliar N is related to Sentinel-2 MSI B4 (R-2 = 0.32), B6 (R-2 = 0.49), B7 (R-2 = 0.42), B8 (R-2 = 0.57) and B12 (R-2 = 0.24) bands. Vegetation indices were more related to coffee foliar N as shown by the Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index - IRECI (R-2 = 0.66), Relative Normalized Difference Index- RNDVI (R-2 = -0.48), CIREI (R-2 = 0.28), and Normalized Difference Infrared Index - NDII (R-2 = 0.37). These variables were also identified by the random forest variable optimisation as the most valuable in coffee foliar N prediction. Modelling coffee foliar N using vegetation indices produced better accuracy (R-2 = 0.71 with RMSE = 0.27 for all and R-2 = 0.73 with RMSE = 0.25 for optimized variables), compared to using spectral bands (R-2 = 0.57 with RMSE = 0.32 for all and R-2 = 0.58 with RMSE = 0.32 for optimized variables). Combining optimized bands and vegetation indices produced the best results in coffee foliar N modelling (R-2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.23). All the three best performing models (all vegetation indices, optimized vegetation indices and combining optimal bands and optimal vegetation indices) established that 15.2 ha (4.7%) of the total area under investigation had low foliar N levels (<2.5%). This study demonstrates the value of Sentinel-2 MSI data, particularly vegetation indices in modelling coffee foliar N at landscape scale.

TI  - Machine learning prediction of coffee rust severity on leaves using spectroradiometer data
T2  - TROPICAL PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The interest in using remote sensing data in agriculture, including plant disease assessments, has increased considerably in the last years. The satellite-based Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) sensor has been launched recently for multispectral vegetation condition assessment for agricultural and ecosystem applications. The aim of this pilot study conducted in the greenhouse using a hand-held spectroradiometer was to assess the utility of the same wavebands as used in the Sentinel-2 MSI in assessing and modeling coffee leaf rust (CLR) based on the non-linear radial basis function-partial least squares regression (RBF-PLS) machine learning algorithm, compared with ordinary partial least squared regression (PLSR). The RBF-PLS derived models satisfactorily described CLR severity (R-2=0.92 and RMSE=6.1% with all bands and R-2=0.78 and RMSE=10.2% with selected bands) when compared with PLSR (R-2 = 0.27 and RMSE = 18.7% with all bands and R-2 = 0.17 and RMSE = 19.8% with selected bands). Specifically, four bands, B2 (490 nm), B4 (665 nm), B5 (705 nm) and B7 (783 nm) were identified as the most important spectral bands in assessing and modeling CLR severity. Better accuracy was obtained for most severe levels of CLR (R-2=0.71 using all variables) than for moderate levels (R-2=0.38 using all variables). Overall, the findings of this study showed that the use of RBF-PLS and the four Sentinel-2 MSI bands could enhance CLR severity estimation at the leaf level. Further work will be needed to extrapolate these findings to the crop level using the Sentinel-2 platform.

TI  - Surface forcing of non-stand-replacing fires in Siberian larch forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires are the dominant disturbance agent in the Siberian larch forests. Extensive low-to mediate-intensity non-stand-replacing fires are a notable property of fire regime in these forests. Recent large scale studies of these fires have focused mostly on their impacts on carbon budget; however, their potential impacts on energy budget through post-fire albedo changes have not been considered. This study quantifies the post-fire surface forcing for Siberian larch forests that experienced non-stand-replacing fires between 2001 and 2012 using the full record of MODIS MCD43A3 albedo product and a burned area product developed specifically for the Russian forests. Despite a large variability, the mean effect of non-stand-replacing fires imposed through albedo is a negative forcing which lasts for at least 14 years. However, the magnitude of the forcing is much smaller than that imposed by stand-replacing fires, highlighting the importance of differentiating between the two fire types in the studies involving the fire impacts in the region. The results of this study also show that MODIS-based summer differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) provides a reliable metric for differentiating non-stand-replacing from stand-replacing fires with an overall accuracy of 88%, which is of considerable importance for future work on modeling post-fire energy budget and carbon budget in the region.

TI  - Precipitation Clouds Delineation Scheme in Tropical Cyclones and Its Validation Using Precipitation and Cloud Parameter Datasets from TRMM
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Utilizing the cloud parameters derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner and the near-surface rainfall detected by the TRMM Precipitation Radar, the differences of cloud parameters for precipitating clouds (PCs) and nonprecipitating clouds (NPCs) are examined in tropical cyclones (TCs) during daytime from June to September 1998-2010. A precipitation delineation scheme that is based on cloud parameter thresholds is proposed and validated using the independent TC datasets in 2011 and observational datasets from Terra/MODIS. Statistical analysis of these results shows that the differences in the effective radius of cloud particles R-e are small for PCs and NPCs, while thick clouds with large cloud optical thickness (COT) and liquid water path (LWP) can be considered as candidates for PCs. The probability of precipitation increases rapidly as the LWP and COT increase, reaching similar to 90%, whereas the probability of precipitation reaches a peak value of only 30% as R-e increases. The combined threshold of a brightness temperature at 10.8 m (BT4) of 270 K and an LWP of 750 g m(-2) shows the best performance for precipitation discrimination at the pixel levels, with the probability of detection (POD) reaching 68.2% and false-alarm ratio (FAR) reaching 31.54%. From MODIS observations, the composite scheme utilizing BT4 and LWP also proves to be a good index, with POD reaching 77.39% and FAR reaching 24.2%. The results from this study demonstrate a potential application of real-time precipitation monitoring in TCs utilizing cloud parameters from visible and infrared measurements on board geostationary weather satellites.

TI  - Is There a Physical Linkage Between Surface Emissive and Reflective Variables Over Non-Vegetated Surfaces?
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For a satellite sensor with only one or two thermal infrared channels, it is difficult to retrieve the surface emissivity from the received emissive signal. Empirical linear relationship between surface emissivity and red reflectance are already established for deriving emissivity, but the inner physical mechanism remains unclear. The optical constants of various minerals that cover the spectral range from 0.44 to 13.5 mu m in conjunction with modern radiative transfer models were used to produce corresponding surface reflectance and emissivity spectra. Compared to the commonly used empirical linear relationship, a more accurate multiple linear relationship between Landsat TM5 emissivity and optical reflectances was derived using the simulated data, which indicated the necessity of replacing the empirical relationship with the new one for improving surface emissivity estimate in the single channel algorithm. The significant multiple linear relationship between broadband emissivity (BBE, 8-13.5 mu m) and MODIS spectral albedos was also derived using the same data. This paper demonstrates that there is a physical linkage between surface emissive and reflective variables, and provides a theoretical perspective on estimating surface emissivity for sensors with only one or two thermal infrared channels.

TI  - SOIL SPECTRAL MAPPING AND ITS CORRELATION WITH THE TRADITIONAL METHODOLOGY
T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing is increasing in agriculture and this raises questions about its efficiency over other usual methods. Thus, the purposes of this study were to compare methodologies for soil mapping, using field samplings and spectral data (from laboratory and from a simulated Landsat-TM), and to estimate their correlation. The soil samples were collected in a wetland with a great variety of soil classes. The distribution of soil classes in the maps was based on independence analysis by the Chi-square. Ten soil classes were determined in the study area, 6 in the first category level. The map of laboratory spectral data showed low correlation with conventional data. The map of spectral data that simulated wavelenghts corresponding the spectral bands of Landsat-TM sensor showed the same behavior of the previous map, with lower correlation with the conventional data. Thus, we verified that the mapping of paddy soils with spectral data shows low correlation with conventional data, however, still rather positive.

TI  - Improvement of Non-linear Estimation Equation of Rainfall Intensity over the Korean Peninsula by using the Brightness Temperature of Satellite and Radar Reflectivity Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to improve the quantitative precipitation estimation method based on satellite brightness temperature. The non-linear equation for rainfall estimation is improved by analysing precipitation cases around the Korean peninsula in summer. Radar reflectivity is adopted the CAPPI 1.5 and CMAX composite fields that provided by the Korea Meteorological Agency (KMA). In addition, the satellite data are used infrared, water vapor and visible channel measured from meteorological imager sensor mounted on the Chollian satellite. The improved algorithm is compared with the results of the A-E method and CRR analytic function. POD, FAR and CSI are 0.67, 0.76 and 0.21, respectively. The MAE and RMSE are 2.49 and 6.18 mm/h. As the quantitative error was reduced in comparison to A-E and qualitative accuracy increased in compare with CRR, the disadvantage of both algorithms are complemented. The method of estimating precipitation through a relational expression can be used for short-term forecasting because of allowing precipitation estimation in a short time without going through complicated algorithms.

TI  - Comparison of Observation Performance of Urban Displacement Using ALOS-1 L-band PALSAR and COSMO-SkyMed X-band SAR Time Series Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We applied PSInSAR to two SAR satellite (ALOS-1 and COSMO-SkyMed) images and analyzed the difference in displacement observation performance according to sensor characteristics. The building layer was extracted from the digital topographic map, and the PS extracted from the SAR image was classified into two groups (building structure and ground surface) for density analysis. The density of PS extracted from the research area was 0.023 point/m(2) for ALOS-1 PALSAR and 0.1 point/m(2) for COSMO-SkyMed, more than 4 times PS was extracted compared to ALOS-1. In addition, not only the PS density in the building, but also the density in the ground were greatly increased. The average displacement velocity of ALOS-1 PALSAR is within +/- 1 cm/yr, while for COSMO-SkyMed it is within +/- 0.3 cm/yr. Although it is difficult to make quantitative comparisons because it does not use the data for the same period, it can be said that the accuracy of X-band SAR system is very high compared to the L-band. In consideration of PS observation density and observation accuracy of displacement, X-band SAR data is very effective in research where it is important to acquire useful signals from the ground surface, such as ground subsidence and sinkhole.

TI  - Tracking Human-Induced Landscape Disturbance at the Nasca Lines UNESCO World Heritage Site in Peru with COSMO-SkyMed InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Lines and Geoglyphs of Nasca and Palpa" in Peru are among the most well-known UNESCO World Heritage Sites globally, and an exemplar of site where heritage assets cannot be separated from their natural and anthropogenic environment. The site is exposed to interactions with natural processes, as well as human presence. In this work, 3-m resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) StripMap HIMAGE HH-polarised scenes acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed constellation are exploited to track two events of human-induced landscape disturbance that occurred in December 2014 and January 2018. Pre-, cross-, and post-event interferometric SAR (InSAR) pairs characterised by small temporal and normal baselines allow the detection of temporal decorrelation associated with the two events, the extent and time reference of which match with online photographic and video evidence, published literature, web news, and press releases by the Ministry of Culture in Peru. Further elements enhancing the understanding of the 2018 event come from 10-m resolution Sentinel-2B satellite data that reveal the occurrence of apparent changes of surface reflectance due to uncovering of the light grey-yellow clay underneath the darker pebble constituting the fragile surface of the Pampa de Jumana. This scientific study confirms that SAR imagery archives, such as those being built by COSMO-SkyMed for Nasca, prove valuable for the retrospective analysis and digital recording of human-induced landscape disturbance events from space. These archives therefore act as essential sources of geospatial information on the conservation history of heritage sites and assets.

It discusses the evolution of a community of technology developers promoting remote-sensing capabilities (mostly sponsored by the French space agency). They attempted to legitimate quality scientific practices, establish the authority of satellite remote-sensing data within academic institutions, and build a community of technology users. This article, hence, is intended to contribute to historical interest in how a community of users is constructed for a technological system.

TI  - Seabirds as regional biomonitors of legacy toxicants on an urbanized coastline
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Seabirds are often cited as sentinels of the marine environment, but are rarely used in traditional ocean and coastal contaminant monitoring. Four classes of persistent organic pollutants (POPs, n=68) and three trace elements (mercury, selenium, and arsenic) were measured in the eggs of California least terns (Sterna antillarum browni), caspian terns (Hydroprogne caspia), double-crested cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus), and western gulls (Larus occidentalis) that nest in the Southern California Bight. Building on a periodic five year regional monitoring program, we measured contaminant exposure and assessed the utility of seabirds as regional contaminant biomonitors. We found that the eggs of larger, more piscivorous species generally had the highest concentrations of POPs and trace elements while California least terns had the lowest concentrations, except for mercury which was higher in least terns. As expected, DDT concentrations were elevated near the Palos Verdes Superfund site. However, we also detected a previously unknown latitudinal pattern in PBDE concentrations in least terns. POP congener profiles also confirmed differences in contamination in urban least tern colonies closest to urban centers. Though toxicants were at detectable levels across species and sites, concentrations were below those known to cause adverse effects in avian taxa and are steady or declining compared to previous studies in this region. Our results suggest that regional seabird monitoring can inform site-specific remediation and support management and protection of regionally-threatened wildlife and coastal systems. Integration of seabird contaminant data with traditional sediment, water, bivalve and fish monitoring is needed to further our understanding of exposure pathways and food web contaminant transfer.

AB  - Objective: Breast cancer subtypes are used as prognostic and predictive factors considering the genomic profile of the disease. This study is designed to investigate the Sentinel Lymph Node (SLN) detection rate in breast cancer for different biological characteristics.Material and Methods: Patients on whom we performed the methylene blue method alone were named as Group I, radiocolloid substance method alone as Group II and both methylene blue and radiocolloid method as Group III. The results of biological tumor characteristics and characteristics of the patients on different SLN biopsy techniques were investigated.Results: The overall SLN detecting success rate was 83.3%. When considered for each group, success rate was 80% for group I, 84.9% for group II and 90.6% for group III. While a success rate of 94.6% was achieved with radiocolloid only in the patients in Luminal A and B subgroup, 90% success rate was achieved in Her2 (+) and triple negative (TN) patients with combined method.Conclusion: While successful results could be achieved by using radiocolloid substances alone in patients with Luminal A and B subtypes, combined methods should be used in HER2 (+) and TN patients.

T2  - ANNALS OF DIAGNOSTIC PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node status is an independent prognostic indicator in breast cancer. Intraoperative identification of metastatic carcinoma in sentinel lymph nodes may allow for concurrent axillary lymph node dissection at the time of primary tumor excision. A retrospective review of patients undergoing primary breast cancer excision with sentinel lymph node sampling was performed. Sensitivity and specificity of imprint cytology (touch prep) with and without the incorporation of gross evaluation was determined using permanent section results as the gold standard. Five hundred sixteen lymph nodes were analyzed by imprint cytology in 213 patients, and 203 lymph nodes were analyzed in 74 patients incorporating gross examination. Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of macrometastases by touch prep alone were 60% and 99% respectively with 4 patients undergoing same-day axillary dissection for only micrometastatic disease. False negative causes included lack of transfer of malignant cells in 8 cases and misinterpretation of tumor cells in 6 cases. Incorporating gross examination in the modified protocol resulted in reduced sensitivity of 38%, but achieved the desired 100% specificity and positive predictive value. Imprint cytology alone did not reliably distinguish between micro- and macrometastatic disease. Gross assessment combined with imprint cytology allows for improved assessment of volume of axillary disease, but is an insensitive technique.

TI  - Land Cover Mapping from Remotely Sensed and Auxiliary Data for Harmonized Official Statistics
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a general framework alternative to the traditional surveys that are commonly performed to estimate, for statistical purposes, the areal extent of predefined land cover classes across Europe. The framework has been funded by Eurostat and relies on annual land cover mapping and updating from remotely sensed and national GIS-based data followed by area estimation. Map production follows a series of steps, namely data collection, change detection, supervised image classification, rule-based image classification, and map updating/generalization. Land cover area estimation is based on mapping but compensated for mapping error as estimated through thematic accuracy assessment. This general structure was applied to continental Portugal, successively updating a map of 2010 for the following years until 2015. The estimated land cover change was smaller than expected but the proposed framework was proved as a potential for statistics production at the national and European levels. Contextual and structural methodological challenges and bottlenecks are discussed, especially regarding mapping, accuracy assessment, and area estimation.

TI  - An Image Transform Based on Temporal Decomposition
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, very dense synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series are available through the framework of the European Copernicus Programme. These time series require innovative processing and preprocessing approaches including novel speckle suppression algorithms. Here we propose an image transform for hypertemporal SAR image time stacks. This proposed image transform relies on the temporal patterns only, and therefore fully preserves the spatial resolution. Specifically, we explore the potential of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), a data-driven approach to decompose the temporal signal into components of different frequencies. Based on the assumption that the high-frequency components are corresponding to speckle, these effects can be isolated and removed. We assessed the speckle filtering performance of the transform using hypertemporal Sentinel-1 data acquired over central Germany comprising 53 scenes. We investigated speckle suppression, ratio images, and edge preservation. For the latter, a novel approach was developed. Our findings suggest that EMD features speckle suppression capabilities similar to that of the Quegan filter while preserving the original image resolution.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in endometrial cancer: an update
T2  - CLINICAL AND TRANSLATIONAL IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim A review was conducted to update the recent published literature on sentinel lymph-node (SLN) procedures in endometrial cancer.Materials and methods A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed and Cochrane library, searching from English language publication of the last 10 years about sentinel lymph node (SLN) in endometrial cancer. Eligible studies had a sample size > 30 patients and reported at least the detection rate. Detection rate, bilateral mapping rate, sensitivity (SN), and negative predictive value (NPV) were evaluated. Different techniques were assessed both for detection rate and for bilateral mapping. A subgroup analysis on studies focused on SPET was performed.Results Forty studies were considered for the analysis (6162 patients). The overall detection rate of SLN mapping was 87.7% (95% CI 77.6-97.9%, range 62-100%). The pooled bilateral mapping rate was 59.9% (95% CI 43.2-76.6%, range 21-92%). The pooled SN resulted 98.3% (range: 50-100%) and the pooled NPV was 99.5% (range 86-100%). Cervical injection was the most used technique. Indocyanine green (ICG) and the combination of radiotracer/blue dye resulted in the highest SLN detection rates: 95% (95% CI 86-100%) and 90% (95% CI 79-100%) with cervical injection, respectively. ICG demonstrated the highest values of bilateral nodal mapping 75% (95% CI 60-91%) with cervical injection. Studies focused on SPET/CT showed a low/moderate correlation between SPET imaging and intraoperative findings.Conclusion SLN mapping accurately predicts nodal status in women with endometrial cancer. Future prospective evaluation of prognosis/outcome is needed to define the impact of this technique for personalized therapy.

TI  - Acute herpes zoster and post herpetic neuralgia in primary care: a study of diagnosis, treatment and cost
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY & INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Acute herpes zoster and its complication post herpetic neuralgia represent a significant challenge to primary care physicians in their care of an ageing population of patients. This was a cross-sectional observational study by means of a quantitative survey of 1,000 general practitioners registered in Ireland exploring the frequency of diagnosis, methods of treatment and cost of AHZ and PHN in primary care. We recorded an 18% response rate (n = 184) with an 83% completion rate (n = 152/184). 80% of cases of AHZ occurred in patients aged 50 years or more with 81% of study participants encountering cases at a rate of 1-3 patients per month. Famciclovir (37%) and valaciclovir (36%) were the most commonly prescribed antiviral agents. Mild opioids (32%) were the most common analgesic agents used for first line AHZ pain, and pregabalin (37%) the most commonly prescribed analgesic agent for second line AHZ pain. Pregabalin was also the most commonly prescribed analgesic for both first and second line PHN pain (29% and 24%, respectively). The mean per-case direct cost (medication and GP visits) of treating AHZ and PHN in primary care was a,notsign195 (range a,notsign153-a,notsign236) and a,notsign201 (range a,notsign140-a,notsign313), respectively. Based on national sentinel data the estimated annual direct costs of treating AHZ and PHN in primary care is a,notsign2,278,196 (range a,notsign1,793,399-a,notsign2, 763,445). The treatment of AHZ and PHN represents both a significant care and cost burden on primary care resources in Ireland in keeping with other European based studies.

TI  - Recent area and volume loss of Alpine glaciers in the Adda River of Italy and their contribution to hydropower production
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We computed and analysed the geometry changes affecting an Italian glacierized sector (the Sondrio Province, Adda River Basin). This zone was chosen because i) there is a relative abundance of high resolution remote sensing data covering the last thirty years, ii) it represents an important sector of the glacierized areas of Italy, and iii) it is first ranked within the list of Italian districts featuring highest hydro-power production.We found large glacier reduction, with an area change of -25.41% during 1991-2007, and -30.5% during 1981-2007. Volume change during 1981-2007 was -1353x10(6)m(3) +/- 27%. The mean thickness change was -14.91 m. The mean annual volume change of the Sondrio glaciers was about -52x10(6)m(3) y(-1) of ice, or ca. -47 x 10(6)m(3) y(-1) of water. We then computed the glaciers' contribution to 25 hydropower plants located in the studied area. For this purpose we divided the study region into two zones. While in the first, Eastern most region (R1) a large share of hydropower is provided by liquid precipitation, in the second Western region (R2) ca. 1/2 of the total water for hydropower is provided by solid water, i.e. snowfall and ice melt. Our results display that in areas like Region R2, where a large share of hydropower production depends upon ice melt, the expected future lack of water under glaciers' down wasting may affect energy production, and requires adaptation strategies.

TI  - Satellite-based ET estimation using Landsat 8 images and SEBAL model
T2  - REVISTA CIENCIA AGRONOMICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of evapotranspiration is a key factor to achieve sustainable water management in irrigated agriculture because it represents water use of crops. Satellite-based estimations provide advantages compared to direct methods as lysimeters especially when the objective is to calculate evapotranspiration at a regional scale. The present study aimed to estimate the actual evapotranspiration (ET) at a regional scale, using Landsat 8 - OLI/TIRS images and complementary data collected from a weather station. SEBAL model was used in South-West Parana, region composed of irrigated and dry agricultural areas, native vegetation and urban areas. Five Landsat 8 images, row 223 and path 78, DOY 336/2013, 19/2014, 35/2014, 131/2014 and 195/2014 were used, from which ET at daily scale was estimated as a residual of the surface energy balance to produce ET maps. The steps for obtain ET using SEBAL include radiometric calibration, calculation of the reflectance, surface albedo, vegetation indexes (NDVI, SAVI and LAI) and emissivity. These parameters were obtained based on the reflective bands of the orbital sensor with temperature surface estimated from thermal band. The estimated ET values in agricultural areas, native vegetation and urban areas using SEBAL algorithm were compatible with those shown in the literature and ET errors between the ET estimates from SEBAL model and Penman Monteith FAO 56 equation were less than or equal to 1.00 mm day(-1).

TI  - Assessment of the High Resolution SAR Mode of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission for First Year Ice and Multiyear Ice Characterization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulated compact polarimetry from the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) is evaluated for sea ice classification. Compared to previous studies that evaluated the potential of RCM for sea ice classification, this study focuses on the High Resolution (HR) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode of the RCM associated with a higher noise floor (Noise Equivalent Sigma Zero of -19 dB), which can prove challenging for sea ice monitoring. Twenty three Compact Polarimetric (CP) parameters were derived and analyzed for the discrimination between first year ice (FYI) and multiyear ice (MYI). The results of the RCM HR mode are compared with those previously obtained for other RCM SAR modes for possible CP consistency parameters in sea ice classification under different noise floors, spatial resolutions, and radar incidence angles. Finally, effective CP parameters were identified and used for the classification of FYI and MYI using the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm. This study indicates that, despite the expected high noise floor of the RCM HR mode, CP SAR data from this mode are promising for the classification of FYI and MYI in dry ice winter conditions. The overall classification accuracies of CP SAR data over two test sites (96.13% and 96.84%) were found to be comparable to the accuracies obtained using Full Polarimetric (FP) SAR data (98.99% and 99.20%).

TI  - Characterization of tropical precipitation using drop size distribution and rain rate-radar reflectivity relation
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Characterization of precipitation is important for proper interpretation of rain information from remotely sensed data. Rain attenuation and radar reflectivity (Z) depend directly on the drop size distribution (DSD). The relation between radar reflectivity/rain attenuation and rain rate (R) varies widely depending upon the origin, topography, and drop evolution mechanism and needs further understanding of the precipitation characteristics. The present work utilizes 2 years of concurrent measurements of DSD using a ground-based disdrometer at five diverse climatic conditions in Indian subcontinent and explores the possibility of rain classification based on microphysical characteristics of precipitation. It is observed that both gamma and lognormal distributions are performing almost similar for Indian region with a marginally better performance by one model than other depending upon the locations. It has also been found that shape-slope relationship of gamma distribution can be a good indicator of rain type. The Z-R relation, Z = AR(b), is found to vary widely for different precipitation systems, with convective rain that has higher values of A than the stratiform rain for two locations, whereas the reverse is observed for the rest of the three locations. Further, the results indicate that the majority of rainfall (> 50%) in Indian region is due to the convective rain although the occurrence time of convective rain is low (< 10%).

TI  - Extraction of lineaments from different azimuth angles using geospatial techniques: a case study of Pravara basin, Maharashtra, India
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineaments are the linear or curvilinear geological surface features which reflect the tectonic history, groundwater potential, oil, and mineral resource availability of a given area. In view of the importance of lineaments, the present study is carried out to understand the spatial distribution, orientation, density, and the influence of lineaments on drainage network. The study focuses on the extraction of lineaments in Pravara basin, Maharashtra, by using Cartosat Digital Elevation Model (CartoDEM). The lineaments are extracted and analyzed in ArcGIS and Rockworks software, respectively. Comparative analysis is performed on eight different lineament outputs which are extracted from various azimuth angles to prepare one final lineament map of the study area. Total number of lineaments found in the study area is 709 with the length of 1194.77 km. The western part of the Pravara basin shows higher lineament density as compared to the central and eastern part. Therefore, these areas might be affected by higher structural deformation. Also, this area might have higher groundwater infiltration potential due to the higher density of lineaments as they work as the structural weaknesses and influence the water to infiltrate in sub-surface region. The study has shown that the predominant orientation of lineaments trending to NNW-SSE. About 10% of the total stream length is found to have the influence of lineaments on the drainage network. More control of lineaments is observed in the source region of the drainage, where mostly first-order streams are found. Apart from the significant findings, this study has been generated a detailed structural information over the study area and the output could be applied for future planning and management of the water resources, tectonic evolution, and in other fields of geosciences.

T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports a comparative analysis performed on a fraction-image time series of the Antarctic Peninsula from the period 1999-2009 generated by multiresolution remote-sensing images (SSM/I SSMI/S with 25 km and QuikSCAT with 2.225 km spatial resolutions) for snow-melt detection. Our method is based on the (a) preprocessing of multitemporal remote-sensing data, (b) subpixel mixture analysis of SSMI and QuikSCAT image time series, and (c) evaluation of subpixel analysis, including an assessment of fraction images of wet snow using an independent ASAR dataset and sensitivity analysis on the melt metrics measured by these images. The temporal dynamics of the melt indices derived from the wet-snow fraction images presented a more realistic pattern than the traditional melt metrics measured by Boolean snow-melt detection approaches. Because the snow melt actually occurs at the pixel fractions, the multiscale analysis that was performed suggests an overestimation of the melt metrics calculated using Boolean approaches (which assume that the entire area of the detected pixel shows snow melt). The melt metrics measurements show an overestimation according to the decrease in spatial resolution related to the multiplicative effect of a larger pixel area.

In this study an attempt is made to develop a SNR prediction model for the urban environment. The height attribute value for 3D shapefile representing different urban environments is acquired from Cartosat-1 DEM and Total Station (which gave better accuracy in prediction). The best fit regression model correlating GPS signal SNR and satellite elevation angle in open environment for a GPS antenna was derived. The derived regression model between satellite elevation angle and signal SNR along with reflection and diffraction coefficients of surrounding urban environment was used to predict the GPS signal SNR at a given time.

AB  - We use data from the complete computerization of agricultural leases in Malawi, a georeferenced farm survey, and satellite imagery to document challenges and opportunities of land-based investment in novel ways. Covering some 1.35 million hectares or about 25% of the country's arable area, agricultural estates are an important part of Malawi's rural economy. However, the analysis shows that 70% of these estates have expired leases, reducing government revenue from ground rent by up to US$35 million or 5% of the total public spending annually. The low quality of spatial records, as indicated by the fact that some 140,000 hectares under estates are subject to overlapping claims could preclude the land market participation, especially under longer-term contracts. Data from a 2006/07 survey suggest that estates' yield, productivity, and intensity of land use are below those of small farms. While the recently passed land laws create a basis for low-cost systematic demarcation and registration of rights to customary land, our analysis suggests that, to maximize their likely contribution to increasing productivity and welfare rather than conflict, such efforts need to be preceded by a clarification of boundaries and lease status of existing estates and ideally a more detailed study of the reasons underpinning the low productivity.

TI  - Seasonality of gross primary production in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The approach to carbon sequestration by ecosystems is critical to mitigating the damage and consequences of their effects at regional and global levels. Thus, this study was based on the hypothesis that Atlantic Forest regions have a relevant capacity of atmospheric carbon absorption. For this purpose, the Gross Primary Production data provided by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensor onboard the Earth-orbiting platform and its relationship with the climatic variables of the Itatiaia National Park were analyzed. The year 2015 presented the highest means of Gross Primary Production for the dry and rainy period when compared to 2005 and 2010, with values ranging from 7 g Cm-2 d(-1) to 8 g C m(-2) d(-1). The highest negative trends were for temperature in the dry season of 2005 (Z = -0.29), rainfall in the dry period of 2010 (Z = -0.36) and 2015 in the annual and dry season (Z = -0.23 and -0.38). There was no significant trend of Gross Primary Production in the Itatiaia National Park. The land use and occupation classes that stand out with the highest values of mean Gross Primary Production are Dense Ombro-phylous High-Montane Forest (9.98 g C m(-2) d(-1)) and Dense Montane Forest (9.09 g C m(-2) d(-1)). Temperature is the environmental factor of greatest variation among the seasons in the Itatiaia National Park region. The results of this study present relevant importance and contribution to the sustainable management of the Itatiaia National Park and subsidize programs that help in the recovery of uncharacterized areas of the Atlantic Forest.

TI  - Evaluation of urban heat island effect in Turkey
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the rate of urbanisation has accelerated due to increasing population density which causes unexpected environmental disturbances and problems. One of the major problems encountered to date is the change in the land use/cover (LULC) structure. Increasing the impervious surface cover has changed microclimatic properties of urbanised areas by altering their thermal characteristics. One of the most important problems facing urban planning today is the phenomena known as the urban heat island (UHI), which is largely due to the changing the character of LULC. In this study, to create a national picture of the UHI structure in Turkey, seven cities, namely Istanbul, Bursa, Ankara, Izmir, Gaziantep, Erzurum and Trabzon, each located in different climatic regions of Turkey, were investigated. The Gaussian fitting technique was applied to characterise the UHI effect in the seven cities in the study. An original contribution of the current study was that the rural reference temperature surface was automatically determined by a proposed algorithm including the automatic masking of input data, as well as the application of iterative Gaussian low-pass filtering during the fitting procedure. Within this context, the daytime and nighttime surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect was modelled and temporally analysed from 1984 to 2011 for all the sub-regions using remote sensing techniques. Furthermore, atmospheric UHI was also investigated using the mobile transect method. The findings from this study suggest that UHI is a major environmental problem in urbanised areas, both atmospheric UHI and SUHI were detected in all cities in the study area, and this problem was found to have rapidly increased from 1984 to 2011. Finally, as inferred from the multiple regression results, it can be concluded that the UHI problem in Turkey might have resulted from the altered LULC structure, as well as anthropogenic pressure on and interference in city planning geometries.

TI  - STUDY OF IMPACT OF UNRELATED PRODUCT DIVERSIFICATION ON FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF FIRMS IN INDIAN PERSPECTIVE
T2  - JIMS8M-THE JOURNAL OF INDIAN MANAGEMENT & STRATEGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper analyzes top five diversified firms in terms of revenue that entered into unrelated businesses between FY 2000-01 and FY 2009-10, from each of the top five industries in terms of revenue. The financial performance is measured in terms of liquidity, profitability, efficiency, and solvency risk. Current ratio is used as a measure of liquidity position, Return on Equity (ROE) is used as a measure of profitability, Total Asset Turnover is used as a measure of efficiency, and Debt-to-Equity (D/E) ratio is used as a measure of solvency risk. To study the impact of unrelated diversification on financial performance, average of post-diversification five years value of financial measures are used. This study was conducted on small size of sample. This study could not find any conclusive evidence that unrelated diversification improves liquidity position, profitability, efficiency or solvency risk level of the firms.

TI  - LOSSES ON THE ATLANTIC MATA VEGETATION INDUCED BY LAND USE CHANGES
T2  - CERNE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes are related to urbanization, economics and technology, influencing the management of natural resources and the ecosystem processes. The present study evaluated the behavior of land use changes in the period of 2007 and 2016, and identified the influence of these changes on the Atlantic Forest vegetation and the expected consequences for a future scenario in the short (2020) and medium term (2025). The study was developed in the Una river basin, located in southeastern Brazil. Land use mapping was performed using Landsat 5 and Sentinel-2A satellite imagery, with visual interpretation techniques. The assessment of land use changes and ecological losses was modeled in the Land Change Modeler and the gains and losses for each category and their future scenarios were identified. The calculations of landscape metrics were performed with the V-LATE extension for ArcGIS. The Anthropogenic Exposure Indicator was applied to evaluate the exposure of fragments. The comparative between land uses showed an increase of 484.33 ha of anthropogenic areas and a decrease of 484.14 ha of vegetation. The greater conversion of forests to other uses was related to agriculture. The fragments are under intense edge effect and 13.70% are under high anthropogenic exposure. By 2016, a loss of 484 ha of Atlantic Forest was identified, being expected a loss of 694.11 ha by 2020 and of 934.10 ha by 2025.

TI  - Water Colour Analysis of Lake Kummerow Using Time Series of Remote Sensing and In Situ Data
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water constituents of lakes using satellites is gaining increasing importance. Image archives of historic satellites represent valuable data sources to analyse the development of constituent concentrations over time and to derive trends. This study presents an analysis of the MERIS archive (2003-2011) using a neural network algorithm (FUB/WeW) to retrieve concentrations of Chlorophyll-a, total suspended matter and absorption by coloured dissolved organic matter (440 nm) at Lake Kummerow. All three constituents showed a clear seasonality: Chlorophyll-a (0.3-45.8 exhibited a spring bloom and multiple blooms during summer. Total suspended matter (0.1-10.0 and coloured dissolved organic matter (0.01-0.94 revealed highest values during summer and lower values during autumn/winter. While total suspended matter (- 1.3 and chlorophyll-a (- 3.4 showed a decreasing tendency from 2003 to 2011, coloured dissolved organic matter showed no clear trend. Chlorophyll-a retrieved from MERIS was around 20% higher than in situ measurements. The other constituents (total suspended matter and coloured dissolved organic matter) were obtained by qualitative analysis due to the absence of in situ measurements. This analysis provides a first multi-year time series on these constituents over the whole lake and all seasons. Both, its size and its form, make Lake Kummerow a suitable lake for remote sensing validation activities. Recent and upcoming satellites, especially of the Sentinel missions, will provide further valuable information for integrating remote sensing into lake monitoring.

TI  - Halophyte fatty acids as biomarkers of anthropogenic-driven contamination in Mediterranean marshes: Sentinel species survey and development of an integrated biomarker response (IBR) index
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Estuarine environments are extremely affected by anthropogenic-driven contamination, namely heavy metals. In the recent years, several organisms have been studied to be used as sentinel species providing a wide range of biomarkers for estuarine contamination. Only recently non-traditional biomarkers, such as fatty acids, were included in animal ecotoxicology and impact assessment studies. Nevertheless, there is a wide lack of knowledge regarding to its application in estuarine plants. Considering this the present work aimed to evaluate the application of fatty acid profiling in Mediterranean halophytic species chronically exposed to different degrees of metal contamination, while incorporating these fatty acid biomarkers into an unifying index. From the fatty acids analysis two different types of sentinel halophytes could be identified: the contamination sensitive Halimione portulacoides (sea purslane), Sarcocomia fruticosa (glasswort) and Spartina patens (saltmeadow cord grass), and the contamination-tolerant Spartina maritima (small cordgrass). In sensitive species the most evident changes in the fatty acid profiles were the decrease in the 18:3 and the increase in the 16:0 fatty acid relative concentrations, while the inverse trend was recorded in the tolerant S. maritima under chronic contamination. Beyond the evident physiological importance, these shifts in the halophyte fatty acid profiles provide some understanding on their use as biomarkers of metal contamination. After application of an integrated biomarker response (IBR) index it was possible to conclude that in sensitive halophytes (H. portulacoides, S. fruticosa and S. patens) the samples collected from the contaminated site produce had higher IBR values than the tolerant species S. maritima being these lower values linked with an adaptation mechanism towards contamination. Furthermore, the fatty acid-based IBR index was intrinsically connected with the bioavailable metals concentrations in the rhizosediments, which make that it could be used in future impact assessment and/or ecotoxicology studies. In summary, the data showed that two of the most abundant halophytes in the Mediterranean eco-region (S. fruticosa and H. portulacoides) are potential sentinel species of metal contamination, whereas its fatty acid profile is an efficient biomarker of the degree of environmental contamination.

AB  - Groundwater is one of the most significant resources in arid and semi-arid areas and is essential for drinking, irrigation and industrialization. Land use classification map used based on 0.5 km MODIS-based Global Land Cover Climatology, GIS application are important tool that had been used for estimating and predicting the quality of groundwater. Samples were collected from 30 wells in summer and 20 wells in winter within the study, in addition to many wells out the study area to obtain best analysis of anions for year 2013, the objective of this study is for predicting the spatial distribution of major anions concentration in groundwater of Karapinar in Konya city such as SO42-, Cl-, NO3-, HCO(3)(-)and PO43- for assessing accuracy of various geostatistical wizard techniques like CoKriging, RFB and IDW, the map of anions concentration in groundwater was prepared for two seasons utilizing geostatistical models (Ordinary Kriging (OK), Simple Kriging (SK), Universal Kriging (UK), Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Radial Basis Functions (RBF) methods) existing in the geographic information system (GIS) and compared between these methods then choosing the best model for observed the spatial distribution of pollutants, the optimum model was used to predict anions concentration in Karapinar. Where the best model of each anion has been chosen based on prediction errors, and on the relation between measured and predicted concentration for each anion. All the anions groundwater parameters were evaluated and compared with WHO 2008 Standards, some of the collected groundwater samples present the investigated parameter levels exceeded the permissible limits of WHO 2008. Therefore, most groundwater samples are considered unsuitable for drinking and irrigation due to its high salt content based on anions concentrations in this study and land use classification map that including Croplands (yellow), Grasslands (green), Barren or Sparsely Vegetated (Grey), Urban and Built-Up (red) and Open Scrublands (Chartreuse).

TI  - Automated Approach for Extraction of Oil Spill from SAR Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill pollution is a major environmental concern since it has most dangerous and hazardous effects on marine environment. Periodic monitoring by detecting oil spills along with its movement, helps in efficient clean-up and recovery operations. Over the past few years, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based remote sensing has received considerable attention for monitoring and detecting oil spill due to its unique capabilities to provide wide-area observation in all weather conditions. However, the interpretation of marine SAR imagery is often ambiguous, since it is difficult to separate oil spill from look-alike features. The objective behind our study was to extract probable oil spill candidates automatically from SAR imageries containing oil spill incidences, where new methods based on over-segmentation and amalgamate approach is used for this purpose. The methodology is all about over segmenting the entire image based on its statistics and amalgamating relevant segments at later point of time to represent actual dark features as probable oil spill candidates. Under the dependency on SAR imageries alone, the approach does not take care of the separation of look-alike features which can be addressed subsequently by the consideration of associated synchronous external data resources such as optical data, wind and ocean parameters (Zhao et al. in Opt Express 22(11):13755-13772, 2014; Espedal and Wahl in Int J Remote Sens 20(1):49-65, 1999). The approach is carried out on a set of RISAT-1 imagery containing oil spill incidences and the extracted oil spill areas are in well agreement with the visually interpreted output with kappa coefficient greater than 0.70 and overall classification accuracy greater than 80%.

TI  - A Hybrid Approach for Fog Retrieval Based on a Combination of Satellite and Ground Truth Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fog has a substantial influence on various ecosystems and it impacts economy, traffic systems and human life in many ways. In order to be able to deal with the large number of influence factors, a spatially explicit high-resoluted data set of fog frequency distribution is needed. In this study, a hybrid approach for fog retrieval based on Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) data and ground truth data is presented. The method is based on a random forest (RF) machine learning model that is trained with cloud base altitude (CBA) observations from Meteorological Aviation Routine Weather Reports (METAR) as well as synoptic weather observations (SYNOP). Fog is assumed where the model predicts CBA values below a dynamically derived threshold above the terrain elevation. Cross validation results show good accordance with observation data with a mean absolute error of 298 m in CBA values and an average Heidke Skill Score of 0.58 for fog occurrence. Using this technique, a 10 year fog baseline climatology with a temporal resolution of 15 min was derived for Europe for the period from 2006 to 2015. Spatial and temporal variations in fog frequency are analyzed. Highest average fog occurrences are observed in mountainous regions with maxima in spring and summer. Plains and lowlands show less overall fog occurrence but strong positive anomalies in autumn and winter.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivePeople believe that they can respond effectively to threats, but actually they experience difficulties in disengaging from ongoing tasks and shifting their attention to life-threatening events. We contend that this tendency is especially true for secure people with respect to their worldview and perception of others and not for insecure individuals.MethodIn Study 1 (N=290), we examined individuals' reactions to various threat scenarios. In Study 2 (N=65), we examined these reactions using a behavioral design high in ecological validity. In Study 3 (N=78), we examined group-level benefits for the actions of insecure individuals by manipulating asocial behavior in response to an emergency.ResultsStudy 1 indicated that anxiously attached individuals stayed away from threats and sought help; avoidant people tended to take action by either assessing the risk of the event and/or enacting an asocial action such as fight or flight. Study 2 added ecological validity to these findings, and Study 3 showed that priming asocial behavior responses promoted actions that increased group members' chances of survival.ConclusionResults validate the central tenets of social defense theory and indicate that actions that are deemed asocial may paradoxically promote the survival of individuals and groups.

TI  - Evaluation of SMOS, SMAP, ASCAT and Sentinel-1 Soil Moisture Products at Sites in Southwestern France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the accuracy of several recent remote sensing Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) products at sites in southwestern France. The products used are Soil Moisture Active Passive "SMAP" (level 3: 36 km x 36 km, level 3 enhanced: 9 km x 9 km, and Level 2 SMAP/Sentinel-l: 1 km x lkm), Advanced Scatterometer " ASCAT" (level 2 with three spatial resolution 25 km x 25 km, 12.5 km x 12.5 km, and 1 km x 1 km), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity " SMOS" (SMOS INRA-CESBIO " SMOS-IC", SMOS Near-Real-Time " SMOS-NRT", SMOS Centre Aval de Traitement des Donndes SMOS level 3 " SMOS-CATDS", 25 km x 25 km) and Sentinel-l(S1) (25 km x 25 km, 9 km x 9 km, and 1 km x 1 km). The accuracy of SSM products was computed using in situ measurements of SSM observed at a depth of 5 cm. In situ measurements were obtained from the SMOSMANIA ThetaProbe (Time Domaine reflectometry) network (7 stations between 1 January 2016 and 30 June 2017) and additional field campaigns (near Montpellier city in France, between 1 January 2017 and 31 May 2017) in southwestern France. For our study sites, results showed that (i) the accuracy of the Level 2 SMAP/Sentinel-1 was lower than that of SMAP-36 km and SMAP-9 km; (ii) the SMAP-36 km and SMAP-9 km products provide more precise SSM estimates than SMOS products (SMOS-IC, SMOS-NRT, and SMOS-CATDS), mainly due to higher sensitivity of SMOS to RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) noise; and (iii) the accuracy of SMAP-36 km and SMAP-9 km products was similar to that of ASCAT (ASCAT-25 km, ASCAT-12.5 km and ASCAT-1 km) and S1 (S1-25 km, S1-9 km, and $ 1-1 km) products. The accuracy of SMAP, Sentinel-1 and ASCAT SSM products calculated using the average of statistics obtained on each site is defined by a bias of about -3.2 vol. %, RMSD (Root Mean Square Difference) about 7.6 vol. %, ubRMSD (unbiased Root Mean Square Difference) about 5.6 vol. %, and R coefficient about 0.57. For SMOS products, the station average bias, RMSD, ubRMSD, and R coefficient were about -10.6 vol. %, 12.7 vol. %, 5.9 vol. %, and 0.49, respectively.

AB  - Soil salinity is the key factor limiting agricultural expansion over poorly drained soils. In Saudi Arabia, the main source of irrigational water is the groundwater aquifers. Therefore, groundwater resources are under constant pressure and over exploited to fulfil the irrigational water demands. Moreover, soils in Saudi Arabia are poor and lack tolerable drainage system. Harsh agricultural environments thrust the farmers to maximize daily groundwater pumpage to overcome the substantial daily evapotranspiration caused by the massive turbulent heat fluxes in the designated study area. Normalized difference salinity index was generated based on remotely sensed data derived from Landsat 8 acquired on April 14th, 2014, after proper radiometric and atmospheric corrections. Thematic map of soil salinity was generated and then reclassified into four classes based on the natural break classification techniques. On the other hand, fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is another remotely sensed vegetation index established to envisage the effect of different soil salinity on the crop vigorously. FAPAR index was estimated using remote sensing data derived from the medium-spectral resolution imaging spectrometer on the same day of acquisition for consistency reasons. Results demonstrated that the FAPAR index is highly dependent on soil salinity. Higher soil salinity values corresponded to lower FAPAR values. Findings of the current research will help decision makers and decision takers to take soil salinity into consideration in future strategic plans.

TI  - Locally tuned model to map the chlorophyll-a and the trophic state in Porto Primavera reservoir using MODIS/Terra images
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we hypothesized that the damming of a rural River for hydropower generation, altering the water retention time should increase the chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration, consequently changing the trophic status. To test this hypothesis, we selected the Porto Primavera (PP) reservoir, which the construction of the dam began in 1998, as study area. Two field-works were conducted in order to obtain water quality and optical data. These field data were used to adjust and validate a statistical-based model. The adjusted model was applied to a time-series of MODIS/Terra images from 2000 to 2015 to obtain the spatial and temporal Chl-a concentration and consequently the trophic status classification. The results showed the following pattern: lower concentration occurred during the dry season and the highest during wet season. The Chl-a time series analysis showed a small tendency in Chl-a concentration to increase over time, but the trophic status has not changed over these 15 years. Our hypothesis can be accepted for the Chl-a concentration but not for the trophic status change. We believe that our findings can improve our knowledge about the water quality dynamics in PP reservoir and can help in future modeling approaches.

TI  - Life-Threatening Event Risk in Children With Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome A Multicenter International Study
T2  - JACC-CLINICAL ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES This study sought to characterize risk in children with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome by comparing those who had experienced a life-threatening event (LTE) with a control population.BACKGROUND Children with WPW syndrome are at risk of sudden death. METHODS This retrospective multicenter pediatric study identified 912 subjects <= 21 years of age with WPW syndrome, using electrophysiology (EPS) studies. Case subjects had a history of LTE: sudden death, aborted sudden death, or atrial fibrillation (shortest pre-excited RR interval in atrial fibrillation [SPERRI] of <= 250 ms or with hemodynamic compromise); whereas subjects did not. We compared clinical and EPS data between cases and subjects.RESULTS Case subjects (n = 96) were older and less likely than subjects (n = 816) to have symptoms or documented tachycardia. Mean age at LTE was 14.1 +/- 3.9 years of age. The LTE was the sentinel symptom in 65%, consisting of rapidly conducted pre-excited atrial fibrillation (49%), aborted sudden death (45%), and sudden death (6%). Three risk components were considered at EPS: SPERRI, accessory pathway effective refractory period (APERP), and shortest paced cycle length with pre-excitation during atrial pacing (SPPCL), and all were shorter in cases than in control subjects. In multivariate analysis, risk factors for LTE included male sex, Ebstein malformation, rapid anterograde conduction (APERP, SPERRI, or SPPCL <= 250 ms), multiple pathways, and inducible atrial fibrillation. Of case subjects, 60 of 86 (69%) had >= 2 EPS risk stratification components performed; 22 of 60 (37%) did not have EPS-determined high-risk characteristics, and 15 of 60 (25%) had neitherconcerning pathway characteristics nor inducible atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia. CONCLUSIONS Young patients may experience LTE from WPW syndrome without prior symptoms or markers of high-risk on EPS. (C) 2018 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.

TI  - Evaluation of Sentinel-1 data for flood mapping in the upstream of Sidi Salem dam (Northern Tunisia)
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood mapping is a powerful asset that allows drawing better strategies to contain possible economic repercussions and to rescue the affected population. This work is directly unfolded after the rainfall events that occurred in the north of the country, in February 2015, during which certain cities located in the vicinity of the Tunisian basin of Medjerda were flooded by the overflow of the Medjerda river, causing important damage to the towns of Jendouba and Bou Salem. The present research illustrates the potentiality of Sentinel-1 sensor in detecting flood areas in the upstream of Medjerda river. The Medjerda is the most important river in Tunisia, with an annual water potential reaching 0.8 billion m(3). We compared the signature of flood water in vertical transmit and horizontal received (VH) and vertical transmit and vertical received (VV) polarizations of radar data. The study proves that the segregation of land/water areas with a threshold technique is better observed in VH polarization rather than VV polarization.

TI  - Effects of Multimethod Intervention on Bedside Report Compliance and Patient Satisfaction
T2  - CRITICAL CARE NURSING QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Miscommunication is a large contributing factor to hospital sentinel events. Communication with nurses is a component of the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. The HCAHPS survey not only assesses patient satisfaction but also impacts how hospitals are reimbursed. A literature review reveals that nursing bedside shift positively impacts patient satisfaction and nurse communication. There is limited research on how to implement bedside report as well as what to include during report. A pilot study evaluated an educational intervention and its impact on nurses' compliance with bedside report. The study also evaluated whether bedside report compliance affected HCAHPS scores. A test of independent proportions showed that overall compliance scores increased significantly from period 1 (46%) to period 3 (81%), z = 2.23, P = -.017, one-tailed. HCAHPS scores for nursing communication went from 69.9% in quarter 1 of 2015 to 73.8% in quarter 4 of 2016, but there was no statistically significant change.

TI  - DEMOCRATIC FILM AND THE AESTHETICS OF CHOICE
T2  - GERMAN LIFE AND LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Both the Germans and their American occupiers understood that films were supposed to support a democratic culture and worldview during the occupation following the Second World War. This essay explores how democratic culture comes to be defined at mid-century through choice, and how two films that played in the Western Zones, Der Apfel ist ab (1948) and The Best Years of Our Lives (1946), take up choice as a formal aesthetic closely tied to a fraught democratic experience. Best Years, praised by German critics as a realistic portrait of American life, also adopts what the film critic Andre Bazin calls a democratic and liberal film style of deep focus compositions and shots of long duration that allow the spectator to choose what to look at in the frame. Yet, as even Bazin notes, this choice is slyly coercive. Der Apfel was a critical failure and thematises indecision within the narrative. In contrast to Best Years, it turns the optics of choice into vertiginous confusion in which there are no good choices. This essay argues that the democratic refusal in Der Apfel ist ab is an apt critique of democracy as choice', and that the film opens up new horizons of political invention.

TI  - Reflections on artisan metaphors in the <i>Laozi</i> ??: Who cuts the "uncarved wood" (<i>pu</i> ?)? (Part 1)
T2  - PHILOSOPHY COMPASS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I argue that the Laozi ?? offers a variety of cosmogenic accounts, including the one expressed by means of the artisan metaphors of uncarved wood (pu ?), vessels (qi ?), and cutting (zhi ?). These metaphors and the images related to them often appeared in the given context in ancient Chinese literature depicting the physical emergence of the world as a process of progressive differentiation out of the original state of chaos. Thus, this account ultimately served as a cosmic justification for the establishment of distinctions and hierarchy within human society. However, as used in the Laozi, the artisan metaphors promulgate a type of social hierarchy that is characteristically informed by the values of ziran ?? and wuwei ??. My argumentation goes against the common tendency of Western scholars to regard the notions of craft appearing in the Laozi as relating exclusively to human activities, connoting artifice, that is, as detrimental to the natural run of the Way. By referring to the most prominent traditional commentaries of the work, I argue that this view was supported only marginally, if at all, in early China and that its emergence appears to be a reaction to and a rejection of the initial Western interpretation of the same terms, one that was heavily influenced by the Christian worldview.

TI  - Challenges of urban green space management in the face of using inadequate data
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective urban planning, and urban green space management in particular, require proper data on urban green spaces. The potential of urban green spaces to provide benefits to urban inhabitants (ecosystem services) depends on whether they are managed as a comprehensive system of urban green infrastructure, or as isolated islands falling under the responsibility of different stakeholders. Meanwhile, different urban green space datasets are based on different definitions, data sources, sampling techniques, time periods and scales, which poses important challenges to urban green infrastructure planning, management and research. Using the case study of Lodz, the third largest city in Poland, and an additional analysis of 17 other Polish cities, we compare data from five publicly available sources: 1) public statistics, 2) the national land surveying agency, 3) satellite imagery (Landsat data), 4) the Urban Atlas, 5) the Open Street Map. The results reveal large differences in the total amount of urban green spaces in the cities as depicted in different datasets. In Lodz, the narrowly interpreted public statistics data, which are aspatial, suggest that green spaces account for only 12.8% of city area, while the most comprehensive dataset from the national land surveying agency reveals the figure of 61.2%. The former dataset, which excludes many types of green spaces (such as arable land, private and informal green spaces), is still the most commonly used. The analysis of the 17 other cities confirms the same pattern. This results in broader institutional failures related to urban green infrastructure planning, management, and research, including a lack of awareness of green space quality (e.g. connectivity) and benefits (ecosystem services), and the related political disregard for urban green spaces. Our comparison suggests that a better understanding of green space data sources is necessary in urban planning, and especially when planning urban green infrastructure.

AB  - Typhoon winds cause a disturbance over sea surface water in the right side of typhoon where divergence occurred, which leads to upwelling and chlorophyll maximum found after typhoon landfall. Ekman transport at the surface was computed during the typhoon period. Upwelling can be observed through lower SST and Ekman transport at the surface over the coast, and chlorophyll maximum found after typhoon landfall. This study also compared MODIS and SeaWiFS satellite data and also the chlorophyll maximum area. The chlorophyll area decreased 3% and 5.9% while typhoon passing and after landfall area increased 13% and 76% in SeaWiFS and MODIS data respectively.

TI  - Mapping and Modelling Malaria Risk Areas Using Climate, Socio-Demographic and Clinical Variables in Chimoio, Mozambique
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Malaria continues to be a major public health concern in Africa. Approximately 3.2 billion people worldwide are still at risk of contracting malaria, and 80% of deaths caused by malaria are concentrated in only 15 countries, most of which are in Africa. These high-burden countries have achieved a lower than average reduction of malaria incidence and mortality, and Mozambique is among these countries. Malaria eradication is therefore one of Mozambique's main priorities. Few studies on malaria have been carried out in Chimoio, and there is no malaria map risk of the area. This map is important to identify areas at risk for application of Public Precision Health approaches. By using GIS-based spatial modelling techniques, the research goal of this article was to map and model malaria risk areas using climate, socio-demographic and clinical variables in Chimoio, Mozambique. Methods: A 30 m x 30 m Landsat image, ArcGIS 10.2 and BioclimData were used. A conceptual model for spatial problems was used to create the final risk map. The risks factors used were: the mean temperature, precipitation, altitude, slope, distance to water bodies, distance to roads, NDVI, land use and land cover, malaria prevalence and population density. Layers were created in a raster dataset. For class value comparisons between layers, numeric values were assigned to classes within each map layer, giving them the same importance. The input dataset were ranked, with different weights according to their suitability. The reclassified outputs of the data were combined. Results: Chimoio presented 96% moderate risk and 4% high-risk areas. The map showed that the central and south-west "Residential areas", namely, Centro Hipico, Trangapsso, Bairro 5 and 1 de Maio, had a high risk of malaria, while the rest of the residential areas had a moderate risk. Conclusions: The entire Chimoio population is at risk of contracting malaria, and the precise estimation of malaria risk, therefore, has important precision public health implications and for the planning of effective control measures, such as the proper time and place to spray to combat vectors, distribution of bed nets and other control measures.

TI  - New techniques for sentinel node biopsy in breast cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is still the standard of care for axillary nodal staging in patients with invasive breast cancer (BC) and clinically negative lymph nodes (LNs). It successfully replaced the more invasive and morbid axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). The actual standard for SLNB is the radioisotope (RI) with or without blue dye (BD) technique. Because of several drawbacks reported in worldwide experiences, new techniques have been developed in the last years: indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) using microbubbles. Whilst each technique has its own advantages/disadvantages they are increasing their efficacy and are candidate to represent a new standard for SLNB in next future. This is a comprehensive review of current limitations of conventional techniques besides the improvements and innovations of new methods which, anyway, need future randomized controlled trials to be fully validated.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of isoprene and monoterpene emissions at the ecosystem level with available models and field measurements is not entirely satisfactory. Remote-sensing techniques can extend the spatial and temporal assessment of isoprenoid fluxes. Detecting the exchange of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) using these techniques is, however, a very challenging goal. Recent evidence suggests that a simple remotely sensed index, the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), which is indicative of light-use efficiency, relative pigment levels and excess reducing power, is a good indirect estimator of foliar isoprenoid emissions. We tested the ability of PRI to assess isoprenoid fluxes in a temperate deciduous forest in central USA throughout the entire growing season and under moderate and extreme drought conditions. We compared PRI time series calculated with MODIS bands to isoprene emissions measured with eddy covariance. MODIS PRI was correlated with isoprene emissions for most of the season, until emissions peaked. MODIS PRI was also able to detect the timing of the annual peak of emissions, even when it was advanced in response to drought conditions. PRI is thus a promising index to estimate isoprene emissions when it is complemented by information on potential emission. It may also be used to further improve models of isoprene emission under drought and other stress conditions. Direct estimation of isoprene emission by PRI is, however, limited, because PRI estimates LUE, and the relationship between LUE and isoprene emissions can be modified by severe stress conditions.

TI  - Global MODIS Fraction of Green Vegetation Cover for Monitoring Abrupt and Gradual Vegetation Changes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence and distribution of green vegetation cover in the biosphere are of paramount importance in investigating cause-effect phenomena at the land/atmosphere interface, estimating primary production rates as part of global carbon and water cycle assessments and evaluating soil protection and land use change over time. The fraction of green vegetation cover (FCover) as estimated from satellite observations has already been demonstrated to be an extraordinarily useful product for understanding vegetation cover changes, for supporting ecosystem service assessments over areas with variable extents and for processes spanning a variable period of time (abrupt events or long-term processes). This study describes a methodology implemented to estimate global FCover (from 2001 to 2015) by applying a linear spectral mixture analysis with global endmembers to an entire temporal series of MODIS satellite observations and gap-filling missing FCover observations in temporal series using the DINEOF algorithm. The resulting global MODV1 FCover product was validated with two global validation datasets and showed an overall good thematic absolute accuracy (RMSE = 0.146) consistent with the validation performance of other FCover global products. Basic statistics performed on the product show changes in average and trend values and allow for the quantification of gross vegetation loss and gain over different temporal scales. To demonstrate the capacity of this global product to monitor specific dynamics, a multitemporal analysis was performed on selected sites and vegetation responses (i.e., cover changes), and specific dynamics resulting from cause-effect phenomena are briefly discussed. The product is intended to be used for monitoring vegetation dynamics, but it also has the potential to be integrated in other modeling frameworks (e.g., the carbon cycle, primary production, and soil erosion) in conjunction with other spatial datasets such as those on climate and soil type.

TI  - Holocene glacial evolution of Mohnbukta in eastern Spitsbergen
T2  - BOREAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Submarine geomorphology is one of the main tools for understanding past fluctuations of tidewater glaciers. In this study we investigate the glacial history of Mohnbukta, on the east coast of Spitsbergen, Svalbard, by combining multibeam-bathymetric data, marine sediment cores and remote sensing data. Presently, three tidewater glaciers, Heuglinbreen, Konigsbergbreen and Hayesbreen calve into Mohnbukta. Hayesbreen surged at the end of the Little Ice Age, between 1901 and 1910. The submarine landform assemblage in Mohnbukta contains two large transverse ridges, interpreted as terminal moraines, with debrisflow lobes on their distal slopes and sets of well-preserved geometric networks of ridges, interpreted as crevasse-squeeze ridges inshore of the moraines. The arrangement of crevasse-squeeze ridges suggests that both landform sets were produced during surge-type advances. The terminus position of the 1901-1910 Hayesbreen surge correlates with the inner (R.2) terminal moraine ridge suggesting that the R.1 ridge formed prior to 1901. Marine sediment cores display C-14 ages between 5700-7700cal. a BP derived from benthic foraminifera, from a clast-rich mud unit. This unit represents pre-surge unconsolidated Holocene sediments pushed in front of the glacier terminus and mixed up during the 1901 surge. An absence of retreat moraines in the deeper part of the inner basin and the observation of tabular icebergs calving off the glacier front during retreat suggest that the front of Hayesbreen was close to flotation, at least in the deeper parts of the basin. As the MOH15-01 core does not penetrate into a subglacial till and the foraminifera in the samples were well preserved, the R.1 ridge is suggested to have formed prior to the deposition of the foraminifera. Based on these data we propose that a surge-type advance occurred in Mohnbukta in the early Holocene, prior to 7700cal. a BP, which in turn indicates that glaciers can switch to and from surge mode.

TI  - NDVI and meteorological data as indicators of the Pampa biome natural grasslands growth
T2  - BRAGANTIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to characterize the dynamics of NDVI and meteorological conditions, relating both to the annual dynamics of biomass accumulation in natural pastures of the Pampa biome as a way of subsidizing growth modeling. Forage accumulation rate data from a long-term experiment, NDVI data from the MODIS images, and meteorological data measured at the surface were used. We verify that the agrometeorological element associated to the accumulation of forage in the natural grasslands is different according to the season, which is typical of the subtropical climate, Winter is the critical season for livestock production due to the lower forage accumulation rate and lower values of NDVI, conditioned by the decrease of solar radiation and air temperature. In the summer, the limiting factor to forage accumulation is the hydric condition, It was also verified that the variability in the growth of grasslands can be associated with the ENSO phenomenon, being the El Nino favorable and the La Nina unfavorable, especially in the spring-summer period. Considering the verified associations, spectral indices combined with agrorneteorological elements are recommended to the adjustment of models of forage accumulation in the Pampa biome natural grasslands.

TI  - Understanding the dynamics of Nigeria's urban transition: A refutation of the "stalled urbanisation' hypothesis
T2  - URBAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nigeria contains some of Africa's oldest and newest cities, hosts five of the 30 largest urban settlements on the continent, and is estimated to have the biggest urban population on the continent. Yet many of the basic facts' about spatial-demographic trends in Nigeria have been contested. Most recently, an article published in World Development in 2012 claimed that urbanisation had stalled in Nigeria. In an effort to establish and explain the stylised facts of Nigeria's urban transition we analyse demographic and spatial trends drawing on diverse sources, including censuses, household surveys, remotely sensed data and migration studies conducted over the past three decades. The evidence does not support the claim of stalled urbanisation: Nigeria's urban population is growing rapidly in absolute terms and will continue to increase as a share of the national population because of both rural-urban migration and rural transformation. These drivers of urbanisation are a product of persistently high fertility in a context of declining mortality in both rural and urban areas. Robust economic growth over the past decade likely accelerated urbanisation, but even as the economy slows demographic fundamentals will continue to drive rapid urban growth and urbanisation.

TI  - Characterization of Subgrid-Scale Variability in Particulate Matter with Respect to Satellite Aerosol Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent use of satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) to characterize surface concentrations of particulate matter (PM) air pollution has proven extremely valuable in estimating exposures for health effects studies. While the spatial resolutions of satellite data provide far better coverage than existing fixed site surface monitoring stations, they are not able to capture atmospheric processes such as dilution of primary pollutants that vary at small spatial scales. As a result, small-scale variability due to highly localized sources such as traffic may be poorly represented, which in turn may lead to exposure measurement error in epidemiological analyses. Using a fixed spatial grid representing 4.4 km Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) aerosol observations, we examined the spatial variability in fine and coarse mode PM (PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 respectively) measured at ground monitors from a unique spatially-dense sampling campaign in Southern California. We found that while the variance in measured PM2.5 differed seasonally (warm 6.82 mu g(2)/m(6) and cool 24.5 mu g(2)/m(6)) across the study region, the average subgrid (<4.4 km) variance did not (warm 2.03 mu g(2)/m(6) and cool 2.43 mu g(2)/m(6)) and was significantly smaller. On the other hand, ground monitor PM2.5-10 concentrations showed large variance in warm (18.6 mu g(2)/m(6)) and cool (20.6 mu g(2)/m(6)) seasons, as well as seasonal differences in subgrid variance (warm 8.90 mu g(2)/m(6) and cool 3.28 mu g(2)/m(6)). Geostatistical analysis of the semivariance as a function of distance indicated that variability in measured PM2.5 and PM2.5-10 concentrations was relatively constant for spatial scales of one to five kilometers, but there was evidence of small-scale (-500 m) variability in PM2.5-10 concentrations in the cool season. The lack of small-scale spatial variability in the warm season was likely due to large photochemical contributions to regional PM2.5, and greater regional contributions to PM2.5-10 from windblown dust. In contrast, in the cool season there tends to be greater localized concentrations from primary traffic sources due to stronger nocturnal inversions and delayed morning winds reducing dilution that contribute to greater spatial heterogeneity. Overall, these results suggest that regional contributions tend to dominate PM2.5, and spatial resolutions of satellite observations including the 4.4 km MISR and 3 km MODIS aerosol products aptly capture relevant spatial variability. Coarse PM2.5-10 can have seasonally dependent localized contributions, leading to small-scale variability below current satellite aerosol product resolutions.

TI  - Mapping nighttime PM<sub>2.5</sub> from VIIRS DNB using a linear mixed-effect model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) from daytime satellite aerosol products is widely reported in the literature; however, remote sensing of nighttime surface PM2.5 from space is very limited. PM2.5 shows a distinct diurnal cycle and PM2.5 concentration at 1:00 local standard time (LST) has a linear correlation coefficient (R) of 0.80 with daily-mean PM2.5. Therefore, estimation of nighttime PM2.5 is required toward an improved understanding of temporal variation of PM2.5 and its effects on air quality. Using data from the Day/Night Band (DNB) of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and hourly PM2.5 data at 35 stations in Beijing, a mixed-effect model is developed here to estimate nighttime PM2.5 from nighttime light radiance measurements based on the assumption that the DNB-PM2.5 relationship is constant spatially but varies temporally. Cross-validation showed that the model developed using all stations predict daily PM2.5 with mean determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.87 +/- 0.12, 0.83 +/- 0.10, 0.87 +/- 0.09, 0.83 +/- 0.10 in spring, summer, autumn and winter. Further analysis showed that the best model performance was achieved in urban stations with average cross-validation R-2 of 0.92. In rural stations, DNB light signal is weak and was likely smeared by lunar illuminance that resulted in relatively poor estimation of PM2.5. The fixed and random parameters of the mixed-effect model in urban stations differed from those in suburban stations, which indicated that the assumption of the mixed-effect model should be carefully evaluated when used at a regional scale.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on TIMESAT 3.2 platform, MODIS NDVI data (2000-2015) of Qaidam Basin are fitted, and three main phenological parameters are extracted with the method of dynamic threshold, including the start of growth season (SGS), the end of growth season (EGS) and the length of growth season (LGS). The spatial and temporal variation of vegetation phenology and its response to climate changes are analyzed respectively. The conclusions are as follows: (1) SGS is mainly delayed as a whole. Areas delayed are more than the advanced in EGS, and EGS is a little delayed as a whole. LGS is generally shortened. (2) With the altitude rising, SGS is delayed, EGS is advanced, and LGS is shortened and phenophase appears a big variation below 3000 m and above 5000 m. (3) From 2000 to 2015, the temperature appears a slight increase along with a big fluctuation, and the precipitation increases evidently. (4) Response of phenophase to precipitation is not obvious in the low elevation humid regions, where SGS arrives early and EGS delays; while, in the upper part of the mountain regions, SGS delays and EGS advances with temperature rising, SGS arrives early and EGS delays with precipitation increasing.

TI  - Lymphatic transit rate as a predictive parameter for nodal metastasis in primary limb malignant melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF DERMATOLOGICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The status of sentinel lymph node (SLN) is one of the most predictive prognostic factors in patients with clinically localized malignant melanomas (MMs). However, since the positive SLN metastatic rate is as low as 20%, it is desirable to minimize SLN biopsy performance with imaging. By dynamic lymphoscintigraphy, we have proposed the lymphatic transit rate (LTR), the value that the distance between the primary lesion and SLN is divided by scintigraphic saturation time. LTR represents the scintigraphic saturation velocity and can be used for evaluation of metastasis of skin cancers.& para;& para;Methods: Dynamic lymphoscintigraphy data from 36 lymph nodes in 36 patients with primary MM on the limb were analyzed. The initial sites of the MMs were the lower limb in 24 patients and the upper limb in 12 patients. Histopathologically, nodal metastasis was found in 10 patients.& para;& para;Results: In the lower limb MM, the mean LTRs were 3.49 cm/min in histologically non-metastatic SLNs and 4.49 cm/min in histologically metastatic SLNs (P = 0.0056). In the upper limb MM, the mean LTRs were 2.59 cm/min in non-metastatic SLNs and 3.94 cm/min in metastatic SLNs (P = 0.0162). Thus, significantly higher LTRs were obtained in the metastatic SLNs. All SLNs with LTR < 4.0 cm/min in the lower limb MM and those with LTR < 3.0 cm/min in the upper limb MM were non-metastatic.& para;& para;Conclusion: LTR is a useful predictive indicator for nodal metastasis and SLN biopsy performance in MMs. (C) 2018 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.

TI  - Mechanism of the 2015 volcanic tsunami earthquake near Torishima, Japan
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tsunami earthquakes are a group of enigmatic earthquakes generating disproportionally large tsunamis relative to seismic magnitude. These events occur most typically near deep-sea trenches. Tsunami earthquakes occurring approximately every 10 years near Torishima on the Izu-Bonin arc are another example. Seismic and tsunami waves from the 2015 event [M-w (moment magnitude) = 5.7] were recorded by an offshore seafloor array of 10 pressure gauges, similar to 100 km away from the epicenter. We made an array analysis of dispersive tsunamis to locate the tsunami source within the submarine Smith Caldera. The tsunami simulation from a large caldera-floor uplift of similar to 1.5 m with a small peripheral depression yielded waveforms remarkably similar to the observations. The estimated central uplift, 1.5 m, is similar to 20 times larger than that inferred from the seismologically determined non-double-couple source. Thus, the tsunami observation is not compatible with the published seismic source model taken at face value. However, given the indeterminacy of M-zx, M-zy, and M-{tensile} of a shallow moment tensor source, it may be possible to find a source mechanism with efficient tsunami but inefficient seismic radiation that can satisfactorily explain both the tsunami and seismic observations, but this question remains unresolved.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Modeling Algorithms for Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation in a Subtropical Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based forest aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation has been extensively explored in the past three decades, but how to effectively combine different sensor data and modeling algorithms is still poorly understood. This research conducted a comparative analysis of different datasets (e.g., Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), ALOS PALSAR L-band data, and their combinations) and modeling algorithms (e.g., artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), k-nearest neighbor (kNN), and linear regression (LR)) for AGB estimation in a subtropical region under non-stratification and stratification of forest types. The results show the following: (1) Landsat TM imagery provides more accurate AGB estimates (root mean squared error (RMSE) values in 27.7-29.3 Mg/ha) than ALOS PALSAR (RMSE values in 30.3-33.7 Mg/ha). The combination of TM and PALSAR data has similar performance for ANN and SVR, worse performance for RF and KNN, and slightly improved performance for LR. (2) Overestimation for small AGB values and underestimation for large AGB values are major problems when using the optical (e.g., Landsat) or radar (e.g., ALOS PALSAR) data. (3) LR is still an important tool for AGB modeling, especially for the AGB range of 40-120 Mg/ha. Machine learning algorithms have limited effects on improving AGB estimation overall, but ANN can improve AGB modeling when AGB values are greater than 120 Mg/ha. (4) Forest type and AGB range are important factors that influence AGB modeling performance. (5) Stratification based on forest types improved AGB estimation, especially when AGB was greater than 160 Mg/ha, using the LR approach. This research provides new insight for remote sensing-based AGB modeling for the subtropical forest ecosystem through a comprehensive analysis of different source data, modeling algorithms, and forest types. It is critical to develop an optimal AGB modeling procedure, including the collection of a sufficient number of sample plots, extraction of suitable variables and modeling algorithms, and evaluation of the AGB estimates.

TI  - Modelling forest canopy height by integrating airborne LiDAR samples with satellite Radar and multispectral imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially-explicit information on forest structure is paramount to estimating aboveground carbon stocks for designing sustainable forest management strategies and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. LiDAR measurements provide samples of forest structure that must be integrated with satellite imagery to predict and to map landscape scale variations of forest structure. Here we evaluate the capability of existing satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with multispectral data to estimate forest canopy height over five study sites across two biomes in North America, namely temperate broadleaf and mixed forests and temperate coniferous forests. Pixel size affected the modelling results, with an improvement in model performance as pixel resolution coarsened from 25 m to 100 m. Likewise, the sample size was an important factor in the uncertainty of height prediction using the Support Vector Machine modelling approach. Larger sample size yielded better results but the improvement stabilised when the sample size reached approximately 10% of the study area. We also evaluated the impact of surface moisture (soil and vegetation moisture) on the modelling approach. Whereas the impact of surface moisture had a moderate effect on the proportion of the variance explained by the model (up to 14%), its impact was more evident in the bias of the models with bias reaching values up to 4 m. Averaging the incidence angle corrected radar backscatter coefficient (gamma degrees) reduced the impact of surface moisture on the models and improved their performance at all study sites, with R-2 ranging between 0.61 and 0.82, RMSE between 2.02 and 5.64 and bias between 0.02 and -0.06, respectively, at 100 m spatial resolution. An evaluation of the relative importance of the variables in the model performance showed that for the study sites located within the temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome ALOS-PALSAR HV polarised backscatter was the most important variable, with Landsat Tasselled Cap Transformation components barely contributing to the models for two of the study sites whereas it had a significant contribution at the third one. Over the temperate conifer forests, Landsat Tasselled Cap variables contributed more than the ALOS-PALSAR HV band to predict the landscape height variability. In all cases, incorporation of multispectral data improved the retrieval of forest canopy height and reduced the estimation uncertainty for tall forests. Finally, we concluded that models trained at one study site had higher uncertainty when applied to other sites, but a model developed from multiple sites performed equally to site-specific models to predict forest canopy height. This result suggest that a biome level model developed from several study sites can be used as a reliable estimator of biome-level forest structure from existing satellite imagery.

TI  - Modeling the hydrological impacts of land use/land cover changes in the Andassa watershed, Blue Nile Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the hydrological response of a watershed to land use/land cover (LULC) changes is imperative for water resources management planning. The objective of this study was to analyze the hydrological impacts of LULC changes in the Andassa watershed for a period of 1985-2015 and to predict the LULC change impact on the hydrological status in year 2045. The hybrid land use classification technique for classifying Landsat images (1985, 2000 and 2015); Cellular-Automata Markov (CA-Markov) for prediction of the 2030 and 2045 LULC states; the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for hydrological modeling were employed in the analyses. In order to isolate the impacts of LULC changes, the LULC maps were used independently while keeping the other SWAT inputs constant. The contribution of each of the LULC classes was examined with the Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) model. The results showed that there was a continuous expansion of cultivated land and built-up area, and withdrawing of forest, shrubland and grassland during the 1985-2015 periods, which are expected to continue in the 2030 and 2045 periods. The LULC changes, which had occurred during the period of 1985 to 2015, had increased the annual flow (2.2%), wet seasonal flow (4.6%), surface runoff (9.3%) and water yield (2.4%). Conversely, the observed changes had reduced dry season flow (2.8%), lateral flow (5.7%), groundwater flow (7.8%) and ET (0.3%). The 2030 and 2045 LULC states are expected to further increase the annual and wet season flow, surface runoff and water yield, and reduce dry season flow, groundwater flow, lateral flow and ET. The change in hydrological components is a direct result of the significant transition from the vegetation to non-vegetation cover in the watershed. This suggests an urgent need to regulate the LULC in order to maintain the hydrological balance. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Influence of predation risk on the sheltering behaviour of the coral-dwelling damselfish, <i>Pomacentrus moluccensis</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES
M3  - Article
AB  - Predation is a key ecosystem function, especially in high diversity systems such as coral reefs. Not only is predation one of the strongest top-down controls of prey population density, but it also is a strong driver of prey behaviour and function through non-lethal effects. We ask whether predation risk influences sheltering behaviour of damselfish living in mutualism with branching corals. Host corals gain multiple advantages from the mutualistic relationship which are determined by the strength of damselfish sheltering. Distance travelled by the Lemon Damselfish Pomacentrus moluccensis away from their host colony was measured here as a proxy for sheltering strength and was expected to be shortest under highest predation risk. Predation risk, defined as a function of predator abundance and activity, turbidity and habitat complexity, was quantified at four reef slope sites in Kepulauan Seribu, Indonesia. Damselfish sheltering strength was measured using stationary unmanned video cameras. Small damselfish (< 2 cm) increased their sheltering strength under high turbidity. Predator feeding activity, but not abundance, influenced damselfish sheltering strength. Contrary to our expectations, sheltering behaviour of adult damselfish decreased under high predator activity. While these observations are in line with risk-averse behaviour by juvenile P. moluccensis, they may indicate the presence of sentinel behaviour in the adults of this species. Habitat complexity seemed to be less important as a driver of damselfish behaviour. These counterintuitive results may indicate complex social behaviour and age-specific strategies for predator avoidance.

TI  - Lithological Classification Using Sentinel-2A Data in the Shibanjing Ophiolite Complex in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As a source of data continuity between Landsat and SPOT, Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), which acquires 13 bands in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) range. In this study, a Sentinel-2A imager was utilized to assess its ability to perform lithological classification in the Shibanjing ophiolite complex in Inner Mongolia, China. Five conventional machine learning methods, including artificial neural network (ANN), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), maximum likelihood classification (MLC), random forest classifier (RFC), and support vector machine (SVM), were compared in order to find an optimal classifier for lithological mapping. The experiment revealed that the MLC method offered the highest overall accuracy. After that, Sentinel-2A image was compared with common multispectral data ASTER and Landsat-8 OLI (operational land imager) for lithological mapping using the MLC method. The comparison results showed that the Sentinel-2A imagery yielded a classification accuracy of 74.5%, which was 2.5% and 5.08% higher than those of the ASTER and OLI imagery, respectively, indicating that Sentinel-2A imagery is adequate for lithological discrimination, due to its high spectral resolution in the VNIR to SWIR range. Moreover, different data combinations of Sentinel-2A + ASTER + DEM (digital elevation model) and OLI + ASTER + DEM data were tested on lithological mapping using the MLC method. The best mapping result was obtained from Sentinel-2A + ASTER + DEM dataset, demonstrating that OLI can be replaced by Sentinel-2A, which, when combined with ASTER, can achieve sufficient bandpasses for lithological classification.

TI  - All-sky satellite data assimilation at operational weather forecasting centres
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article reviews developments towards assimilating cloud- and precipitation-affected satellite radiances at operational forecasting centres. Satellite data assimilation is moving beyond the "clear-sky" approach that discards any observations affected by cloud. Some centres already assimilate cloud- and precipitation-affected radiances operationally and the most popular approach is known as "all-sky," which assimilates all observations directly as radiances, whether they are clear, cloudy or precipitating, using models (for both radiative transfer and forecasting) that are capable of simulating cloud and precipitation with sufficient accuracy. Other frameworks are being tried, including the assimilation of humidity retrieved from cloudy observations using Bayesian techniques. Although the all-sky technique is now proven for assimilation of microwave radiances, it has yet to be demonstrated operationally for infrared radiances, though several centres are getting close. Assimilating frequently available all-sky infrared observations from geostationary satellites could give particular benefit for short-range forecasting. More generally, assimilating cloud- and precipitation-affected satellite observations improves forecasts in the medium range globally and can also improve the analysis and shorter-range forecasting of otherwise poorly observed weather phenomena as diverse as tropical cyclones and wintertime low cloud.

TI  - God Says It, That Settles It? The Nature and Place of Moral Authorities in Political Discourse
T2  - CHRISTIAN BIOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Public policy discussions involve certain presuppositions about ethical authorities, but disclosing ethical authorities is controversial to many. Some argue that a just society, to say nothing of public persuasion, suffers when an appeal is made to a particular worldview and the moral authority found within it. Others make bald and rash appeals to moral authorities and even consider the attachment of other reasons to them as self-undermining. In this essay, I attempt to show that moral authorities are relevant and legitimately disclosed in public ethics debates. However, for Christians in particular, I point to examples drawn from the Bible not only to show that public persuasion goes beyond mere authorial-appeal and embraces authorial-reasoning, where public advocates identify the ethical directive, but also to explain why public policy derived from that directive is sensible for everyone.

TI  - Inland advance of supraglacial lakes in north-west Greenland under recent climatic warming
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The inland advance of supraglacial lakes (SGLs) towards the interior regions of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) may have implications for the water volumes reaching the subglacial drainage system, and could consequently affect long-term ice-sheet dynamics. Here, we investigate changes to the areas, volumes and elevation distributions of over 8000 manually delineated SGLs using 44 Landsat images of a 6200 km(2) sector of north-west Greenland over three decades (1985-2016). Our results show that SGLs have advanced to higher maximum (+418 m) and mean (+299 m) elevations, and that there has been a near-doubling of total regional SGL areas and volumes over the study period, accelerating after 2000. These changes were primarily caused by an increased SGL area and volume at high (>= 1200 m a.s.l.) elevations, where SGL coverage increased by over 2750% during the study period. Many of the observed changes, particularly the post-2000 accelerations, were driven by changes to regional surface-temperature anomalies. This study demonstrates the past and accelerating response of the GrlS's hydrological system due to climatic warming, indicating an urgent need to understand whether the increasingly inland SGLs will be capable of hydrofracture in the future, thus determining their potential implications for ice-sheet dynamics.

TI  - A coexistence of Paradigms: Understanding Human-environmental Relations of Fishers Involved in the Bycatch of Threatened Marine Species
T2  - CONSERVATION & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we study a fishing community and its relationship with non-human species, including threatened marine mammals and turtles incidentally captured by fishers. We focus on the interaction between this fishing community and a group of conservation experts who seek to protect these vulnerable species by proposing the testing of alternative fishing gear. This conservation practice, however, ignores the fishing community's worldview - which includes its relationship with animal species and the links and negotiations established with other stakeholders. Through an interdisciplinary ethnographic approach, we find that although fishers classify species according to their capacity to be exploited as a resource, they may also be willing to become strategic conservationists by negotiating with conservation experts to protect some of these species. The coexistence of strategic conservation and resource exploitation practices in this fishing community does not preclude the existence of an 'implicit communalism', in which resource exploitation is rooted in daily intimacy with various species. A comprehensive reconstruction of local perspectives and practices is a first step towards a democratic exchange between local and expert knowledge in pursuit of the conservation of biodiversity.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The concept of the noospheric balance as the main tool for solving global environmental problems was proposed in the doctrine of V.I. Vernadsky. Noospheric balance is a reasonable consumption of material and energetic resources and their accelerated reproduction on the basis of the scientific and technological progress achievements. The noospheric balance components are directly related to the environmental culture and religion. A new noospheric worldview underlies application of the noospheric balance to the solution of global environmental problems. The same attitude to the environment brings religions and Science closer together and inevitably takes us to the noospheric worldview as a doctrine of the faith in the power of mind. The second component of the noospheric balance is associated with the scientific and technological progress, primarily in the energy sector. The humanity will obtain an environmentally-friendly inexhaustible source of energy which is mass-to-energy transformation (E = mc(2)) that will allow solving any global problems. Such research is already underway.

TI  - Epidemiology of vaccine-preventable diseases in Japan: considerations for pre-travel advice for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games
T2  - WESTERN PACIFIC SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In 2019 and 2020, Japan will host two international sporting events estimated to draw a combined 22 million visitors. Mass gatherings like these ones increase the risk of spread of infectious disease outbreaks and international transmission. Pre-travel advice reduces that risk.Methods: To assist ministries of health and related organizations in developing pre-travel advice, we summarized national surveillance data in Japan (2000-2016, to the extent available) for rubella, invasive pneumococcal disease, measles, non-A and non-E viral hepatitis, hepatitis A, invasive Haemophilus influenzae disease, tetanus, typhoid fever, invasive meningococcal disease, Japanese encephalitis, influenza, varicella, mumps and pertussis by calculating descriptive statistics of reported cases and reviewing trends. (See Annex A for details of reviewed diseases.)Results: Our findings showed notable incidences of rubella (1.78 per 100 000 person-years), influenza (243.5 cases per sentinel site), and mumps (40.1 per sentinel site); seasonal increases for influenza (November-May) and Japanese encephalitis (August-November); and a geographical concentration of Japanese encephalitis in western Japan. Measles cases decreased from 11 013 in 2008 to 35 in 2015, but outbreaks (n = 165 cases) associated with importation occurred in 2016. Though invasive meningococcal disease incidence was only 0.03 per 100 000, international transmission occurred at a mass gathering in Japan in 2015.Discussion: Ministries of health and related organizations should use these findings to develop targeted pre-travel advice for travellers to the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, especially for mumps, measles, rubella, influenza, and meningitis. Travellers with increased exposure risk should also be advised about hepatitis A and Japanese encephalitis.

TI  - An Efficient Parallel Multi-Scale Segmentation Method for Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is an essential step in geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) to ultimately derive "meaningful objects". While many segmentation methods exist, most of them are not efficient for large data sets. Thus, the goal of this research is to develop an efficient parallel multi-scale segmentation method for RS imagery by combining graph theory and the fractal net evolution approach (FNEA). Specifically, a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm in graph theory is proposed to be combined with a minimum heterogeneity rule (MHR) algorithm that is used in FNEA. The MST algorithm is used for the initial segmentation while the MHR algorithm is used for object merging. An efficient implementation of the segmentation strategy is presented using data partition and the " reverse searching-forward processing" chain based on message passing interface (MPI) parallel technology. Segmentation results of the proposed method using images from multiple sensors (airborne, SPECIM AISA EAGLE II, WorldView-2, RADARSAT-2) and different selected landscapes (residential/industrial, residential/agriculture) covering four test sites indicated its efficiency in accuracy and speed. We conclude that the proposed method is applicable and efficient for the segmentation of a variety of RS imagery (airborne optical, satellite optical, SAR, high-spectral), while the accuracy is comparable with that of the FNEA method.

TI  - Case study of inclined sporadic E layers in the Earth's ionosphere observed by CHAMP/GPS radio occultations: Coupling between the tilted plasma layers and internal waves
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We have used the radio occultation (RO) satellite data CHAMP/GPS (Challenging Minisatellite Payload/Global Positioning System) for studying the ionosphere of the Earth. A method for deriving the parameters of ionospheric structures is based upon an analysis of the RO signal variations in the phase path and intensity. This method allows one to estimate the spatial displacement of a plasma layer with respect to the ray perigee, and to determine the layer inclination and height correction values. In this paper, we focus on the case study of inclined sporadic E (E-s) layers in the high-latitude ionosphere based on available CHAMP RO data. Assuming that the internal gravity waves (IGWs) with the phase-fronts parallel to the ionization layer surfaces are responsible for the tilt angles of sporadic plasma layers, we have developed a new technique for determining the parameters of IGWs linked with the inclined E-s structures. A small-scale internal wave may be modulating initially horizontal E-s layer in height and causing a direction of the plasma density gradient to be rotated and aligned with that of the wave propagation vector k. The results of determination of the intrinsic wave frequency and period, vertical and horizontal wavelengths, intrinsic vertical and horizontal phase speeds, and other characteristics of IGWs under study are presented and discussed.

AB  - In this study, visible near infrared, shortwave infrared spectral bands of Landsat 8 satellite sensor, two polarisation channel of L band ALOS-PALASAR sensor, SRTM-DEM derived digital elevation data were processed to delineate different geomorphic components of alluvial fans of Tista-Mahanada fan complex. We found image composite of independent components, principal components of Landsat 8 bands were effective in delineating proximal and distal fan segments. Fused images of Landsat 8 and ALOS data were used for enhancing incised distributaries and paleochannels. Field data on depositional sequence of fans, were used to substantiate the image based delineation. Topographic breaks along selected longitudinal profiles (identified with the changes in land use and drainage pattern) of digital elevation data were conjugately analysed using Landsat false colour composites. GPR survey along selected transect highlights the vertical dislocation in the recently deposited sequences of alluvial fan regime indicative of post depositional disturbances.

TI  - Detecting Trends in Wetland Extent from MODIS Derived Soil Moisture Estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A soil wetness index for optical satellite images, the Transformed Wetness Index (TWI) is defined and evaluated against ground sampled soil moisture. Conceptually, TWI is formulated as a non-linear normalized difference index from orthogonalized vectors representing soil and water conditions, with the vegetation signal removed. Compared to 745 ground sites with in situ measured soil moisture, TWI has a globally estimated Random Mean Square Error of 14.0 (v/v expressed as percentage), which reduces to 8.5 for unbiased data. The temporal variation in soil moisture is significantly captured at 4 out of 10 stations, but also fails for 2 to 3 out of 10 stations. TWI is biased by different soil mineral compositions, dense vegetation and shadows, with the latter two most likely also causing the failure of TWI to capture soil moisture dynamics. Compared to soil moisture products from microwave brightness temperature data, TWI performs slightly worse, but has the advantages of not requiring ancillary data, higher spatial resolution and a relatively simple application. TWI has been used for wetland and peatland mapping in previously published studies but is presented in detail in this article, and then applied for detecting changes in soil moisture for selected tropical regions between 2001 and 2016. Sites with significant changes are compared to a published map of global tropical wetlands and peatlands.

TI  - Feasibility of Estimating Cloudy-Sky Surface Longwave Net Radiation Using Satellite-Derived Surface Shortwave Net Radiation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface longwave net radiation (LWNR) is a vital component in the surface radiation budget. Major progress has been made in the estimations of clear-sky LWNR. However, the estimation of cloudy-sky LWNR remains a significant challenge. In this paper, a linear model (LM) and a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) model were developed to estimate the cloudy-sky LWNR from a satellite-derived surface shortwave net radiation product. Spatially and temporally matched satellite data and ground-measured LWNR, which was collected at 24 sites from four networks, were used to build and validate the linear and MARS models. The effects of land cover, climate type, and surface elevation on the estimate of LWNR were also analyzed. The MARS model, incorporating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface elevation (H) as the inputs, had the best performance. The determination coefficient, BIAS, and root mean square error (RMSE) were 0.51, 0.01 W/m(2), and 26.10 W/m(2), respectively. The developed model, when combined with freely distributed Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products, showed promise for producing surface LWNR and all-sky surface net radiation.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Invasive Lobular Carcinoma of the Breast
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the breast makes up 5 to 15 percent of all invasive breast cancers. It has distinctive clinical and histopathological features when compared to invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). This study intends to describe factors influencing sentinel lymph node (SLN) positivity in patients with "pure" ILC.Materials and Methods: Data of 105 patients, who were treated at a tertiary oncology center, with lobular carcinoma of the breast that were subjected to SLN biopsy was probed retrospectively. Patients were categorized as <= 60 and >60 years of age, positive or negative for estrogen receptor and progesterone, tumor grade I, II and III, Ki67 <= 15% and >30%, lymphovascular invasion presence and the presence of multicentricity and multifocality.Results: Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 52 (38-81). Mean tumor size was 2.7 cm (0.7-13cm). Univariate analyses revealed a significant relationship between tumor size (<= 2 cm vs >2cm) and metastasis in the SLN. This relation kept its significance in multivariate analyses. (p=0.013).Conclusion: With so many different characteristics from IDC, ILC is mostly a uniform tumor. In this study, tumor size was the only independent clinical parameter that was found related to SLN metastases.

TI  - Sonographic Evaluation of Axillary Lymph Nodes in Women with Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer at the University College Hospital Ibadan, Nigeria
T2  - NIGERIAN POSTGRADUATE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node (LN) status of patients with breast cancer is important in the surgical management. Sonographic evaluation of axillary LNs in newly diagnosed breast cancer is required to predict prognosis. Objective: The purpose of this study was to describe the morphologic features by sonographic evaluation of the cortices and sinuses as well as patterns of blood flow of axillary LNs and correlate same with the clinical staging in women with newly diagnosed breast cancer in a tertiary referral centre. Patients and Methods: This was a prospective and descriptive study of 106 newly diagnosed female breast cancer patients recruited from the surgical outpatient clinic of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, during a period of 9 months in 2015. All 106 patients had clinical evaluation, sociodemographic documentation and ultrasound scans of the breast and axillae performed. Results: The mean age of patients was 48.1 (+/- 11.1) years with age range 20-82 years. Most patients have a negative family history of breast cancer as seen in 97 (91.4%) of them. Abnormal cortex-hilum area ratio was more frequent in the right (66.7%) than the left (41.2%) axillary LNs. Longitudinal-transverse ratio was abnormal in 93.5% and 86.3% of LNs in the right and left axillae, respectively. Slit-like hilum, eccentric cortical thickening, replaced node and rat-bite appearance, respectively, were found in 40.7%, 10.4%, 48.4% and 44.4% of LNs in the right axilla. The peripheral flow type was demonstrated in 46.8% and 48.1% of LNs in the right and left axillae, respectively. Conclusion: Ultrasonography is a good diagnostic tool that can be employed with reasonable accuracy in the initial assessment of axillary involvement in breast cancer. Although the assessment of tumour size and clinical staging leaves little doubt as to the stage of breast cancer disease, sonographic evaluation of the breast and the axilla painted a more ominous picture.

TI  - A Multilayer Surface Temperature, Surface Albedo, and Water Vapor Product of Greenland from MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A multilayer, daily ice surface temperature (IST)-albedo-water vapor product of Greenland, extending from March 2000 through December 2016, has been developed using standard MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data products from the Terra satellite. To meet the needs of the ice sheet modeling community, this new Earth Science Data Record (ESDR) is provided in a polar stereographic projection in NetCDF format, and includes the existing standard MODIS Collection 6.1 IST and derived melt maps, and Collection 6 snow albedo and water vapor maps, along with ancillary data, and is provided at a spatial resolution of -0.78 km. This ESDR enables relationships between IST, surface melt, albedo, and water vapor to be evaluated easily. We show examples of the components of the ESDR and describe some uses of the ESDR such as for comparison with skin temperature, albedo, and water vapor output from Modem Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). Additionally, we show validation of the MODIS IST using in situ and aircraft data, and validation of MERRA-2 skin temperature maps using MODIS IST and in situ data. The ESDR has been assigned a DOI and will be available through the National Snow and Ice Data Center by the summer of 2018.

TI  - Implications of employing detailed urban canopy parameters for mesoscale climate modelling: a comparison between WUDAPT and GIS databases over Vienna, Austria
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the major obstacles to using numerical weather prediction models for guidance on mitigating urbanization's impact on local and regional climate is the lack of detailed and model ready morphological data at urban scale. The World Urban Database and Access Portal Tool (WUDAPT) is a recent project developed to extract climate relevant information on urban areas, in the form of local climate zones (LCZs), out of remote sensing imagery. This description of the urban landscape has been tested and used for parameterization of different urban canopy models (UCM) for mesoscale studies. As detailed information is usually bounded within cities' centres, crowdsourced and remote sensing data offer the possibility to move beyond the old barriers of urban climate investigations by studying the full range of variation from the urban core to the periphery and its related impacts on local climate. Thus, for this study we sought to compare the relative impact of using the WUDAPT methodology versus a simplified definition of the urban morphology extracted out of detailed GIS information to initialize a regional weather model and compare the output against official and crowdsourced weather station networks. A case study over Vienna, Austria was conducted using the weather research forecasting (WRF) model, coupled with the building effect parameterization and building energy models (BEP-BEM) in five distinct seasonal periods. Results demonstrated that using detailed GIS data to derive morphological descriptions of LCZs for mesoscale studies provided only a marginal overall improvement over using the default WUDAPT parameters based on the ranges proposed by Stewart and Oke (2012). The findings also highlighted the importance of developing techniques that are better at capturing the morphological heterogeneity across the entire urban landscape and thus improve our understandings of UCM performance over urban areas.

TI  - How Does Snow Persistence Relate to Annual Streamflow in Mountain Watersheds of the Western US With Wet Maritime and Dry Continental Climates?
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - With climate warming, many regions are experiencing changes in snow accumulation and persistence. These changes are known to affect streamflow volume, but the magnitude of the effect varies between regions. This research evaluates whether variables derived from remotely sensed snow cover can be used to estimate annual streamflow at the small watershed scale across the western U.S., a region with a wide range of climate types. We compared snow cover variables derived from MODIS, snow persistence (SP), and snow season (SS), to more commonly utilized metrics, snow fraction (fraction of precipitation falling as snow, SF), and peak snow water equivalent (SWE). Each variable represents different information about snow, and this comparison assesses similarities and differences between the snow metrics. Next, we evaluated how two snow variables, SP and SWE, related to annual streamflow (Q) for 119 USGS reference watersheds and examined whether these relationships varied for wet/warm (precipitation surplus) and dry/cold (precipitation deficit) watersheds. Results showed high correlations between all snow variables, but the slopes of these relationships differed between climates, with wet/warm watersheds displaying lower SF and higher SWE for the same SP. In dry/cold watersheds, both SP and SNODAS SWE correlated with Q spatially across all watersheds and over time within individual watersheds. We conclude that SP can be used to map spatial patterns of annual streamflow generation in dry/cold parts of the region. Applying this approach to the Upper Colorado River Basin demonstrates that 50% of streamflow comes from areas >3,000 masl. If the relationship between SP and Q is similar in other dry/cold regions, this approach could be used to estimate annual streamflow in ungauged basins.

TI  - Axillary staging for breast cancer during pregnancy: feasibility and safety of sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Safety of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy for breast cancer during pregnancy is insufficiently explored. We investigated efficacy and local recurrence rate in a large series of pregnant patients.Women diagnosed with breast cancer who underwent SLN biopsy during pregnancy were identified from the International Network on Cancer, Infertility and Pregnancy, the German Breast Group, and the Cancer and Pregnancy Registry. Chart review was performed to record technique and outcome of SLN biopsy, locoregional and distant recurrence, and survival.We identified 145 women with clinically N0 disease who underwent SLN during pregnancy. The SLN detection techniques were as follows: Tc-99m-labeled albumin nanocolloid only (n = 96; 66.2%), blue dye only (n = 14; 9.7%), combined technique (n = 15; 10.3%), or unknown (n = 20; 13.8%). Mapping was unsuccessful in one patient (0.7%) and she underwent an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Mean number of SLNs was 3.2 (interquartile range 1-3; missing n = 15). Positive SLNs were found in 43 (29.7%) patients and 34 subsequently underwent ALND. After a median follow-up of 48 months (range 1-177), 123 (84.8%) patients were alive and free of disease. Eleven patients experienced a locoregional relapse, including 1 isolated ipsilateral axillary recurrence (0.7%). Eleven (7.6%) patients developed distant metastases, of whom 9 (6.2%) died of breast cancer. No neonatal adverse events related to SLN procedure during pregnancy were reported.SLN biopsy during pregnancy has a comparably low axillary recurrence rate as in nonpregnant women. Therefore, this method can be considered during pregnancy instead of standard ALND for early-stage, clinically node-negative breast cancer.

TI  - Woody Cover Estimates in Oklahoma and Texas Using a Multi-Sensor Calibration and Validation Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Woody cover encroachment/expansion/conversion is a complex phenomenon that has environmental and economic impacts around the world. This research demonstrates the development of highly accurate models for estimating percent woody cover using high spatial resolution image data in combination with multi-seasonal Landsat reflectance products. We use a classification and regression tree (CART) approach to classify woody cover using fine resolution multispectral National Agricultural Imaging Program (NAIP) data. A continuous classification and regression tree (Cubist) ingests the aggregated woody cover classification along with the seasonal Landsat data to create a continuous woody cover model. We applied the models, derived by Cubist, across several Landsat scenes to estimate the percentage of woody plant cover, within each Landsat pixel, over a larger regional extent. We measured an average absolute error of 12.1 percent and a correlation coefficient of 0.78 for the models performed. The method of modelling percent woody cover established in this manuscript outperforms currently available woody cover estimates including Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF), on average by 26 percent, and Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) products, on average by 16 percent, for the region of interest. Current woody cover products are also limited to certain years and not available pre-2000. This manuscript describes a novel Cubist-based technique to model woody cover for any area of the world, as long as fine (similar to 1-2 m) spatial resolution and Landsat data are available.

AB  - Total RMSE (Root-Mean-Square Error) in geometric correction was obtained as 0.42 and 0.36 for images of 1999 and 2013, respectively. Then, the best band combination was specified in the images of 1999 and 2013 which was the combination of 2, 3, and 5 bands in the image of 1999 and the combination of 3, 6, and 7 bands in the image of 2013). The classification was performed and results showed a reduction in the area of residential use classes from 372.87 to 329.31, a reduction in dense forest from 1126.44 to 844.11, an increase in tea gardens from 1225.17 to 1519.92, and an increase in semi-dense forest from 121.59 to 152.73 hectares. Investigating the maximum likelihood classification also showed that the images of 1999 with kappa coefficient of 95.51 and the overall accuracy of 96. 80 % have higher accuracy than the images of 2013 with kappa coefficient of 89.30 and overall accuracy of 92.80%. During the recent decades, deciduous forests have been molested by human intervention. Easy access, abundance and diversity of valuable forest products have led to increased population, creating new residential areas and deforestation activities and use satellite data suggest to management natural resources.

T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Two years field experiment on strawberry plants (cv. Sweet Charlie) in Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt was carried out to study the effect of different growing conditions (organic and conventional) and the effect of some colors of plastic mulch such as clear, black, and silver on the quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the strawberry plantations using hyper spectral remotely sensed data. As the first step, spectral reflectance pattern for the different treatments (fertilization and colors of plastic mulch) was identified through in situ spectral measurements. It was found that silver plastic mulch recorded higher values with all observed vegetative and fruit traits, as compared with an organic strawberry growing systems without plastic mulch. Spectral reflectance parameters in form of vegetation indices (VIs) were examined as yield estimators and their correlation with leaf area index (LAI) was observed. Generated models with accuracy assessment were explained and the optimal vegetation index to estimate yield under each treatment was identified. Generally, it was found that fertilization has more effect on spectral characteristics than plastic mulch. Spectral vegetation indices (VIs) showed higher accuracy than LAI as yield estimators. (Spectral - yield) models showed the same trend with adequate correlation coefficient (r(2)) exceeded (0.7) except the treatment of black plastic mulch conventional system that showed (r(2)) less than (0.6) with two yield estimators. All generated models with an accuracy of each model are explained in the following sections.

TI  - Land-Use Regression Modelling of Intra-Urban Air Pollution Variation in China: Current Status and Future Needs
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rapid urbanization in China is leading to substantial adverse air quality issues, particularly for NO2 and particulate matter (PM). Land-use regression (LUR) models are now being applied to simulate pollutant concentrations with high spatial resolution in Chinese urban areas. However, Chinese urban areas differ from those in Europe and North America, for example in respect of population density, urban morphology and pollutant emissions densities, so it is timely to assess current LUR studies in China to highlight current challenges and identify future needs. Details of twenty-four recent LUR models for NO2 and PM2.5/PM10 (particles with aerodynamic diameters <2.5 mu m and <10 mu m) are tabulated and reviewed as the basis for discussion in this paper. We highlight that LUR modelling in China is currently constrained by a scarcity of input data, especially air pollution monitoring data. There is an urgent need for accessible archives of quality-assured measurement data and for higher spatial resolution proxy data for urban emissions, particularly in respect of traffic-related variables. The rapidly evolving nature of the Chinese urban landscape makes maintaining up-to-date land-use and urban morphology datasets a challenge. We also highlight the importance for Chinese LUR models to be subject to appropriate validation statistics. Integration of LUR with portable monitor data, remote sensing, and dispersion modelling has the potential to enhance derivation of urban pollution maps.

TI  - Reducing Uncertainties in Applying Remotely Sensed Land Use and Land Cover Maps in Land-atmosphere Interaction: Identifying Change in Space and Time
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) data are a central component of most land-atmosphere interaction studies, but there are two common and highly problematic scale mismatches between LULC and climate data. First, in the spatial domain, researchers rarely consider the impact of scaling up fine-scale LULC data to match coarse-scale climate datasets. Second, in the temporal domain, climate data typically have sub-daily, daily, monthly, or annual resolution, but LULC datasets often have much coarser (e. g., decadal) resolution. We first explored the effect of three spatial scaling methods on correlations among LULC data and a land surface climatic variable, latent heat flux in China. Scaling by a fractional method preserved significant correlations among LULC data and latent heat flux at all three studied scales (0.50, 1.0', and 2.50), whereas nearest-neighbor and majority-aggregation methods caused these correlations to diminish and even become statistically non-significant at coarser spatial scales (i.e., 2.5 degrees). In the temporal domain, we identified fractional changes in croplands, forests, and grasslands in China using a recently developed and annually resolved time series of LULC maps from 1982 to 2012. Relative to common LULC change (LULCC) analyses conducted over two-time steps or several time periods, this annually resolved, 31-year time series of LULC maps enables robust interpretation of LULCC. Specifically, the annual resolution of these data enabled us to more precisely observe three key and statistically significant LULCC trends and transitions that could have consequential effects on land-atmosphere interaction: (1) decreasing grasslands to increasing croplands in the Northeast China plain and the Yellow river basin, (2) decreasing croplands to increasing forests in the Yangtze river basin, and (3) decreasing grasslands to increasing forests in Southwest China. Our study not only demonstrates the importance of using a fractional spatial rescaling method, but also illustrates the value of annually resolved LULC time series for detecting significant trends and transitions in LULCC, thus potentially facilitating a more robust use of remotely sensed data in land-atmosphere interaction studies.

TI  - STUDY OF DENSITY AND CHANGE OF MANGROVE COVER USING SATELLITE IMAGERY IN SEBATIK ISLAND NORTH BORNEO
T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forest is a susceptive ecosystem which needs continuous monitoring to detect various threats such as human activities and natural disasters. Remote sensing and geographical information system (GIS) are very effective tools to be used in monitoring mangrove ecosystem due to they can reach large areas and periodically. Application of remote sensing technology to monitor mangrove ecosystem in Sebatik Island had never been conducted before. This research is important to be carried out to reveal changes in condition of mangrove forest in Sebatik Island. Aims of this research were analyzing the correlation between Normalized Different Vegetation Index (NDVI) values and its canopy cover percentages, calculated the accuracy of land cover classification with different spatial resolution, and measuring the changes of mangrove covers from 2005 to 2016. Land cover classification in this research used supervised classification with Maximum Likelihood algorithm. The NDVI was used as mangrove density indicator and vegetation condition. Field data measurement was taken to count canopy cover. The accuracy of Landsat images classification was about 83% and the SPOT 6 images around of 90%. Mangrove forest in Sebatik Island had increased from 2005 to 2016 as high as 31.27%. The correlation between NDVI and canopy percent cover were categorized as high with their coeficient correlation r=0.82 (Landsat 8) and 0.85 (SPOT 6).

TI  - Test of sampling methods to optimize the calibration of vine water status spatial models
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant water status is one of the main factors affecting yield and quality in viticulture. Nevertheless, it is generally difficult to characterize it with enough precision for management purposes. In addition to its temporal variation, related to climate conditions, it has been shown that it is also spatially variable within the vineyard. In practical terms, this makes traditional reference measurements both too costly and time consuming to be affordable. In contrast, it has been shown that spatial variation of plant water status can be inferred from more accessible information, such as plant vigour in Mediterranean conditions. The main practical limitation for this approach is that the relationship between vigour measurements and plant water status is specific for each block and needs to be explicitly calibrated. Furthermore, a high number of measurements are usually required for this calibration. The objective of this work was to propose and test sampling methods to optimize the calibration of a specific spatial model of vine water status using the minimum number of measurements. Two model-based sampling methods commonly used in non-spatial modelling, Kennard and Stone (K&S) and Surface Response (SR) were considered, tested and discussed. Satisfactory results were obtained with both methods: with a sample size of 9 calibration sites, both sampling methods gave similar errors to the reference model (Root Mean Standard Error of Prediction, RMSEP = 0.1 MPa), which was calibrated with 49 sites. Taking into consideration the advantages and limitations of each method, K&S is considered to be better adapted for the case study presented. The proposed sampling approach could be extended to other spatial models used in precision agriculture in which ancillary variables can be used to explain most of the spatial variation for any agronomic information of interest.

TI  - A Progressive Crop-Type Classification Using Multitemporal Remote Sensing Data and Phenological Information
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Local parameters for climate modelling are highly dependent on crop types and their phenological growth stage. The land cover change of agricultural areas during the growing season provides important information to distinguish crop types. The presented progressive classification algorithm identifies crop types based on their phenological development and their corresponding reflectance characteristics in multitemporal satellite images of the four sensors Landsat-7 and -8, Sentinel-2A and RapidEye. It distinguishes crop types not only retrospectively, but progressively during the growing season starting in early spring. Binary fuzzy c-means clustering differentiates seven crop types in eight decisions at particular time periods. These decisions are based on expert knowledge about plant characteristics in different phenological stages. The unsupervised classification approach and previously defined decisions enable the algorithm to work independently of training data. The fuzzy approach provides certainties of crop-type existence and generates first results in early spring. The accuracy and reliability of the classification results improve with increasing time. The method is developed at the German Durable Environmental Multidisciplinary Monitoring Information Network (DEMMIN). The study area is an official test site of the Joint Experiment of Crop Assessment and Monitoring (JECAM) and is located in an intensely agricultural used area in Northern Germany. Classification results were produced for the growing seasons 2015 and 2016. The overall accuracy in 2015 amounted to 89.49%. A challenge remains the distinct separation of wheat and rye, whereas barley, rapeseed, potato, corn and sugar beet are classified with high accuracies. The overall accuracy in 2016 was lower (77.19%) due to unfavourable weather conditions.

TI  - LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS AS A SOURCE OF FLORISTIC-STRUCTURAL HETEROGENEITY OF THE TREE COMPONENT IN AN AREA OF OMBROPHILOUS MIXED FOREST
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to test the hypothesis that different landscape elements, such as corridors, connected and non-connected forest fragments, have a tree component with floristic-structural differences. For this sake, the tree component of a fragment-corridor system was sampled by permanent plots (10 x 20 m), totaling an area of 1.4 ha. Within the plots, tree individuals with the circumference at breast height (cbh) greater than 15.7 cm, which botanical identities were determined in the field, were sampled and counted. The landscapes metrics (fragment size area, nearest neighbor distance and edge-interior relation) were extracted from a LANDSAT image, by FRAGSTAT software. The organization and richness of the tree component in the landscape were analyzed through Non-Metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS), non-parametric multivariate variance analysis (NPMANOVA), Jaccard and Bray-Curtis dissimilarities indices, rarefaction, Venn diagram and indicator species analysis. Three non-connected fragments, two connected fragments and two forest corridors were recognized. In these landscape elements, a total of 84 species, 60 genera and 36 botanical families were found. The most floristically distinctive landscape element was the corridor. The hypothesis that the different landscape elements have a tree component with floristic-structural differences was accepted, supporting the idea that the spatial organization of forest fragments and corridors is relevant for the organization of tree vegetation in a landscape scale.

TI  - THE RARE SOUTHERN TWAYBLADE (<i>NEOTTIA BIFOLIA</i>): SENTINEL OF ECOSYSTEM INTEGRITY FOR SPHAGNOUS SWAMPS
T2  - RHODORA
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term monitoring of the rare southern twayblade (Neottia bifolia; Orchidaceae) and understorey of a black spruce-tamarack, swamp community was conducted after construction of an airport taxiway above the swamp edge. Succession documented over 14 years in the treed swamp edge following disturbance involved loss of the twayblade, invasion by guilds of annuals, and shifts between original and new guilds of wetland plants. Despite changes, the twayblade was the only plant extirpated from the swamp edge community although fungal richness (mainly basidiomycete) was substantially lower in the edge than the swamp interior. NMS ordination indicated that the orchid niche is an undisturbed swamp with an intact tree canopy and unbroken mat of Sphagnum which supports a diverse mycorrhizal community adapted to summer water table drawdown and low ionic groundwater chemistry (e.g. Cl < 10 mg/L). Fourteen years after the disturbance, southern twayblade populations in the swamp interior, 100 m from the edge were in steady decline. The woodland orchids may be sentinels of ecosystem integrity. Loss of the twayblade signalled the onset of a post-development, disturbance-cascade: installation of an impervious surface restricted infiltration, altered run-off quantity and quality which subsequently resulted in loss of the ecosystem engineer, Sphagnum, and keystone mycorrhizal fungi.

AB  - We report a case of a non-invasive ductal carcinoma revealed on long-term follow-up of spontaneous nipple discharge. The patient, a 36-year-old woman, had noticed spontaneous nipple discharge from both breasts over a 3-year period. Mammography and ultrasonography did not reveal any lesions in the breasts. The nipple discharge from her left breast stopped 36 months after initial clinical assessment. However, the nipple discharges from her right breast transformed into a bloody discharge from a single duct. Ultrasonography showed a tumor, 6mm in diameter, in the upper-outer quadrant of her right breast. A core needle biopsy for breast tumor led to a pathological diagnosis of non-invasive ductal carcinoma. We conducted a whole-body clinical examination but no metastatic lesions were detected. Subsequently, we performed breastconserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. The pathological diagnosis was non-invasive ductal carcinoma in situ. The tumor was positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors, but negative for HER2/neu. The Ki-67 labeling index was 5%. The surgical margin was negative. We diagnosed the tumor as TisN0M0=Stage 0. Endocrine therapy comprising tamoxifen (20mg/day)was initiated. Four years after surgery, she was well without any metastases.

TI  - Mapping Forest Characteristics at Fine Resolution across Large Landscapes of the Southeastern United States Using NAIP Imagery and FIA Field Plot Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information is important for effective management of natural resources. In the field of forestry, field measurements of forest characteristics such as species composition, basal area, and stand density are used to inform and evaluate management activities. Quantifying these metrics accurately across large landscapes in a meaningful way is extremely important to facilitate informed decision-making. In this study, we present a remote sensing based methodology to estimate species composition, basal area and stand tree density for pine and hardwood tree species at the spatial resolution of a Forest Inventory Analysis (FIA) program plot (78 m by 70 m). Our methodology uses textural metrics derived at this spatial scale to relate plot summaries of forest characteristics to remotely sensed National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) aerial imagery across broad extents. Our findings quantify strong relationships between NAIP imagery and FIA field data. On average, models of basal area and trees per acre accounted for 43% of the variation in the FIA data, while models identifying species composition had less than 15.2% error in predicted class probabilities. Moreover, these relationships can be used to spatially characterize the condition of forests at fine spatial resolutions across broad extents.

TI  - How do you find the green sheep? A critical review of the use of remotely sensed imagery to detect and count animals
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - 1. Animal abundance data are essential for endangered species conservation, tracking invasive species spread, biosecurity, agricultural applications and wildlife monitoring; however, obtaining abundance data are a perennial challenge. Recent improvements in the resolution of remotely sensed imagery, and image-processing tools and software have facilitated improvement of methods for the detection of individual, generally large-bodied animals. The potential to monitor and survey populations from remotely sensed imagery is an exciting new development in animal ecology.2. We review the methods used to analyse remotely sensed imagery for their potential to estimate the abundance of wild and domestic animal populations by directly detecting, identifying and counting individuals.3.Despite many illustrative studies using a variety of methods for detecting animals from remotely sensed imagery, it remains problematic in many situations. Studies that demonstrated reasonably high accuracy using automated and semi-automated techniques have been undertaken on small spatial scales relative to the geographical range of the species of interest and/or in homogenous environments such as sea ice. The major limitations are the relatively low accuracy of automated detection techniques across large spatial extents, false detections and the cost of high-resolution data.4. Future developments in the analysis of remotely sensed data for population surveys will improve detection capabilities, including the advancement of algorithms, the crossover of software and technology from other disciplines, and improved availability, accessibility, cost and resolution of data.

TI  - Estimation of Soil Moisture in Vegetation-Covered Floodplains with Sentinel-1 SAR Data Using Support Vector Regression
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a significant parameter influencing various environmental processes in hydrology, ecology, and climatology. SAR-derived remote sensing products can be valuable input features for estimating SM. In the past, the results often lacked a sufficient spatial resolution for a local application. With the new Sentinel-1 sensor it seems possible to derive more detailed SM-maps. Therefore, we utilized this sensor to test the applicability of a support vector regression (SVR) based method for SM retrieval for two different grassland-covered floodplains in north-east Germany. The model was then tested for its transferability. Moreover, it was operating exclusively with free and publicly available data. In situ data of volumetric SM were collected in 2015 for both study areas at the Elbe and Peene rivers. Remote sensing input data were VV and VH backscatter, and local incidence angle derived from Sentinel-1 images, as well as height, slope, and aspect derived from SRTM images. Additionally, the Landsat 8 NDVI product was included to compensate vegetation influences on SAR backscatter. Overall, the SVR is capable of estimating SM reasonably accurate (RMSE 9.7 and 13.8 Vol% for the individual study sites). Nevertheless, the performance highly depends on the in situ data-particularly, on the amount of samples (here 98 Peene and 71 Elbe) and the value range (10-100 Vol% Peene and 12-87 Vol% Elbe). Furthermore, the optimal input feature combination and the best performance differed between study sites. In summary, backscatter, elevation, and NDVI were the most important features for SM prediction. Models using only Radar-derived features where only 1.05 or 2.01 Vol% worse than models including optical data and are, therefore, able to estimate SM. Combining samples from both study sites slightly impaired the model. Due to varying site-conditions in terms of humidity and vegetation cover, the transferability of the SVR models is not possible for the studied sites.

T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of urbanization will provide a framework for understanding the biophysical processes caused by artificial land changes. Sejong Multifunctional Administrative City MAC is under development since 2006 to decentralize the function of Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. MAC was originally agricultural land and now is rapidly developing to mega-city. Using U.S. Air Force Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System DMSP-OLS and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer MODIS satellite data, the spatio-temporal characteristics of nighttime light NTL emission, normalized difference vegetation index NDVI, land surface temperature LST, and surface albedo were investigated in MAC and its adjacent cities. NTL was generally stronger in the presence of vegetation degradation and surface warming conditions. LST was negatively correlated with a growth in vegetation. Those relationships among NTL, LST, and NDVI were shown both in temporal change at MAC and spatial variation of MAC's adjacent cites. Further, because the ratio value of LST to NDVI was similar in temporal and spatial scales, these two indices can be used as important indicator of urbanization. However, surface albedo is not suitable to represent the temporal transition from rural to urban state because tall buildings can often bring relatively low surface albedo by blocking outgoing radiation.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - MINERVA GINECOLOGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Appropriate extent of lymphadenectomy in clinically, early stage endometrial cancer remains controversial but sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has emerged as an alternative staging strategy, until the advent of molecular prognostic markers. We sought to perform a systematic review of the literature to determine pooled estimates for SLN detection rate and diagnostic accuracy, while exploring impact of the SLN on adjuvant therapy and oncologic outcomes.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We performed a systematic search utilizing Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science electronic databases for all studies published in the English language until October 31, 2017. Studies were included for review and potential aggregate analyses if they contained at least 30 endometrial cancer patients with undergoing SLN mapping and reported on detection rates (overall, bilateral or para-aortic) or diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity and negative predictive value [NPV]). Pooled estimates were calculated via meta-analyses utilizing a random-effects model. Studies reporting on the impact of SLN on adjuvant therapy, as well as studies comparing SLN mapping to completion lymphadenectomy were qualitatively reviewed and analyzed as well.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We identified 48 eligible studies, which included 5348 patients for review and inclusion in the meta-analysis for SLN detection or diagnostic accuracy. The pooled SLN detection rates were were 87% (95% CI : 8489%, 44 studies) for overall detection, 61% (95% CI : 56-66%, 36 studies) for bilateral detection, and 6% (95% CI : 3-9%, 31 studies) for para-aortic detection. Indocyanine green use improved overall (94%, 95% CI : 92-96%, 19 studies) SLN detection rates compared to blue tracer (86%, 95% CI : 83-89%, 31 studies) or technetium-99 (86%, 95% CI : 83-89%, 25 studies). This trend was similarly seen in terms of bilateral detection rates (74% vs. 59% vs. 57%, respectively). There was no difference in para-aortic SLN detection rate between each tracer. The pooled estimates for diagnostic accuracy for 34 studies were 94% (95% CI : 91-96%) for sensitivity and 100% (95% CI : 99 -100%) for NPV. Diagnostic accuracy of SLN mapping was not negatively affected in patients with high-grade endometrial histology. Patients with SLN mapping are more likely to receive adjuvant therapy and do not have inferior survival or recurrence outcomes compared to those undergoing completion lymphadenectomy.CONCLUSIONS: SLN mapping is a feasible and accurate alternative to stage patients with endometrial cancer. Utilizing indocyanine green results in the highest SLN detection rates. Future studies should prospectively examine the impact of SLN mapping on progression-free and overall survival.

TI  - Estimating Sub-Pixel Soybean Fraction from Time-Series MODIS Data Using an Optimized Geographically Weighted Regression Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soybean cultivation in China has significantly decreased due to the rising import of genetically modified soybeans from other countries. Understanding soybean's extent and change information is of great value for national agricultural policy implications and global food security. Some previous studies have explored the quantitative relationships between crop area and spectral variables derived from remote sensing data. However, both those linear or non-linear relationships were expressed by global regression models, which ignored the spatial non-stationarity of crop spectral signature and may limit the prediction accuracy. This study presented a geographically weighted regression model (GWR) to estimate fractional soybean at 250 m spatial resolution in Heilongjiang Province, one of the most important food production regions in China, using time-series MODIS data and high-quality calibration information derived from Landsat data. A forward stepwise optimization strategy was embedded with the GWR model to select the optimal subset of independent variables for soybeans. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of Julian day 233 to 257 when soybeans are filling seed was found to be the most important temporal period for sub-pixel soybean area estimation. Our MODIS-based soybean area compared well with Landsat-based results at pixel-level. Also, there was a good agreement between the MODIS-based result and census data at county level, with the coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.80 and the root mean square error (RMSE) was 340.21 km 2. Additionally, F-test results showed GWR model had better model goodness-of-fit and higher prediction accuracy than the traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) model. These promising results suggest crop spectral variations both at temporal and spatial scales should be considered when exploring its relationship with pixel-level crop acreage. The optimized GWR model by combining an automated feature selection strategy has great potential for estimating sub-pixel crop area at regional scale based on remote sensing time-series data.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite-Derived Phytoplankton Size Classes Using In-Situ Measurements in the South China Sea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean colour remote sensing is used as a tool to detect phytoplankton size classes (PSCs). In this study, the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) phytoplankton size classes (PSCs) products were compared with in-situ High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) data for the South China Sea (SCS), collected from August 2006 to September 2011. Four algorithms were evaluated to determine their ability to detect three phytoplankton size classes. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and absorption spectra of phytoplankton (aph(A)) were also measured to help understand PSC's algorithm performance. Results show that the three abundance-based approaches performed better than the inherent optical property (IOP)-based approach in the SCS. The size detection of microplankton and picoplankton was generally better than that of nanoplankton. A three-component model was recommended to produce maps of surface PSCs in the SCS. For the IOP-based approach, satellite retrievals of inherent optical properties and the PSCs algorithm both have impacts on inversion accuracy. However, for abundance-based approaches, the selection of the PSCs algorithm seems to be more critical, owing to low uncertainty in satellite Chl-a input data

TI  - Cascade optimization design of inter-satellite link enhanced with adaptability in future GNSS satellite networks
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Inter-satellite communication and inter-satellite ranging are the foundation of autonomous navigation for satellite navigation systems. Due to cost limitations, it has been proposed in recent years to equip each satellite with one spot beam antenna, which points to different satellites according to a polling mechanism, resulting in an intermittently connected satellite network. This poses the problem of how to design the inter-satellite link (ISL) contact plan, which determines the evolution of network topology and has important effects on system performance. We propose a new framework for the ISL contact plan design in satellite navigation systems. Considering contact plan design as a multi-parameter and multi-objective optimization problem, the cascade optimization design (COD) is proposed as a method simple to implement and optimize the parameters of the contact plan. COD considers network load and geometry of satellites and has a good adaptability. In the proposed framework, both communication and measurement requirements are taken into account while the contact sequence and the slot length are optimized in two steps. Simulation results show that COD guarantees zero packet drops and achieves the least average delay with a selected network load. When the packet arrival rate is 0.45 packets/s, the packet drop ratio of COD is zero, while that of the traditional simulated annealing design (SAD) is 2.58%. The delay of COD is 22.97 s, which is only two-fifth of the SAD value of 58.77 s. At the same time, using COD the average autonomous navigation weighted dilution of precision decreases from 1.4408 to 0.9671. COD also has strong robustness and performance regardless of the onboard buffer size.

TI  - Tropical Cyclone Boundary Layer Rolls in Synthetic Aperture Radar Imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) roll plays an important role in the turbulent exchange of momentum, sensible heat, and moisture throughout MABL of tropical cyclone (TC). Hence, rolls are believed to be closely related to TC's development, intensification, and decay processes. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides a unique capability to image the sea surface imprints of quasi-linear streaks induced by the MABL rolls within a TC. In this study, sixteen SAR images, including three images acquired during three major hurricanes: Irma, Jose, and Maria in the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, were utilized to systematically map the distribution and wavelength of MABL rolls under the wide range of TC intensities. The images were acquired by SAR onboard RADARSAT-1/2, ENVISAT, and SENTINEL-1 satellites. Our findings are in agreement with the previous one case study of Hurricane Katrina (2005), showing the roll wavelengths are between 600 and 1,600 m. We also find that there exist roll imprints in eyewall and rainbands, although the boundary layer heights are shallower there. Besides, the spatial distribution of roll wavelengths is asymmetrical. The roll wavelengths are found to be the shortest around the storm center, increase and then decrease with distance from storm center, reaching the peak values in the range of d-2d, where d is defined as the physical location to TC centers normalized by the radius of maximum wind. These MABL roll characteristics cannot be derived using conventional aircraft and land-based Doppler radar observations.

TI  - Retrospective observational study of emergency department syndromic surveillance data during air pollution episodes across London and Paris in 2014
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Poor air quality (AQ) is a global public health issue and AQ events can span across countries. Using emergency department (ED) syndromic surveillance from England and France, we describe changes in human health indicators during periods of particularly poor AQ in London and Paris during 2014.Methods Using daily AQ data for 2014, we identified three periods of poor AQ affecting both London and Paris. Anonymised near real-time ED attendance syndromic surveillance data from EDs across England and France were used to monitor the health impact of poor AQ. Using the routine English syndromic surveillance detection methods, increases in selected ED syndromic indicators (asthma, difficulty breathing and myocardial ischaemia), in total and by age, were identified and compared with periods of poor AQ in each city. Retrospective Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests were used to identify significant increases in ED attendance data on days with (and up to 3 days following) poor AQ.Results Almost 1.5 million ED attendances were recorded during the study period (27 February 2014 to 1 October 2014). Significant increases in ED attendances for asthma were identified around periods of poor AQ in both cities, especially in children (aged 0-14 years). Some variation was seen in Paris with a rapid increase during the first AQ period in asthma attendances among children (aged 0-14 years), whereas during the second period the increase was greater in adults.Discussion This work demonstrates the public health value of syndromic surveillance during air pollution incidents. There is potential for further cross-border harmonisation to provide Europe-wide early alerting to health impacts and improve future public health messaging to healthcare services to provide warning of increases in demand.

TI  - A Method to Upscale the Leaf Area Index (LAI) Using GF-1 Data with the Assistance of MODIS Products in the Poyang Lake Watershed
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A leaf area index is a key parameter reflecting the growth changes of vegetation and one of the most important canopy structural parameters for performing quantitative analyses of many ecological and climate models. Although using high-resolution satellite data and the radiative transfer model (RTM) can be used to generate high resolution LAI products, the RTM method has some problems because its temporal resolution is low, the input parameters are more appropriate for a physics model, and some parameters are difficult to obtain. Problems that urgently need to be solved include improving the temporal-spatial resolution for LAI products and localizing LAI products. To explore an applicable method for the high-resolution LAI products in a small basin and to improve the inversion accuracy, we propose an approach for GF-1 WFV LAI retrieval using MOD15A2 data and the measured LAI of the Poyang Lake watershed. Empirical models were used to retrieve high resolution LAI values, and the results show that these models are well designed for analyzing time-series satellite data. Good correlations were obtained between the NDVI of the GF-1 WFV data, the retrieved LAI values and the MODIS LAI data from samples acquired in both summer and winter. The exponential NDVI model obtained the best LAI value estimation results from the GF-1 WFV data (R2 = 0.697, RMSE = 1.100); the best synthetic validation of the RMSE is 0.883, close to the optimum model. Therefore, the retrieval results more fully reflect the growth process of the different features. This study proposed an upscale method for developing a high spatial resolution GF-1 satellite standard LAI products retrieval model using MODIS data. The proposed method will be helpful for efficiently improving the temporal-spatial resolution of LAI products to benefit the extraction of vegetation parameter information and dynamic land use monitoring.

TI  - Monitoring nitrogen status of potatoes using small unmanned aerial vehicles
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Small unmanned aircraft vehicles (UAV) are potential remote sensing platforms for precision agriculture. However, to be useful for in-season management, nitrogen status needs to be estimated sufficiently early in the growing season. To determine when differences in nitrogen status of irrigated potatoes could be detected, an experiment was established in 2013 with a randomized block design with four N fertilization rates and three replicates. Over the growing season, a small parafoil-wing UAV was used to acquire color-infrared images with pixel sizes between 20 and 25 mm. Two normalized difference spectral indices were determined from image digital numbers, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), which were then calibrated using reflectance-based NDVI and GNDVI. Unexpectedly, there were decreases in the NDVI and GNDVI calibrations with increased camera exposure time. After calibration, both NDVI and GNDVI were about equal to indices calculated using reflectances from high-altitude aerial photography and the WorldView-2 satellite. During tuber initiation and early tuber bulking, differences in measured leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll meter values and spectral indices were only detectable at the lowest N fertilization rate. Later in the growing season, all N treatments could be distinguished in the imagery, but too late to mitigate yield losses from N deficiency. Linear relationships between plot GNDVI and NDVI were hypothesized to differ among N treatments because there would be less chlorophyll content per leaf area. Contrary to the hypothesis, there were no differences among fertilization rates on either of the two sampling dates. Compared with alternative technologies, small UAV platforms and sensors may not provide value to farmers for in-season nitrogen management.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper analyzes motivations and experiences of foot-pilgrims in their journey to Karbala( Iraq) during the1Arbaeen pilgrimage. The study deploys an interpretivist paradigm consisting of a phenomenological approach and incorporates the Shia Islamic worldview to synthesize the findings. Findings reveal that Arbaeen foot-pilgrim's motives are driven by perpetual rituals practiced by the Shia community, and concern for society (umma). The 'umma' element recurred as a key motive for those who repeated the Arbaeen foot-pilgrimage. The experiential component emerging of the results indicate: religious; bodily; and hospitality/humanitarian aspects to be the significant elements of experiences. Managerial implications including future planning and policy are deliberated.

AB  - Correcting a sign error results in no changes to the key conclusions of Hutchings and others (2011). However, there is an improved agreement with previous work. Mean total sea-ice deformation scales log linearly with distance and the scaling exponent was found to be dependent on time. We find a linear relationship between the temporal scale and spatial scaling exponent, for timescales of an hour to a day. Extrapolating to the timescales of deformation resolved by RADARSAT, we find total deformation and distance scale with an exponent of between -0.16 and -0.19.

TI  - A Palliative Approach to Falls in Advanced Dementia
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF GERIATRIC PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Falls are viewed as a preventable cause of injury, functional loss, and death in older adults with dementia, and have been used as a marker of quality of care in long-term care facilities. Despite intensive intervention around fall prevention in these settings, falls and injury remain frequent, particularly among residents in the advanced stages of dementia. In this clinical review, we consider the common challenges and pitfalls in both the management of falls and the provision of palliative care in advanced dementia. We then describe a palliative approach to falls in advanced dementia that involves identifying individuals who would benefit from this care approach, framing falls and loss of mobility as a quality of life issue, and devising an individualized symptom assessment and management plan. A palliative approach can lead to recognition and acceptance that recurrent falls are often symptomatic of advanced dementia, and that not all falls are preventable. We conclude that falls in the advanced stage of dementia can be sentinel events indicating the need for a palliative approach to care. Rather than replace falls prevention activities, a palliative approach to falls prompts us to select dementia stage-appropriate interventions with a focus on symptom management, comfort, and dignity.

M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale, aims, and objectivesLean Six Sigma (LSS) has been recognized as an effective management tool for improving healthcare performance. Here, LSS was adopted to reduce the risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), a critical quality parameter in the healthcare sector.MethodsLean Six Sigma was applied to the areas of clinical medicine (including general medicine, pulmonology, oncology, nephrology, cardiology, neurology, gastroenterology, rheumatology, and diabetology), and data regarding HAIs were collected for 28,000 patients hospitalized between January 2011 and December 2016. Following the LSS define, measure, analyse, improve, and control cycle, the factors influencing the risk of HAI were identified by using typical LSS tools (statistical analyses, brainstorming sessions, and cause-effect diagrams). Finally, corrective measures to prevent HAIs were implemented and monitored for 1year after implementation.ResultsLean Six Sigma proved to be a useful tool for identifying variables affecting the risk of HAIs and implementing corrective actions to improve the performance of the care process. A reduction in the number of patients colonized by sentinel bacteria was achieved after the improvement phase.ConclusionsThe implementation of an LSS approach could significantly decrease the percentage of patients with HAIs.

AB  - Background: The LigaSure (TM) small jaw (LS-SJ) multifunctional tissue sealing system is mainly used in cervical operations. We aimed to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the LS-SJ in axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in comparison to the conventional method. Patients and Methods: Ninety-two patients with breast cancer who underwent total mastectomy and ALND were included in this study. The patients were divided into the LS-SJ group (n= 43) and the conventional-ALND (c-ALND) group (n= 49). Results: Patients with high body mass index values had a greater drainage volume and longer time to drain removal. The drainage volume was in the LS-SJ group was significantly lower than that in the c-ALND group. The time to drain removal and the hospitalization period were also significantly shorter in the LS-SJ group. The LS-SJ was more effective for ALND in obese patients. Conclusion: The results suggest the clinical usefulness of LS-SJ in ALND in patients with breast cancer, especially in obese patients.

TI  - Variability in Rates of Coastal Change Along the Yukon Coast, 1951 to 2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the reaction of Arctic coasts to increasing environmental pressure, coastal changes along a 210-km length of the Yukon Territory coast in north-west Canada were investigated. Shoreline positions were acquired from aerial and satellite images between 1951 and 2011. Shoreline change rates were calculated for multiple time periods along the entire coast and at six key sites. Additionally, Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) measurements of shoreline positions from seven field sites were used to analyze coastal dynamics from 1991 to 2015 at higher spatial resolution. The whole coast has a consistent, spatially averaged mean rate of shoreline change of 0.7 +/- 0.2 m/a with a general trend of decreasing erosion from west to east. Additional data from six key sites shows that the mean shoreline change rate decreased from -1.3 +/- 0.8 (1950s-1970s) to -0.5 +/- 0.6 m/a (1970s-1990s). This was followed by a significant increase in shoreline change to -1.3 +/- 0.3 m/a in the 1990s to 2011. This increase is confirmed by DGPS measurements that indicate increased erosion rates at local rates up to -8.9 m/a since 2006. Ground surveys and observations with remote sensing data indicate that the current rate of shoreline retreat along some parts of the Yukon coast is higher than at any time before in the 64-year-long observation record. Enhanced availability of material in turn might favor the buildup of gravel features, which have been growing in extent throughout the last six decades.Plain Language Summary The Arctic is warming, but the impacts on its coasts are not well documented. To better understand the reaction of Arctic coasts to increasing environmental pressure, shoreline position changes along a 210-km length of the Yukon Territory coast in northwest Canada were investigated for the time period from 1951 to 2015. Shoreline positions were extracted from historical aerial images from the 1950s, 1970s, and 1990s and from satellite images from 2011. Additionally, measurements of shoreline positions from field sites were used to analyze coastal dynamics from 1991 to 2015. The mean shoreline change rate was -1.3 m/a between the 1950s and 1970s and followed by a decrease to -0.5 m/a between the 1970s to 1990s. This was followed by a significant increase in mean shoreline change rates again to -1.3 m/a in the 1990s to 2011 time period. This acceleration in erosion is confirmed by field measurements that indicate increased erosion rates at high local rates up to -8.9 m/a since 2006. Enhanced coastal erosion might, in turn, favor the buildup of gravel features, which have been growing in extent throughout the last six decades.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The degraded Chunati wildlife sanctuary (CWS) has undergone various land use changes since 1980s. In this study, land use changes of CWS were assessed from 2005 to 2015 by using Landsat TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images. The ArcGIS v10.1 and ERDAS Imagine v14 were used to process satellite imageries and assessed quantitative data for land use change assessment of this study area. Maximum likelihood classification algorithm was used in order to derive supervised land use classification. It was found that about 256 ha of degraded forest area had been increased within 10 years (2005-2015) and the annual rate of change was 25.56%. Another 159 ha of naturally forested land had been changed to other land uses having an (-) annual rate of change of 15.88%. The overall supervised classification accuracy was found 92.16% for 2015, 86.15% for 2010, and 83.96% for 2005 with Kappa values of 0.89, 0.82, and 0.81 for 2015, 2010, and 2005, respectively and these were fairly satisfactory. The results of this study would be helpful to plan and implement important management decisions in order to conserve the rich biodiversity of Chunati wildlife sanctuary.

TI  - Modelling of Basin Wide Daily Evapotranspiration with a Partial Integration of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is the most significant water balance component and is also a very complex component to evaluate in spatio-temporal scales. Remotely-sensed data greatly increases the accuracy of basin wide ET estimation but only in periods with available satellite images. This paper describes an attempt to estimate daily ET regardless of the availability of the satellite images. The method is based on application of the interpolated evaporative fraction (L) from "historical" satellite images to periods with no satellite data available. Basin wide daily ET is obtained by combining interpolated L and standard PET methods on meteorological stations. The reliability of such approach was evaluated by comparing the obtained daily ET to the SEBAL ET estimates through the analysis of residuals (D), standard deviations of residuals (sigma) and the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NSE) over the basin. The SEBAL ET estimates were validated with the data from two lysimeters. The discrepancy of obtained ET versus the SEBAL ET estimates (Delta = 0.13 mm day(-1), sigma = 0.64 mm day(-1), NSE = 0.07) indicated that the proposed concept has relatively high accuracy, which is notably higher than the Penman-Monteith interpolated ET estimates (Delta = 1.94 mm day(-1), sigma = 1.03 mm day(-1), NSE = -4.71). It was shown that a total of five images can provide a reliable estimate of interpolated L and thus represent specific characteristics of a basin. As the presented concept requires minimum remote sensing data and ground based inputs, it could be applied to estimate basin wide daily ET in data scarce regions and in periods with no satellite images available.

TI  - EFFECT OF GROUNDWATER SALINITY LEVEL ON SOIL USING REMOTE SENSING AND GIS TECHNIQUES: CASE STUDY OF SOUTHWEST OF BASRA PROVINCE
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater salinity level is one of the most important considerations for monitoring soil degradation that threat some regions in the southwest of Basra Province, Iraq. The aim of this research is to assign the appropriate and effective image processing techniques to be implemented for monitoring, and then to evaluate groundwater salinity level map. Landsat TM 2000 and ETM 2015 images respectively have been selected, as well as ancillary data of the available salinity field measurements have been used. Spatial overlay analysis between salt affected areas and water table were made to assess spatial distribution as well as relationships with these features. The result shows that about 47.8% of the areas were low-saline in 2000. This gradually decreased to 35.9% in 2015. Large area change was observed in the slightly and moderately saline soil categories. High sensitive areas of saline soil were about 13.3% in 2000 and this increased to 19.4% in 2015. Areas highly vulnerable to salinization were related to the groundwater salinity level that normally occurred on the soil sediment in this location of study.

TI  - On the representation error in data assimilation
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Representation, representativity, representativeness error, forward interpolation error, forward model error, observation-operator error, aggregation error and sampling error are all terms used to refer to components of observation error in the context of data assimilation. This article is an attempt to consolidate the terminology that has been used in the earth sciences literature and was suggested at a European Space Agency workshop held in Reading in April 2014. We review the state of the art and, through examples, motivate the terminology. In addition to a theoretical framework, examples from application areas of satellite data assimilation, ocean reanalysis and atmospheric chemistry data assimilation are provided. Diagnosing representation-error statistics as well as their use in state-of-the-art data assimilation systems is discussed within a consistent framework.

TI  - Comparison of multihardware parallel implementations for a phase unwrapping algorithm
T2  - OPTICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase unwrapping is an important problem in the areas of optical metrology, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image analysis, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis. These images are becoming larger in size and, particularly, the availability and need for processing of SAR and MRI data have increased significantly with the acquisition of remote sensing data and the popularization of magnetic resonators in clinical diagnosis. Therefore, it is important to develop faster and accurate phase unwrapping algorithms. We propose a parallel multigrid algorithm of a phase unwrapping method named accumulation of residual maps, which builds on a serial algorithm that consists of the minimization of a cost function; minimization achieved by means of a serial Gauss-Seidel kind algorithm. Our algorithm also optimizes the original cost function, but unlike the original work, our algorithm is a parallel Jacobi class with alternated minimizations. This strategy is known as the chessboard type, where red pixels can be updated in parallel at same iteration since they are independent. Similarly, black pixels can be updated in parallel in an alternating iteration. We present parallel implementations of our algorithm for different parallel multicore architecture such as CPU-multicore, Xeon Phi coprocessor, and Nvidia graphics processing unit. In all the cases, we obtain a superior performance of our parallel algorithm when compared with the original serial version. In addition, we present a detailed comparative performance of the developed parallel versions. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Isolation and characterization of influenza A virus (H6N2) from a temporary artificial pond in Mexico
T2  - VETERINARIA MEXICO
M3  - Article
AB  - Most epidemiological surveillance studies of the influenza A virus (IAV) have focused on the isolation and detection of the virus in wild birds. However, there are limited descriptions of both the wild duck population and the purpose and size of the aquatic habitats where viruses have been detected or isolated. The objective of this study was to determine if a pond of 16 hectares (39.536 acres), used for agricultural and fishing purposes and visited by approximately 9000 wild migratory ducks consisting of nine different species during the wintering stay, is suitable to support the isolation of IAV. One influenza A virus was isolated from Pekin ducks used as sentinels during the wintering stay season from September 2007 to March 2008. Only one IAV subtype was isolated from 9 of the 88 samples collected from the sentinel ducks over seven months, and the molecular characterization of this isolate revealed an H6N2 virus subtype. Based on this information, it is suggested that a pond such as the one in this study provides a suitable biological setting to support the presence of IAV, but the minimum biological environment to isolate the influenza A virus is still unknown.

TI  - Statistical Analysis of SSMIS Sea Ice Concentration Threshold at the Arctic Sea Ice Edge during Summer Based on MODIS and Ship-Based Observational Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The threshold of sea ice concentration (SIC) is the basis for accurately calculating sea ice extent based on passive microwave (PM) remote sensing data. However, the PM SIC threshold at the sea ice edge used in previous studies and released sea ice products has not always been consistent. To explore the representable value of the PM SIC threshold corresponding on average to the position of the Arctic sea ice edge during summer in recent years, we extracted sea ice edge boundaries from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sea ice product (MOD29 with a spatial resolution of 1 km), MODIS images (250 m), and sea ice ship-based observation points (1 km) during the fifth (CHINARE-2012) and sixth (CHINARE-2014) Chinese National Arctic Research Expeditions, and made an overlay and comparison analysis with PM SIC derived from Special Sensor Microwave Imager Sounder (SSMIS, with a spatial resolution of 25 km) in the summer of 2012 and 2014. Results showed that the average SSMIS SIC threshold at the Arctic sea ice edge based on ice-water boundary lines extracted from MOD29 was 33%, which was higher than that of the commonly used 15% discriminant threshold. The average SIC threshold at sea ice edge based on ice-water boundary lines extracted by visual interpretation from four scenes of the MODIS image was 35% when compared to the average value of 36% from the MOD29 extracted ice edge pixels for the same days. The average SIC of 31% at the sea ice edge points extracted from ship-based observations also confirmed that choosing around 30% as the SIC threshold during summer is recommended for sea ice extent calculations based on SSMIS PM data. These results can provide a reference for further studying the variation of sea ice under the rapidly changing Arctic.

TI  - Downscaling AMSR-2 Soil Moisture Data With Geographically Weighted Area-to-Area Regression Kriging
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in the land surface energy balance and water cycle. Microwave remote sensing has been applied widely to estimate SM. However, the application of such data is generally restricted because of their coarse spatial resolution. Downscaling methods have been applied to predict fine-resolution SM from original data with coarse spatial resolution. Commonly, SM is highly spatially variable and, consequently, such local spatial heterogeneity should be considered in a downscaling process. Here, a hybrid geostatistical approach, which integrates geographically weighted regression and area-to-area kriging, is proposed for downscaling microwave SM products. The proposed geographically weighted area-to-area regression kriging (GWATARK) method combines fine-spatial-resolution optical remote sensing data and coarse-spatial-resolution passive microwave remote sensing data, because the combination of both information sources has great potential for mapping fine-spatial-resolution near-surface SM. The GWATARK method was evaluated by producing down-scaled SM at 1-km resolution from the 25-km-resolution daily AMSR-2 SM product. Comparison of the downscaled predictions from the GWATARK method and two benchmark methods on three sets of covariates with in situ observations showed that the GWATARK method is more accurate than the two benchmarks. On average, the root-mean-square error value decreased by 20%. The use of additional covariates further increased the accuracy of the downscaled predictions, particularly when using topography-corrected land surface temperature and vegetation-temperature condition index covariates.

TI  - A vegetation control on seasonal variations in global atmospheric mercury concentrations
T2  - NATURE GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic mercury emissions are transported through the atmosphere as gaseous elemental mercury (Hg(0)) before they are deposited to Earth's surface. Strong seasonality in atmospheric Hg(0) concentrations in the Northern Hemisphere has been explained by two factors: anthropogenic Hg(0) emissions are thought to peak in winter due to higher energy consumption, and atmospheric oxidation rates of Hg(0) are faster in summer. Oxidation-driven Hg(0) seasonality should be equally pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere, which is inconsistent with observations of constant year-round Hg(0) levels. Here, we assess the role of Hg(0) uptake by vegetation as an alternative mechanism for driving Hg(0) seasonality. We find that at terrestrial sites in the Northern Hemisphere, Hg(0) co-varies with CO2, which is known to exhibit a minimum in summer when CO2 is assimilated by vegetation. The amplitude of seasonal oscillations in the atmospheric Hg(0) concentration increases with latitude and is larger at inland terrestrial sites than coastal sites. Using satellite data, we find that the photosynthetic activity of vegetation correlates with Hg(0) levels at individual sites and across continents. We suggest that terrestrial vegetation acts as a global Hg(0) pump, which can contribute to seasonal variations of atmospheric Hg(0), and that decreasing Hg(0) levels in the Northern Hemisphere over the past 20 years can be partly attributed to increased terrestrial net primary production.

TI  - Vegetation responses to sagebrush-reduction treatments measured by satellites
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of vegetative indices derived from satellite imagery constitute tools to measure ecological effects of natural and management-induced disturbances to ecosystems. Over the past century, sagebrush-reduction treatments have been applied widely throughout western North America to increase herbaceous vegetation for livestock and wildlife. We used indices from satellite imagery to 1) quantify effects of prescribed-fire, herbicide, and mechanical treatments on vegetative cover, productivity, and phenology, and 2) describe how vegetation changed over time following these treatments. We hypothesized that treatments would increase herbaceous cover and accordingly shift phenologies towards those typical of grass-dominated systems. We expected prescribed burns would lead to the greatest and most-prolonged effects on vegetative cover and phenology, followed by herbicide and mechanical treatments. Treatments appeared to increase herbaceous cover and productivity, which coincided with signs of earlier senescence signals expected of grass-dominated systems, relative to sagebrush-dominated systems. Spatial heterogeneity for most phenometrics was lower in treated areas relative to controls, which suggested treatment-induced homogenization of vegetative communities. Phenometrics that explain spring migrations of ungulates mostly were unaffected by sagebrush treatments. Fire had the strongest effect on vegetative cover, and yielded the least evidence for sagebrush recovery. Overall, treatment effects were small relative to those reported from field-based studies for reasons most likely related to sagebrush recovery, treatment specification, and untreated patches within mosaicked treatment applications. Treatment effects were also small relative to inter-annual variation in phenology and productivity that was explained by temperature, snowpack, and growing-season precipitation. Our results indicated that cumulative NDVI, late-season phenometrics, and spatial heterogeneity of several phenometrics may serve as useful indicators of vegetative change in sagebrush ecosystems.

TI  - Assimilation of <i>GOES</i>-<i>13</i> Imager Clear-Sky Water Vapor (6.5 μm) Radiances into a Warn-on-Forecast System
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - A prototype convection-allowing system using the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) Model and employing an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation technique has been developed and used during the spring 2016 and 2017 Hazardous Weather Testbeds. This system assimilates WSR-88D reflectivity and radial velocity, geostationary satellite cloud water path (CWP) retrievals, and available surface observations over a regional domain with a 3-km horizontal resolution at 15-min intervals, with 3-km initial conditions provided by an experimental High-Resolution Rapid Refresh ensemble (HRRR-e). However, no information on upper-level thermodynamic conditions in cloud-free regions is currently assimilated, as few timely observations exist. One potential solution is to also assimilate clear-sky satellite radiances, which provide information on mid-and upper-tropospheric temperature and moisture conditions. This research assimilates GOES-13 imager water vapor band (6.5 mu m) radiances using the GSI-EnKF system to take advantage of the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) integration. Results using four cases from May 2016 showed that assimilating radiances generally had a neutral-to-positive impact on the model analysis, reducing humidity bias and/or errors at the appropriate model levels where verification observations were present. The effects on high-impact weather forecasts, as verified against forecast reflectivity and updraft helicity, were mixed. Three cases (9, 22, and 24 May) showed some improvement in skill, while the other (25 May) performed worse, despite the improved environment. This research represents the first step in designing a high-resolution ensemble data assimilation system to use GOES-16 Advanced Baseline Imager data, which provides additional water vapor bands and increased spatial and temporal resolution.

TI  - A Method for Robust Estimation of Vegetation Seasonality from Landsat and Sentinel-2 Time Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series from Landsat and Sentinel-2 satellites have great potential for modeling vegetation seasonality. However, irregular time sampling and frequent data loss due to clouds, snow, and short growing seasons, makes this modeling a challenge. We describe a new method for modeling seasonal vegetation index dynamics from satellite time series data. The method is based on box constrained separable least squares fits to logistic model functions combined with seasonal shape priors. To enable robust estimates, we extract a base level (i.e., the minimum dormant season value) from the frequency distribution of clear-sky vegetation index values. A seasonal shape prior is computed from several years of data, and in the final fits local parameters are box constrained. More specifically, if enough data values exist in a certain time period, the corresponding local parameters determining the shape of the model function over this period are relaxed and allowed to vary freely. If there are no observations in a period, the corresponding local parameters are locked to the parameters of the shape prior. The method is flexible enough to model interannual variations, yet robust enough when data are sparse. We test the method with Landsat, Sentinel-2, and MODIS data over a forested site in Sweden, demonstrating the feasibility and potential of the method for operational modeling of growing seasons.

TI  - Surgical-site infection following lymph node excision indicates susceptibility for lymphedema: A retrospective cohort study of malignant melanoma patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives: Cancer-related lymphedema is a common complication following lymph node excision. Prevention of lymphedema is essential, as treatment options are limited. Known risk factors are firmly anchored to the cancer treatment itself; however potentially preventable factors such as seroma and surgical-site infection (SSI) have yet to be asserted.Methods: All malignant melanoma patients treated with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) and/or complete lymph node dissection (CLND) in the axilla or groin between January 2008 and December 2014 were retrospectively identified. Identified patients were followed until March 2017 for the incidence of lymphedema.Results: We identified 70 cases of extremity lymphedema following 640 SNB/CLND. SSI was an independent risk factor for developing lymphedema (HR 8.46, 95% CI 4.37-16.36, p < 0.001), whilst seroma was an independent risk factor for developing SSI (OR 6.92, 95% CI 4.11-12.54, p < 0.001). In addition, the risk of lymphedema was significantly larger following inguinal incisions compared to axillary incisions (HR 2.49, 95% CI 1.36-4.55, p < 0.05).Conclusion: SSI was the greatest independent risk factor for developing lymphedema. Additionally, patients' that developed postoperative seroma were at an increased risk of also developing SSI. Future studies should examine if lymphedema can be prevented, by reducing seroma and SSI.

TI  - Measuring displacements of the Thompson River valley landslides, south of Ashcroft, BC, Canada, using satellite InSAR
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Thompson River valley, south of Ashcroft in British Columbia, Canada, has experienced several landslides since the mid-1800s. The national railways that run along the valley cross a number of these landslides. All the landslides occur in glacial deposits, typically sliding on weak clay layers. Some have failed rapidly to very rapidly and are currently inactive or showing deformation rates from a few millimeters to centimeters per year. An evaluation of satellite InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) using RADARSAT-2 images between September 2013 and November 2015 provides new insight into landslide displacements in the Thompson River valley. This information enhances the ongoing hazard management of unstable terrain. This paper presents the comparison of the InSAR measurements with other instrumentation (GPS and ShapeAccelArrays (TM) -SAA) installed at one moving landslide and then addresses the extent and magnitude of the slope movements observed. InSAR was found to provide similar displacement values to those measured otherwise. The stable location showed displacements of +/-1 mm with an average near zero during the whole monitoring period. Six areas of slope movement were identified within the study area, all within or adjacent to the footprints of past landslides. The average line of sight (LOS) displacement rates range between 11 and 39 mm/year. Most of the landslides exhibited seasonal variations in velocity that corresponds to changes in river elevation in the valley.

TI  - Family Separation, Reunification, and Intergenerational Trauma in the Aftermath of Human Trafficking in the United States
T2  - ANTI-TRAFFICKING REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Family reunification is a complex part of a survivor's journey; its processes long, arduous, and unassured. This article seeks to examine the intricacies of human trafficking and family separation in migration, and intergenerational trauma following family reunification. The authors apply theoretical frameworks and concepts established by literature on migration and trauma, and provide a case study to explain the implications of family separation that occurs during and after the survivor's human trafficking experience. Written from the perspective of social service providers, this article also provides a look at life after trafficking and how the individual's worldview is altered by the trauma endured, resulting in possible intergenerational transmission of trauma from parent to child. The article explains the family's process of moving from crisis back to balance, and the need for adjustment and adaptation, flexibility and cohesion in finding resilience. Finally, the authors discuss family resiliency frameworks as empowering models for serving survivors of human trafficking and their families during the reunification process. With the appropriate support, families can move forward in their journey towards healing.

TI  - Mapping of the corals around Hendorabi Island (Persian Gulf), using WorldView-2 standard imagery coupled with field observations
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - High spatial resolution WorldView-2 (WV2) satellite imagery coupled with field observations have been utilized for mapping the coral reefs around Hendorabi Island in the northern Persian Gulf. In doing so, three standard multispectral bands (red, green, and blue) were selected to produce a classified map for benthic habitats. The in situ observations were included photo-transects taken by snorkeling in water surface and manta tow technique. The satellite image has been classified using support vector machine (SVM) classifier by considering the information obtained from field measurements as both training and control points data. The results obtained from manta tow demonstrated that the mean total live hard coral coverage was 29.04% 2.44% around the island. Massive corals poritiids (20.70%) and branching corals acroporiids (20.33%) showed higher live coral coverage compared to other corals. Moreover, the map produced from satellite image illustrated the distribution of habitats with 78.1% of overall accuracy.

TI  - Practical consensus recommendations regarding the management of sentinel lymph node issues in early breast cancer
T2  - SOUTH ASIAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Axillary lymph node involvement is a very important poor prognostic factor in the clinical staging and management of breast cancer patients. Traditionally, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) has been used for determining the status of the axillary lymph nodes. More recently the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedure has gained wider acceptance as the standard of care, having the advantage of being less invasivewhile providing good accuracy. This expert group used data from published literature, practical experience and opinion of a large group of academic oncologists to arrive at these practical consensus recommendations in regards with the use of the two different procedures and other issues in patients with early breast cancer for the benefit of community oncologists.

TI  - Contribution of Remote Sensing on Crop Models: A Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Crop growth models simulate the relationship between plants and the environment to predict the expected yield for applications such as crop management and agronomic decision making, as well as to study the potential impacts of climate change on food security. A major limitation of crop growth models is the lack of spatial information on the actual conditions of each field or region. Remote sensing can provide the missing spatial information required by crop models for improved yield prediction. This paper reviews the most recent information about remote sensing data and their contribution to crop growth models. It reviews the main types, applications, limitations and advantages of remote sensing data and crop models. It examines the main methods by which remote sensing data and crop growth models can be combined. As the spatial resolution of most remote sensing data varies from sub-meter to 1 km, the issue of selecting the appropriate scale is examined in conjunction with their temporal resolution. The expected future trends are discussed, considering the new and planned remote sensing platforms, emergent applications of crop models and their expected improvement to incorporate automatically the increasingly available remotely sensed products.

TI  - Assessment of the Spatiotemporal Effects of Land Use Changes on Runoff and Nitrate Loads in the Talar River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This research surveyed the effects of land use changes on flow nitrate pollution in the Talar River (northern Iran), using Landsat images of 1991 and 2013 and the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The results indicated that forest areas decreased by 14.9% and irrigated crops, dry land farming areas, range lands and residential areas increased by 46.8%, 31.1%, 4.7% and 17.5%, respectively. To calibrate and validate the studied period, the Nash Sutcliffe model efficiency (NSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) were applied, ranging from 0.57 to 0.75 and from 0.62 to 0.76 for flow simulation and 0.84 and 0.63 and 0.75 and 0.83 for nitrate simulation, respectively. The results of land use scenarios indicated that respective water flow and nitrate loads increased by 34.4% and 42.2% in 1991-2013 and may even increase by 42.3% and 55.9% in the simulated period of 2013-2050 in all sub-basins. It is likely that the main reason for these results was due to the increase in agricultural activities and the decrease in forestry areas. Our findings showed the useful combination of modelling techniques (land cover changes and SWAT) to develop valuable maps able to design correct land management plans and nature-based solutions for water quality of runoff water harvesting systems in the future.

TI  - Evaluating Landsat and RapidEye Data for Winter Wheat Mapping and Area Estimation in Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - While publicly available, cost-free coarse and medium spatial resolution satellite data such as MODIS and Landsat perform well in characterizing industrial cropping systems, commercial high spatial resolution satellite data are often preferred alternative for fine scale land tenure agricultural systems such as found in Pakistan. In this article, we integrated commercial 5 m spatial resolution RapidEye and free 30 m Landsat imagery in characterizing winter wheat in Punjab province, Pakistan. Specifically, we used 5 m spatial resolution RapidEye imagery from peak of the winter wheat growing season to derive training data for the characterization of time-series Landsat data. After co-registration, each RapidEye image was classified into wheat/no wheat labels at the 5 m resolution and then aggregated as percent cover to 30 m Landsat grid cells. We produced four maps, two using RapidEye derived continuous training data (of percent wheat cover) as input to a regression tree model, and two using RapidEye derived categorical training data as input to a classification tree model. From the RapidEye-derived 30 m continuous training data, we derived Map 1 as percent wheat per pixel, and Map 2 as binary wheat/no wheat classification derived using a 50% threshold applied to Map 1. To create the categorical wheat/no wheat training data, we first converted the continuous training data to a wheat/no wheat classification, and then used these categorical RapidEye training data to produce a categorical wheat map from the Landsat data. Two methods for categorizing the training data were used. The first method used a 50% wheat/no wheat threshold to produce Map 3, and the second method used only pure wheat (>= 75% cover) and no wheat (<= 25% cover) training pixels to produce Map 4. The approach of Map 4 is analogous to a standard method in which whole, pure, high-confidence training pixels are delineated. We validated the wheat maps with field data collected using a stratified, two-stage cluster design. Accuracy of the maps produced from the percent cover training data (Map 1 and Map 2) was not substantially better than the accuracy of the maps produced from the categorical training data as all methods yielded similar overall accuracies (+/- standard error): 88% (+/- 4%) for Map 1, 90% (+/- 4%) for Map 2, 90% (+/- 4%) for Map 3, and 87% (+/- 4%) for Map 4. Because the percent cover training data did not produce significantly higher accuracies, sub-pixel training data are not required for winter wheat mapping in Punjab. Given sufficient expertise in supervised classification model calibration, freely available Landsat data are sufficient for crop mapping in the fine-scale land tenure system of Punjab. For winter wheat mapping in Punjab and other like landscapes, training data for supervised classification may be collected directly from Landsat images without the need for high resolution reference imagery.

TI  - Assessment of land surface temperature variation due to change in elevation of area surrounding Jaipur, India
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter for surface energy balance and urban climatology studies. LST is affected by the characteristics of the land surface such as vegetation cover and its type, land use-land cover and surface imperviousness. Incessant urbanization has resulted in many fold increase in the urban area and it has caused significant changes in the land surface. The difference in altitude of two points, that are located at different parts of a vast study area, may be large. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of change in elevation over LST. LST data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and digital elevation model from ASTER have been used. Consistent inverse linear trend is observed between LST and elevation for all the study seasons. High correlation (R-2 = 0.73-0.87) is found between elevation and mean LST. It is seen that the change in LST due to elevation difference between two points separated in space in horizontal direction varies from 3.5 degrees C to 4.6 degrees C per 1000 m which is relatively lesser than the condition when two points are separated in vertical direction (5.0 degrees C-10.0 degrees C per 1000 m) i.e. along a vertical column of air. The study concludes that in any study related with spatial distribution of LST over a large area, effect of change in elevation at different locations shall also be considered and LSTs at different location shall be rationalized on the basis of their comparative elevations.

TI  - Earthquake-Induced Landslides Hazard Zonation of Rudbar-Manjil Using CAMEL Model
T2  - GEOTECHNICAL AND GEOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake-induced landslides are of the phenomena that have caused huge losses to human in recent years. Although many studies on the identification and characterization of landslides are generally done, the review of landslides caused by earthquakes is very young especially in Iran. This paper describes zoning of landslides triggered by 1990 Rudbar-Manjil earthquake with moment magnitude (Mw) 7.3 using a comprehensive areal model of earthquake-induced landslides (CAMEL). At first, the necessary information including disturbance distance (distance from river and road), ground strength class, ground moisture, shaking intensity, slope angle, slope height, soil depth, terrain roughness, material type, and vegetation were collected using aerial photos, Landsat satellite images, geological and topographic maps, and site investigation of the studied region. These data were digitized and weighed using the digital geographic information system in a comparative manner, and then concentration and hazard of the seismic landslides were predicted using the CAMEL program. It can be concluded that CAMEL displays a better performance in predicting and zoning earthquake-induced soil landslides than earthquake-induced rock landslides.

AB  - Computer networking and internet developments create new challenges in information security and copyright protection. In order to protect the multimedia data and also in some cases, for information management, the authors can use watermarking schemes to achieve more security. In this article, the authors firstly review a watermarking scheme for remote sensing applications, represented by Zhu et al.; They also explain two problems in Zhu et al.'s scheme and in addition, introduce two solutions for these problems. Generally, Zhu et al.'s scheme is a non-blind scheme that also does not have any attention to watermarked image quality, thus they try to represent ways in order to achieve the blind and quality-aware watermarking. Experimental results confirm that both of their modifications have suitable effectiveness than the original scheme whereas in practice, their modifications create an output with embedding capacity like the original scheme but it is high quality and also blind.

TI  - Analysis of the Cooling Effects in Urban Green Areas using the Landsat 8 Satellite Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green areas or forest regions play an important role in lowering the air temperature of the surrounding areas. This cooling effect does not only affect inside of the green areas, but also extends into neighboring streets and buildings. In this study, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) are retrieved from the Landsat 8 satellite data for 8 clear days in Seoul, Korea from 2013 to 2015, and used for analyzing the cooling effect at an urban green region, Seonjeongneung, located in the southern part of Seoul. The LST distribution from the boundary of the Seonjeongneung presents that the cooling effect of the green areas was found to extend in many directions into the urban areas. The LST estimations of residential and commercial areas around the Seonjeongneung are also analyzed to assess how the green areas affect the type of land cover and the surroundings in the urban areas. Relatively lower LST for the residential areas from the Seonjeongneung boundary ranges from 100 to 250 m, resulting in an average cooling effect of 2.3 degrees C. On the other hand, the LST distribution in the commercial areas shows that the effective distance of green areas are relatively low in the range of 0 to 200 m, which means the average cooling effect is approximately 0.3 degrees C. This result shows that the cooling effect of the Seonjeongneung is clearly noticeable, particularly, the residential areas show greater cooling effect than commercial areas.

TI  - Retrieval of High Resolution Surface Net Radiation for Urban Area Using Satellite and CFD Model Data Fusion
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Net radiation is the total amount of radiation energy used as a heat flux for the Earth's energy cycle, and net radiation from the surface is an important factor in areas such as hydrology, climate, meteorological studies and agriculture. It is very important to monitoring the net radiation through remote sensing to be able to understand the trend of heat island and urbanization phenomenon. However, net radiation estimation using only remote sensing data is generally causes difference in accuracy depending on cloud. Therefore, in this paper, we retrieved and monitored high resolution surface net radiation at 1 hour interval in Eunpyeong New Town where urbanization using Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS), Landsat-8 satellite and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model data reflecting the difference in building height. We compared the observed and estimated net radiation at the flux tower. As a result, estimated net radiation was similar trend to the observed net radiation as a whole and it had the accuracy of RMSE 54.29 Wm(-2) and Bias 27.42 Wm(-2). In addition, the calculated net radiation showed well the meteorological conditions such as precipitation, and showed the characteristics of net radiation for the vegetation and artificial area in the spatial distribution.

TI  - Relative importance of hydrological variables in predicting the habitat suitability of <i>Euryale ferox</i> Salisb
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsAquatic ecosystems are a priority for conservation as they have become rapidly degraded with land-use changes. Predicting the habitat range of an endangered species provides crucial information for biodiversity conservation in such rapidly changing environments. However, the complex network structure of aquatic ecosystems restricts spatial prediction variables and has hitherto limited the use of habitat models to predict species occurrence in aquatic ecosystems. We used the maximum entropy model to evaluate the potential distribution of an endangered aquatic species, Euryale ferox Salisb. We tested the relative influence of (i) climatic variables, (ii) topographic variables, and (iii) hydrological variables derived from remote sensing data to improve the prediction of occurrence of aquatic plant species.MethodsWe considered the southern part of the Korean Peninsula as the modeling extent for the potential distribution of E. ferox. Occurrence records for E. ferox were collected from the literature and field surveys. We applied maximum entropy modeling using remotely sensed environmental variables and evaluated their relative importance as prediction variables with variation partitioning.Important FindingsThe species distribution model predicted potential habitats of E. ferox that matched the actual distribution well. Floodplain wetlands and shallow reservoirs were the favored habitats of E. ferox. Quantitative loss and fragmentation of wetland habitats appeared to be a major reason for the decrease of E. ferox populations. Our results also imply that hydrological variables (i.e. normalized difference water index) derived from remote sensing data greatly increased model prediction (relative contribution: 10.5-37.0%) in the aquatic ecosystem. However, interspecific competition within a similar niche environment should be considered to increase the accuracy of the distribution model.

AB  - The massive green tide occurred every summer in the Yellow Sea since 2008, and many studies are being actively conducted to estimate the coverage of green tide through analysis of satellite imagery. However, there is no satellite images selection criterion for accurate coverage calculation of green tide. Therefore, this study aimed to find a suitable satellite image from for the comparison of the green tide coverage according to the spatial resolution of satellite image. In this study, Landsat ETM+, MODIS and GOCI images were used to coverage estimation and its spatial resolution is 30, 250 and 500 m, respectively. Green tide pixels were classified based on the NDVI algorithm, the difference of the green tide coverage was compared with threshold value. In addition, we estimate the proportion of the green tide in one pixel through the Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU) method, and the effect of the difference of green tide ratio on the coverage calculation were evaluated. The result of green tide coverage from the calculation of the NDVI value, coverage of green tide usually overestimate with decreasing spatial resolution, maximum difference shows 1.5 times. In addition, most of the pixels were included in the group with less than 0.1 (10%) LSU value, and above 0.5 (50%) LSU value accounted for about 2% in all of three images. Even though classified as green tide from the NDVI result, it is considered to be overestimated because it is regarded as the same coverage even if green tide is not 100% filled in one pixel. Mixed-pixel problem seems to be more severe with spatial resolution decreases.

TI  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease as a sentinel marker for the development of diabetes mellitus in non-obese subjects
T2  - DIGESTIVE AND LIVER DISEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Non alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with substantial cardiometabolic morbidity.Aims: We evaluated the long-term extrahepatic complications of NAFLD and sought to evaluate NAFLD in non-obese subjects.Methods: A total of 2920 participants were retrospectively selected from a health check-up center in 2000, and followed through to December 2010. NAFLD was diagnosed using ultrasonography. Subjects were stratified according to body mass index, NAFLD, and metabolic syndrome.Results: The prevalence of non-obese NAFLD subjects and metabolically unhealthy non-obese subjects was 14.4% and 8.7%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, non-obese NAFLD subjects had a significantly higher risk for diabetes mellitus (DM; HR 2.69, 95% CI 1.72-4.20, P < 0.001); no increase was observed for hypertension or cardiovascular disease. Metabolically unhealthy non-obese subjects had a significantly higher risk for hypertension (HR 2.75, 95% CI 2.02-3.74, P<0.001), DM (HR 5.72, 95% CI 3.68-8.89, P<0.001), and cardiovascular disease (HR 2.93, 95% CI 1.53-5.63,P = 0.001). Subgroup analysis of non-obese subjects showed that NAFLD, without metabolic syndrome, conferred a higher risk for DM (HR 3.60, 95% CI 2.03-6.39, P<0.001).Conclusion: Non-obese subjects with NAFLD are at a higher risk for DM independent of metabolic syndrome.

TI  - JUDGING RELIGION AND JUDGES' RELIGIONS
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW AND RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - In liberal democracies with religiously diverse populations, it would be surprising and troubling if a judge relied on a religious text or precept to resolve a legal dispute. It would deeply offend principles of religious freedom if individuals were bound by judicial pronouncement to obey the dictates of a faith they do not share. However, some commentators have long claimed that a person's cultural worldview has an impact on the way they interpret laws and facts, and there is some empirical support for this claim. There is thus reason to expect that judges' worldviews have some effect on their decision-making. I argue that when judges deliberately avoid engaging with their own moral perspectives, they may mask to themselves the impact that such perspectives have on their decisions. The alternative of explicit reference to religious sources in judicial decisions, however, is too problematic for the religious freedom of legal subjects. I argue that judges should instead endeavor to be conscious of the in. uence their backgrounds have on their decision-making, but suggest that judicial institutions may be resistant to adopting practices that would support such an approach. The article draws on Canadian and American case law to demonstrate its argument but has wider applicability to liberal states.

TI  - Indicator-Based Soil Moisture Monitoring of Wetlands by Utilizing Sentinel and Landsat Remote Sensing Data
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise and region-wide information about soil moisture with a high spatial resolution is required for river flood plains to fulfil statutory provisions from the EU Water Framework Directive. Influenced by constraints like precipitation and vegetation cover, this complex parameter is often measured point-by-point. Continuous soil moisture products derived from remote sensing are currently available only at coarse spatial resolutions. In this context, plants are of special interest, as their growth and distribution is determined by soil properties. Plant characteristics can be utilized as indicators or proxies of mean soil moisture. This study focuses on the derivation of top soil layer moisture content based on these indicator values by synergistically utilizing different methods and active as well as passive sensors. Subsequently, a joint model was developed to derive a high spatial resolution soil moisture product for the investigated wetlands. This model reached a coefficient of determination of 0.93. The result is valuable to many different user groups like water or nature conservation authorities of all administrative levels. The implementation is mainly based on Sentinel-1 and -2 along with Landsat data sets. The high repetition rate of the Sentinel sensors can increase the classification accuracy of the bio-indicators by a precise mapping of the phenological stages. The results indicate that the method is transferable to other riparian areas to a certain degree. In addition, a time series analysis covering a period of 16 years based on a soil moisture index derived from Landsat data sets was realized. Changes in soil moisture, following restoration measures, emerge clearly and thus allow for a remote sensing-based monitoring of restoration success.

TI  - Improved estimates of glacier change rates at Nevado Coropuna Ice Cap, Peru
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of rates of glacier mass loss is critical for managing water resources and for assessing hazards at ice-clad volcanoes, especially in arid regions like southern Peru. In these regions, glacier and snow melt are crucial dry season water resources. In order to verify previously reported rates of ice area decline at Nevado Coropuna in Peru, which are anomalously rapid for tropical glaciers, we measured changes in ice cap area using 259 Landsat images acquired from 1980 to 2014. We find that Coropuna Ice Cap is presently the most extensive ice mass in the tropics, with an area of 44.1 km(2), and has been shrinking at an average area loss rate of 0.409 km(2) a(-1) (similar to 0.71% a(-1)) since 1980. Our estimated rate of change is considerably lower than previous studies (1.4 km(2) a(-1) or similar to 2.43% a(-1)), but is consistent with other tropical regions, such as the Cordillera Blanca located similar to 850 km to the NW (similar to 0.68% a(-1)). Thus, if glacier recession continues at its present rate, our results suggest that Coropuna Ice Cap will likely continue to contribute to water supply for agricultural and domestic uses until similar to 2120, which is nearly 100 years longer than previously predicted.

TI  - Adaptive Probability Thresholding in Automated Ice and Open Water Detection From RADARSAT-2 Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, we introduce adaptive probability thresholding in addition to our previously developed technique for automated detection of ice and open water from RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR dual-polarization HH-HV images. Situations where the probability threshold needs to be modified were identified based on the analysis of misclassified ice and water samples when the static probability threshold of 0.95 is applied. We found that with the use of the proposed approach, the fraction of misclassified ice samples decreased from 0.98% to 0.24% and the fraction of misclassified water samples decreased from 0.35% to 0.09% in the most clean verification scenario against Canadian Ice Service Image Analysis pure ice and water data, while the fraction of correctly classified ice and water samples did not decrease appreciably, from 72.2% to 65.4%. The developed approach will be implemented as a part of the data assimilation component of the operational Environment and Climate Change Canada Regional Ice-Ocean Prediction System.

TI  - Hip Fracture in the Elderly Patients: A Sentinel Event
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HOSPICE & PALLIATIVE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Importance: Hip fracture in the elderly patients is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is great need for advance care planning should a patient fail to rehabilitate or experience an adverse event during or after recovery. This study was performed to evaluate for palliative care consultation and changes in code status and/or advance directives in elderly patients with hip fracture.Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 186 consecutive patients aged 65 years and older with a hip fracture due to a low-energy fall who underwent surgery at a large academic institution between August 1, 2013, and September 1, 2014. Risk factors assessed were patient demographics, home status, mobility, code status, comorbidities, medications, and hospitalizations prior to injury. Outcomes of interest included palliative care consultation, complications, mortality, and most recent code status, mobility, and home.Results: About 186 patients with hip fractures were included. Three patients died, and 12 (6.5%) sustained major complications during admission. Nearly one-third (51 patients) died upon final follow-up approximately 1.5 years after surgery. Of the patients who died, palliative care consulted on 6 (11.8%) during initial admission. Eleven (21.6%) were full code at death. Three patients underwent cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and 1 underwent massive transfusion and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation prior to changing their code status to do not attempt resuscitation.Conclusion: Hip fracture in elderly patients is an important opportunity to reassess the patient's personal health-care priorities. Advance directives, goals of care, and code status documentation should be updated in all elderly patients with hip fracture, should the patient's health decompensate.

TI  - Improved Hydrological Simulation Using SMAP Data: Relative Impacts of Model Calibration and Data Assimilation
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture information into a land surface model has been shown in past studies to contribute accuracy to the simulated hydrological variables. Remotely sensed data, however, can also be used to improve the model itself through the calibration of the model's parameters, and this can also increase the accuracy of model products. Here, data provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission are applied to the land surface component of the NASA GEOS Earth system model using both data assimilation and model calibration in order to quantify the relative degrees to which each strategy improves the estimation of near-surface soil moisture and streamflow. The two approaches show significant complementarity in their ability to extract useful information from the SMAP data record. Data assimilation reduces the ubRMSE (the RMSE after removing the long-term bias) of soil moisture estimates and improves the timing of streamflow variations, whereas model calibration reduces the model biases in both soil moisture and streamflow. While both approaches lead to an improved timing of simulated soil moisture, these contributions are largely independent; joint use of both approaches provides the highest soil moisture simulation accuracy.

TI  - Impact of Anthropogenic Pressures on the Flora of the Haut-Sassandra Classified Forest (Central-West of Cote d'lvoire)
T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - The classified forest of Haut-Sassandra located in the center-west of Ivory Coast is subjected to a strong anthropization since the politico-military conflicts of the year 2002. This study aims to quantify the degradation in the northern, central and southern zones of this domain. To achieve this, a spatiotemporal analysis of the dynamics of the three zones was made based on five Landsat images from 1990, 1997, 2002, 2006 and 2013. It was supplemented by a floristic inventory of each zone. The results show that forest cover conversions of the three zones occurred during the conflict period with regression rates of more than 50 %. At the floristic level, 622 plant species distributed among 410 genera and 104 families were recorded in all three zones. The North and the Center differ significantly from the South by the average specific richness. The inventoried flora generally differs from one zone to another depending on the degradation factors, with a greater diversity in cocoa plantations. However, this flora, although diversified, does not have any similarity with that of the forest relics still present in the classified forest of Haut-Sassandra.

TI  - Cocoa Expansion Dynamics in the Forest-Savanna Contact Zones: Case Study of the Sub-prefecture of Kokumbo (Centre Cote d'lvoire)
T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - In Cote d'lvoire, forests-savannah transition areas have been considered from the 1970s as unfavorable to cocoa cultivation. In recent years, however, there has been a comeback to the cocoa economy in these areas. This study carried out in the sub-prefecture of Kokumbo, aimed to map and to follows the spatial and temporal evolution of this crop using Landsat images of 1990, 2002 and 2016. In order to better understand the fundamentals of the peasant practices, surveys were carried out in different villages in the area. Treatment shows that the influence of cocoa culture is becoming increasingly important in the region. This cocoa crop is set up to the detriment of forests and savannahs, which have lost 25% and 58.1% of their initial area respectively. The surveys identified four types of cocoa farms, of which 65% of the plots were created between 2002 and 2014. Facing this relatively recent expansion, the issue of the sustainability of cocoa production systems in this region arises. Their agronomic and economic performances and their value for biodiversity conservation should be analyzed in future studies.

TI  - Comparing SAR-Based Short Time-Lag Cross Correlation and Doppler-Derived Sea Ice Drift Velocities
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper shows initial results from estimating Doppler radial surface velocities (RVLs) over Arctic sea ice using the Sentinel-1A (S1A) satellite. Our study presents the first quantitative comparison between ice drift derived from the Doppler shifts and drift derived using time-series methods over comparable time scales. We compare the Doppler-derived ice velocities with global positioning system tracks from a drifting ice station as well as vector fields derived using traditional cross correlation between a pair of S1A and Radarsat-2 images with a time lag of only 25 min. A strategy is provided for precise calibration of the Doppler values in the context of the S1A level-2 ocean RVL product. When comparing the two methods, root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 7 cm/s were found for the extra wide (EW4) and EW5 swaths, while the highest RMSE of 32 cm/s was obtained for the EW1 swath. Though the agreement is not perfect, our experiment demonstrates that the Doppler technique is capable of measuring a signal from the ice if the ice is fast moving. However, for typical ice speeds, the uncertainties quickly grow beyond the speeds we are trying to measure. Finally, we show how the application of an antenna pattern correction reduces a bias in the estimated Doppler offsets.

TI  - Parametric analysis of lava dome-collapse events and pyroclastic deposits at Shiveluch volcano, Kamchatka, using visible and infrared satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - For the years 2001 to 2013 of the ongoing eruption of Shiveluch volcano, a combination of different satellite remote sensing data are used to investigate the dome-collapse events and the resulting pyroclastic deposits. Shiveluch volcano in Kamchatka, Russia, is one of the world's most active dome-building volcanoes, which has produced some of the largest known historical block-and-ash flows (BAFs). Globally, quantitative data for deposits resulting from such large and long-lived dome-forming eruptions, especially like those at Shiveluch, are scarce. We use Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and visible-near infrared (VNIR) data to analyze the dome-collapse scars and BAF deposits that were formed during eruptions and collapse events in 2001, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2010, and two events in 2013. These events produced flows with runout distances of as far as 19 km from the dome, and with aerial extents of as much as 22.3 km(2). Over the 12 years of this period of investigation, there is no trend in deposit area or runout distances of the flows through time. However, two potentially predictive features are apparent in our data set: 1) the largest dome-collapse events occurred when the dome exceeded a relative height (from dome base to top) of 500 m; 2) collapses were preceded by thermal anomalies in six of the cases in which ASTER data were available, although the areal extent of these precursory thermal areas did not generally match the size of the collapse events as indicated by scar area (volumes are available for three collapse events). Linking the deposit distribution to the area, location, and temperature profiles of the dome-collapse scars provides a basis for determining similar future hazards at Shiveluch and at other dome-forming volcanoes. Because of these factors, we suggest that volcanic hazard analysis and mitigation at volcanoes with similar BAF emplacement behavior may be improved with detailed, synoptic studies, especially when it is possible to access and interpret appropriate remote sensing data in near-real time.

TI  - Seasonal radiogenic isotopic variability of the African dust outflow to the tropical Atlantic Ocean and across to the Caribbean
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assess the impact of mineral dust on climate and biogeochemistry, it is paramount to identify the sources of dust emission. In this regard, radiogenic isotopes have recently been used successfully for tracing North African dust provenance and its transport across the tropical Atlantic to the Caribbean. Here we present two time series of radiogenic isotopes (Pb, Sr and Nd) in dusts collected at the Cape Verde Islands and Barbados in order to determine the origin of the dust and examine the seasonality of westerly dust outflow from Northern Africa. Aerosol samples were collected daily during two campaigns - February 2012 (winter) and June-July 2013 (summer) - at the Cape Verde Atmospheric Observatory (CVAO) on the island of Sao Vicente (16.9 degrees N, 24.9 degrees W). A one-year-long time series of aerosols from Barbados (13.16 degrees N, 59.43 degrees W) - a receptor region in the Caribbean - was sampled at a lower, monthly resolution.Our results resolve a seasonal isotopic signal at Cape Verde shown by daily variations, with a larger radiogenic isotope variability in winter compared to that in summer. This summer signature is also observed over Barbados, indicating similar dust provenance at both locations, despite different sampling years. This constrains the isotope fingerprint of Saharan Air Layer (SAL) dust that is well-mixed during its transport. This result provides unequivocal evidence for a permanent, albeit of variable strength, longrange transport of African dust to the Caribbean and is in full agreement with atmospheric models of North African dust emission and transport across the tropical Atlantic in the SAL.The seasonal isotopic variability is related to changes in the dust source areas - mainly the Sahara and Sahel regions - that are active all-year-round, albeit with variable contributions in summer versus the winter months. Our results provide little support for much dust contributed from the Bodele Depression in Chad - the "dustiest" place on Earth - reaching Cape Verde and Barbados during the summer, while contributions during the winter months are likely patchy and minor at most.Importantly, a short-term isotopic excursion is resolved in the Cape Verde winter record during a dust outbreak on 06-08 February 2012. This features a highly radiogenic Pb and Sr and unradiogenic Nd signature, marking a clear shift in dust provenance relative to that of normal days. As the dust storm waned, continuous gradual changes are observed, reflecting mixing and progressive dilution with dust typical of normal days. These inferences from radiogenic isotope tracers are corroborated by both satellite images (CALIPSO and MODIS) and back-trajectory analyses. The radiogenic isotope fingerprinting of these presently-active North African dust sources, and especially the Saharan Air Layer, will prove invaluable in studies of past dust emission from Northern Africa, where imagery and back trajectory analysis are unavailable.

TI  - Investigation of impacts of land use/land cover change on water availability of Tons River Basin, Madhya Pradesh, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Both natural erosional dynamics and anthropogenic changes have intense effects on the land use/land cover (LULC) of the global earth. These LULC changes have a substantial impact on soil and water. This study focus on impacts of LULC changes on hydrological processes governing the Tons River Basin (TRB). Landsat satellite images based on seven land use classes which were defined for this basin are forest deciduous (FRSD), forest mixed (FRST), mixed crop (RWSW), barren land (BARN), hay (HAY), residential (URBN) and water body (WATR). The LULC (1985-2035) result showed an increase in URBN from 0.29 to 2.81% while the rate of change (RoC) for URBN was calculated to be 8.71%. A continuous reduction was seen in FRSD from 15.57 to 9.77% giving the RoC as - 0.37%. The FRST increased at the RoC of 1.95% from 0.6 to 1.77% while the mixed crop (RWSW) increased from 72.68 to 78.27% at the RoC of 0.77%. The other LULC classes showed similar results. The hydrologic impacts were analyzed by running SWAT for the LULC changes in order to predict the corresponding changes in the hydrologic process. In this consequence SWAT was run for five decades from 1985 to 1995, 1995-2005, 2005-2015 (before baseline scenario) and 2015-2025, 2025-2035 (after baseline scenario) assuming 2015 as a baseline scenario. Evaluation of the impact of LULC changes revealed that there was decrease in surface runoff, from 62.29 to 62.14% and lateral flow from 2.39 to 0.261% for the period of 2015 to 2035. The groundwater flow showed a slight increment from 37.42 to 37.62% while the total water yield increased from 774.74 to 776.74 mm. The simulated results for TRB showed that the hydrological processes in the watershed were minimally influenced by LULC changes. It was concluded that the basin's LULC change was not pronounced and was minimally affected by natural and artificial changes. The hydrological changes were not correlated with LULC changes. It is recommended that in order to manage the water resources and to properly develop the entire catchment, a rational regulation policy for land use patterns is vitally important in order to assist stakeholders and policy makers.

TI  - Projecting Climate and Land Use Change Impacts on Actual Evapotranspiration for the Narmada River Basin in Central India in the Future
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of actual evapotranspiration (ET) is essential as it controls the exchange of water and heat energy between the atmosphere and land surface. ET also influences the available water resources and assists in the crop water assessment in agricultural areas. This study involves the assessment of spatial distribution of seasonal and annual ET using Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and provides an estimation of future changes in ET due to land use and climate change for a portion of the Narmada river basin in Central India. Climate change effects on future ET are assessed using the ACCESS1-0 model of CMIP5. A Markov Chain model estimated future land use based on the probability of changes in the past. The ET analysis is carried out for the years 2009-2011. The results indicate variation in the seasonal ET with the changed land use. High ET is observed over forest areas and crop lands, but ET decreases over crop lands after harvest. The overall annual ET is high over water bodies and forest areas. ET is high in the premonsoon season over the water bodies and decreases in the winter. Future ET in the 2020s, 2030s, 2040s, and 2050s is shown with respect to land use and climate changes that project a gradual decrease due to the constant removal of the forest areas. The lowest ET is projected in 2050. Individual impact of land use change projects decreases in ET from 1990 to 2050, while climate change effect projects increases in ET in the future due to rises in temperature. However, the combined impacts of land use and climate changes indicate a decrease in ET in the future.

TI  - Geoinformational Mapping of Landscapes in the Northwestern Part of Western Siberia Using the Hansen Mosaic Dataset
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND NATURAL RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Presented are the technique and results of studying the landscape structure of the north-west of Western Siberia on the basis of the Hansen mosaic dataset consisting of elements covering the entire territory of the Earth. To study this area used a synthesis of classical methods of thematic system mapping as described in the doctrine of geosystems of V. B. Sochava, and automated interpretation of remote sensing data and mapping using GIS technologies. The method of geoinformational mapping of the landscape structure with the use of MultiSpec and Quantum GIS software programs for the purpose of drawing up real-time raster landscape maps is shown. In drawing up the map and the legend, the principle of geomic system-hierarchical representation of the territory as a complex multi-level "bottom-up" structure from topological-level geosystems (groups and classes of landscape facies) to regional-level geosystems (geoms, groups and classes of geoms) was used. Compilation of operational raster landscape maps of the north-west of Western Siberia involved multilevel automated interpretation of the Hansen mosaic dataset and mapping of areas (clusters) on images with different brightness characteristics, with the landscape structure of key areas and stationary physical and geographical profiles. A characteristic of this approach also implies using a dynamic classification of geosystems based on the study of their variable states. Such an approach permits a monitoring of changes in landscape structure and its areas and the intensity of anthropogenic impacts on forest and marsh landscapes, and determination of permissible pressure on geosystems in areas with high technogenic pressure of the oil and gas complex represented by the north-west of Siberia. An automated processing of data based on a supervised classification of territorial objects allows for the elimination of inaccuracies arising in visual image interpretation. Raster landscape maps can be used both for a further generation of vector maps and as a real-time information base for purposes of environmental management and protection.

TI  - A Hybrid Color Mapping Approach to Fusing MODIS and Landsat Images for Forward Prediction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a simple, and efficient approach to fusing MODIS and Landsat images. It is well known that MODIS images have high temporal resolution and low spatial resolution, whereas Landsat images are just the opposite. Similar to earlier approaches, our goal is to fuse MODIS and Landsat images to yield high spatial and high temporal resolution images. Our approach consists of two steps. First, a mapping is established between two MODIS images, where one is at an earlier time, t1, and the other one is at the time of prediction, tp. Second, this mapping is applied to map a known Landsat image at ti to generate a predicted Landsat image at tp. Similar to the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), SpatioTemporal Image-Fusion Model (STI-FM), and the Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF) approaches, only one pair of MODIS and Landsat images is needed for prediction. Using seven performance metrics, experiments involving actual Landsat and MODIS images demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves comparable or better fusion performance than that of STARFM, STI-FM, and FSDAF.

TI  - Assessment of Spatiotemporal Fusion Algorithms for Planet and Worldview Images
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Worldview-2 (WV) images (non-pansharpened) have 2-m resolution, the re-visit times for the same areas may be seven days or more. In contrast, Planet images are collected using small satellites that can cover the whole Earth almost daily. However, the resolution of Planet images is 3.125 m. It would be ideal to fuse these two satellites images to generate high spatial resolution (2 m) and high temporal resolution (1 or 2 days) images for applications such as damage assessment, border monitoring, etc. that require quick decisions. In this paper, we evaluate three approaches to fusing Worldview (WV) and Planet images. These approaches are known as Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal Data Fusion (FSDAF), and Hybrid Color Mapping (HCM), which have been applied to the fusion of MODIS and Landsat images in recent years. Experimental results using actual Planet and Worldview images demonstrated that the three aforementioned approaches have comparable performance and can all generate high quality prediction images.

TI  - Towards Operational Monitoring of Forest Canopy Disturbance in Evergreen Rain Forests: A Test Case in Continental Southeast Asia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an approach to forest canopy disturbance monitoring in evergreen forests in continental Southeast Asia, based on temporal differences of a modified normalized burn ratio (NBR) vegetation index. We generate NBR values from each available Landsat 8 scene of a given period. A step of ' self-referencing' normalizes the NBR values, largely eliminating illumination/topography effects, thus maximizing inter-comparability. We then create yearly composites of these self-referenced NBR (rNBR) values, selecting per pixel the maximum rNBR value over each observation period, which reflects the most open canopy cover condition of that pixel. The ArNBR is generated as the difference between the composites of two reference periods. The methodology produces seamless and consistent maps, highlighting patterns of canopy disturbances (e. g., encroachment, selective logging), and keeping artifacts at minimum level. The monitoring approach was validated within four test sites with an overall accuracy of almost 78% using very high resolution satellite reference imagery. The methodology was implemented in a Google Earth Engine (GEE) script requiring no user interaction. A threshold is applied to the final output dataset in order to separate signal from noise. The approach, capable of detecting sub-pixel disturbance events as small as 0.005 ha, is transparent and reproducible, and can help to increase the credibility of monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), as required in the context of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+).

TI  - Successful Placement of Nasointestinal Feeding Tubes Using an Electromagnetic Sensor-Guided Enteral Access System in Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Devices
T2  - NUTRITION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Technology advances have made it possible to prolong life for patients with heart failure who are not transplant candidates or while awaiting transplant. Many different cardiac devices are available that can be used as a bridge to transplant (temporary support) or as a destination therapy (permanent support). Placement of these devices can cause complications that, if not addressed, could negatively impact the nutrition status of patients. Placement of nasointestinal feeding tubes using an electromagnetic sensor-guided enteral access system (EMS-EAS) has been difficult in patients with implantable devices because of the potential for interference with the EMS-EAS and the left ventricular assist device (LVAD). The purpose of this paper was to report the results using a modified method to place nasointestinal tubes in patients with LVADs by elevating the receiver off the xiphoid process. There were 42 feeding tube placements in 25 patients. Results showed a 69% success rate of placement into the small bowel, 13 unsuccessful placements, and no adverse or sentinel events associated with tube placement using this method. Results indicated the modified method is a safe approach to help expedite feeding tube placement in a nutritionally compromised patient. The success rate is comparable with non-LVAD patient populations requiring nasointestinal tube placement via EMS-EAS. To our knowledge, this is the first published case series addressing a modified method for nasointestinal tube placement in patients with LVAD. More research is needed to determine ideal separation distances or other techniques to improve the success rate in this patient population.

TI  - Cosmic Evolutionary Philosophy and a Dialectical Approach to Technological Singularity
T2  - INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The anticipated next stage of human organization is often described by futurists as a global technological singularity. This next stage of complex organization is hypothesized to be actualized by scientific-technic knowledge networks. However, the general consequences of this process for the meaning of human existence are unknown. Here, it is argued that cosmic evolutionary philosophy is a useful worldview for grounding an understanding of the potential nature of this futures event. In the cosmic evolutionary philosophy, reality is conceptualized locally as a universal dynamic of emergent evolving relations. This universal dynamic is structured by a singular astrophysical origin and an organizational progress from sub-atomic particles to global civilization mediated by qualitative phase transitions. From this theoretical ground, we attempt to understand the next stage of universal dynamics in terms of the motion of general ideation attempting to actualize higher unity. In this way, we approach technological singularity dialectically as an event caused by ideational transformations and mediated by an emergent intersubjective objectivity. From these speculations, a historically-engaged perspective on the nature of human consciousness is articulated where the truth of reality as an emergent unity depends on the collective action of a multiplicity of human observers.

TI  - A real-time PCR tool for the surveillance of zoonotic<i> Onchocerca lupi</i> in dogs, cats and potential vectors
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ocular onchocercosis is caused by the zoonotic parasite Onchocerca lupi (Spirurida: Onchocercidae). A major hindrance to scientific progress is the absence of a reliable diagnostic test in affected individuals. Microscopic examination of skin snip sediments and the identification of adults embedded in ocular nodules are seldom performed and labour-intensive. A quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay was herein standardized for the detection of O. lupi DNA and the results compared with microscopic examination and conventional PCR (cPCR). The specificity of qPCR and cPCR was assessed by processing the most common filarial nematodes infecting dogs, skin samples from O. lupi infected (n = 35 dogs) or uninfected animals (n = 21 dogs; n = 152 cats) and specimens of potential insect vector (n = 93 blackflies; n = 59 mosquitoes/midges). The analytical sensitivity of both assays was assessed using 10-fold serial dilutions of DNA from adult specimen and from a pool of microfilariae. The qPCR on skin samples revealed an analytical specificity of 100% and a sensitivity up to 8 x 10(-1)fg/2 mu l O. lupiadult-DNA and up to 3.6 x 10(-1) pg/2 mu l of mfs-DNA (corresponding to 1 x 10(-2) mfs/2 mu l). Only 9.5% O. lupi-infected skin samples were positive for cPCR with a sensitivity of 8 x 10(-1)pg/2 mu l of DNA. Out of 152 blackflies and mosquitoes/midges, eight specimens experimentally infected (n = 1 S. erythrocephalum; n = 1 S. omatum; n = 6 Simulium sp.) were positive by qPCR. The qPCR assay herein standardized represents an important step forward in the diagnosis of zoonotic onchocercosis caused by O. lupi, especially for the detection and quantification of low number of mfs. This assay provides a fundamental contribution for the establishment of surveillance strategies aiming at assessing the presence of O. lupi in carnivores and in insect species acting as potential intermediate hosts. The O. lupi qPCR assay will enable disease progress monitoring as well as the diagnosis of apparently clinical healthy dogs and cats.

TI  - Early mapping of industrial tomato in Central and Southern Italy with Sentinel 2, aerial and RapidEye additional data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely crop information, i.e. well before harvesting time and at first stages of crop development, can benefit farmers and producer organizations. The current case study documents the procedure to deliver early data on planted tomato to users, showing the potential of Sentinel 2 (S2) to map tomato at the very beginning of the crop season, which is a challenging task. Using satellite data, integrated with ground and aerial data, an initial estimate of area planted with tomato and early tomato maps were generated in seven main production areas in Italy. Estimates of the amount of area planted with tomato provided similar results either when derived from field surveys or from remote-sensing-based classification. Tomato early maps showed a producer accuracy >80% in seven cases out of nine, and a user accuracy >80% in five cases out of nine, with differences attributed to the varying agricultural characteristics and environmental heterogeneity of the study areas. The additional use of aerial data improved producer accuracy moderately. The ability to identify abrupt growth changes, such as those caused by natural hazards, was also analysed: S2 detected significant changes in tomato growth between a hailstorm-affected area and a control area. The study suggests that S2, with enhanced spectral capabilities and open data policy, represents very valuable data, allowing crop monitoring at an early development stage.

TI  - Detecting Phenology Using MODIS Vegetation Indices and Forest Type Map in South Korea
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the continuous development of phenology detection studies using satellite imagery, verification through comparison with the field observed data is insufficient. Especially, in the case of Korean forests patching in various forms, it is difficult to estimate the start of season (SOS) by using only satellite images due to resolution difference. To improve the accuracy of vegetation phenology estimation, this study reconstructed the large scaled forest type map (1: 5,000) with MODIS pixel resolution and produced time series vegetation phenology curves from Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODIS images. Based on the field observed data, extraction methods for the vegetation indices and SOS for Korean forests were compared and evaluated. We also analyzed the correlation between the composition ratio of forest types in each pixel and phenology extraction from the vegetation indices. When we compared NDVI and EVI with the field observed SOS data from the Korea National Arboretum, EVI was more accurate for Korean forests, and the first derivative was most suitable for extracting SOS in the phenology curve from the vegetation index. When the eight pixels neighboring the pixels of 7 broadleaved trees with field SOS data (center pixel) were compared to field SOS, the forest types of the best pixels with the highest correlation with the field data were deciduous forest by 67.9%, coniferous forest by 14.3%, and mixed forest by 7.7%, and the mean coefficient of determination (R-2) was 0.64. The average national SOS extracted from MODIS EVI were DOY 112.9 in 2014 at the earliest and DOY 129.1 in 2010 at the latest, which is about 0.16 days faster since 2003. In future research, it is necessary to expand the analysis of deciduous and mixed forests' SOS into the extraction of coniferous forest's SOS in order to understand the various climate and geomorphic factors. As such, comprehensive study should be carried out considering the diversity of forest ecosystems in Korea.

TI  - Multitemporal assessment of coarse sediment connectivity along a braided-wandering river
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents the postflood period coarse sediment connectivity (CSC) assessment approach on the basis of the holistic ideas of the interpretation of the long-term CSC in river channels. Seven sets of remote sensing data (1949-2009) were used as the basic information sources to study the CSC along the braided-wandering Bela River by using the patch-graph approach for assessing the structural connectivity. The bar areas (patches), with 200m direct links between them, and the attribute of a deflection angle of a link to the flow direction were parameters used to estimate the integral index of connectivity (IIC) and bar area and bar link importance indices. The higher values of the IIC fit with a well-developed bar system. Conversely, the values of the IIC decrease because of the progressive degradation of the braided pattern. The potential functional CSC was inferred from the variability of the values obtained by the balance indices representing the balance of the channel-floodplain connectivity (B1) and the bar-bar connectivity (B2). Eight types of the potential functional CSC based on the balance indices and the deduction of processes that conditioned the channel-floodplain and in-channel CSC linkages were identified. In order to assess the development of the braidplain pattern in terms of the structural connectivity during the study time span, the linear trendline analysis of IIC associated with flood periods was applied. On the basis of the coefficient of determination, all reaches exhibit a decreasing trend in IIC values but different response to flood periods.

TI  - Detection of Forest Disturbance With Spaceborne Repeat-Pass SAR Interferometry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Focusing on open forests and woodlands within the Injune Landscape Collaborative Project research area in central southeast Queensland, Australia, and using dual-pol (HH and HV) ALOS PALSAR repeat-pass InSAR data (temporal baseline of 92 days), this paper explores the detection of forest disturbance from the spaceborne repeat-pass InSAR correlation magnitude by developing a simple and efficient forest disturbance detection approach. In particular, a generic physical InSAR scattering model is derived by accounting for the forest disturbance information as well as the normal temporal decorrelation effects that are later compensated for using the modified Random Volume over Ground model. Based on the generic model, a quantitative indicator of forest disturbance is retrieved, namely, disturbance index that varies from 0 (no disturbance) to 1 (complete deforestation). This index is compared with that identified using a time series of Landsat sensor data over a selective logging area and has a relative root mean square error of 13% at a spatial resolution of 0.8 ha. This paper highlights the use of the co-pol InSAR correlation magnitude for forest disturbance detection, which serves as a complimentary application to using the cross-pol counterpart for forest height inversion in a companion work. Given the global availability of this type of data (e.g., Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency's ALOS-1/2 and NASA-ISRO's NISAR), the method is anticipated to contribute to the range of tools being developed for large-scale forest disturbance assessment and monitoring.

TI  - Vegetation monitoring in refugee-hosting areas in South Sudan
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass population displacements put additional stress on the ecosystems and often lead to conflicts with the host communities, especially in the case of large refugee or Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camps. Therefore, there is need for the assessment of environmental impacts and, based on this, the sustainable management of natural resources between host and refugee communities. We propose a method based on high (Landsat 5,7 and 8) and very high (WorldView-2) resolution Earth Observation data to establish forest inventories combining the analysis of remote sensing satellite data along with ground-based observations in South Sudan. The resulting forest inventory mapping comprises map products on vegetation cover, tree species, and vegetation changes. We distinguished between the vegetation types grassland, shrub/tree savanna, savanna woodland, and woodland. For savanna woodland and woodland, we furthermore applied a tree species classification, differentiating between Red acacia, Desert date tree, Silak, and Doum palm. The tree species classification yielded in mean accuracies of about 61.0% for both the Landsat and WorldView based classifications, with the best results achieved for Desert palm tree and red acacia with average accuracies of 88% and 53%, respectively. The product about vegetation changes indicates a decrease of vegetation up to 50% within and in the surroundings of the refugee camps/settlement. The resulting maps can serve to estimate accessible wood resources and to identify potential harvest areas. In addition, they can support the definition of a sustainable use of wood for construction and cooking purposes for the refugee and host communities based on a community forest management.

TI  - The Evaluation of SMAP Enhanced Soil Moisture Products Using High-Resolution Model Simulations and In-Situ Observations on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission was designed to provide a global mapping of soil moisture (SM) measured by L-band passive and active microwave sensors. In this study, we evaluate the newly released SMAP enhanced SM products over the Tibetan Plateau by performing comparisons among SMAP standard products, in-situ observations and Community Land Model (CLM) simulations driven by high-resolution meteorological forcing. At local scales, the enhanced SMAP products, the standard products and CLM simulations all generally compare well with the in-situ observations. The SMAP products show stronger correlations (0.64-0.88) but slightly larger unbiased root mean square errors (ubRMSE, -0.06) relative to the CLM simulations (0.58-0.79 and 0.037-0.047, for correlation and ubRMSE, respectively). At the regional scale, both SMAP products show similar spatial distributions of SM on the TP (Tibetan Plateau), although, as expected, the enhanced product provides more fine details. The SMAP enhanced product is in good agreement with model simulations with respect to temporal and spatial variations in SM over most of the TP. Regions with low correlation between SMAP enhanced products and model simulations are mainly located in the northwestern TP and regions of complex topography, where meteorological stations are sparse and non-existent or elevation is highly variable. In such remote regions, CLM simulations may be problematic due to inaccurate land cover maps and/or uncertainties in meteorological forcing. The independent, high-resolution observations provided by SMAP could help to constrain the model simulation and, ultimately, improve the skill of models in these problematic regions.

TI  - Improvement of Two Evapotranspiration Estimation Models Using a Linear Spectral Mixture Model over a Small Agricultural Watershed
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately measuring regional evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance for studying global climate change, regional hydrological cycles, and surface energy balance. However, estimating regional ET from mixed vegetation types is still challenging. In this study, the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) models were applied to estimate surface ET in a small agricultural watershed. Landsat8 satellite images were used as input data to the single-source models. The two models were validated at single point and ecosystem scales. The results showed that both models overestimated ET observations in paddy fields and orange groves but underestimated them in dry farmland. The error was mainly caused by the heterogeneity of the mixed pixels. The linear spectral mixture model and a set of equations were introduced to reduce the simulation error. The revised results showed that the relative precision of SEBAL was improved by 9.87% and 10.06%, respectively. This research is expected to provide new ideas for future development of accurate remote-sensing ET estimations on heterogeneous surfaces.

TI  - Isolation and Identification of <i>Rickettsia raoultii</i> in Human Cases: A Surveillance Study in 3 Medical Centers in China
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Rickettsia raoultii is frequently detected in multiple tick species, whereas human infection remains scarcely studied.Methods. A surveillance study was performed at 3 sentinel hospitals in China, to recruit participants with suspected tick exposure. Rickettsia raoultii infection was identified through polymerase chain reaction, followed by sequencing, and confirmed serologically. Isolation by cell culture was performed and the isolates were genome sequenced.Results. Twenty-six subjects were determined to have R. raoultii infection, including 7 with asymptomatic infection, 15 with mild to moderate illness, and 4 with severe illness. Common nonspecific manifestations in the 19 patients with mild to moderate or severe illness included fever (100%), malaise (95%), myalgia (58%), lymphadenopathy (53%), and nausea (42%). Only 5% of them had rash, and 16% had eschar. Scalp eschar and neck lymphadenopathy after a tick bite syndrome was only seen in 2 patients. Of the 4 patients with severe complications, 3 developed pulmonary edema, and 1 developed clouding of consciousness and lethargy. Frequent abnormalities of laboratory testing included leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, hypoproteinemia, and elevated levels of total bilirubin, hepatic aminotransferases, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. All the 19 patients recovered without sequelae after receiving doxycycline treatment. Two R. raoultii strains were isolated, and a significantly less degraded genome was observed than other more virulent Rickettsia strains, indicating a low pathogenicity of the current strain.Conclusions. Human infection with R. raoultii has a wide clinical spectrum that ranged from subclinical infection to severe complications. Physicians need to be aware of the high potential and clinical complexity of R. raoultii infection, to ensure appropriate testing and treatment in endemic regions.

TI  - Retrieval of Winter Wheat Leaf Area Index from Chinese GF-1 Satellite Data Using the PROSAIL Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the key biophysical parameters in crop structure. The accurate quantitative estimation of crop LAI is essential to verify crop growth and health. The PROSAIL radiative transfer model (RTM) is one of the most established methods for estimating crop LAI. In this study, a look-up table (LUT) based on the PROSAIL RTM was first used to estimate winter wheat LAI from GF-1 data, which accounted for some available prior knowledge relating to the distribution of winter wheat characteristics. Next, the effects of 15 LAI-LUT strategies with reflectance bands and 10 LAI-LUT strategies with vegetation indexes on the accuracy of the winter wheat LAI retrieval with different phenological stages were evaluated against in situ LAI measurements. The results showed that the LUT strategies of LAI-GNDVI were optimal and had the highest accuracy with a root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 0.34, and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.61 during the elongation stages, and the LUT strategies of LAI-Green were optimal with a RMSE of 0.74, and R-2 of 0.20 during the grain-filling stages. The results demonstrated that the PROSAIL RTM had great potential in winter wheat LAI inversion with GF-1 satellite data and the performance could be improved by selecting the appropriate LUT inversion strategies in different growth periods.

TI  - Deriving a time series of 3D glacier motion to investigate interactions of a large mountain glacial system with its glacial lake: Use of Synthetic Aperture Radar Pixel Offset-Small Baseline Subset technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the interactions of Lake Merzbacher with the Southern Inylchek Glacier (Central Tien Shan) using the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Pixel Offset-Small Baseline Subset (PO-SBAS) to derive a time series of three-dimensional (3D) glacier motion. The measurements of 3D glacier velocity were similar to 17% more precise than a previous study that did not use the SBAS estimation. The velocities of the glacier were up to 58 cm/day east, 70 cm/day north, and 113 cm/day vertically. Combining these data with Landsat images indicated that movement of the glacier is sensitive to changes of Lake Merzbacher. Specifically, the entry of more lake water into the glacier during the ablation season increased englacial ablation due to thermal erosion. Moreover, ice calving begins when the lake water gradually lifts the ice dam. Calving can cause greater loss of glacier mass than normal ablation. Trying to replenish the front mass loss, the distributary accelerates and the mass loss further intensifies. A time series of the vertical velocity indicates that the glacier tongue has a huge englacial cavity. We suggest that the lake outburst is directly related to the crack of this cavity. Bursting of the lake triggers a mini-surge at the glacier tongue. The vertical velocity at the ice dam was similar to+60 cm/day before the lake outburst, and similar to-113 cm/day afterwards. After drainage of the lake, flow velocities at the distributary, do not sharply decrease because pre-drainage mass loss needs to be replenished by fast flow. Based on comparisons with previous measurements, our results indicate that the lake had an increasing influence on the glacier from 2005 to 2009. This study demonstrates that a time series of 3D glacier motion based on the PO-SBAS technique is effective for assessing the dynamics of a mountain glacial system and interactions with its glacial lake.

TI  - Computation of domain-average radiative flux profiles using Gaussian quadrature
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - A method for calculating domain-average radiative flux profiles, called Gaussian Quadrature Independent Column Approximation (GQ-ICA), is introduced and assessed using cloud properties retrieved from A-Train satellite data. This method could be suitable for use in large-scale atmospheric models. Like the Monte Carlo ICA (McICA), GQ-ICA uses N stochastically generated subgrid-scale cloudy columns. The independent variable is the sorted, from smallest to largest, sequence of N sub-column values of liquid and ice cloud water paths. The integrand is essentially the radiative transfer equation. Accurate GQ integration requires integrands to be relatively smooth functions. Unlike McICA, GQ-ICA performs full solar and infrared spectral integrations on n(G) < < N sub-columns which are identified by rules governing n(G)-node GQ. The n(G) flux profiles are appropriately weighted and summed to give domain averages. Several sorting procedures were considered, and all results are based on the CCCma radiation algorithm. For solar radiation, 1-node GQ-ICA can produce significant bias errors, but its random errors are generally less than McICA's. These biases, however, are almost eliminated by 2-node GQ-ICA. For GQ-ICA to better McICA's random errors for infrared fluxes, at least the 2-node version is needed. Ultimately, 2-node GQ-ICA random errors for net fluxes at surface and top-of-atmosphere are typically 30-50% of McICA's. This is partly because solar and infrared solvers operate on the same sub-columns. GQ-ICA random errors for atmospheric heating rates are comparable to McICA's even for 3-node GQ-ICA. Computational times required for the 2- and 3-node GQ-ICA are, respectively, similar to 180 and similar to 230% of McICA's.

TI  - Building damage assessment from PolSAR data using texture parameters of statistical model
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate building damage assessment is essential in providing decision support for disaster relief and reconstruction. Polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) has become one of the most effective means of building damage assessment, due to its all-day/all-weather ability and richer backscatter information of targets. However, intact buildings that are not parallel to the SAR flight pass (termed oriented buildings) and collapsed buildings share similar scattering mechanisms, both of which are dominated by volume scattering. This characteristic always leads to misjudgments between assessments of collapsed buildings and oriented buildings from PolSAR data. Because the collapsed buildings and the intact buildings (whether oriented or parallel buildings) have different textures, a novel building damage assessment method is proposed in this study to address this problem by introducing texture parameters of statistical models. First, the logarithms of the estimated texture parameters of different statistical models are taken as a new texture feature to describe the collapse of the buildings. Second, the collapsed buildings and intact buildings are distinguished using an appropriate threshold. Then, the building blocks are classified into three levels based on the building block collapse rate. Moreover, this paper also discusses the capability for performing damage assessment using texture parameters from different statistical models or using different estimators. The RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-1 PolSAR images are used to present and analyze the performance of the proposed method. The results show that using the texture parameters avoids the problem of confusing collapsed and oriented buildings and improves the assessment accuracy. The results assessed by using the K/G(0) distribution texture parameters estimated based on the second moment obtain the highest extraction accuracies. For the RADARSAT-2 and ALOS-1 data, the overall accuracy (OA) for these three types of buildings is 73.39% and 68.45%, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring the dynamics of surface water fraction from MODIS time series in a Mediterranean environment
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed spatial information of changes in surface water extent is needed for water management and biodiversity conservation, particularly in drier parts of the globe where small, temporally-variant wetlands prevail. Although global surface water histories are now generated from 30 m Landsat data, for many locations they contain large temporal gaps particularly for longer periods ( > 10 years) due to revisit intervals and cloud cover. Daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) imagery has potential to fill such gaps, but its relatively coarse spatial resolution may not detect small water bodies, which can be of great ecological importance. To address this problem, this study proposes and tests options for estimating the surface water fraction from MODIS 16-day 500 m Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) corrected surface reflectance image composites. The spatial extent of two Landsat tiles over Spain were selected as test areas. We obtained a 500 m reference dataset on surface water fraction by spatially aggregating 30 m binary water masks obtained from the Landsat-derived C-version of Function of Mask (CFmask), which themselves were evaluated against high-resolution Goggle Earth imagery. Twelve regression tree models were developed with two approaches, Random Forest and Cubist, using spectral metrics derived from MODIS data and topographic parameters generated from a 30 m spatial resolution digital elevation model. Results showed that accuracies were higher when we included annual summary statistics of the spectral metrics as predictor variables. Models trained on a single Landsat tile were ineffective in mapping surface water in the other tile, but global models trained with environmental conditions from both tiles can provide accurate results for both study areas. We achieved the highest accuracy with Cubist global model (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 11.05%, MAE = 7.67%). Our method was not only effective for mapping permanent water fraction, but also in accurately capturing temporal fluctuations of surface water. Based on this good performance, we produced surface water fraction maps at 16-day interval for the 2000-2015 MODIS archive. Our approach is promising for monitoring surface water fraction at high frequency time intervals over much larger regions provided that training data are collected across the spatial domain for which the model will be applied.

TI  - Linear array-based real-time photoacoustic imaging system with a compact coaxial excitation handheld probe for noninvasive sentinel lymph node mapping
T2  - BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a linear ultrasound array-based real-time photoacoustic imaging system with a compact coaxial excitation handheld photoacoustic imaging probe for guiding sentinel lymph node (SLN) needle biopsy. Compared with previous studies, our system and probe have the following advantages: (1) the imaging probe is quite compact and userfriendly; (2) laser illumination and ultrasonic detection are achieved coaxially, enabling high signal-to-noise ratio; and (3) GPU-based image reconstruction enables real-time imaging and displaying at a frame rate of 20 Hz. With the system and probe, clear visualization of the SLN at the depth of 2 cm (similar to human SLN depth) was demonstrated on a living rat. A fine needle was pushed towards the SLN based on the guidance of real-time photoacoustic imaging. The proposed photoacoustic imaging system and probe was shown to have great potential to be used in clinics for guiding SLN needle biopsy, which may reduce the high morbidity rate related to the current gold standard clinical SLN biopsy procedure.

TI  - Using Satellite Altimetry to Calibrate the Simulation of Typhoon Seth Storm Surge off Southeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite altimeters can capture storm surges generated by typhoons and tropical storms, if the satellite flies over at the right time. In this study, we show TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter-observed storm surge features off Southeast China on 10 October 1994 during Typhoon Seth. We then use a three-dimensional, barotropic, finite-volume community ocean model (FVCOM) to simulate storm surges. An innovative aspect is that satellite data are used to calibrate the storm surge model to improve model performance, by adjusting model wind forcing fields (the National Center for Environment Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis product) in reference to the typhoon best-track data. The calibration reduces the along-track root-mean-square (RMS) difference between model and altimetric data from 0.15 to 0.10 m. It also reduces the RMS temporal difference from 0.21 to 0.18 m between the model results and independent tide-gauge data at Xiamen. In particular, the calibrated model produces a peak storm surge of 1.01 m at 6: 00 10 October 1994 at Xiamen, agreeing with tide-gauge data; while the peak storm surge with the NCEP forcing is 0.71 m only. We further show that the interaction between storm surges and astronomical tides contributes to the peak storm surge by 34% and that the storm surge propagates southwestward as a coastally-trapped Kelvin wave.

TI  - Higher absorbed solar radiation partly offset the negative effects of water stress on the photosynthesis of Amazon forests during the 2015 drought
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazon forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle and Earth's climate. The vulnerability of Amazon forests to drought remains highly controversial. Here we examine the impacts of the 2015 drought on the photosynthesis of Amazon forests to understand how solar radiation and precipitation jointly control forest photosynthesis during the severe drought. We use a variety of gridded vegetation and climate datasets, including solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR), the fraction of absorbed PAR (APAR), leaf area index (LAI), precipitation, soil moisture, cloud cover, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) in our analysis. Satellite-derived SIF observations provide a direct diagnosis of plant photosynthesis from space. The decomposition of SIF to SIF yield (SIFyield) and APAR (the product of PAR and fPAR) reveals the relative effects of precipitation and solar radiation on photosynthesis. We found that the drought significantly reduced SIFyield, the emitted SIF per photon absorbed. The higher APAR resulting from lower cloud cover and higher LAI partly offset the negative effects of water stress on the photosynthesis of Amazon forests, leading to a smaller reduction in SIF than in SIFyield and precipitation. We further found that SIFyield anomalies were more sensitive to precipitation and VPD anomalies in the southern regions of the Amazon than in the central and northern regions. Our findings shed light on the relative and combined effects of precipitation and solar radiation on photosynthesis, and can improve our understanding of the responses of Amazon forests to drought.

TI  - Impact of Blackbody Warm-Up Cool-Down Cycle on the Calibration of Aqua MODIS and S-NPP VIIRS Thermal Emissive Bands
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper evaluates the calibration quality during the blackbody (BB) warm-up cool-down cycle for thermal emissive bands onboard Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). This evaluation utilizes data from Aqua MODIS Collection 6 Level-1B products and VIIRS Sensor Data Records in 6-min granule format provided by the NASA Land Science Investigator-led Processing System. Nearly simultaneous hyperspectral measurements from the Aqua Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the S-NPP Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) are used as references for MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. Each AIRS footprint of 13.5 km is co-located with multiple MODIS pixels while each CrIS field of view of 14 km is co-located with multiple VIIRS pixels. The corresponding AIRS-simulated MODIS and CrIS-simulated VIIRS radiances are derived by convolutions based on sensor-dependent relative spectral response functions. In this paper, the analysis mainly focuses on the bands that are used in sea surface temperature products. The results show that there is virtually no impact for MODIS bands 22 and 23 and bands 31 and 32 for a BB temperature below 290 K; however, when the BB temperature increases above 290 K, the impact is up to 0.3 K for bands 22 and 23 and 0.05 K for bands 31 and 32, respectively. For VIIRS, BB temperature-dependent drifts are observed in M15 and M16, which can reach 0.15 and 0.1 K, respectively, over the operational BB temperature range and the VIIRS brightness temperature range.

TI  - Surveillance of the armed forces as a sentinel system for detecting adverse effects of dietary supplements in the general population
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Half the US population takes dietary supplements, but surveillance systems available to regulatory and public health authorities to determine whether specific dietary supplements present a risk are inadequate and numerous severe injuries and deaths have occurred from their consumption. Uniformed military personnel regularly use dietary supplements and are more likely to use potentially dangerous supplements than civilians. Recently, the supplement 1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA) was marketed for physical performance-enhancement and weight loss. However, after over 100 reports of illness attributed to DMAA, including six deaths, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning to cease its sale.Design: When DMAA was legal (2010-2011), we conducted, using convenience samples, supplement surveys of service members and determined prevalence of use and self-reported symptoms of DMAA use.Subjects: We surveyed 4374 armed forces personnel using a standardized dietary supplement survey administered by local health-care professionals.Results: Overall, 11 % of survey respondents used dietary supplements labelled as containing DMAA at least once/week. Regular users were over two times more likely to report tachycardia (P<0.0001), tremors (P<0.0001) and dizziness (P=0.0004), and over three times more likely to report numbness/tingling (P<0.0001) than non-users.Conclusions: Military services could readily monitor adverse events associated with dietary supplements using electronic surveys and medical records. Since armed forces personnel are much more likely than civilians to use potentially dangerous dietary supplements like DMAA, near real-time surveillance of them using electronic surveys and medical records would provide early warning to regulatory agencies and the medical and public health communities when high-risk dietary supplements are introduced.

TI  - The attributable risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to ambient fine particulate pollution among older adults
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The linkage between ambient fine particle pollution (PM2.5) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the attributable risk remained largely unknown. This study determined the cross-sectional association between ambient PM2.5 and prevalence of COPD among adults >= 50 years of age.Methods: We surveyed 29,290 participants aged 50 years and above in this study. The annual average concentrations of PM2.5 derived from satellite data were used as the exposure indicator. A mixed effect model was applied to determine the associations and the burden of COPD attributable to PM2.5.Results: Among the participants, 1872 (6.39%) were classified as COPD cases. Our analysis observed a threshold concentration of 30 mu g/m(3) in the PM2.5-COPD association, above which we found a linear positive exposure-response association between ambient PM2.5 and COPD. The odds ratio (OR) for each 10 mu g/m(3) increase in ambient PM2.5 was 1.21(95% CI: 1.13, 1.30). Stratified analyses suggested that males, older subjects (65 years and older) and those with lower education attainment might be the vulnerable subpopulations. We further estimated that about 13.79% (95% CI: 7.82%, 21.62%) of the COPD cases could be attributable to PM2.5 levels higher than 30 mu g/m(3) in the study population.Conclusion: Our analysis indicates that ambient PM2.5 exposure could increase the risk of COPD and accounts for a substantial fraction of COPD among the study population.

TI  - Tracking oceanic nonlinear internal waves in the Indonesian seas from geostationary orbit
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Nonlinear Internal Waves (NLIWs) in the ocean are observable from passive satellite radiometers. The surface manifestations of these internally propagating waves are curvilinear bands demarcating relatively smooth and rough surface waters, providing a means for their detection via observations of sunglint. Typical horizontal scales of NLIWs are such that traditionally only high resolution (< 1 km pixel) sensors aboard polar orbiting satellites could resolve them. The launch on 28 October 2014 of the Japanese Meteorological Agency's Himawari-8 geostationary satellite and its Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) opens up possibilities to study the spatio-temporal change of these relatively small scale NLIW features from geostationary orbit. Himawari-8 provides 500-m resolution visible imagery every 10 min over a hemispheric field of regard centered at 140.7 degrees E longitude. These spatial and temporal resolutions allow for not only the identification of NLIWs over the low latitude regions such as the Indonesian Seas, but also the ability to track the evolution of these waves in real time. Here, we present examples of NLIWs as viewed from Himawari-8/AHI and calculate a few basic wave quantities, including wavelength and propagation speed. These quantities were found to be consistent with previous observations and model simulations of NLIWs, but observations from AHI provide the ability to calculate wave propagation speeds in the same locations over multiple times a day for multiple days, which is impossible with polar-orbiting satellite data. Geostationary observations will augment the existing database of observed NLIWs and help to better quantify their spatial and temporal attributes.

TI  - El Nino, Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly and Coral Bleaching in the South Atlantic: A Chain of Events Modeled With a Bayesian Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coral bleaching represents one of the main climate-change related threats to reef ecosystems. This research represents a methodological alternative for modeling this phenomenon, focused on assessing uncertainties and complexities with a low number of observations. To develop this model, intermittent reef monitoring data from the largest reef complex in the South Atlantic collected over nine summers between 2000 and 2014 were used with remote sensing data to construct and train a bleaching seasonal prediction model. The Bayesian approach was used to construct the network as it is suitable for hierarchically organizing local thermal variables and combining them with El Nino indicators from the preceding winter to generate accurate bleaching predictions for the coming season. Network count information from six environmental indicators was used to calculate the probability of bleaching, which is mainly influenced by the combined information of two thermal indices; one thermal index is designed to track short period anomalies in the early summer that are capable of triggering bleaching (SST of five consecutive days), and the other index is responsible for tracking the accumulation of thermal stress over time, an index called degree heating trimester (DHT). In addition to developing the network, this study conducted the three tests of applicability proposed for model: 1- Perform the forecast of coral bleaching for the summer of 2016; 2- Investigate the role of turbidity during the bleaching episodes; and 3- Use the model information to identify areas with a lower predisposition to bleaching events.

TI  - Maximizing the relationship of yield to site-specific management zones with object-oriented segmentation of hyperspectral images
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quick and low cost delineation of site-specific management zones (SSMZ) would improve applications of precision agriculture. In this study, a new method for delineating SSMZ using object-oriented segmentation of airborne imagery was demonstrated. Three remote sensing domains-spectral, spatial, and temporal- are exploited to improve the SSMZ relationship to yield. Common vegetation indices (VI), and first and second derivatives (, ) from twelve airborne hyperspectral images of a cotton field for one season were used as input layers for object-oriented segmentation. The optimal combination of VI, SSMZ size and crop phenological stage were used as input variables for SSMZ delineation, determined by maximizing the correlation to segmented yield monitor maps. Combining narrow band vegetation indices and object-oriented segmentation provided higher correlation between VI and yield at SSMZ scale than that at pixel scale by reducing multi-resource data noise. VI performance varied during the cotton growing season, providing better SSMZ delineation at the beginning and middle of the season (days after planting (DAP) 66-143).The optimal scale determined for SSMZ delineation was approximately 240 polygons for the study field, but the method also provided flexibility enabling the setting of practical scales for a given field. For a defined scale, the optimal single phenological stage for the study field was near July 11 (DAP 87) early in the growing season. SSMZs determined from multispectral VIs at a single stage were also satisfactory; compared to hyperspectral indices, temporal resolution of multi-spectral data seems more important for SSMZ delineation.

TI  - Assessment of Methods for Passive Microwave Snow Cover Mapping Using FY-3C/MWRI Data in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing information on snow and its extent is critical for understanding global water and energy cycles. Passive microwave data have been widely used in snow cover mapping given their long-time observation capabilities under all-weather conditions. However, assessments of different passive microwave (PMW) snow cover area (SCA) mapping algorithms have rarely been reported, especially in China. In this study, the performances of seven PMW SCA mapping algorithms were tested using in situ snow depth measurements and a one-kilometer Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) snow cover product over China. The selected algorithms are the FY3 algorithm, Grody's algorithm, the South China algorithm, Kelly's algorithm, Singh's algorithm, Hall's algorithm and Neal's algorithm. During the test period, most algorithms performed reasonably well. The overall accuracy of all algorithms is higher than 0.895 against in situ observations and higher than 0.713 against the IMS product. In general, Singh's algorithm, Hall's algorithm and Neal's algorithm had poor performance during the test. Their misclassification errors were larger than those of the remaining algorithms. Grody's algorithm, the South China algorithm and Kelly's algorithm had higher positive predictive values and lower omission errors than those of the others. The errors of these three algorithms were mainly caused by variations in commission errors. Comparing to Grody's algorithm, the South China algorithm and Kelly's algorithm, the FY3 algorithm presented a conservative snow cover estimation to balance the problem between snow identification and overestimation. As a result, the overall accuracy of the FY3 algorithm was the highest of all the tested algorithms. The accuracy of all algorithms tended to decline with a decreased snow cover fraction as well as SD < 5 cm. All tested algorithms have severe omission errors over barren land and grasslands. The results shown in this study contribute to ongoing efforts to improve the performance and applicability of PMW SCA algorithms.

TI  - Water Detection in Urban Areas from GF-3
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and accurate detection of urban water is critical for urban management, river detection, and flood disaster assessment. This study is devoted to detecting water by GaoFen-3 (GF-3) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images with high spatial resolution. There have been no effective solutions that discriminate water and building shadows using a single SAR image in previous research. Inspired by the principle that every shadow has a corresponding building nearby, a new method is proposed in this study, whereby building shadows are removed depending on the correspondence of buildings and their shadows. The proposed method is demonstrated effective and efficient by experimental results on six GF-3 SAR images. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves of the water detection results indicate that the proposed method increases the Probability of Detection (PD) to 98.36% and decreases the Probability of False Alarm (PFA) to 1.91% compared with the thresholding method, where, at the same PFA level, the maximum PD of the thresholding method is 72.62% in all testing samples. The proposed method is capable of removing building shadows and detecting water with high precision in urban areas, which presents the great potential of high-spatial-resolution GF-3 images in terms of water resource management.

TI  - Assessment of offshore oil/gas platform status in the northern Gulf of Mexico using multi-source satellite time-series images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of the detailed status (location and lifetime) of each oil/gas platform is crucial for ocean management and for understanding its potential environmental impact. However, this requirement is often compromised due to incomplete data records, especially when platform abandonment is not properly planned, designed, and/or executed. The availability of multi-source optical and SAR images provides the possibility of a systematic assessment, but the ubiquitous false positives and frequent geocoding errors make it technically challenging. Here, we develop a time-series remote sensing approach (TSRS) for detecting offshore platforms and determining their status, where the technical challenges are overcome using two strategies, as follows: (i) A stepwise optimization strategy applied to individual images and time-series images to mitigate numerous noises, to select platforms from candidates, and to assess platform status; and (ii) A cross geo-correction strategy using platforms derived from high-geometric accuracy images as ground control points to rectify poorly geo-referenced images. We applied the TSRS approach to the northern Gulf of Mexico using about 26,000 moderate resolution optical/SAR images from eight satellites spanning the period from 1982 to 2017. TSRS detected a total of 9260 (5556) platforms in both Federal and State waters, including 3140 (1803) existing platforms, 5044 (3426) removed platforms, and 1076 (327) status-to-be-determined platforms where the numbers in parentheses represent those from Federal waters. Of these TSRS platforms, 4751 coincide spatially with 5476 (77.68%) of platform records of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) platform database; 2846 (387 in Federal waters) are not found in the BSEE platform database but are convincingly supported by data from other sources (including BSEE-pipeline-database, time-series VIIRS nighttime light products, and littoral ground truth images), meaning that 82.04% of the TSRS-derived platforms can be directly/indirectly confirmed. A site specific validation in East Bay using multi-temporal ground-truth aerial images indicates that, for this site, the false negative rate (FNR) is similar to 9.63% and the false positive rate (FPR) is only 4.44%. The detailed beginning/end dates of the TSRS platforms are mostly confirmed by the corresponding Installation/Site-clear dates recorded in the BSEE platform database. Our findings suggest that the TSRS approach is a robust and cost-effective way to assess oil/gas platform status in large regions, and our results here may complement the official database, narrow down locations for future field investigations, and provide critical information for future assessment of the potential impacts of active and decommissioned platforms on the marine environments.

TI  - The Temporal and Spatial Variations in Lake Surface Areas in Xinjiang, China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid areas, lakes play important roles in sustaining the local ecology, mitigating flood hazard, and restricting economic activity of society. In this study, we used multi-temporal satellite data to study annual variations in 16 natural lakes with individual surface areas over 10 km(2), categorized into six regions based on their geographical and climatic information and on their relations with climate variables. Results indicated that annual variations in lake surface areas are different across these six regions. The surface area of Kanas Lake has not obviously changed due to its typical U-shape cross section; the areas of Ulungur Lake and Jili Lake increased sharply in the 1980s and then slightly decreased; the areas of Sayram Lake, Ebinur Lake, and Bosten Lake increased and then decreased, with peaks detected in the early 2000s; the areas of Barkol Lake and Toale Culler decreased, while those of the lakes located in the Kunlun Mountains steadily increased. Lake areas also show various relationships with climate variables. There is no obvious relationship between area and climate variables in Kanas Lake due to the specific lake morphology; the areas of most lakes showed positive correlations with annual precipitation (except Sayram Lake). A negative correlation between area and temperature were detected in Ulungur Lake, Jili Lake, Barkol Lake, and Toale Culler, while positive correlations were suggested in Bosten Lake and the lakes in the Kunlun Mountains (e.g., Saligil Kollakan Lake, Aksai Chin Lake, and Urukkule Lake).

TI  - Change Detection in Heterogenous Remote Sensing Images via Homogeneous Pixel Transformation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The change detection in heterogeneous remote sensing images remains an important and open problem for damage assessment. We propose a new change detection method for heterogeneous images (i.e., SAR and optical images) based on homogeneous pixel transformation (HPT). HPT transfers one image from its original feature space (e.g., gray space) to another space (e.g., spectral space) in pixel-level to make the pre-event and post-event images represented in a common space for the convenience of change detection. HPT consists of two operations, i.e., the forward transformation and the backward transformation. In forward transformation, for each pixel of pre-event image in the first feature space, we will estimate its mapping pixel in the second space corresponding to post-event image based on the known unchanged pixels. A multi-value estimation method with noise tolerance is introduced to determine the mapping pixel using K-nearest neighbors technique. Once the mapping pixels of pre-event image are available, the difference values between the mapping image and the post-event image can be directly calculated. After that, we will similarly do the backward transformation to associate the post-event image with the first space, and one more difference value for each pixel will be obtained. Then, the two difference values are combined to improve the robustness of detection with respect to the noise and heterogeneousness (modality difference) of images. Fuzzy-c means clustering algorithm is employed to divide the integrated difference values into two clusters: changed pixels and unchanged pixels. This detection results may contain some noisy regions (i.e., small error detections), and we develop a spatial-neighbor-based noise filter to further reduce the false alarms and missing detections using belief functions theory. The experiments for change detection with real images (e.g., SPOT, ERS, and NDVI) during a flood in U.K. are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Evidence for cross rift structural controls on deformation and seismicity at a continental rift caldera
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In continental rifts structural heterogeneities, such as pre-existing faults and foliations, are thought to influence shallow crustal processes, particularly the formation of rift faults, magma reservoirs and surface volcanism. We focus on the Corbetti caldera, in the southern central Main Ethiopian Rift. We measure the surface deformation between 22nd June 2007 and 25th March 2009 using ALOS and ENVISAT SAR interferograms and observe a semi-circular pattern of deformation bounded by a sharp linear feature cross-cutting the caldera, coincident with the caldera long axis. The signal reverses in sign but is not seasonal: from June to December 2007 the region south of this structure moves upwards 3 cm relative to the north, while from December 2007 until November 2008 it subsides by 2 cm. Comparison of data taken from two different satellite look directions show that the displacement is primarily vertical. We discuss potential mechanisms and conclude that this deformation is associated with pressure changes within a shallow (<1 km) fault-bounded hydrothermal reservoir prior to the onset of a phase of calderawide uplift.Analysis of the distribution of post-caldera vents and cones inside the caldera shows their locations are statistically consistent with this fault structure, indicating that the fault has also controlled the migration of magma from a reservoir to the surface over tens of thousands of years. Spatial patterns of seismicity are consistent with a cross-rift structure that extents outside the caldera and to a depth of similar to 30 km, and patterns of seismic anisotropy suggests stress partitioning occurs across the structure. We discuss the possible nature of this structure, and conclude that it is most likely associated with the GobaBonga lineament, which cross-cuts and pre-dates the current rift. Our observations show that pre-rift structures play an important role in magma transport and shallow hydrothermal processes, and therefore they should not be neglected when discussing these processes.

TI  - Multivariate estimation for accurate and logically consistent forest-attributes maps at macroscales
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially explicit wall-to-wall forest-attributes information is critically important for designing management strategies resilient to climate-induced uncertainties. Multivariate estimation methods that link forest attributes and auxiliary variables at full-information locations can be used to estimate the forest attributes for locations with only auxiliary variables information. However, trade-offs between estimation accuracies versus logical consistency among estimated attributes may occur. This is particularly likely for macroscales (i.e., >= 1 Mha) with large forest-attributes variances and wide spacing between full-information locations. We examined these trade-offs for similar to 390 Mha of Canada's boreal zone using variable-space nearest-neighbours imputation versus two modelling methods (i.e., a system of simultaneous nonlinear models and kriging with external drift). We found logical consistency among estimated forest attributes (i.e., crown closure, average height and age, volume per hectare, species percentages) using (i) k <= 2 nearest neighbours or (ii) careful model selection for the modelling methods. Of these logically consistent methods, kriging with external drift was the most accurate, but implementing this for a macroscale is computationally more difficult. This extra cost is justified given the importance of assessing strategies under expected climate changes in Canada's boreal forest and in other forest regions.

TI  - Characterization of oceanic <i>Noctiluca</i> blooms not associated with hypoxia in the Northeastern Arabian Sea
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Intense blooms of the heterotrophic dinoflagellate, green Noctiluca scintillans, have been reported annually in the Northern Arabian Sea since the early 2000s. Although not known to produce organic toxins, these blooms are still categorized as a harmful due to their association with massive fish mortalities. Recent work has attributed these blooms to the vertical expansion of the oxygen minimum zone, driven by cultural eutrophication from major coastal cities in western India. As diatoms are preferred prey of green Noctiluca scintillans, more frequent blooms of this mixotroph will likely impact the productivity of important fisheries in the region. The present study uses a satellite algorithm to determine the distribution of both diatom and green Noctiluca blooms in the Northeastern Arabian Sea from 2009 to 2016. The results from shipboard microscopy of phytoplankton community composition were used to validate the satellite estimates. The satellite algorithm showed 76% accuracy for detection of green Noctiluca and 92% for diatoms. Shipboard measurements and data from biogeochemical-Argo floats were used to assess the relationship between oxygen concentrations and green Noctiluca blooms in the Northeastern Arabian Sea Regardless of the presence of a Noctiluca bloom, the dissolved oxygen in the photic zone was always >70% saturated, with an average oxygen saturation >90%. The variability in the relative abundance of diatoms and green Noctiluca is not correlated with changes in oxygen concentration. These findings provide no evidence that cultural eutrophication has contributed to the decadal scale shifts in plankton composition in the Northeastern Arabian Sea oceanic waters. Conversely, the climatic warming of surface waters would have intensified stratification, thereby reducing net nutrient flux to the photic zone and decreasing silicate to nitrate ratios (Si:N); both factors that could increase the competitive advantage of the mixotroph, green Noctiluca, over diatoms. If so, the decadalscale trajectory of phytoplankton community composition in the Northeastern Arabian Sea may be a harbinger of future climate-driven change in other productive oceanic systems.

TI  - Evolving imaging techniques for staging axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The presence and extent of axillary nodal metastases at the time of breast cancer diagnosis is a critical factor in disease prognosis and plays a central role in deciding the best treatment for patients. Accurate assessment of the axilla is therefore an essential component in staging breast cancer. Over the years, axillary staging has evolved from surgical axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), with its numerous associated long-term complications, to the much less-radical surgical sentinel lymph node excision biopsy (SLNB), the current reference standard. In parallel, radiological staging of the axilla has become increasingly more useful as our knowledge and techniques have improved. Preoperative axillary ultrasound is used widely to stage patients with breast cancer, providing an evaluation of node morphology and allowing targeted biopsy of abnormal nodes. This is important in helping stratify which patients should proceed directly to ALND and which should undergo SLNB first. Grey-scale ultrasound on its own is not perfect and can over-and underestimate axillary disease. Newer ultrasound techniques such as elastography may help to improve diagnostic confidence when visually assessing axillary nodes; for example, in more accurately assessing the extent of axillary disease burden or in differentiating benign reactive nodes from malignant nodes in equivocal cases. The use of intradermal "microbubbles" has shown great promise in being able to locate and biopsy the sentinel lymph node under ultrasound guidance, and raises the possibility that in the future such techniques may obviate the need for surgical SLNB in select patient populations.

TI  - A proposed approach to accelerate evidence generation for genomic-based technologies in the context of a learning health system
T2  - GENETICS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Genomic technologies should demonstrate analytical and clinical validity and clinical utility prior to wider adoption in clinical practice. However, the question of clinical utility remains unanswered for many genomic technologies. In this paper, we propose three building blocks for rapid generation of evidence on clinical utility of promising genomic technologies that underpin clinical and policy decisions. We define promising genomic tests as those that have proven analytical and clinical validity. First, risk-sharing agreements could be implemented between payers and manufacturers to enable temporary coverage that would help incorporate promising technologies into routine clinical care. Second, existing data networks, such as the Sentinel Initiative and the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Network (PCORnet) could be leveraged, augmented with genomic information to track the use of genomic technologies and monitor clinical outcomes in millions of people. Third, endorsement and engagement from key stakeholders will be needed to establish this collaborative model for rapid evidence generation; all stakeholders will benefit from better information regarding the clinical utility of these technologies. This collaborative model can create a multipurpose and reusable national resource that generates knowledge from data gathered as part of routine care to drive evidence-based clinical practice and health system changes.

TI  - Ductal carcinoma in-situ arising within benign phyllodes tumours
T2  - ANNALS OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Ductal carcinoma in situ arising within a benign phyllodes tumour is a rare neoplasm of the breast. We present a case of a 19-year-old woman who had a right breast lump for six months with the above diagnosis together with a mini-review of the literature. Ultrasound revealed a 5-cm breast lump and core biopsy revealed ductal carcinoma in situ. She underwent wide local excision of the breast lump with clear margins. Final histology confirmed ductal carcinoma in situ within a fibroepithelial lesion consistent with a benign phyllodes tumour. To our knowledge, this is the youngest case of ductal carcinoma in situ arising in a phyllodes tumour to have been reported so far.

TI  - Comparison of methodologies for cloud cover estimation in Brazil - A case study
T2  - ENERGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are the major modulator of the shortwave and longwave radiation components of the Earth's energy balance and, as such, help to regulate the planer s temperature. In the energy sector, clouds are a source of instability in the generation of energy using solar technologies. This study aims at comparing three approaches to get cloud cover information in the Southeastern region of Brazil during the period of approximately three months. The first method, assumed as reference, uses all-sky camera pictures for the cloud cover estimation. The other two methodologies use downward longwave radiation with surface meteorological data and geostationary satellite data. Both methods presented good agreement with the camera for clear sky and overcast conditions, with probabilities of detection of 92.8% and 80.7% for the longwave method and 93.3% and 87.6% for the satellite method, respectively. The major problem occurs with the broken-clouds sky scenario, with probabilities of detection above 38%, where each method has its own specificity, such as, longwave emissivity of the atmosphere, spatial resolution and view geometly. The long-wave method has the minor R correlation with the camera (87%) when compared with the satellite method (93%) and requires a daily nonualization, which make it not usable for instantaneous measurements. Regarding the satellite method, the most important issue is the spatial resolution, which has the major impact on the broken-clouds sky scenarios. The cloud masking works properly for large clouds with, at least, the size comparable to the satellite image pixel. Furthermore, the method using the all sky camera also needs to be improved, because it presented some deficiencies, like very bright areas around the sun, sometimes identified as clouds, leading to cloud cover overestimation.

TI  - Is OSNA better than imprint cytology for intraoperative diagnosis of cancer involvement of axillary sentinel node in breast cancer?
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The study aim was to establish Sensitivity, Specificity, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value (NPV), and Accuracy Values of both imprint cytology (IC) and the OSNA assay for intraoperative assessment of axillary sentinel node (SN) cancer involvement in breast cancer. Specifically, we wished to find out if true positive and false negative results of IC were associated to axillary lymphadenectomy (ALND). Also, we addressed a comparative cost analysis between techniques.Methods: 244 patients treated for breast cancer in the Breast Unit of Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol from 2011 to 2015 were prospectively included. A transversal, consecutive design was applied to assess IC compared to the reference test (OSNA). Inclusion criteria were: T1 and T2 tumors with negative nodes, both clinically and on ultrasound.Results: Sensitivity of IC for macrometastases was 70%. The NPV of IC for macrometastases was 95,75%. Accuracy of IC was 96,12%. In the comparative cost analysis, the release time of results for OSNA doubled that of IC and was associated with an increased cost of (sic) 370.Conclusions: IC has been stated as a good technique for intraoperative cancer involvement SN with high sensitivity and NPV compared to the OSNA assay. It allows keeping the whole node tissue and thus the possibility of improved histopathological evaluation, which can be useful for adjuvant, and offers the advantage of being less time consuming. Cost analysis shows a higher cost for OSNA, which may exceed the benefit of sorting out false negatives from IC. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Stock Volume Dependency of Forest Drought Responses in Yunnan, China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Revealing forest drought response characteristics and the potential impact factors is quite an important scientific issue against the background of global climate change, which is the foundation to reliably evaluate and predict the effects of future drought. Due to the high spatial heterogeneity of forest properties such as biomass, forest age, and height, and the distinct differences in drought stress in terms of frequency, intensity, and duration, current studies still contain many uncertainties. In this research, we used the forests in Yunnan Province in Southwest China as an example and aimed to reveal the potential impacts of forest properties (i.e., stock volume) on drought response characteristics. Specifically, we divided the forest into five groups of stock volume density values and then analyzed their drought response differences. To depict forest response to drought intensity, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was chosen as the explanatory variable, and the change in remote sensing-based enhanced vegetation index (deficit of MODIS-EVI, dEVI) was chosen as the response variable of drought stress. Given that the SPEI has different time scales, we first analyzed the statistical dependency of SPEIs with different time scales (1 to 36 months) to the response variable (i.e., dEVI). The optimal time scale of SPEI (SPEIopt) to interpret the maximum variation of dEVI (R-square) was then chosen to build the ultimate statistical models for the five groups of stock volume density. The main findings were as follows: (1) the impacts of drought showed hysteresis and cumulative effects, and the length of the hysteresis increased with stock volume densities; (2) forests with high stock volume densities required more soil water and were therefore more sensitive to the changes in water deficit; (3) compared with the optimal time scale of SPEI (SPEIopt), the SPEI with the commonly used time scale (e.g., 1, 6, and 12 months) could not well reflect the impacts of drought on forests and the simulation error of dEVI increased with stock volume densities; and (4) forests with higher stock volume densities were likely to experience a greater risk of degradation following higher atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases (Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5). As a result, both the time scale of the meteorological drought index and the spatial difference in forest stock volumes should be considered when evaluating forest drought responses at regional and global scales.

TI  - Integrating fuzzy object based image analysis and ant colony optimization for road extraction from remotely sensed images
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Updated road network as a crucial part of the transportation database plays an important role in various applications. Thus, increasing the automation of the road extraction approaches from remote sensing images has been the subject of extensive research. In this paper, we propose an object based road extraction approach from very high resolution satellite images. Based on the object based image analysis, our approach incorporates various spatial, spectral, and textural objects' descriptors, the capabilities of the fuzzy logic system for handling the uncertainties in road modelling, and the effectiveness and suitability of ant colony algorithm for optimization of network related problems. Four VHR optical satellite images which are acquired by Worldview-2 and IKONOS satellites are used in order to evaluate the proposed approach. Evaluation of the extracted road networks shows that the average completeness, correctness, and quality of the results can reach 89%, 93% and 83% respectively, indicating that the proposed approach is applicable for urban road extraction. We also analyzed the sensitivity of our algorithm to different ant colony optimization parameter values. Comparison of the achieved results with the results of four state-of-the-art algorithms and quantifying the robustness of the fuzzy rule set demonstrate that the proposed approach is both efficient and transferable to other comparable images.

TI  - Seasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes on a floating ice tongue, Petermann Glacier, Greenland
T2  - ANNALS OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes are known to trigger Antarctic ice-shelf instability and break-up. However, to date, no study has focused on lakes on Greenland's floating termini. Here, we apply lake boundary/area and depth algorithms to Landsat 8 imagery to analyse the inter- and intraseasonal evolution of supraglacial lakes across Petermann Glacier's (81 degrees N) floating tongue from 2014 to 2016, while also comparing these lakes to those on the grounded ice. Lakes start to fill in June and quickly peak in total number, volume and area in late June/early July in response to increases in air temperatures. However, through July and August, total lake number, volume and area all decline, despite sustained high temperatures. These observations may be explained by the transportation of meltwater into the ocean by a river, and by lake drainage events on the floating tongue. Further, as mean lake depth remains relatively constant during this time, we suggest that a large proportion of the lakes that drain, do so completely, likely by rapid hydrofracture. The mean areas of lakes on the tongue are only similar to 20% of those on the grounded ice and exhibit lower variability in maximum and mean depth, differences likely attributable to the contrasting formation processes of lakes in each environment.

TI  - Prevalence of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in women with persistent high-risk HPV genotypes and negative cytology
T2  - CYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionPrimary HPV screening will be implemented into the English Cervical Screening Programme by 2019. Its impact upon women referred to colposcopy, with negative cytology but persistently positive high-risk HPV (hrHPV), remains unreported from UK Sentinel sites. HPV primary screening was introduced in Sheffield, UK in April 2013; this paper reports its impact on the service.MethodsA retrospective cohort study was performed from June 2014 to July 2016 at the Jessop Wing Colposcopy Unit, Sheffield. UK. Data were obtained from the pathology and colposcopy databases and cross-referenced with case-notes and pathology results for women referred with persistently positive hrHPV, cytology negative samples. Patient demographics, hrHPV genotype, biopsy rates, histological diagnoses, management, and outcomes were collected and baseline statistics performed.ResultsDuring the study 1076 women were seen. Most frequent hrHPV genotypes were: hrHPV other, 41%; and HPV16, 33%. The majority (72%) were found to have normal colposcopy; 28% had an abnormal colposcopic assessment (11% low-grade; 11% high-grade; 6% inadequate). The majority were discharged (83%) and only 5% underwent LLETZ. No cancers were detected. High-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) was found in 7%; overall risk of CIN2 was 1/29; 1/30 for CIN3. Presence of HPV16 was associated with a significantly higher risk of high-grade CIN; 1/9.ConclusionThis is the first study to report results for women referred to colposcopy with cytology negative, persistently positive hrHPV. Disease prevalence is low, although women with HPV16 have a significantly higher likelihood of high-grade disease compared to other HPV subtypes.This is the first study to report results from a Sentinel Site for women referred to colposcopy who have negative cytology but are positive for hrHPV. Undertaking colposcopy in a population with such a low prevalence of disease is challenging and can impact on the confidence of the colposcopist.

AB  - It is challenging to reconcile large scale data with the dynamic characteristics present in land use. Such dynamism requires data with a high repetition of sampling. An alternative is the integration of data of high spatial resolution and low temporal resolution, with that of high temporal resolution and low spatial resolution. The aim addressed in this article is related to the integration of aerial photographs and temporal series for land use and land cover mapping in high detail scale. We conducted a case study in Santa Rosa de Lima-SC. The main data used was the aerial survey that overlaid the state of Santa Catarina, executed in 2010/2011. The interpretation key included typical elements of photointerpretation (color, texture, size, shape), aiming to classify the land use and land cover classes. The mapping evaluation resulted in 75.6% global accuracy, ranging from 54% (Grassland and Wetlands) to 96% (Water Bodies and Rocks). Such results are considered satisfactory. The integration of high-resolution images with high temporal resolution data has enabled the discrimination between classes that present great difficulties of separability. Such discrimination is essential in the territorial management processes of Encosta da Serra and the municipality of Santa Rosa de Lima.

TI  - Analyzing the effects of urban expansion on land surface temperature patterns by landscape metrics: a case study of Isfahan city, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban expansion can cause extensive changes in land use and land cover (LULC), leading to changes in temperature conditions. Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the key parameters that should be considered in the study of urban temperature conditions. The purpose of this study was, therefore, to investigate the effects of changes in LULC due to the expansion of the city of Isfahan on LST using landscape metrics. To this aim, two Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 images, which had been acquired, respectively, on August 2, 1985, and July 4, 2015, were used. The support vector machine method was then used to classify the images. The results showed that Isfahan city had been encountered with an increase of impervious surfaces; in fact, this class covered 15% of the total area in 1985, while this value had been increased to 30% in 2015. Then LST zoning maps were created, indicating that the bare land and impervious surfaces categories were dominant in high temperature zones, while in the zones where water was present or NDVI was high, LST was low. Then, the landscape metrics in each of the LST zones were analyzed in relation to the LULC changes, showing that LULC changes due to urban expansion changed such landscape properties as the percentage of landscape, patch density, large patch index, and aggregation index. This information could be beneficial for urban planners to monitor and manage changes in the LULC patterns.

AB  - The global dynamic spread of chemical contamination through the aquatic environment calls for the development of biomarkers of interest. Reproduction is a key element to be considered because it is related to the sustainability of species. Spermatogenesis is a complex process that leads to the formation of mature germ cells, whose steps and impairments need to be finely described in ecotoxicological analyses. The physiological process has been commonly described by histological analyses of gonads in different taxa. In the present paper, we describe the development of a novel technique to characterize spermatogenesis based on the analysis of the DNA content of germ cells by flow cytometry, using a DNA-intercalating agent. This new biomarker, referred to as an index of sexual maturity, proved relevant to describe the seasonal reproductive cycle of the zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas, 1771), used as a sentinel species in the biomonitoring of continental waters and sensitive to highlight the reprotoxicity of carbamazepine (an anti-epileptic pharmaceutical) tested under ecosystemic conditions (mesocosms).

TI  - A regional algorithm to model mesozooplankton biomass along the southwestern Bay of Bengal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A three-dimensional regression analysis attempted to model mesozooplankton (MSP) biomass using sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a). The study was carried out from January 2014 to July 2015 in the southwestern Bay of Bengal (BoB) and sampling was carried out on board Sagar Manjusha and Sagar Purvi. SST ranged from 26.2 to 33.1 degrees C while Chl-a varied from 0.04 to 6.09 mu g L-1. During the course of the study period, there was a weak correlation (r = 0.32) between SST and Chl-a statistically. MSP biomass varied from 0.42 to 9.63 mg C m(-3) and inversely related with SST. Two kinds of approaches were adopted to develop the model by grouping seasonal datasets (four seasonal algorithms) and comprising all datasets (one annual algorithm). Among the four functions used (linear, paraboloid, the Lorentzian and the Gaussian functions), paraboloid model was best suited. The best seasonal and annual algorithms were applied in the synchronous MODIS-derived SST and Chl-a data to estimate the MSP biomass in the southwestern BoB. The modelled MSP biomass was validated with field MSP biomass and the result was statistically significant, showing maximum regression coefficient for the seasonal algorithms (R-2 = 0.60; p = 0.627; alpha = 0.05), than the annual algorithm (R-2 = 0.52; p = 0.015, alpha = 0.05).

TI  - Modeling and mapping landslide susceptibility zones using GIS based multivariate binary logistic regression (LR) model in the Rorachu river basin of eastern Sikkim Himalaya, India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multivariate binary logistic regression (LR) model was used for the assessment of landslide susceptibility in the Rorachu river basin of eastern Sikkim Himalaya. For this purpose, a spatial database of 13 factors such as rainfall, slope, aspect, curvature, relief, drainage density, distance from drainage, distance from lineament, distance from road, geology, soil, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and land use/land cover was constructed under Geographical Information System (GIS) environment. A landslide inventory map was prepared and converted into binary raster coded by 0 for absence and 1 for the presence of landslide. Total 946 landslide pixels were found out of which 725 landslide pixels (76.63%) were used as training dataset for the model and the model was validated using all landslide pixels. The coefficient value of geology was maximum followed by NDVI, soil and land use/land. The calculated probability value was used as Landslide Susceptibility Index (LSI). On the basis of the LSI value, the landslide susceptibility map was divided into five distinct categories of very low, low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility. The susceptibility classes depict that, 9.18% of total area was under very high and high susceptibility contains 75.48% area of total landslide. Finally the accuracy of the model was assessed by area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and landslide density method. The AUC value of 0.947 indicates a very good quality of the model and landslide density shows that the density is increasing with LSI classes.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of prodelta dynamics by means of new satellite generation: the case of Po river by Landsat-8 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a procedure to perform spatio-temporal analysis of river plume dispersion in prodelta areas by multi-temporal Landsat-8-derived products for identifying zones sensitive to water discharge and for providing geostatistical patterns of turbidity linked to different meteo-marine forcings. In particular, we characterized the temporal and spatial variability of turbidity and sea surface temperature (SST) in the Po River prodelta (Northern Adriatic Sea, Italy) during the period 2013-2016. To perform this analysis, a two-pronged processing methodology was implemented and the resulting outputs were analysed through a series of statistical tools. A pixel-based spatial correlation analysis was carried out by comparing temporal curves of turbidity and SST hypercubes with in situ time series of wind speed and water discharge, providing correlation coefficient maps. A geostatistical analysis was performed to determine the spatial dependency of the turbidity datasets per each satellite image, providing maps of correlation and variograms. The results show a linear correlation between water discharge and turbidity variations in the points more affected by the buoyant plumes and along the southern coast of Po River delta. Better inverse correlation was found between turbidity and SST during floods rather than other periods. The correlation maps of wind speed with turbidity show different spatial patterns depending on local or basin-scale wind effects. Variogram maps identify different spatial anisotropy structures of turbidity in response to ambient conditions (i.e. strong Bora or Scirocco winds, floods). Since the implemented processing methodology is based on open source software and free satellite data, it represents a promising tool for the monitoring of maritime ecosystems and to address water quality analyses and the investigations of sediment dynamics in estuarine and coastal waters.

TI  - Coastal lateral spreading in the world heritage site of the Tramuntana Range (Majorca, Spain). The use of PSInSAR monitoring to identify vulnerability
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - The BA litx area is located on the steep coastal side of the Tramuntana Range (Majorca), a mountainous region which was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2011 in the cultural landscape category. The BA litx site was occupied by farming areas with dry stone constructions and water storing systems of both Roman and Islamic origin. The coastal landscape is characterised by a large fault escarpment of up to 260 m in height. Lateral spreading processes are favoured by local stratigraphy and tectonics in an energetic coastal dynamics scenario. Block spreading morphologies are identified along the escarpment, with large, rocky blocks of volumes up to 60 x 10(3) m(3) moving very slowly until their collapse. Consequently, a thick and highly karstified breccia deposit is accumulated at the base of the scarp. The lowest, oldest breccia outcrop has been dated (Th/U), and an age of 82.5 +/- 5.6 kyr was obtained, reflecting the time span this process has been active. Additionally, numerous geomorphological slope features are identified in the area: landslides, rockfalls, and, more specifically, long and deep cracks in the hanging wall block of the fault, which also reveal active lateral spreading processes. Coastal dynamics have been investigated by interpreting offshore geophysical studies, bathymetry data and borehole information to determine the role of wave energy in the stability of the slope. Additionally, 14 SAR images from the ALOS PALSAR satellite have been exploited for the present work, covering a period spanning from 2007 to 2010, an anomalous rainy period in the region. Images were processed using the Persistent Scattered Interferometry (PSI) technique. PSInSAR results reveal that the rate of movement for the BA litx lateral spreading is extremely low (- 5.2 mm/year on average), but major activity has been detected in the NE sector, where velocity rates can reach values of up to - 16 mm/year Coastal dynamics in the area can explain this, as a small island generates wave refraction and reflection determining more intense erosive processes in the NE part, which lead to a greater destabilising effect on the slopes. A simple vulnerability approach has been developed to take the elements of cultural heritage into account. Vulnerability increases from SW to NE, in accordance with landslide activity. The BA litx case study could provide a testimony to the effects of mass movements and coastal dynamics in an exceptional example of Mediterranean agricultural landscape.

TI  - A Modular Support Vector Machine for Active Learning of Urban Remote Sensing Images Classification in Algeria
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we present a new strategy of active learning, based on a modular version of support vector machine (MSVM) applied to urban remote sensing images in Algeria. In general, the training set is highly imbalanced, which gives more complex models; this difficulty is solved by dividing the problem at hand into a set of sub-problems, where each sub-model could be simpler to solve. The support vector machine is introduced to solve the problem of classification based on image remote sensing data related to atmospheric conditions and illumination reflectance. The aim of the proposed method is to improve the accuracy in order to understand the correlated elements of urban structures (the site, the built, the parcels, the network, the space), to generate the final classification result. In particular, we propose a new method based on the modular support vector machine (MSVM) adopted to active learning method, using three different clustering methods (i) k-means, (ii) fuzzy c-means (FCM), and (iii) Gustafson-Kessel (GKclust). Experimental results obtained on two QuickBird multispectral images of S,tif and Batna cities in the eastern of Algeria confirm the capabilities of the proposed methods based on the ensemble of model trained with different task decomposition compared to a traditional model using active learning. This method improves each class presents a main register in urban structure tissues.

TI  - Singularity maps applied to a vegetation index
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought quantification is one of the most important tasks in the characterisation process of this natural hazard. Recently, several vegetation indexes based on remote-sensing data have been applied to quantify it, being the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) the most widely used. Some index-based drought insurances define a drought event through the comparison of actual NDVI values in a given period with a NDVI threshold based on historical data of that period extrapolating this result spatially to the surrounded areas. Hence, the spatial statistical approach is very relevant and has not been deeply studied in this context.Drought can be highly localised, and several authors have recognised the critical role of the spatial variability. Therefore, it is important to delimit areas that will share NDVI statistical distributions and in which the same criteria can be applied to define the drought event. In order to do so, we have applied for the first time in this context the method of singularity maps commonly used in localisation of mineral deposits. The NDVI singularity maps calculated for each season and different years are shown and discussed in this context. For this study we have selected a region that includes the whole Autonomous Community of Madrid (Spain). The resulting singularity maps show that areas where the NDVI follows theoretically a spatial normal/log-normal distribution (alpha congruent to 2) are widely scattered in the area of study and vary across seasons and years. Therefore, the extrapolation of normal/log-normal NDVI statistics should be applied only inside these areas. (C) 2017 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Use of Sentinel-1 Time-Series Data to Improve Flood Monitoring in Arid Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the similarity of the radar backscatter over open water and over sand surfaces a reliable near real-time flood mapping based on satellite radar sensors is usually not possible in arid areas. Within this study, an approach is presented to enhance the results of an automatic Sentinel-1 flood processing chain by removing overestimations of the water extent related to low-backscattering sand surfaces using a Sand Exclusion Layer (SEL) derived from time-series statistics of Sentinel-1 data sets. The methodology was tested and validated on a flood event in May 2016 at Webi Shabelle River, Somalia and Ethiopia, which has been covered by a time-series of 202 Sentinel-1 scenes within the period June 2014 to May 2017. The approach proved capable of significantly improving the classification accuracy of the Sentinel-1 flood service within this study site. The Overall Accuracy increased by -5% to a value of 98.5% and the User's Accuracy increased by 25.2% to a value of 96.0%. Experimental results have shown that the classification accuracy is influenced by several parameters such as the lengths of the time-series used for generating the SEL.

TI  - Vegetation cover in relation to socioeconomic factors in a tropical city assessed from sub-meter resolution imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale information about urban vegetation and social-ecological relationships is crucial to inform both urban planning and ecological research, and high spatial resolution imagery is a valuable tool for assessing urban areas. However, urban ecology and remote sensing have largely focused on cities in temperate zones. Our goal was to characterize urban vegetation cover with sub-meter (<1 m) resolution aerial imagery, and identify social-ecological relationships of urban vegetation patterns in a tropical city, the San Juan Metropolitan Area, Puerto Rico. Our specific objectives were to (1) map vegetation cover using sub-meter spatial resolution (0.3-m) imagery, (2) quantify the amount of residential and non-residential vegetation, and (3) investigate the relationship between patterns of urban vegetation vs. socioeconomic and environmental factors. We found that 61% of the San Juan Metropolitan Area was green and that our combination of high spatial resolution imagery and object-based classification was highly successful for extracting vegetation cover in a moist tropical city (97% accuracy). In addition, simple spatial pattern analysis allowed us to separate residential from non-residential vegetation with 76% accuracy, and patterns of residential and non-residential vegetation varied greatly across the city. Both socioeconomic (e.g., population density, building age, detached homes) and environmental variables (e.g., topography) were important in explaining variations in vegetation cover in our spatial regression models. However, important socioeconomic drivers found in cities in temperate zones, such as income and home value, were not important in San Juan. Climatic and cultural differences between tropical and temperate cities may result in different social-ecological relationships. Our study provides novel information for local land use planners, highlights the value of high spatial resolution remote sensing data to advance ecological research and urban planning in tropical cities, and emphasizes the need for more studies in tropical cities.

TI  - An Assessment of Existing Methodologies to Retrieve Snow Cover Fraction from MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of snow extent is critical for a wide range of applications. Since 1966, snow maps at different spatial resolutions have been produced using various satellite sensor images. Nowadays, the most widely used products are likely those derived from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, which cover the whole Earth at a near-daily frequency. There are a variety of snow mapping methods for MODIS data, based on different methodologies and applied at different spatial resolutions. Up to now, all these products have been tested and evaluated separately. This study aims to compare the methods currently available for retrieving snow from MODIS data. The focus is on fractional snow cover, which represents the snow cover area at the subpixel level. We examine the two main approaches available for generating such products from MODIS data; namely, linear regression of the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI) and spectral unmixing (SU). These two approaches have resulted in several methods, such as MOD10A1 (the NSIDC MODIS snow product) for NDSI regression, and MODImLAB for SU. The assessment of these approaches was carried out using higher resolution binary snow maps (i.e., showing the presence or absence of snow) at spatial resolutions of 10, 20, and 30 m, produced by SPOT 4, SPOT 5, and LANDSAT-8, respectively. Three areas were selected in order to provide landscape diversity: the French Alps (117 dates), the Pyrenees (30 dates), and the Moroccan Atlas (24 dates). This study investigates the impact of reference maps on accuracy assessments, and it is suggested that NDSI-based high spatial resolution reference maps advantage NDSI medium-resolution snow maps. For MODIS snow maps, the results show that applying an NDSI approach to accurate surface reflectance corrected for topographic and atmospheric effects generally outperforms other methods for the global retrieval of snow cover area. The improvements to the newer version of MOD10A1 (Collection 6) compared to the older version (Collection 5) are significant. Products based on SU provide a good alternative and more accurate retrieval of the snow fraction where wider ranges of land covers are concerned. The fusion process and its resulting 250 m spatial resolution product improve snow line retrieval. False detection in mixed pixels, probably due to the spectral variability associated with the various materials in the spectral mixture, has been identified as an area that will require improvement.

TI  - Annihilator ideals of two-generated metabelian <i>p</i>-groups
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALGEBRA AND ITS APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - For certain metabelian p-groups G = < x, y > with two generators x and y, the annihilator U (sic) Z[X, Y] of the main commutator [y, x] of G, as an ideal of bivariate polynomials with integer coefficients, is determined by means of a presentation for G. It is proved that together with Schreier's polynomials Fx, Fy, the annihilator A identifies the group G uniquely, and the Furtwangler isomorphism of the additive group underlying the residue class ring Z[X, Y]/A to the commutator subgroup G' of G admits the calculation of the abelian type invariants of G'. The results are underpinned by class field theoretic realizations of the groups G as Galois groups Gal((FpK)-K-2/K) of second Hilbert p-class fields (FpK)-K-2 over algebraic number fields K.

TI  - Forest loss and Borneo's climate
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The equatorial island of Borneo is a deforestation hotspot. However, the influence of forest loss on the island's climate remains largely unexplored. Here, we examine how forest loss is related to changes in ground-based records of temperature (1961-2007) and precipitation (1951-2007), andMODIS data for temperature (2002-2016). Analyses were performed for the entire island, lowland areas (<200 m ASL), and nine selected watersheds. We found a strong island-wide relationship between forest loss and increases in daily temperature and reductions in daily precipitation. The relationship between deforestation and changes in local climate was most pronounced for watersheds in southeast Borneo, which have lost 40%-75% of their forests since 1973. These watersheds also had a significantly higher frequency of temperatures above 31 degrees C. Watersheds in north and northwest Borneo, which have lost 5%-25% of their forest cover, maintained a more stable climate with a similar distribution of mean and extreme warm temperatures between forest and modified forest areas. Watersheds with >15% forest loss had a >15% reduction in rainfall. We conclude that loss of forest in Borneo has increased local daily temperatures and temperature extremes, and reduced daily precipitation.

TI  - Enabling efficient, large-scale high-spatial resolution wetland mapping using satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global coastal and freshwater wetlands provide ecosystem services valued at over $200,000 USD per hectare per year. Despite their value, wetlands continue to be lost at alarming rates worldwide, with as much as 71% of global wetland extent being converted to other land-cover types since 1900. Targeted conservation and restoration efforts, however, have proven successful, particularly in Europe and North America. Such efforts require accurate protocols to identify, assess, and map wetlands repeatedly to enable detection of change. High resolution (i.e. 2-meter pixel) satellite imagery has proven effective to map wetlands at higher accuracies than historical 30-meter or coarser satellite data. We describe a method to process and classify high volumes of multispectral high-resolution satellite data to update wetland maps. We show the results of a study conducted with 130 2-meter resolution WorldView-2 satellite images to map forested wetland, upland, water, bare land, and developed lands in a 6500 km(2) watershed. The processing of the map was completed in under 24 h and was more accurate at identifying forested wetland (78%) and upland (64%) than three previous, widely used maps of the same area (45-65%, and 49-53%, respectively). This method offers high potential for monitoring change in coastal areas and adjacent watersheds over large geographic scales.

TI  - Carbon Flux Phenology from the Sky: Evaluation for Maize and Soybean
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon flux phenology is widely used to understand carbon flux dynamics and surface exchange processes. Vegetation phenology has been widely evaluated by remote sensors; however, very few studies have evaluated the use of vegetation phenology for identifying carbon flux phenology. Currently available techniques to derive net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from a satellite image use a single generic modeling subgroup for agricultural crops. But, carbon flux phenological processes vary highly with crop types and land management practices; this paper reexamines this assumption. Presented here are an evaluation of ground-truth remotely sensed vegetation indices with in situ NEE measurements and an identification of vegetation indices for estimating carbon flux phenology metrics by crop type. Results show that the performance of different vegetation indices as an indicator of phenology varies with crop type, particularly when identifying the start of a season and the peak of a season. Maize fields require vegetation indices that make use of the near-infrared and red reflectance bands, while soybean fields require those making use of the shortwave infrared (IR) and near-IR bands. In summary, the study identifies how to best utilize remote sensing technology as a cropspecific measurement tool.

TI  - Magnetism at Depth: A View from an Ancient Continental Subduction and Collision Zone
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent sophisticated global data compilations and magnetic surveys have been used to investigate the nature of magnetization in the lower crust and upper mantle. Two approaches to constraining magnetizations are developed, providing minimum (0.01 SI) and maximum (0.04 SI) susceptibility estimates, given some assumed thickness (15+ km here). These values are higher than are found in many continental rocks. Are there rocks deeper in the crust or upper mantle that are more magnetic than expected, or are the model assumptions incomplete? What is the magnetic behavior of deep-crustal and upper mantle rocks, when slightly cooler than the Curie or Neel temperatures of their magnetic minerals, after being exhumed from locations of high-grade metamorphism at greater depth? Different sets of equilibrium metamorphic minerals can be considered that would form under different conditions. Results on 1,501 samples from the Western Gneiss Region (WGR) Norway, mainly from mafic and ultramafic bodies subducted to depths of 60-200 km and temperatures of 750 up to 950 degrees C at the very highest pressures, show that rocks did not fully equilibrate to the dominant metamorphic-facies conditions. There is a large variation in petrophysical properties, oxide minerals, and mineral assemblages in WGR samples, though they cannot explain the broad high-amplitude (deep-seated) anomalies measured in this region. The presence of magnetite, and exsolved titanohematite and hemoilmenite in samples, shows those magnetic phases are preserved even at eclogite-facies conditions, in part because complete eclogite-facies equilibrium was rarely achieved.Plain Language Summary From the surface of the Earth down to the depth of what we call the Curie/Neel temperature, the crust can act as a magnetic tape recorder. The magnetic history is recorded and a memory kept for thousands (in essence a present-day magnetic memory) to an ancient memory that can be more than a billion years old. The preservation of this memory depends on temperature and pressure conditions, and oxide mineralogy. Today we read this memory from satellite data, or explore Earth's crust from high-resolution aeromagnetic surveys. It is challenging to understand the nature of the magnetic signature of the Earth provided by deep-seated rocks, because there are few areas on Earth with exceptional exposures of rocks, which have been exhumed from great depths. Here we explore the magnetic properties of rocks subducted to high-pressure and ultrahigh-pressure conditions in the Western Gneiss Region of Norway, famous for the eclogites found there. These show large variations in petrophysical properties, oxide minerals, and mineral assemblages, and provide new insights into the potential magnetic behavior of Earth's lithosphere at depth. These results are primary data that allow us to constrain and test current interpretations of the structure of the crust made from satellite surveys.

TI  - Object-based random forest classification of Landsat ETM plus and WorldView-2 satellite imagery for mapping lowland native grassland communities in Tasmania, Australia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a random forest classification approach for identifying and mapping three types of lowland native grassland communities found in the Tasmanian Midlands region. Due to the high conservation priority assigned to these communities, there has been an increasing need to identify appropriate datasets that can be used to derive accurate and frequently updateable maps of community extent. Therefore, this paper proposes a method employing repeat classification and statistical significance testing as a means of identifying the most appropriate dataset for mapping these communities. Two datasets were acquired and analysed; a Landsat ETM + scene, and a WorldView-2 scene, both from 2010. Training and validation data were randomly subset using a k-fold (k = 50) approach from a pre-existing field dataset. Poa labillardierei, Themeda triandra and lowland native grassland complex communities were identified in addition to dry woodland and agriculture. For each subset of randomly allocated points, a random forest model was trained based on each dataset, and then used to classify the corresponding imagery. Validation was performed using the reciprocal points from the independent subset that had not been used to train the model. Final training and classification accuracies were reported as per class means for each satellite dataset. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was undertaken to determine whether classification accuracy differed between the two datasets, as well as between classifications. Results showed mean class accuracies between 54% and 87%. Class accuracy only differed significantly between datasets for the dry woodland and Themeda grassland classes, with the WorldView-2 dataset showing higher mean classification accuracies. The results of this study indicate that remote sensing is a viable method for the identification of lowland native grassland communities in the Tasmanian Midlands, and that repeat classification and statistical significant testing can be used to identify optimal datasets for vegetation community mapping.

TI  - Simulated cold bias being improved by using MODIS time-varying albedo in the Tibetan Plateau in WRF model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematic cold biases exist in the simulation for 2m air temperature in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) when using regional climate models and global atmospheric general circulation models. We updated the albedo in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model lower boundary condition using the Global LAnd Surface Satellite Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer albedo products and demonstrated evident improvement for cold temperature biases in the TP. It is the large overestimation of albedo in winter and spring in the WRF model that resulted in the large cold temperature biases. The overestimated albedo was caused by the simulated precipitation biases and over-parameterization of snow albedo. Furthermore, light-absorbing aerosols can result in a large reduction of albedo in snow and ice cover. The results suggest the necessity of developing snow albedo parameterization using observations in the TP, where snow cover and melting are very different from other low-elevation regions, and the influence of aerosols should be considered as well. In addition to defining snow albedo, our results show an urgent call for improving precipitation simulation in the TP.

T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Chronic diseases are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA. Most chronic diseases have behavioral risk factors that can improve health and quality of life and reduce financial burdens. Improved methods of measurement and behavioral interventions are rapidly progressing. These changes require sufficient funding to maximize effectiveness. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (OBSSR) helps to coordinate and support behavioral and social science research initiatives that are designed to promote public health and reduce chronic disease burden throughout the NIH. OBSSR's budget has not increased for the past 5 years. The goals of this policy paper are to promote awareness of the OBSSR Strategic Plan FY 2017-2021's three priority areas and encourage increased and sustained funding for OBSSR to support these priority areas. Priority area 1 involves improving the quality and integration of behavioral and social science research, which can increase speed of funding natural experiments. Priority area 2 encourages the use and improvement of new technology to create methods and infrastructures to analyze big behavioral data, ensuring that health behavior interventions keep pace with the substantial data generated from new technology. Priority area 3 supports translational research between scientific data and real-world practice, ensuring the delivery of research findings to patients and populations. Adequate and sustained resources are needed to address these priority areas. Without such resources, disparities in health outcomes and the costs of treating preventable chronic diseases will continue to grow. Society of Behavioral Medicine (SBM) recommends and supports an increase for OBSSR's budget.

TI  - DRY FOREST DEFORESTATION DYNAMICS IN BRAZIL'S PONTAL BASIN
T2  - REVISTA CAATINGA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable information on vegetation cover and its dynamics over time is essential for managing life, resources, and supporting policies. Although many related initiatives have been undertaken in Brazil since the 1980s, knowledge about its dry forests is still limited. In this study, we address the drivers of deforestation and their threat to the Brazilian dry forest called Caatinga. We evaluated the land cover dynamics and landscape metrics in the watershed of the Pontal River, as it has become one of the most socially and environmentally important areas in Brazil. The overall process consists of a systematic sampling grid of hydrological samples, where Landsat images (1975 to 2013) combined with the FRAGSTATS package were used to evaluate landscape metrics indices for the Caatinga. Data showed that the relative area (RA) decreased from 90.25% to 60.98% over the 38-year period, while fragmentation (PD) presented an increasing bias. In addition, the spatial distribution of both indices became more heterogeneous and clustered in the north. We suggest that appropriateness of land for farming was the leading cause of deforestation; rainfall is 112% more intense in the north of the watershed than in the south. Therefore, the northern fauna and flora have been significantly altered and reduced. The relationship between deforestation and time shows an increasing threat. Further studies evaluating these causes are needed to improve our understanding of the vegetation dynamics in this region.

TI  - An investigation on the effect of land use land cover changes on surface water quantity
T2  - WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study is an attempt to show how changes in land use and land cover would change the quantity of surface water resources in a river basin in northwestern Iran. In order to detect the changing trend of surface water quantity in the river basin, the long-term statistic data of sediment load and river discharge were gathered over the period between 1987 and 2013. For land use change detection of the river basin, the land use land cover maps of the study area in the years of 1987, 1998, 2002, 2009, and 2013 were prepared from Landsat satellite images using supervised classification method. The changing trend of river discharge showed a significant and positive relationship with rain-fed agriculture (R-2 = 0.8152), poor rangeland (R-2 = 0.7978), and urban areas (R-2 = 0.8377). There was also a strong negative correlation between water discharge and irrigated agriculture (R-2 = 0.7286) and good rangeland (R-2 = 0.8548). In conclusion, increasing the area of rain-fed agriculture, good rangeland (type IV), and urban land uses, due to their effects on increasing the runoff, have caused an increase in the water flow of Zanjanroud River.

TI  - A 31-year climatology of tropical cyclone size from the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A 31-year tropical cyclone (TC) size climatology (1980-2010) is established using the NCEP Climate Forecast System Reanalysis for the western North Pacific (WNP) and the North Atlantic (NA). The size of a TC, defined as the azimuthally averaged radius of 17 m s(-1) wind near the sea surface, is estimated using the strong relationship between TC size and azimuthally averaged winds in the outer-core region of the TC. The estimation method is verified by comparing the TC size climatology established using the QuikSCAT satellite data. The monthly and annual variations in both climatologies agree with each other.Based on this 31-year data set, the mean TC sizes over the WNP and NA are 2.01 degrees and 1.61 degrees latitude, respectively. TC size in both basins exhibits temporal intra-seasonal and annual as well as spatial variations. Inter-annual TC size variations in the WNP are highly correlated (r = 0.816) with El Nino-Southern Oscillation events. In WNP, the highest percentage of large TCs occurs near 25 degrees N, which agrees with previous modelling and observational studies.

TI  - Segmentation schema for enhancing land cover identification: A case study using Sentinel 2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land monitoring is performed increasingly using high and medium resolution optical satellites, such as the Sentinel-2. However, optical data is inevitably subjected to the variable operational conditions under which it was acquired. Overlapping of features caused by shadows, soft transitions between shadowed and non-shadowed regions, and temporal variability of the observed land-cover types require radiometric corrections. This study examines a new approach to enhancing the accuracy of land cover identification that resolves this problem. The proposed method constructs an ensemble-type classification model with weak classifiers tuned to the particular operational conditions under which the data was acquired. Iterative segmentation over the learning set is applied for this purpose, where feature space is partitioned according to the likelihood of misclassifications introduced by the classification model. As these are a consequence of overlapping features, such partitioning avoids the need for radiometric corrections of the data, and divides land cover types implicitly into subclasses. As a result, improved performance of all tested classification approaches were measured. during the validation that was conducted on Sentinel-2 data. The highest accuracies in terms of F1-scores were achieved using the Naive Bayes Classifier as the weak classifier, while supplementing original spectral signatures with normalised difference vegetation index and texture analysis features, namely, average intensity, contrast, homogeneity, and dissimilarity. In total, an F1-score of nearly 95% was achieved in this way, with F1-scores of each particular land cover type reaching above 90%.

TI  - The Tune of Christian Apocalyptic: Paul and John in Concert
T2  - THEOLOGY TODAY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article puts John and Paul in conversation concerning two issues: believers' partaking of food sacrificed to idols and the question of who were the primary actors in Jesus' death. While many modern interpreters see discord between John's treatment of food offered to idols and Paul's, this article argues that both John and Paul were informed by an apocalyptic worldview that sees demonic forces behind idolatry. As such, they are in harmony in their arguments that all foods explicitly identified as idol food must be rejected by believers. Furthermore, both John and Paul share an apocalyptic worldview that saw demonic forces as the primary actors in Jesus' crucifixion.

TI  - Sedative Prescriptions Are Common at Opioid Initiation: An Observational Study in the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - PAIN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Concurrent use of sedatives, especially anxiolytics, and opioids is associated with increased risk of medication-related harms. To the extent that multiple prescribers are involved, approaches to influence patterns of coprescribing will differ from those to influence prescribing within a single drug class.Objectives. Describe the proportion of new opioid recipients with concurrent sedative medications at opioid initiation and determine whether these medications were prescribed by the same prescriber.Methods. We used national Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) outpatient pharmacy administration data to identify veterans who received a new opioid prescription between October 20, 2010, and September 1, 2011 (FY 2011), preceded by a 365-day opioid-free period. Concurrent sedative use was defined as a skeletal muscle relaxant, benzodiazepine, atypical antipsychotic, or hypnotic filled on the opioid start date or before and after the opioid start date with a gap of less than twice the day supply of the prior fill.Results. Concurrent sedative use at opioid initiation was 21.4% (112,408/526,499) in FY 2011. The proportion of concurrent recipients who received at least one concurrent sedative prescribed by a provider other than the opioid prescriber was 61.4% (69,002/112,408). The proportion of recipients who received a sedative concurrent with opioid initiation from the same prescriber varied across sedative class. Benzodiazepines and opioids were prescribed by the same provider in 41.1% (15,520/37,750) of concurrent users.Conclusion. One in five patients newly prescribed opioids also had a sedative prescription. Less than half of patients with concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine prescriptions received these from the same provider. Efforts to reduce concurrent opioid and sedative prescribing will require addressing care coordination.

TI  - Monitoring flood and drought events - earth observation for multiscale assessment of water-related hazards and exposed elements
T2  - Biodiversity Ecol
M3  - Article
AB  - Disaster management is dependent on comprehensive information about the hazard's nature and the elements exposed- independent of the location and extent of the hazard. This work explores methods to monitor water-related hazards and identify exposed elements based on multisensorial earth observation (EO) and auxiliary data in southern Africa. For the hazard-related perspective, we present methods to monitor floods based on radar data (Sentinel-1, TerraSAR-X) and droughts based on time series MODIS satellite data. For the exposure-related perspective, we classify exposed settlements from TerraSAR-X (TSX) and TanDEM-X (TDX) data. We assess people at risk and their respective locations, combining earth observation and census-based geoinformation. The datasets and methods are explored in two case studies investigating a flood in northern Namibia in 2011 and drought events in South Africa and Botswana in 2015 and 2016. The case studies show that the methods developed are crucial tools for hazard and exposure identification, assessment, and monitoring.

TI  - Quantification of carbon stocks in Mount Marsabit Forest Reserve, a sub-humid montane forest in northern Kenya under anthropogenic disturbance
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of carbon stocks is vital for decision making in forest management, carbon stock change assessment and scientific applications. We applied the land degradation surveillance framework (LDSF) method with a sentinel site of (10 km x 10 km) to assess carbon stock levels and tree diversity in the Marsabit Forest Reserve (MFR). The above ground (ABG) carbon stock was estimated at 12.42 t/ha, while soil organic carbon (SOC) was 12.51 t/ha, with SOC densities increasing with increasing depth. The mean ABG carbon and SOC densities were higher in the least disturbed strata than the disturbed strata. The estimated ABG carbon and SOC stocks were significantly lower than the range observed in a typical dry tropical forest. Twenty-one tree species were recorded belonging to twelve families with the disturbed areas recording nine tree species while the least disturbed recording twelve species. Rubiaceae and Rutaceae were the richest families with four species each while Boraginaceae, Capparaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Tiliaceae, Violaceae, and Ochnaceae the least frequent with one species each. The most common tree species were, Croton megalocarpus, Drypetes gerrardii, Ochna insculpta, Strychnos henningsii and Vangueria madagascariensis. The forest recorded a basal diameter of 14.09 +/- 12.15 cm, basal area of 0.016 m 2/ha with a mean height of 8.69 m. The basal size class distribution declined monotonically indicative of a stable population. Livestock grazing, selective logging, and firewood collection were the primary forms of anthropogenic activities recorded in the MFR despite the moratorium imposed on consumptive utilisation of forest products by the Marsabit County security committee. The Pearson correlation coefficient returned an inverse relationship between forest disturbance with SOC and ABG carbon in the disturbed strata suggesting that anthropogenic activities reduced carbon stocks in the MFR. Concerted efforts to mitigate anthropogenic impacts on the MFR could significantly increase its terrestrial carbon sequestration potential and the provision of critical ecosystem goods and services.

TI  - Effect of convection on the thermal structure of the troposphere and lower stratosphere including the tropical tropopause layer in the South Asian monsoon region
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Influence of convection on the thermal structure of Troposphere and Lower Stratosphere (TLS) is investigated using radiosonde data, obtained from Trivandrum (8.5 degrees N, 76.9 degrees E), Gadanki (13.5 degrees N, 79.2 E), Bhubaneswar (20.25 degrees N, 85.83 degrees E), Kolkata (22.65 degrees N, 88.45 degrees E) and Singapore (1.37 degrees N, 103.98 degrees E), collected during different convective categories classified based on the altitude of deep convective cloud tops (CT) in the period 2008-2014. During deep convective events, the temperature showed lower tropospheric cooling, an upper tropospheric warming and an anomalous cooling (warming) below (above) the cold point tropopause (CPT) with respect to the clear-sky value. While warming in the upper troposphere is strongest (similar to 2-4 K) around 10-12 km, anomalous cooling (warming) below (above) the CPT is maximum around 15.5 km (17.51cm) with values in the range of -2 to -4 K (3-6 K). These temperature perturbations are observed 5-6 days prior to the convective events. In response to deep convection, surface cooling up to similar to -4 K is also observed. This study showed that the magnitude of cold and warm anomalies increases with strength of convection. During deep convection, the potential temperature (theta) shows a decrease (<5K) in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) from the TTL-base up to CPT compared to that on clear-sky days, confirming the vertical mixing of convective air from the lower atmosphere to the TTL-levels. Correlation analysis between different TTL parameters suggests that, as the cloud top altitude increases, along with the adiabatic process, diabatic process also plays a major role in the TTL. An interesting feature observed during deep convection is the ascent of TTL-base by similar to 1.5 km and descent of CPT and TTL-top by 0.5 km, which effectively thins the TTL by similar to 2 km.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is an endeavor to assess the impact of climate change on physical, ecological and socio economic vulnerability of Mousuni Island which is one of the 10 most vulnerable ocean-confronting Islands in South 24 Parganas District of West Bengal according to WWF India, 2010. Landsat imageries have been analyzed to identify shoreline changes; Spectral Radiance Model and Split Window Algorithm have been executed for land surface temperature change analysis and supervised classification is employed for detecting landuse alteration. Flood prone area has been worked out from modified normalized difference water index and SRTM DEM dataset. Normalized difference vegetation index and normalized difference salinity index are also employed to find out change in forest cover and salinity respectively. Socio-economic vulnerability has been identified by primary survey and secondary data sources. The result indicates that climate change causes vulnerability of life processes of rural folk forcing them to become ecological refugees.

TI  - Exploiting the capabilities of the Sentinel-2 multi spectral instrument for predicting growing stock volume in forest ecosystems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial prediction of growing stock volume is one of the most frequent application of remote sensing for supporting the sustainable management of forest ecosystems. For such a purpose data from active or passive sensors are used as predictor variables in combination with measures taken in the field in sampling plots. The Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites are equipped with a Multi Spectral Instrument (MSI) capable of acquiring 13 bands in the visible and infrared domains with a spatial resolution varying between 10 and 60 m. The present study aimed at evaluating the performance of the S2-MSI imagery for estimating the growing stock volume of forest ecosystems. To do so we used 240 plots measured in two study areas in Italy. The imputation was carried out with eight k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) methods available in the open source Yalmpute R package. In order to evaluate the S2-MSI performance we repeated the experimental protocol also with two other sets of images acquired by two well-known satellites equipped with multi spectral instruments: Landsat 8 OLI and RapidEye scanner. We found that S2 worked better than Landsat in 37.5% of the cases and in 62.5% of the cases better than RapidEye. In one study area the best performance was obtained with Landsat OLI (RMSD = 6.84%) and in the other with S2 (RMSD = 22.94%), both with the k-NN system based on a distance matrix calculated with the Random Forest algorithm. The results confirmed that S2 images are suitable for predicting growing stock volume obtaining good performances (average RMSD for both the test areas of less than 19%).

TI  - Ability of Intraoperative Pathologic Analysis of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ to Guide Selective Use of Sentinel Lymph Node Surgery
T2  - AMERICAN SURGEON
M3  - Article
AB  - For patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), sentinel lymph node (SLN) surgery is generally reserved for patients at high risk of being upstaged to invasive disease. The use of frozen section (FS) pathologic analysis of the primary tumor may allow for selective surgical nodal staging within one procedure. We sought to define the reliability of FS for detection of upstaging. Eight hundred and twenty-seven patients were identified with DCIS on core needle biopsy that underwent 834 operations at our institution between January 2004 and October 2014. We calculated the rate of upstage from DCIS to invasive cancer on both intraoperative FS and final pathology to determine the performance of FS. Upstage rate on final pathology was 118/834 (14.1%) 95 per cent confidence interval 11.8 to 16.7 per cent. FS identified 88/118 (74.6%) of the upstages. Specificity was 99.3 per cent (711/716). Overall accuracy was 95.8 per cent (799/834) and the positive predictive value was 96.0 per cent (711/741 patients). Mean size of invasive cancers identified on FS was 5.6 mm, versus 3.5 mm for those identified only on permanent section, P = 0.11. Intraoperative FS analysis of DCIS is useful for identification of upstage to invasive disease. This may facilitate a selective approach to SLN surgery that both decreases unnecessary SLN surgery and the need for a second operation.

TI  - Management of the axilla in metaplastic breast carcinoma
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Metaplastic breast cancer (MBC), characterized by admixed epithelial, squamous or mesenchymal elements, constitutes <1% of breast cancers and has a poor prognosis but a paradoxically low reported rate of axillary lymph node (LN) involvement. Due to its rarity, data on appropriate axillary management is lacking, prompting this investigation of LN status and outcomes.Methods: We identified 41 MBC patients treated at our institution 2001-2011 who were followed for a median of 66 months. Statistical analyses evaluated axillary ultrasound (AUS), fine needle aspiration (FNA), and sentinel LN biopsy (SLNB) in association with LN status.Results: Median tumor size was 2.7 cm and 76% were triple-negative. Twenty-three patients (56%) had preoperative AUS: 9 (39%) showed >= 1 suspicious LN, 6 proceeded to LN FNA and 3 were confirmed positive. Six patients had neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including 2 FNA LN+. Ten patients were LN+ at operation. Among 19 patients undergoing AUS and axillary surgery, AUS +/- FNA sensitivity was 100% and specificity was 94%. LN positivity correlated with increasing tumor size, grade and angiolymphatic invasion. 16 patients recurred, 63% with distant disease (10/16) and one with isolated axillary disease after a negative SLNB not preceded by AUS. Overall SLNB accuracy was 96% (23/24), but absent preoperative AUS, 1/7 (14%) of SLNBs were falsely negative.Conclusions: Our study is the first to specifically address the performance and utility of AUS/FNA and SLNB for MBC patients. AUS/FNA at diagnosis followed by SLN surgery provided accurate nodal staging and critical prognostic information to inform treatment recommendations. We recommend this approach for axillary management of MBC patients.

TI  - The role of satellite remote sensing in structured ecosystem risk assessments
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The current set of global conservation targets requires methods for monitoring the changing status of ecosystems. Protocols for ecosystem risk assessment are uniquely suited to this task, providing objective syntheses of a wide range of data to estimate the likelihood of ecosystem collapse. Satellite remote sensing can deliver ecologically relevant, long-term datasets suitable for analysing changes in ecosystem area, structure and function at temporal and spatial scales relevant to risk assessment protocols. However, there is considerable uncertainty about how to select and effectively utilise remotely sensed variables for risk assessment. Here, we review the use of satellite remote sensing for assessing spatial and functional changes of ecosystems, with the aim of providing guidance on the use of these data in ecosystem risk assessment. We suggest that decisions on the use of satellite remote sensing should be made a priori and deductively with the assistance of conceptual ecosystem models that identify the primary indicators representing the dynamics of a focal ecosystem.

AB  - It is unknown how many patients with localized melanoma undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or if there is a therapeutic effect from performing nodal staging. We evaluated predictors for SLNB use and assessed if there was an association with improved survival in melanoma patients who had SLNB.The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was queried for clinically node-negative melanoma cases ae<yen> 0.75 mm in thickness treated from 2010 to 2012. Clinicopathologic factors were correlated with SLNB use, overall survival (OS), and melanoma-specific survival (MSS).Overall, 13,703 cases were included. SLNB was performed in 1479 of 3439 thin cases (43.0%), 5810 of 8522 intermediate-thickness cases (68.2%), and 916 of 1742 thick cases (52.6%). On multivariable analysis, age ae<yen> 70 years, thickness < 1 or > 4 mm, head/neck or trunk tumor location, being unmarried, African American race, and residing in a county with a lower level of education were significantly associated with a lower likelihood of performing SLNB (p < 0.05). Patients with intermediate-thickness or thick melanoma who had a SLNB had significantly improved OS and MSS compared with patients who did not have a SLNB (p < 0.05). On multivariable analysis, SLNB use significantly predicted for improved OS and MSS (p < 0.01).Only 68.2% of intermediate-thickness and 52.6% of thick melanomas are treated with SLNB. Age, thickness, tumor location, race, marital status, and socioeconomic factors appear to influence the performance of SLNB. This data becomes more relevant with the finding that SLNB use is potentially associated with improved survival.

TI  - Evaluating the Applications of the Near-Infrared Region in Mapping Foliar N in the Miombo Woodlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been widely used to estimate the distribution of foliar nitrogen (N) in a cost-effective manner. Although hyperspectral remote sensing targeting the red edge and shortwave infrared regions has proved successful at estimating foliar N, research has recently shifted to include exploring the benefits of using the near-infrared (NIR) region, especially when using broadband sensing. Bootstrapped random forest regression analysis was applied on Sentinel 2 data to test the significance of using the NIR in foliar N estimation in miombo woodlands. The results revealed a low ranking for individual NIR bands, but the ranking improved when spectral indices were used. In addition, the results indicated a marginal increase in the normalised root mean square error of prediction (nRMSE) from 11.35% N when all bands were used to 11.69% N when the NIR bands were excluded from the model. Bootstrapping results show higher accuracy and better consistency in the prediction of foliar N using combined spectral indices and individual bands. This study therefore underscores the significance of spectral indices to increase the NIR region's importance in estimating the distribution of foliar N as a key indicator of ecosystem health at the landscape scale in miombo systems.

TI  - Landscape Greening Policies-based Land Use/Land Cover Simulation for Beijing and Islamabad-An Implication of Sustainable Urban Ecosystems
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - City green infrastructure (CGI) makes cities more resilient and sustainable, as required by the United Nations' (UN) Sustainable Development Goal 11-Sustainable Cities and Communities. Based on the CGI policies of Beijing, land use/land cover (LULC) changes of two Asian capitals, Beijing, China and Islamabad, Pakistan, are simulated. LULC maps for 2010 and 2015 are developed by applying object-based image analysis (OBIA) to Landsat imagery. Dynamics of land system (DLS) model was used to simulate the LULC changes for 2020 and 2025 under three scenarios: (1) business-as-usual (BAU); (2) urban green space work plan (UGWP); and (3) landscape and greening policies (LGP). Results reveal that DLS is efficient than other simulation models. The BAU scenario predicts an overall expansion in Beijing's greenery, while Islamabad will encounter a decline by 7.3 km(2) per year. Under the UGWP scenario, urban green spaces and other vegetation area of Beijing will expand by 7.6 km(2), while, for Islamabad, vegetation degradation rate will slow down to 6.9 km(2) per year. The LGP scenario envisage a massive increase of 23.5 km(2) per year in green resources of Beijing and Islamabad's green land loss rate will further slowdown to 6.1 km(2) per year. It is inferred from the results that vegetation degradation in Islamabad need to lessen by implementing LGP policy after basic amendments according to the local conditions and available resources.

TI  - Characterizing agricultural drought in the Karamoja subregion of Uganda with meteorological and satellite-based indices
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Karamoja is notoriously food insecure and has been in need of food aid for most years during the last two decades. One of the main factors causing food insecurity is drought. Reliable, area-wide, long-term data for detecting and monitoring drought conditions are critical for timely, life-saving interventions and the long-term development of the region, yet such data are sparse or unavailable. Due to advances in satellite remote sensing, characterizing drought in data-sparse regions like Karamoja has become possible. This study characterizes agricultural drought in Karamoja to enable a comprehensive understanding of drought, concomitantly evaluating the suitability of NDVI-based drought monitoring. We found that in comparison with the existing data, NDVI data currently provide the best, consistent, and spatially explicit information for operational drought monitoring in Karamoja. Results indicate that the most extreme agricultural drought in recent years occurred in 2009 followed by 2004 and 2002 and suggest that in Karamoja, moderate to severe droughts (e.g., 2008) often have the same impact on crops and human needs (e.g., food aid) as extreme droughts (e.g., 2009). We present in a proof-of-concept frame, a method to estimate the number of people needing food assistance and the population likely to fall under the integrated food security phase classification (IPC) Phase 3 (crisis) due to drought severity. Our model indicates that 90.7% of the variation in the number of people needing aid can be explained by NDVI data and NDVI data can augment these estimates. We conclude that the biggest drivers of food insecurity are the cultivation of crops on marginal land with insignificant inputs, the lack of irrigation and previous systematic incapacitation of livestock (pastoral) alternatives through government programming. Further research is needed to bridge empirical results with social-economic studies on drought impacts on communities in the region to better understand additional factors that will need to be addressed to ensure livelihood resilience.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Characterization with a Dual-Targeted Molecular Ultrasound Contrast Agent
T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the performance of molecular ultrasound with dual-targeted microbubbles to detect metastatic disease in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in swine model of naturally occurring melanoma. The SLN is the first lymph node in the lymphatic chain draining primary tumor, and early detection of metastatic SLN involvement is critical in the appropriate management of melanoma.Nine Sinclair swine (weight 3-7 kg; Sinclair BioResources, Columbia, MO, USA) with naturally occurring melanoma were examined. Siemens S3000 scanner with a 9L4 probe was used for imaging (Siemens Healthineers, Mountain View, CA). Dual-targeted contrast agent was created using Targestar SA microbubbles (Targeson, San Diego, CA, USA) labeled with alpha(nu)beta(3)-integrin and P-selectin antibodies. Targestar SA microbubbles labeled with IgG-labeled were used as control. First, peritumoral injection of Sonazoid contrast agent (GE Healthcare, Oslo, Norway) was performed to detect SLNs. After that, dual-targeted and IGG control Targestar SA microbubbles were injected intravenously with a 30-min interval between injections. Labeled Targestar SA microbubbles were allowed to circulate for 4 min to enable binding. After that, two sets of image clips were acquired several seconds before and after a high-power destruction sequence. The mean intensity difference pre- to post-bubble destruction within the region of interest placed over SLN was calculated as a relative measure of targeted microbubble contrast agent retention. This process was repeated for non-SLNs as controls. All lymph nodes evaluated on imaging were surgically removed and histologically examined for presence of metastatic involvement.A total of 43 lymph nodes (25 SLNs and 18 non-SLNs) were included in the analysis with 18 SLNs demonstrating metastatic involvement greater than 5 % on histology. All non-SLNs were benign. The mean intensity (+/- SD) of the dual-targeted microbubbles for metastatic SLNs was significantly higher than that of benign LNs (18.05 +/- 19.11 vs. 3.30 +/- 6.65 AU; p = 0.0008), while IgG-labeled control microbubbles demonstrated no difference in retained contrast intensity between metastatic and benign lymph nodes (0.39 +/- 1.14 vs. 0.03 +/- 0.24 AU; p = 0.14).The results indicate that dual-targeted microbubbles labeled with P-selectin and alpha(nu)beta(3)-integrin antibodies may aid in detecting metastatic involvement in SLNs of melanoma.

TI  - Signals from the south; humpback whales carry messages of Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem variability
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern hemisphere humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) rely on summer prey abundance of Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) to fuel one of the longest-known mammalian migrations on the planet. It is hypothesized that this species, already adapted to endure metabolic extremes, will be one of the first Antarctic consumers to show measurable physiological change in response to fluctuating prey availability in a changing climate; and as such, a powerful sentinel candidate for the Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem. Here, we targeted the sentinel parameters of humpback whale adiposity and diet, using novel, as well as established, chemical and biochemical markers, and assembled a time trend spanning 8 years. We show the synchronous, inter-annual oscillation of two measures of humpback whale adiposity with Southern Ocean environmental variables and climate indices. Furthermore, bulk stable isotope signatures provide clear indication of dietary compensation strategies, or a lower trophic level isotopic change, following years indicated as leaner years for the whales. The observed synchronicity of humpback whale adiposity and dietary markers, with climate patterns in the Southern Ocean, lends strength to the role of humpback whales as powerful Antarctic sea-ice ecosystem sentinels. The work carries significant potential to reform current ecosystem surveillance in the Antarctic region.

TI  - A New InSAR Persistent Scatterer Selection Technique Using Top Eigenvalue of Coherence Matrix
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) time-series processing relies on identifying coherent pixels in SAR image stacks that show the persistent scatterer (PS) or distributed scatterer (DS) behavior. Accuracy of InSAR time-series estimates is dependent on the quality of selected PS/DS pixels. Current pixel selection techniques perform well when identifying highly coherent pixels but produce many false alarms in low coherence regions due to the inherent bias in residual phase estimation. Therefore, pixels with low coherence may have the appearance of noise and be rejected if the coherence threshold is too high. In contrast, lowering the threshold increases the number of false alarms introduced in processing giving noisier time-series as a result of incorrect phase unwrapping. The multidimensional SAR data acquisition can be described as a zero mean Gaussian process fully described by the covariance matrix. In this paper, we investigate the covariance matrix using a random matrix theory approach to find the statistical properties of the eigenvalues for simulated and real SAR data. The probability distribution of all the eigenvalues in this case is limited by the Marcenko-Pastur distribution. The histogram of the highest eigenvalue follows a Tracy-Widom distribution. Thus, by adopting a pixel selection strategy based on a threshold on the highest eigenvalue of the coherence matrix, we can differentiate between low coherence and noise pixels. In addition, our technique provides a methodology to detect the number of targets present in multiscatterer layover pixels and extract time-series information from double bounce response of bridges. Applying the technique for TerraSAR-X data over Berlin shows the effectiveness of the algorithm.

TI  - Evaluation of Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) for Water Quality Monitoring: A Case Study for the Estimation of Salinity
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) dataset have been used to estimate salinity in the coastal area of Hong Kong. Four adjacent Landsat TM images were used in this study, which was atmospherically corrected using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) radiative transfer code. The atmospherically corrected images were further used to develop models for salinity using Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) based on in situ data of October 2009. Results show that the coefficient of determination (R (2)) of 0.42 between the OLS estimated and in situ measured salinity is much lower than that of the GWR model, which is two times higher (R (2) = 0.86). It indicates that the GWR model has more ability than the OLS regression model to predict salinity and show its spatial heterogeneity better. It was observed that the salinity was high in Deep Bay (north-western part of Hong Kong) which might be due to the industrial waste disposal, whereas the salinity was estimated to be constant (32 practical salinity units) towards the open sea.

TI  - Impact of National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines on Case Selection and Outcomes for Sentine Lymph Node Biopsy in Thin Melanoma
T2  - DERMATOLOGIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In 2010, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommended sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for thin melanomas <1 mm with mitotic rate (MR) In 2016, the criteria were changed to Breslow depth >0.75 mm and MR >= 1.ObjectiveTo compare the impact of 2010 and 2016 NCCN guidelines on SLNB case selection and thin melanoma outcomes.Materials and Methods Ten-year retrospective cohort of primary thin melanomas at an academic hospital was retroactively stratified for SLNB eligibility using the 2010 and 2016 NCCN guidelines. Nodal recurrence-free survival (NRFS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were compared.Results Eight hundred two patients with 859 tumors and median follow-up of 79 months were included. Eleven percent fewer tumors qualified for SLNB under 2016 versus 2010 NCCN guidelines (19% vs 8%, p < .001). The 2016-qualifying cases also had lower 10-year NRFS (70.7% vs 95.2%, p < .001) and DFS (64.7% vs 91.4%, p < .001). Among 2016-qualifying cases, those that received SLNB had improved NRFS (85.6% vs 35.3%, p = .001) and DFS (80.2% vs 30.5%, p < .001) as compared to those that did not receive SLNB.Conclusion The 2016 NCCN guidelines reduced the number of thin melanomas qualifying for SLNB and more accurately selected cases with higher risks of nodal recurrence and death.

TI  - Fog Detection Based on Meteosat Second Generation- Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager High Resolution Visible Channel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) High Resolution Visible channel (HRV) is used in synergy with the narrow band MSG-SEVIRI channels for daytime fog detection. A new algorithm, named MSG-SEVIRI SatFog, has been designed and implemented. MSG-SEVIRI SatFog provides the indication of the presence of fog in near real time and at the high spatial resolution of the HRV channel. The HRV resolution is useful for detecting small scale daytime fog that would be missed in the MSG-SEVIRI low spatial resolution channels. By combining textural, physical and tonal tests, a distinction between fog and low stratus is performed for pixels identified as low/middle clouds or clear by the Classification-MAsk Coupling of Statistical and Physical Methods (C-MACSP) cloud detection algorithm. Suitable thresholds have been determined using a specific dataset covering different geographical areas, seasons and time of the day. MSG-SEVIRI SatFog is evaluated against METeorological Aerodrome Reports (METAR) data observations. Evaluation results in an accuracy of 69.9%, a probability of detection of 68.7%, a false alarm ratio of 31.3% and a probability of false detection of 30.0%.

TI  - Multi-Temporal DInSAR to Characterise Landslide Ground Deformations in a Tropical Urban Environment: Focus on Bukavu (DR Congo)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides can lead to high impacts in less developed countries, particularly in tropical environments where a combination of intense rainfall, active tectonics, steep topography, and high population density can be found. However, the processes controlling landslide initiation and their evolution through time remains poorly understood. Here we show the relevance of the use of the multi-temporal differential radar interferometric (DInSAR) technique to characterise ground deformations associated with landslides in the rapidly-expanding city of Bukavu (DR Congo). We use 70 COSMO-SkyMed synthetic aperture radar images acquired between March 2015 and April 2016 with a mean revisiting time of eight days to produce ground deformation rate maps and displacement time series using the small baseline subset approach. We find that various landslide processes of different ages, mechanisms, and states of activity can be identified. Ground deformations revealed by DInSAR are found consistent with field observations and differential GPS measurements. Our analysis highlights the ability of DInSAR to grasp landslide deformation patterns affecting the complex tropical-urban environment of the city of Bukavu. However, longer time series will be needed to infer landside responses to climate, seismic, and anthropogenic drivers.

TI  - The influence of tumour-derived extracellular vesicles on local and distal metastatic dissemination
T2  - MOLECULAR ASPECTS OF MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key mediators of intercellular communication that have been ignored for decades. Tumour cells benefit from the secretion of vesicles as they can influence the behaviour of neighbouring tumour cells within the tumour microenvironment. Several studies have shown that extracellular vesicles play an active role in pre-metastatic niche formation and importantly, they are involved in the metastatic organotropism of different tumour types. Tumour-derived EVs carry and transfer molecules to recipient cells, modifying their behaviour through a process defined as "EV-driven education". EVs favour metastasis to sentinel lymph nodes and distal organs by reinforcing angiogenesis, inflammation and lymphangiogenesis. Hence, in this review we will summarize the main mechanisms by which tumour-derived EVs regulate lymph node and distal organ metastasis. Moreover, since some cancers metastasize through the lymphatic system, we will discuss recent discoveries about the presence and function of tumour EVs in the lymph. Finally, we will address the potential value of tumour EVs as prognostic biomarkers in liquid biopsies, specially blood and lymphatic fluid, and the use of these tools as early detectors of metastases.

TI  - Theology as a language for mission: on claiming <i>incognito</i> contributions from beyond the discipline
T2  - MISSIOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Mission and theology are intimately related. This might not have seemed so obvious in the nineteenth century when practical considerations were paramount, but it was growing clearer in the twentieth as complex interactions among denominations and with other world religions required more careful reflection. David Bosch duly notes the trend, calling it Mission as Theology, the twelfth element of An Emerging Ecumenical Missionary Paradigm (Transforming Mission, 489-498). The question is whether this trend has found its fulfillment. A certain narrowness of vision persists in missiological conversations, which risks neglecting mission-worthy insights from theologians and exegetes outside the field strictly defined. Unless theologians identify themselves publicly as missiologists or their subject matter as missiologically related, they risk not being noticed by the missiological community. Two examples of this will be noted in this article: systematic theologian Gerhard Forde who rarely talks overtly of mission but makes a passionate contribution towards its effective practice; and New Testament professor Roy Harrisville of modest experience in overseas mission who probes a worldview-rupturing effect of Christ pertinent to any interfaith dialogue. The need for a mechanism for the fulfillment of the trend Bosch noted will be argued, and some possibilities proposed.

TI  - A quantitative analysis of tumour characteristics in breast cancer patients with extranodal extension in non-sentinel nodes
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The presence of extranodal extension (ENE) is well documented as a predictor of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis. The ACOSOG Z0011 trial (2011) concluded that patients who satisfy criteria including the absence of sentinel lymph node (SLN) ENE can forgo axillary clearance (AC). Currently there are no studies analysing the rate of ENE in NSLN metastasis in which the sentinel node was positive but had no ENE. Determining this incidence will help determine if current paradigms are resulting in residual ENE in NSLN metastasis by forgoing AC based on the Z0011 trial..Methods: This study determined incidence of ENE at NSLN metastasis in patients with a positive SLN biopsy without ENE in 162 symptomatic breast cancer patients who underwent AC between 2009 and 2014 at Cork University Hospital Breast Cancer Service, a teaching hospital of University College Cork.Results: Of 965 sentinel node biopsies performed 251 were identified as SLN positive, 162 (64.5%) underwent further AC. Of the 162 patients, 56.8% (92/162) were positive for ENE at SLN, of these 57.6% (53/92) had NSLN metastasis versus 17.1% (12/70) in the ENE-negative group (chi(2) test; P < 0.001). On adjusted analysis, ENE at the SLN was a significant predictor of NSLN metastasis (odds ratio [OR] 8.63; 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.26-22.86; P < 0.001). The incidence of NSLN-ENE in patients without SLN-ENE was 1/70 (1.4%) compared with 33.7% (31/92) in patients who had ENE at the SLN (chi(2) test; P < 0.001).Conclusion: ENE at the SLN is an independent predictor of NSLN involvement; its absence significantly reduces the likelihood of ENE in NSLN metastasis..

TI  - Intestinal Intraepithelial Lymphocytes: Sentinels of the Mucosal Barrier
T2  - TRENDS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) are a large and diverse population of lymphoid cells that reside between the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) that form the intestinal mucosal barrier. Although IEL biology has traditionally focused on T cells, recent studies have identified several subsets of T cell receptor (TCR)-negative IELs with intriguing properties. New insight into the development, homeostasis, and functions of distinct IEL subsets has recently been provided. Additional studies have revealed intricate interactions between different IEL subsets, reciprocal interactions between IELs and IECs, and communication of IELs with immune cells that reside outside the intestinal epithelium. We review here sentinel functions of IELs in the maintenance of the mucosal barrier integrity, as well as how dysregulated IEL responses can contribute to pathology.

TI  - The expression of neotectonics in the Pantanal da Nhecolandia, State of Mato Grosso do Sul - Brazil
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pantanal da Nhecolandia is one of the most well-preserved areas in the State of Mato Grosso do Sul. Located in the southern part of the Taquari River megafan, it is in tectonic contact with the fault escarpments of the Maracaju-Campo Grande plateaus to the east and with the fault escarpments of the Bodoquena plateau to the west, which continue to north. To the south and to the north, the limits are marked respectively by the lineaments of the Negro and Taquari Rivers. Nhecolandia is characterized by the existence of at least 17,631 lagoons, 17,050 (96.70 %) of which are of fresh water (baias) and 577 (3.3 %) of salty water (salinas). Studies based on (Landsat) satellite images and use of free software (QGIS, version 2.8.3) and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) revealed that the major axes of the lagoons are aligned along two directions, NE (62.49 %) and NW (37.51 %), with modes concentrated between N30-40E and N30-40W, suggesting in both cases the role played by tectonic control (neotectonics) in their formation. Evidences of fluvial origin are presented for these groups of lagoons, as well as for their tectonic alignment.

TI  - The Prognostic Relevance of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastases Assessed by PHGR1 mRNA Quantification in Stage I to III Colon Cancer
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Regional lymph node (LN) metastasis is a strong and well-established prognostic factor in colon cancer, and recent data suggest a prognostic value of detecting micrometastases and isolated tumor cells in regional LNs. The aim of the study was to investigate the clinical relevance of detecting sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases in colon cancer patients by measuring the novel metastasis marker PHGR1 mRNA.METHODS: Using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, we measured PHGR1 mRNA levels in SLNs and primary tumors from 206 patients surgically treated for stage I to III colon cancer and 52 normal LNs from patients undergoing surgery for benign colon diseases. The prognostic impact of these findings was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional-hazards regression.RESULTS: Compared to normal LNs, elevated PHGR1 mRNA levels were detected in SLNs from 56 (89%) of the 63 patients with pN+ disease. Furthermore, 68 (48%) of the 143 node-negative (pN0) patients had elevated PHGR1 mRNA levels in SLNs, suggesting occult metastases. With a median follow-up of 7.2 years, a significantly shorter recurrence-free (P=. 005) and disease-specific (P=. 02) survival was observed in patients with elevated PHGR1 mRNA levels in SLNs. Multivariable modeling showed that the SLN PHGR1 mRNA level was an independent prognostic factor. However, when the survival analyses were restricted to pN0 patients, no significant prognostic information was found.CONCLUSION: Measuring PHGR1 mRNA in SLNs provided independent prognostic information on operable colon cancer patients but not in the pN0 subgroup.

TI  - Additional Nodal Disease Prediction in Breast Cancer with Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis Based on Clinicopathological Features
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The standard-of-care in breast cancer (BC) with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis includes complete axillary lymph node dissection (ALND); however, almost half of such cases have no further tumor burden. This study aimed to assess the clinicopathological factors that predict non-SLN metastasis to define subgroups of SLN-positive patients in whom the axilla may be staged by SLN biopsy alone, while avoiding unnecessary overtreatment. Patients and Methods: The records of 191 patients with histologically-proven primary BC who underwent a positive (SLN) biopsy between 2005 and 2017 were reviewed. Patients with at least one tumor-involved SLN who underwent completion ALND were enrolled. Demographic and clinicopathological characteristics, including age, primary tumor size and histological grade, lymphovascular invasion, ratio of positive SLNs to the harvested SLNs, SLN metastasis size, and molecular subtype classification according to immunohistochemical biomarker status [estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)], were evaluated. Data were collected retrospectively and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney and Chi-square tests (statistical significance: p<0.05). Results: The incidence of non-SLN metastasis associated with positive SLN was 48.6% (93/191). The risk of additional nodal spread correlated with high sentinel nodal ratio >0.67 [odds ratio (OR)=2.55, p=0.032], luminal BC subtype (OR=2.67, p=0.06), HER2 overexpression (OR=0.4, p=0.016), and ER(+)PR(-)HER2(-) profile (OR=2.95, p=0.027). There was a tendency (statistically insignificant; p>0.05) toward higher incidence of non SLN metastasis with increasing age and histological grade, which could be attributed to the small sample size. Conclusion: According to this study, sentinel nodal ratio and BC subtypes as per ER, PR, and HER2 status significantly predicted the likelihood of additional lymphatic involvement. Validation of these parameters in prospective studies is indicated, and may help individualize treatment modalities.

TI  - Anthropogenic Pressure and Landscape Dynamics in the Ivoirian Forest Area in the Meagui Region
T2  - Tropicultura
M3  - Article
AB  - In Cote d'lvoire, population density increased from 8 inhabitants/km(2) in 1950 to 71 inhabitants/km(2) in 2014. The population growth impulse strong dynamics of settlement and generated an increase of the cultivated surfaces. To visualize these dynamics in the area of Meagui, a diachronic study was realized on settlement and landscape on a transect from Meagui town (East) to National Park of Tai (West), covering a surface of 233 km(2). The combination of field information and analysis of Landsat satellite imagery taken at different dates (1986, 2002 and 2014) allowed to discriminate settlement dynamics and land-use patterns. From 6 units of settlements, identified in the eastern part of the zone in the early 1975s, the number was increased to 489 in 2016. In the same time, the forest, which occupied 40% of the area studied in 1986, had almost disappeared in 2014, in favor of perennial crops (more than 90%). The total population density is estimated at 416 inhabitants/km(2), i.e 6 times most important than the national density. These results show how important the population/resource problem is in Cote d'lvoire.

TI  - River discharge estimation under uncertainty from synthetic SWOT-type observations using variational data assimilation
T2  - HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU
M3  - Article
AB  - Variational data assimilation is used for discharge estimation for the Garonne River downstream reach, using the 1D full Saint-Venant hydraulic model SIC2. Based on water surface elevation observations with the level of noise expected for the forthcoming Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission, discharge estimation problem under uncertainty in the bathymetry and the friction has been considered. Two observation sampling periods has been tested, with the purpose of investigating the influence of the temporal frequency of observations. We emphasize that the temporal sampling frequency should be consistent with the characteristic (travel) time of the dynamical system, in which case the discharge is successfully estimated (rRMSE = 4.6%). Larger temporal sampling intervals require complementary information given by a-priori information on discharge or combined in-situ and remote sensing data assimilation. Simultaneous estimation of discharge and the spatially distributed functions may lead to the equifinality issue. In this case, the estimates of the bathymetry and the friction only help to achieve a better estimation quality of discharge, but may not be usable for subsequent experiments.

TI  - Brewster Angle Damping Observed in the TerraSAR-X Synthetic Aperture Radar Images of Man-Made Targets
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter shows the phenomena of Brewster angle damping and its implication observed in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of concrete constructions, such as a bridge and seawalls over the sea. The Fresnel reflection coefficient of concrete material is close to zero at the Brewster angle for X-band V-polarization microwave. The TerraSAR-X images of Tokyo Bay, Japan, at small incidence angles (20.1 degrees-21.4 degrees) showed strong double-bounce reflection between the sea surface and coastal structure with HH-polarization, whereas very little radar backscatter was observed with VV-polarization. The same little radar backscatter was seen in the images of concrete walls on ground and swamp areas covered with reeds. This effect is illustrated with HH/VV intensity and phase difference images, and ground survey data; its implication is also suggested for a better understanding of polarimetric SAR images.

TI  - Why and How Do We Study Sediment Transport? Focus on Coastal Zones and Ongoing Methods
T2  - WATER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Scientific research on sediment dynamics in the coastal zone and along the littoral zone has evolved considerably over the last four decades. It benefits from a technological revolution that provides the community with cheaper or free tools for in situ study (e.g., sensors, gliders), remote sensing (satellite data, video cameras, drones) or modelling (open source models). These changes favour the transfer of developed methods to monitoring and management services. On the other hand, scientific research is increasingly targeted by public authorities towards finalized studies in relation to societal issues. Shoreline vulnerability is an object of concern that grows after each marine submersion or intense erosion event. Thus, during the last four decades, the production of knowledge on coastal sediment dynamics has evolved considerably, and is in tune with the needs of society. This editorial aims at synthesizing the current revolution in the scientific research related to coastal and littoral hydrosedimentary dynamics, putting into perspective connections between coasts and other geomorphological entities concerned by sediment transport, showing the links between many fragmented approaches of the topic, and introducing the papers published in the special issue of Water on "Sediment transport in coastal waters".

TI  - Enhanced surveillance for Rift Valley Fever in livestock during El Nino rains and threat of RVF outbreak, Kenya, 2015-2016
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn mid-2015, the United States' Pandemic Prediction and Forecasting Science and Technical Working Group of the National Science and Technology Council, Food and Agriculture Organization Emergency Prevention Systems, and Kenya Meteorological Department issued an alert predicting a high possibility of El-Nino rainfall and Rift Valley Fever (RVF) epidemic in Eastern Africa.Methodology/Principal findingsIn response to the alert, the Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services (KDVS) carried out an enhanced syndromic surveillance system between November 2015 and February 2016, targeting 22 RVF high-risk counties in the country as identified previously through risk mapping. The surveillance collected data on RVF-associated syndromes in cattle, sheep, goats, and camels from >1100 farmers through 66 surveillance officers. During the 14-week surveillance period, the KDVS received 10,958 reports from participating farmers and surveillance officers, of which 362 (3.3%) had at least one syndrome. The reported syndromes included 196 (54.1%) deaths in young livestock, 133 (36.7%) abortions, and 33 (9.1%) hemorrhagic diseases, with most occurring in November and December, the period of heaviest rainfall. Of the 69 herds that met the suspect RVF herd definition (abortion in flooded area), 24 (34.8%) were defined as probable (abortions, mortalities in the young ones, and/or hemorrhagic signs) but none were confirmed.Conclusion/SignificanceThis surveillance activity served as an early warning system that could detect RVF disease in animals before spillover to humans. It was also an excellent pilot for designing and implementing syndromic surveillance in animals in the country, which is now being rolled out using a mobile phone-based data reporting technology as part of the global health security system.

TI  - A novel cross-satellite based assessment of the spatio-temporal development of a cyanobacterial hatinful algal bloom
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - As the frequency of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) become more common in recreational lakes and water supply reservoirs, demand for rapid detection and temporal monitoring will be imminent for effective management. The goal of this study was to demonstrate a novel and potentially operational cross satellite based protocol for synoptic monitoring of rapidly evolving and increasingly common CyanoHABs in inland waters. The analysis involved a novel way to cross-calibrate a chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) detection model for the Landsat-8 OLI sensor from the relationship between the normalized difference chlorophyll index and the floating algal index derived from Sentinel-2A on a coinciding overpass date during the summer CyanoHAB bloom in Utah Lake. This aided in the construction of a time-series phenology of the Utah Lake CyanoHAB event. Spatio-temporal cyanobacterial density maps from both Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 sensors revealed that the bloom started in the first week of July 2016 (July 3rd, mean cell count: 9163 cells/ma reached peak in mid July (July 15th, mean cell count: 108176 cells/ma and reduced in August (August 24th, mean cell count: 9145 cells/Ina Analysis of physical and meteorological factors suggested a complex interaction between landscape processes (high surface runoff), climatic conditions (high temperature, high rainfall followed by negligible rainfall, stable wind), and water quality (low water level, high Chl-a) which created a supportive environment for triggering these blooms in Utah Lake. This cross satellite based monitoring methods can be a great tool for regular monitoring and will reduce the budget cost for monitoring and predicting CyanoHABs in large lakes.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a precursor study for the upcoming combined Earth Gravitational Model 2020 (EGM2020), the Experimental Gravity Field Model XGM2016, parameterized as a spherical harmonic series up to degree and order 719, is computed. XGM2016 shares the same combination methodology as its predecessor model GOCO05c (Fecher et al. in Surv Geophys 38(3): 571-590, 2017. doi: 10.1007/ s10712-016-9406-y). The main difference between these models is that XGM2016 is supported by an improved terrestrial data set of 15 x15 gravity anomaly area-means provided by the United States National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), resulting in significant upgrades compared to existing combined gravity field models, especially in continental areas such as South America, Africa, parts of Asia, and Antarctica. A combination strategy of relative regional weighting provides for improved performance in near-coastal ocean regions, including regions where the altimetric data are mostly unchanged from previous models. Comparing cumulative height anomalies, from both EGM2008 and XGM2016 at degree/order 719, yields differences of 26 cm in Africa and 40 cm in South America. These differences result from including additional information of satellite data, as well as from the improved ground data in these regions. XGM2016 also yields a smoother Mean Dynamic Topography with significantly reduced artifacts, which indicates an improved modeling of the ocean areas.

TI  - Estimating Above-Ground Biomass in Sub-Tropical Buffer Zone Community Forests, Nepal, Using Sentinel 2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessment of above-ground biomass (AGB) is important for the sustainable management of forests, especially buffer zone (areas within the protected area, where restrictions are placed upon resource use and special measure are undertaken to intensify the conservation value of protected area) areas with a high dependence on forest products. This study presents a new AGB estimation method and demonstrates the potential of medium-resolution Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data application as an alternative to hyperspectral data in inaccessible regions. Sentinel-2 performance was evaluated for a buffer zone community forest in Parsa National Park, Nepal, using field-based AGB as a dependent variable, as well as spectral band values and spectral-derived vegetation indices as independent variables in the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The 10-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate model effectiveness. The effect of the input variable number on AGB prediction was also investigated. The model using all extracted spectral information plus all derived spectral vegetation indices provided better AGB estimates (R-2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 25.57 t ha(-1)). Incorporating the optimal subset of key variables did not improve model variance but reduced the error slightly. This result is explained by the technically-advanced nature of Sentinel-2, which includes fine spatial resolution (10, 20 m) and strategically-positioned bands (red-edge), conducted in flat topography with an advanced machine learning algorithm. However, assessing its transferability to other forest types with varying altitude would enable future performance and interpretability assessments of Sentinel-2.

TI  - Assessing the Spatial and Occupation Dynamics of the Brazilian Pasturelands Based on the Automated Classification of MODIS Images from 2000 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The pasturelands areas of Brazil constitute an important asset for the country, as the main food source for the world's largest commercial herd, representing the largest stock of open land in the country, occupying similar to 21% of the national territory. Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of these areas is of fundamental importance for the goal of promoting improved territorial governance, emission mitigation and productivity gains. To this effect, this study mapped, through objective criteria and automatic classification methods (Random Forest) applied to MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) images, the totality of the Brazilian pastures between 2000 and 2016. Based on 90 spectro-temporal metrics derived from the Red, NIR and SWIRl bands and distinct vegetation indices, distributed between dry and wet seasons, a total of 17 pasture maps with an approximate overall accuracy of 80% were produced with cloud-computing (Google Earth Engine). During this period, the pasture area varied from -152 (2000) to -179 (2016) million hectares. This expansion pattern was consistent with the bovine herd variation and mostly occurred in the Amazon, which increased its total pasture area by -15 million hectares between 2000 and 2005, while the Cerrado, Caatinga and Pantanal biomes showed an increase of -8 million hectares in this same period. The Atlantic Forest was the only biome in which there was a retraction of pasture areas throughout this series. In general, the results of this study suggest the existence of two relevant moments for the Brazilian pasture land uses. The first, strongly supported by the opening of new grazing areas, prevailed between 2000 and 2005 and mostly occurred in the Deforestation Arc and in the Matopiba regions. From 2006 on, the total pasture area in Brazil showed a trend towards stabilization, indicating a slight intensification of livestock activity in recent years.

TI  - Impacts of climate, disturbance and topography on distribution of herbaceous cover in Southern California chaparral: Insights from a remote-sensing method
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: While chaparral communities have historically been considered resistant to invasion and type conversion into grasslands, interacting global changes such as increased drought and anthropogenic disturbance may have reduced this resistance. Existing monitoring methods are not well-suited to evaluate the distribution of invasive herbs and grasses within chaparral at regional scales. In this study, we determine the extent of invasions by forbs and grasses into formerly chaparral vegetation and evaluate contributions of moisture, disturbance and anthropogenic activity and topography to the distribution of herbaceous cover throughout chaparral-dominated communities.Location: The Angeles National Forest (ANF), California, USA.Methods: We developed a remote-sensing method to estimate the distribution of herbaceous cover within chaparral by leveraging intra-annual phenological differences in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) between herbaceous forbs and grasses and evergreen shrublands using Landsat remote-sensing imagery. The distribution of herbaceous cover was then related to multiple spatially explicit variables describing individual and interactive effects of local moisture availability and anthropogenic disturbance.Results: Herbaceous cover represents approximately 31% of the ANF within the elevation range typically dominated by chaparral. Disturbance-related and anthropogenic factors explained 17% of observed variation, while differences in moisture availability explained 47% of observed variation in herbaceous cover and were associated with increased invasive cover.Main conclusions: Landscapes historically dominated by chaparral may exhibit high degrees of herbaceous cover. While fire frequency and other anthropogenic disturbances are likely the primary catalyst for invasion of chaparral by herbaceous species, this study shows that moisture availability is a more important factor in determining which locations are successfully invaded. These results indicate that chaparral vulnerability to invasion in southern California may increase in the next century due to reduced precipitation associated with projected climate change.

TI  - Accuracy Evaluation of Daily-gridded ASCAT Satellite Data Around the Korean Peninsula
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to access the accuracy of the gridded daily Advanced Scatterometer (hereafter DASCAT) ocean surface wind data in the surrounding of Korea, the DASCAT was compared with the wind data from buoys. In addition, the reanalysis data for wind at 10 m provided by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF, hereafter ECMWF), National Centers for Environmental Prediction and National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR, hereafter NCEP), Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications -2 (MERRA-2, hereafter MERRA) were compared and analyzed. As a result, the RMSE of DASCAT for the actual wind speed is about 3 m/s. The zonal components of wind of buoys and the DASCAT have strong correlation more than 0.8 and the meridional components of wind them have lower correlation than that of zonal wind and are the lowest in the Yellow Sea (r=0.7). When the actual wind speed is below 10 m/s, the EMCWF has the highest accuracy, followed by DASCAT, MERRA, and NCEP. However, under the wind speed more than 10 m/s, DASCAT shows the highest accuracy. In the nature of error according to the wind direction, when the zonal wind is strong, all dataset has the error of more than 70 degrees on the average. On the other hand, the RMSE of wind direction was recorded 50 degrees under the strong meridional winds. ECMWF shows the highest accuracy in these results. The RMSE of the wind speed according to the wind direction varied depending on the actual wind direction. Especially, MERRA has the highest RMSE under the westerly and southerly wind condition, while the NCEP has the highest RMSE under the easterly and northerly wind condition.

TI  - Endoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy using indocyanine green-neomannosyl human serum albumin
T2  - LARYNGOSCOPE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to determine the possibility of endoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy of the head and neck region using indocyanine green-neomannosyl human serum albumin (ICG:MSA) and a custom-made intraoperative color-and-fluorescence-merged imaging system (ICFIS).MethodsUsing mouse and rabbit models of tongue cancer, we performed sentinel lymph node biopsy using an ICG:MSA tracer and custom imaging system equipped with an endoscope.ResultsICG:MSA was localized to the cervical lymph node on the ipsilateral side for up to 30 minutes compared to ICG tracer (ICG n=3, IGC:MSA n=3). Detection of sentinel lymph nodes was attempted after injecting ICG:MSA in the mouse tongue cancer model (n=3). During the operation, lymph nodes were easily identified and resected using ICFIS without the aid of other magnifiers. In the rabbit tongue cancer model (n=3), the ICFIS equipped with 30-degree endoscopy was used to confirm the feasibility of endoscopic sentinel lymph node biopsy. The entire sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure was performed using the ICFIS with the 30-degree endoscope. We detected and dissected sentinel lymph nodes in the rabbit model without the other sentinel lymph node detection tools.ConclusionWe confirmed the usefulness of sentinel lymph node biopsy using a near infrared fluorescence technique and endoscopic system. Avoidance of radiation exposure and shine-through phenomena, which are problems of sentinel lymph node biopsy using conventional radioisotopes, are advantages of our surgical technique. By combining the endoscopic system with a sentinel lymph node biopsy procedure, we avoided visible neck scars, which lead to excellent cosmetic outcomes.Level of EvidenceNA.

TI  - A Comparison between Standard and Functional Clustering Methodologies: Application to Agricultural Fields for Yield Pattern Assessment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recognition of spatial patterns within agricultural fields, presenting similar yield potential areas, stable through time, is very important for optimizing agricultural practices. This study proposes the evaluation of different clustering methodologies applied to multispectral satellite time series for retrieving temporally stable (constant) patterns in agricultural fields, related to within-field yield spatial distribution. The ability of different clustering procedures for the recognition and mapping of constant patterns in fields of cereal crops was assessed. Crop vigor patterns, considered to be related to soils characteristics, and possibly indicative of yield potential, were derived by applying the different clustering algorithms to time series of Landsat images acquired on 94 agricultural fields near Rome (Italy). Two different approaches were applied and validated using Landsat 7 and 8 archived imagery. The first approach automatically extracts and calculates for each field of interest (FOI) the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), then exploits the standard K-means clustering algorithm to derive constant patterns at the field level. The second approach applies novel clustering procedures directly to spectral reflectance time series, in particular: (1) standard K-means; (2) functional K-means; (3) multivariate functional principal components clustering analysis; (4) hierarchical clustering. The different approaches were validated through cluster accuracy estimates on a reference set of FOIs for which yield maps were available for some years. Results show that multivariate functional principal components clustering, with an a priori determination of the optimal number of classes for each FOI, provides a better accuracy than those of standard clustering algorithms. The proposed novel functional clustering methodologies are effective and efficient for constant pattern retrieval and can be used for a sustainable management of agricultural fields, depending on farming systems and environmental conditions in different regions.

TI  - Stroke After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Incidence, Definitions, Etiologies and Management Options
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIOTHORACIC AND VASCULAR ANESTHESIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Neurologic complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement are devastating. The etiologies of stroke in this setting are best addressed in an integrated fashion during each phase of the perioperative pathway. The conduct of this triphasic approach will continue to be refined to reduce the stroke risks even further, given the major focus on aspects such as embolic protection devices and valve thrombosis. This neurologic focus in transcatheter aortic valve replacement has transformed the investigational approach to neurologic events in cardiovascular clinical trials, resulting in novel guidelines for the diagnosis and assessment of neurologic injury after cardiovascular interventions.

TI  - Multitemporal Analysis of vegetation change at Chimborazo Reserve as a result of climate change
T2  - ENFOQUE UTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a global problem that affects the state of conservation of ecosystems in all regions of the world; as well as in the Chimborazo Fauna Production Reserve, which is linked to anthropogenic activities inside and outside it, such as the extensive and intensive grazing of sheep and cattle that have caused effects on vegetation and soil given to the consumption of native plants and all ecosystem processes because they are related to each other. The methodology used to achieve optimal discrimination of vegetation change and conservation status is obtained through the application of satellite images LANDSAT 5, LANDSAT 7, orthophotos and aerial photographs from 1962 to 1966 up to 2010 distributed in three periods; using procedures such as supervised classification and the calculation of the Normalized Differential Index of Vegetation. Anthropogenic activity for the period 1962-1966 determines 0.26% and snow is 10.30%, while for the period 2010-2011, the percentage of intervention increases to 9.54% and the snow decreases to 4.46%, evidencing the loss of perpetual snow due to solar radiation.

TI  - Measuring Suspended-Sediment Concentration and Turbidity in the Middle Mississippi and Lower Missouri Rivers Using Landsat Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Middle Mississippi River (MMR) and lower Missouri River (MOR) provide critical navigation waterways, ecological habitat, and flood conveyance. They are also directly linked to processes affecting geomorphic and ecological conditions in the lower MR and Delta. For this study, a method was developed to measure suspended-sediment concentration (SSC) and turbidity along the MMR and the lower MOR using Landsat imagery. Data from nine United States Geological Survey water-quality monitoring stations were used to create a model-development dataset and a model-validation dataset. Concurrent gaging data were identified for available Landsat images to generate the datasets. Surface-reflectance filters were developed to eliminate images with cirrus cloud coverage or vessel traffic. Using the filtered model-development dataset, unique reflectance-SSC and reflectance-turbidity models were developed for three Landsat sensors: Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus, and Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper. Coefficient of determination values for the models ranged from 0.72 to 0.88 for the model-development dataset. The model-validation dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the models and had coefficient of determination values ranging from 0.62 to 0.79.

TI  - Evaluating and monitoring forest fuel treatments using remote sensing applications in Arizona, USA
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of fire suppression across the western United States over the past century has led to dense forests, and when coupled with drought has contributed to an increase in large and destructive wildfires. Forest management efforts aimed at reducing flammable fuels through various fuel treatments can help to restore frequent fire regimes and increase forest resilience. Our research examines how different fuel treatments influenced burn severity and post-fire vegetative stand dynamics on the San Carlos Apache Reservation, in east-central Arizona, U.S.A. Our methods included the use of multitemporal remote sensing data and cloud computing to evaluate burn severity and post-fire vegetation conditions as well as statistical analyses. We investigated how forest thinning, commercial harvesting, prescribed burning, and resource benefit burning (managed wildfire) related to satellite measured burn severity (the difference Normalized Burn Ratio - dNBR) following the 2013 Creek Fire and used spectral measures of post-fire stand dynamics to track changes in land surface characteristics (i.e., brightness, greenness and wetness). We found strong negative relationships between dNBR and post-fire greenness and wetness, and a positive non-linear relationship between dNBR and brightness, with greater variability at higher severities. Fire severity and post-fire surface changes also differed by treatment type. Our results showed harvested and thinned sites that were not treated with prescribed fire had the highest severity fire. When harvesting was followed by a prescribed burn, the sites experienced lower burn severity and reduced post-fire changes in vegetation greenness and wetness. Areas that had previously experienced resource benefit burns had the lowest burn severities and the highest post-fire greenness measurements compared to all other treatments, except for where the prescribed burn had occurred. These results suggest that fire treatments may be most effective at reducing the probability of hazardous fire and increasing post-fire recovery. This research demonstrates the utility of remote sensing and spatial data to inform forest management, and how various fuel treatments can influence burn severity and post-fire vegetation response within ponderosa pine forests across the southwestern U.S.

TI  - Minor contribution of small thaw ponds to the pools of carbon and methane in the inland waters of the permafrost-affected part of the Western Siberian Lowland
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the potential importance of small (< 1000 m(2)) thaw ponds and thermokarst lakes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from inland waters of high latitude and boreal regions, these features have not been fully inventoried and the volume of GHG and carbon in thermokarst lakes remains poorly constrained. This is especially true for the vast Western Siberia Lowland (WSL) which is subject to strong thermokarst activity. We assessed the number of thermokarst lakes and their size distribution for the permafrost-affected WSL territory based on a combination of medium-resolution Landsat-8 images and high-resolution Kanopus-V scenes on 78 test sites across the WSL in a wide range of lake sizes (from 20 to 2 x 10(8) m(2)). The results were in fair agreement with other published data for world lakes including those in circum-polar regions. Based on available measurements of CH4, CO2, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in thermokarst lakes and thaw ponds of the permafrost-affected part of the WSL, we found an inverse relationship between lake size and concentration, with concentrations of GHGs and DOC being highest in small thaw ponds. However, since these small ponds represent only a tiny fraction of the landscape (i.e. similar to 1.5% of the total lake area), their contribution to the total pool of GHG and DOC in inland lentic water of the permafrost-affected part of the WSL is less than 2%. As such, despite high concentrations of DOC and GHG in small ponds, their role in overall C storage can be negated. Ongoing lake drainage due to climate warming and permafrost thaw in the WSL may lead to a decrease in GHG emission potential from inland waters and DOC release from lakes to rivers.

TI  - Multi-Objective Validation of SWAT for Sparsely-Gauged West African River Basins-A Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting freshwater resources is a major concern in West Africa, where large parts of the population depend on rain-fed subsistence agriculture. However, a steady decline in the availability of in-situ measurements of climatic and hydrologic variables makes it difficult to simulate water resource availability with hydrological models. In this study, a modeling framework was set up for sparsely-gauged catchments in West Africa using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), whilst largely relying on remote sensing and reanalysis inputs. The model was calibrated using two different strategies and validated using discharge measurements. New in this study is the use of a multi-objective validation conducted to further investigate the performance of the model, where simulated actual evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and total water storage were evaluated using remote sensing data. Results show that the model performs well (R-2 calibration: 0.52 and 0.51; R-2 validation: 0.63 and 0.61) and the multi-objective validation reveals good agreement between predictions and observations. The study reveals the potential of using remote sensing data in sparsely-gauged catchments, resulting in good performance and providing data for evaluating water balance components that are not usually validated. The modeling framework presented in this study is the basis for future studies, which will address model response to extreme drought and flood events and further examine the coincidence with Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) total water storage retrievals.

T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In northern Brazilian Amazon, the crops, savannahs and rainforests form a complex landscape where land use and land cover (LULC) mapping is difficult. Here, data from the Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Landsat-8 and Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR-2)/ALOS-2 were combined for mapping 17 LULC classes using Random Forest (RF) during the dry season. The potential thematic accuracy of each dataset was assessed and compared with results of the hybrid classification from both datasets. The results showed that the combination of PALSAR-2 HH/HV amplitudes with the reflectance of the six OLI bands produced an overall accuracy of 83% and a Kappa of 0.81, which represented an improvement of 6% in relation to the RF classification derived solely from OLI data. The RF models using OLI multispectral metrics performed better than RF models using PALSAR-2 L-band dual polarization attributes. However, the major contribution of PALSAR-2 in the savannahs was to discriminate low biomass classes such as savannah grassland and wooded savannah.

TI  - Estimation of Consistent Global Microwave Land Surface Emissivity from AMSR-E and AMSR2 Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of passive microwave land surface emissivity (LSE) is crucial for numerical weather prediction model data assimilation, for microwave retrievals of land precipitation and atmospheric profiles, and for a better understanding of land surface and subsurface characteristics. In this study, global instantaneous LSE is estimated for a 9-yr period from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and for a 5-yr period from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) sensors. Estimates of LSE from both sensors were obtained by using an updated algorithm that minimizes the discrepancy between the differences in penetration depths from microwave and infrared remote sensing observations. Concurrent ancillary datasets such as skin temperature from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and profiles of air temperature and humidity from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder are used. The latest collection 6 of MODIS skin temperature is used for the LSE estimation, and the differences between collections 6 and 5 are also comprehensively assessed. Analyses reveal that the differences between these two versions of infrared-based skin temperatures could lead to approximately a 0.015 difference in passive microwave LSE values, especially in arid regions. The comparison of global mean LSE features from the combined use of AMSR-E and AMSR2 with an independent productTool to Estimate Land Surface Emissivity from Microwave to Submillimeter Waves (TELSEM2)shows spatial pattern correlations of order 0.92 at all frequencies. However, there are considerable differences in magnitude between these two LSE estimates, possibly because of differences in incidence angles, frequencies, observation times, and ancillary datasets.

TI  - Performance of 3-D Surface Deformation Estimation for Simultaneous Squinted SAR Acquisitions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper addresses the performance in the retrieval of 3-D mean deformation maps by exploiting simultaneous or quasi-simultaneous squinted synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometric acquisitions in a repeat-pass scenario. In multisatellite or multibeam low earth observation missions, the availability of two (or more) lines of sight (LOSs) allows the simultaneous acquisition of SAR images with different squint angles, hence improving the sensitivity to the north-south component of the deformation. Due to the simultaneity of the acquisitions, the troposphere will be highly correlated and, therefore, will tend to cancel out when performing the differential measurement between the interferograms obtained with the different LOSs, hence resulting in a practically troposphere-free estimation of the along-track deformation measurement. In practice, however, the atmospheric noise in the differential measurement will increase for increasing angular separations. This paper expounds the mathematical framework to derive the performance by properly considering the correlation of the atmospheric delays between the simultaneous acquisitions. To that aim, the hybrid Cramer-Rao bound is exploited making use of the autocorrelation function of the troposphere. Some performance examples are presented in the frame of future spaceborne SAR missions at C and L band.

TI  - Multiple field-based methods to assess the potential impacts of seismic surveys on scallops
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine seismic surveys are an important tool to map geology beneath the seafloor and manage petroleum resources, but they are also a source of underwater noise pollution. A mass mortality of scallops in the Bass Strait, Australia occurred a few months after a marine seismic survey in 2010, and fishing groups were concerned about the potential relationship between the two events. The current study used three field-based methods to investigate the potential impact of marine seismic surveys on scallops in the region: 1) dredging and 2) deployment of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) were undertaken to examine the potential response of two species of scallops (Pecten fumatus, Mimachlamys asperrima) before, two months after, and ten months after a 2015 marine seismic survey; and 3) MODIS satellite data revealed patterns of sea surface temperatures from 2006-2016. Results from the dredging and AUV components show no evidence of scallop mortality attributable to the seismic survey, although sub-lethal effects cannot be excluded. The remote sensing revealed a pronounced thermal spike in the eastern Bass Strait between February and May 2010, overlapping the scallop beds that suffered extensive mortality and coinciding almost exactly with dates of operation for the 2010 seismic survey. The acquisition of in situ data coupled with consideration of commercial seismic arrays meant that results were ecologically realistic, while the paired field-based components (dredging, AUV imagery) provided a failsafe against challenges associated with working wholly in the field. This study expands our knowledge of the potential environmental impacts of marine seismic survey and will inform future applications for marine seismic surveys, as well as the assessment of such applications by regulatory authorities.

TI  - A surface soil moisture mapping service at national (Italian) scale based on Sentinel-1 data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents MULESME, a software designed for the systematic mapping of surface soil moisture using Sentinel-1 SAR data. MULESME implements a multi-temporal algorithm that uses time series of Sentinel-1 data and ancillary data, such as a plant water content map, as inputs. A secondary software module generates the plant water content map from optical data provided by Landsat-8, or Sentinel-2, or MODIS. Each output of MULESME includes another map showing the level of uncertainty of the soil moisture estimates. MULESME was tested by using both synthetic and actual data. The results of the tests showed that root mean square error is in the range between 0.03m(3)/m(3) (synthetic data) and 0.06m(3)/m(3) (actual data) for bare soil. The accuracy decreases in the presence of vegetation (root mean square in the range 0.08e0.12m(3)/m(3)), as expected. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Axillary tumour burden in women with one abnormal node on ultrasound compared to women with multiple abnormal nodes
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AIM: To determine if the number of abnormal nodes seen on preoperative axillary ultrasound (AUS) is a predictor of the number of positive nodes at histology for women with needle-biopsy-proven positive nodes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective multicentre cohort study included consecutive patients with early breast cancer who had needle-biopsy-proven positive nodes on AUS and underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) between October 2015 and July 2016. The number of abnormal nodes at preoperative AUS was recorded by breast radiologists or radiographers.RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-three patients were included in the study. The median age of the women was 62 (range 30-93) years. Fifty-four of the 123 (44%) women had one abnormal node, whereas 69 (56%) had multiple abnormal nodes on AUS. Forty of the 123 (33%) women had two or fewer nodes with metastases at histology after ALND. Tumours <= 20 mm (p< 0.001) and one abnormal node on AUS (p< 0.001) were associated with two or fewer nodes with metastases at ALND. Both remained significant in logistic regression analysis. The likelihood of at least three metastases based on the combination of these two factors had 95% sensitivity (79 of 83), 35% specificity (14 of 40), a negative predictive value of 78% (14 of 18), and a positive predictive value of 75% (79 of 105).CONCLUSION: Among women with needle-biopsy-proven positive nodes, around three in four women (78%) with an invasive tumour <= 2 cm and one abnormal node on AUS have two or fewer positive nodes at ALND. These women are overtreated by upfront ALND and can be offered sentinel node biopsy (SNB). (C) 2017 The Royal College of Radiologists. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - FISHERIES SURVEY ON THE PRESENCE OF SKIPJACK <i>Katsuwonus pelamis</i> IN BONE BAY
T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of skipjack Katsuwonus pelamis is always subject to change depending on the condition of the surrounding watersfavored by the fish. This study gives prediction of the existence of skipjack in the Bone Bay waters by using satellite remote sensing data and an overview of length-weight relationship obtained fromfisheries survey. Satellite remote sensing data such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll-a obtained from the NASA database with a spatial resolution of 4 km and a temporal resolution 8-day composite in Bone Bay waters. Fishery survey data such as position data, the fish catches, the length and weight of skipjack were obtained fishing base from two different locations namely Sinjai and Luwu. Satellite remote sensing data and fisheries survey data (position of the catch) were overlaidto determine the environmental conditions that are favor by skipjack. The results showed that the skipjack mostly found many in the waters with sea surface temperature range between 28.42 degrees C to 30,73 degrees C and with chlorophyll-a concentration between 0.1335 mg/m(3) to 0,2309 mg/m(3). Based on the length-weight relationship, the growth pattern of skipjack were caught in the waters of the Gulf of Bone is allometric negative.

TI  - Mixed phenotype (T/B/myeloid) extramedullary blast crisis as an initial presentation of chronic myelogenous leukemia
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND MOLECULAR PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome generated by the reciprocal translocation t(9,22)(q34;q11). The natural progression of the disease follows a biphasic or triphasic course. Most cases of CML are diagnosed in the chronic phase. Extramedullary blast crisis rarely occurs during the course of CML, and is extremely rare as the initial presentation of CML.Case presentation: Here, we report the case of a 32-year-old female with enlarged neck lymph nodes and fatigue. She was diagnosed with B-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma with possible mixed phenotype (B/myeloid) by right neck lymph node biopsy at an outside hospital. However, review of her peripheral blood smear and her bone marrow aspirate and biopsy showed features consistent with CML, which was confirmed by PCR and karyotyping. An ultrasound-guided right cervical lymph node core biopsy showed a diffuse infiltrate of blasts, near totally replacing the normal lymph node tissue, admixed with some hematopoietic cells including megakaryocytes, erythroid precursors and maturing myeloid cells. By flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry, the blasts expressed CD2, cytoplasmic CD3, CD5, CD7, CD56, TdT, CD10 (weak, subset), CD19 (subset), CD79a, PAX-5 (subset), CD34, CD38, CD117 (subset), HLA-DR (subset), CDIIb, CD13 (subset), CD33 (subset), and weak cytoplasmic myeloperoxidase, without co-expression of surface CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD22, CD14, CD15, CD16 and CD64, consistent with blasts with mixed phenotype (T/B/myeloid). A diagnosis of extramedullary blast crisis of CML was made. Chromosomal analysis performed on the lymph node biopsy tissue revealed multiple numerical and structural abnormalities including the Ph chromosome (46-49,XX,add(1)(p34),add(3)(p25),add (5) (q13),-6,t(9; 22)(q34;q11.2), + 10,-15,add (17) (p11.2), + 19, + der(22)t(9;22), + mar [cp8]). After completion of one cycle of combined chemotherapy plus dasatinib treatment, she was transferred to City of Hope National Cancer Institute for bone marrow transplantation.Discussion and conclusion: Diagnosis of extramedullary blast crisis should be suspected in patients with leukocytosis and extramedullary blast proliferation. In this case study, we diagnosed extramedullary blast crisis accompanied by chronic phase of CML in the bone marrow. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of extramedullary blast crisis as the initial presentation of CML with T/B/myeloid mixed phenotype. Other unusual features associated with this case are also discussed.

TI  - Towards automatic SAR-optical stereogrammetry over urban areas using very high resolution imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we discuss the potential and challenges regarding SAR-optical stereogrammetry for urban areas, using very-high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery. Since we do this mainly from a geometrical point of view, we first analyze the height reconstruction accuracy to be expected for different stereogrammetric configurations. Then, we propose a strategy for simultaneous tie point matching and 3D reconstruction, which exploits an epipolar-like search window constraint. To drive the matching and ensure some robustness, we combine different established hand-crafted similarity measures. For the experiments, we use real test data acquired by the Worldview-2, TerraSAR-X and MEMPHIS sensors. Our results show that SAR-optical stereogrammetry using VHR imagery is generally feasible with 3D positioning accuracies in the meter-domain, although the matching of these strongly hetereogeneous multi-sensor data remains very challenging.

TI  - Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter air pollution and type 2 diabetes mellitus in elderly: A cohort study in Hong Kong
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Evidence for the link between long-term air pollution exposure and occurrence of diabetes is limited and the results are mixed.Objectives: We aimed to assess the association of long-term residential exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) with the prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM).Methods: This is a prospective cohort study. We studied 61,447 participants of the Chinese Elderly Health Services cohort in Hong Kong enrolled 1998-2001 and followed participants without DM at baseline to 31 December 2010 to ascertain the first hospital admissions for type 2 DM. Yearly mean residential PM2.5 exposure was predicted based on satellite data. Logistic regression and time-varying Cox regression model were used to evaluate the prevalence and incidence risk of DM associated with PM2.5 while adjusting for potential individual and neighborhood confounders.Results: There were 61,447 participants included in the study of prevalent DM, and in 53,905 participants without DM at baseline we studied incident type 2 DM. Over a mean follow-up of 9.8 years, we ascertained 806 incident cases of type 2 DM. After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio (OR) for every interquartile range (3.2 mu g/m(3)) increase of PM2.5 concentration was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.11) for prevalent DM, while the corresponding hazard ratio (HR) was 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05-1.25) for incident type 2 DM.Conclusions: Long-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 may increase the risk of both prevalence and incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in Hong Kong elderly population.

TI  - Soil Moisture Investigation Utilizing Machine Learning Approach Based Experimental Data and Landsat5-TM Images: A Case Study in the Mega City Beijing
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics of soil moisture content (SMC) distribution in an area are necessarily analyzed for the design and construction of sponge cities. Combining remote sensing data with experimental data, this paper establishes a machine learning model to reveal the characteristics of SMC. Taking Beijing as an example, the SMC distribution was obtained and the characteristics were analyzed after training and validating. When comparing different machine learning methods, it can be concluded that the support vector classifier (SVC) method trained with remote sensing and grayscale data can achieve the highest accuracy (76.69%). The calculation results show that the districts with the highest and lowest SMC value are Xicheng District (19.94%) and Daxing District (11.04%), respectively, in Beijing. The mean SMC value of Beijing is 15.65%. The SMC distribution characteristic in Beijing shows that the soil in the west and north are relatively wet, while the soil in the east and south are relatively dry. Therefore, it is suggested that the timely monitoring of the SMC of vegetation covered areas at the north and west should be carried out. Water conservation facilities also need to be established with the development of city constructions in the south and east areas.

TI  - A Method of Retrieving BRDF from Surface-Reflected Radiance Using Decoupling of Atmospheric Radiative Transfer and Surface Reflection
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bi-directional reflection distribution function (BRDF) defines anisotropy of the surface reflection. It is required to specify the boundary condition for radiative transfer (RT) modeling used in aerosol retrievals, cloud retrievals, atmospheric modeling, and other applications. Ground based measurements of reflected radiance draw increasing attention as a source of information about anisotropy of surface reflection. Derivation of BRDF from surface radiance requires atmospheric correction. This study develops a new method of retrieving BRDF on its whole domain, making it immediately suitable for further atmospheric RT modeling applications. The method is based on the integral equation relating surface-reflected radiance, BRDF, and solutions of two auxiliary atmosphere-only RT problems. The method requires kernel-based BRDF. The weights of the kernels are obtained with a quickly converging iterative procedure. RT modeling has to be done only one time before the start of iterative process.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), a state-of-the-art topo-hydrological index, has been increasingly used in geo-environmental studies. It describes the local normalized drainage potential of a large region. To date, a trial and error and cumbersome multistep process has been used to obtain the HAND index which does not result in an optimal threshold for contributing area. This study aims at developing a user-friendly geographic information system (GIS) tool, HANDTool, using the Python programming language. We successfully applied the tool for the Chehel-Chai watershed, Iran and the random forest algorithm was used to model groundwater potential. Results revealed that the HAND index made a great contribution to groundwater potential modeling among the other conditioning factors. This tool gives valuable insights on the soil-topography-moisture shared interactions and vegetation condition, especially in ungauged watersheds. (c) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spectral Signature Characterization and Remote Mapping of Oman Exotic Limestones for Industrial Rock Resource Assessment
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study demonstrates the capability of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) sensor data to remotely map industrial carbonate rocks known as the ;Oman exotics' of the Sultanate of Oman. We measured reflectance spectra of marble using a PIMA (TM) spectrometer and studied their spectral absorptions distinguishing calcite from spectral absorptions of dolomite of the same region. The spectral band 8 of ASTER is processed by simple decorrelation stretch image processing method to map the exotic limestone rock of the Nakhl region, Oman. Results showed that carbonate rocks displayed distinctive tonal variation on the image. A comparative study with the spectral band 7 of Landsat 7 (ETM+) does not discriminate the calcite-bearing marbles and associated carbonate formations in the studied area. ASTER data were also processed by the application of the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Spectral Information Divergence (SID) image classification algorithms. The results were assessed by the production of a confusion matrix. The study shows the capability of visible near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of the ASTER sensor and potential of the image processing methods to remotely identify industrial carbonate rocks and we recommend this technique to similar regions of the world.

TI  - Identifying Drivers and Spatial Patterns of Deforestation in the Rio Grande Basin, Colombia
T2  - JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the spatial patterns and drivers of deforestation is a critical task in geographic research. In addition to mapping deforestation, it's important to determine the statistical effects of the spatial configuration of tropical landscapes on current deforestation trends. To accurately model drivers of deforestation, it is important to take into account the spatial structure of data (i.e., whether or not observed deforestation is spatially clustered). We calculated deforestation rates at the village level in the Rio Grande Basin, Colombia, using land cover information derived from Landsat TM/ETM satellite imagery (1986-2012). We used econometric models to understand the deforestation patterns using a set of socioeconomic, biophysical, and accessibility variables. Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis showed the existence of globally and locally positive spatial autocorrelation. The Spatial Lag Model, which considers spatial data autocorrelation, explained most of the variability in deforestation patterns. The main drivers of deforestation for the region over a twenty-six-year period were annual average temperature, population density, road density, and distance to main rivers. Results show that observed deforestation is closely related to dairy farming; this is due to the long history of human intervention in the watershed. We found some forest recovery in recent years; however, forest loss continues to be the dominant way land is changing in Andean landscapes, with positive spatial interdependencies. Identifying drivers of deforestation using methods that account for spatial autocorrelation can inform national conservation policies and programs aimed at providing ecosystem services.

T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives Cannabis is a widely used illicit substance that has been associated with acute injuries. This study seeks to provide near real-time injury estimates related to cannabis and other substance use from the electronic Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program (eCHIRPP) database.Methods Data from the eCHIRPP database, years 2011 to 2016, were analyzed via data mining, descriptive, logistic regression, and sensitivity analyses. Drug use trends over time for cannabis and/or other substances (alcohol, illicit drugs, and medications) were assessed. Descriptive statistics (intent, external cause, and nature of injury) and proportionate injury ratios (PIR) associated with cannabis use are presented.Results Cannabis use was observed in 184 cases/100,000 eCHIRPP cases, and related injuries were mostly identified as unintentional (66.8%). Poisoning (68.5%) and intoxication (69.4%) were the external cause and nature of injury most associated with these events, and hospitalization was recorded for 14.3% of cases. Per 100,000 eCHIRPP cases, cannabis was used alone in 72.4 cases, and in combination with alcohol, illicit drugs, or medications in 74.6 cases, 11.3 cases, and 7.9 cases, respectively. Relative to non-use, the PIR of hospitalization was not significant for cannabis-only users of either sex (males: PIR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6-1.7, females: PIR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.5-1.7).Conclusion Cannabis use injuries are rare, but can occur when cannabis is used with or without other substances. As Canada considers legislative changes, our finding of cases related to unintentional injury, poisoning, and intoxication suggests areas that might benefit from health literacy efforts.

TI  - Impact of Assimilation of Sea-Ice Surface Temperatures on a Coupled Ocean and Sea-Ice Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - We establish a methodology for assimilating satellite observations of ice surface temperature (IST) into a coupled ocean and sea-ice model. The method corrects the 2 m air temperature based on the difference between the modeled and the observed IST. Thus the correction includes biases in the surface forcing and the ability of the model to convert incoming parameters at the surface to a net heat flux. A multisensor, daily, gap-free surface temperature analysis has been constructed over the Arctic region. This study revealed challenges estimating the ground truth based on buoys measuring IST, as the quality of the measurement varied from buoy to buoy. With these precautions we find a cold temperature bias in the remotely sensed data, and a warm bias in the modeled data relative to ice mounted buoy temperatures, prior to assimilation. As a consequence, this study weighted the modeled IST and the observed IST equally in the correction. The impact of IST was determined for experiments with and without the assimilation of IST and sea-ice concentration. We find that assimilation of remotely sensed data results in a cooling of IST, which improves the timing of the snow melt onset. The improved snow cover in spring is only based on observations from one buoy, thus additional good quality observations could strengthen the conclusions. The ice cover and the sea-ice thickness are increased, primarily in the experiment without sea-ice concentration assimilation.

TI  - Prediction of vegetation dynamics using NDVI time series data and LSTM
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and analyzing the changes in vegetation cover is very important in several aspects including climatic changes, water budget, ecological balance and specially to undertake necessary conservation measures. The concept of neural network has gained much significance in the analysis of vegetation dynamics using remote sensing satellite data. In the current study an attempt has been made to predict the vegetation dynamics using MODIS NDVI time series data sets and long short term memory network, an advanced technique adapted from the artificial neural network. The dataset of 861 NDVI images from January 2000 to June 2016 is used for making the time series. The data is segregated into three sets which comprises of training set (70%), validation set (20%), and testing set (10%). To check the reliability of the experiment we have finalised two different regions after extensive research for investigation. These include different terrains in the Great Nicobar Islands, one region along the coast where vegetation has severe ecological damage due to 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the other, an interior region which remained imperturbable during the tsunami. Long short term memory network, an advanced neural network is trained with these NDVI values for both the regions separately to predict the future vegetation dynamics. To measure the accuracy of the LSTM network, root mean square error is calculated. The resulting plots from both the experiments indicate that the long short-term memory neural network follows the series in addition to coinciding with the required time series. Also, an unanticipated change in the trend of the NDVI series were well adapted by the network and was able to predict the future NDVI values with good accuracy maintaining RMSE less than 0.03 without providing any supplementary data. By adopting the prescribed method in the paper, anticipation of vegetation changes can be done accurately much ahead of time and take proactive measures accordingly to safeguard and improve the vegetation in any area.

TI  - Evaluation of automatic drainage extraction thresholds using ASTER GDEM and Cartosat-1 DEM: A case study from basaltic terrain of Central India
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the study, the digital elevation models from ASTER GDEM and Cartosat-1 of 30 m resolution were used to evaluate the thresholds in automatic extraction of stream network at six thresholds of 0.05 km(2), 0.125 km(2), 0.25 km(2), 0.50 km(2), 1.0 km(2) and 2.0 km(2) in Neri watershed in basaltic terrain of Central India. At stream thresholds of 0.05 km(2), Cartosat-1 DEM shows higher channel initiation points (150) than ASTER (127). As we increase the stream thresholds from 0.05 km(2) to 2.0 km(2), the channel initiation points are consistently decreased in two input DEMs. The correlation coefficient R-2 between the drainage area thresholds and stream length for ASTER and Cartosat-1 DEM shows 0.94 and 0.92, respectively. The comparative evaluation of morphometric indices shows that threshold of 0.05 km(2) is found to be optimum to obtain the finer drainage networks particularly from Cartosat-1 DEM, when compare to the ASTER GDEM of same resolution.

TI  - LANDSCAPE PATTERN AND CONNECTIVITY IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTED AREAS IN KUALA LUMPUR CONURBATION FOR SUSTAINABLE URBAN PLANNING
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas in the cities play an important role for nature conservation and sustainable urban planning. In many occasions however development activities and urban planning ignore this ecological aspect. For sustainable urban planning, understanding the landscape pattern and connectivity importance of urban protected areas and its surroundings are important. Therefore, this study examined: i) landscape pattern changes of three protected areas-Bukit Sungai Puteh, Bukit Nenas and KL Golf Course and ii) their connectivity importance for biodiversity conservation of Kuala Lumpur conurbation. In this study three satellite images (Landsat TM 30 m resolution) of the study areas in 1988, 1996 and 2005 were processed and analyzed using ERDAS Imagine 9.2 and ArcGIS 9.3 to develop land use/ land cover maps of the study areas in the three years. Landscape pattern of the maps was analyzed using landscape metrics calculated by Vector Based Landscape Analysis Tools Extension (vLATE) software. Conefor Sensinode 2.2 (CS22) software was used to measure landscape connectivity. Results revealed that over the decades the protected areas experienced highly pressure from anthropogenic activities. Generally, their size is very small and the natural areas within their boundary gradually reduced and fragmented. Analysis also revealed the transformation of natural landscape to the anthropogenic settlements inside all of the three protected areas. This suggests that these protected areas may have lost their capability to support valuable biodiversity if the situation persisted. However, the connectivity analysis showed that some of the large patches of forest outside the protected areas have connectivity importance. Therefore, there is a need for more protected areas in the Kuala Lumpur conurbation to protect valuable biodiversity and also the natural landscapes for sustainable planning of the city.

TI  - Genetic evaluation and selection in <i>Jatropha curcas</i> L.
T2  - CROP BREEDING AND APPLIED BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - J. curcas (physic nut) is one of the most promising oilseeds for biofuel production and the knowledge about genetic parameter estimates is important for its breeding. Here, we evaluated 121 families, from 48 to 60 months of age, aiming genetic evaluation and selection. The trial was set up in an 11 x 11 lattice design, with three replications and 4-plant plot. The traits evaluated were fruit yield (FY), grain (GY) and oil yield (OY), fruit husk percentage (FH) and seed oil content (OC). Individual heritabilities were low (0.19 to 0.23), requiring accurate selection and improvement methods. Moderate repeatabilities were observed for FY (0.54), GY (0.52), OC (0.30) and OY (0.51), indicating that the families evaluated maintained relative superiority over the years. With selection of the 20 best individuals, the predicted genotypic gains (66%) were greater than the additive gains (56%), indicating greater possibilities of success from cultivation of clones.

TI  - Downscaling of ASTER Thermal Images Based on Geographically Weighted Regression Kriging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lower spatial resolution of thermal infrared (TIR) satellite images and derived land surface temperature (LST) is one of the biggest challenges in mapping temperature at a detailed map scale. An extensive range of scientific and environmental applications depend on the availability of fine spatial resolution temperature data. All satellite-based sensor systems that are equipped with a TIR detector depict a spatial resolution that is coarser than most of the multispectral bands of the same system. Certain studies may therefore be not feasible if applied in areas that depict a high spatial variation in temperature at small spatial scales, such as urban centers and flooded pristine areas. To solve this problem, this study applied an image downscaling method to enhance the spatial resolution of LST data by combining TIR, multispectral images, and derived data, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), according to the geographically weighted regression (GWRK) and area-to-point kriging of regressed residuals. The resulting LST images of the natural and anthropogenic urban areas of the Brazilian Pantanal are very highly correlated to the reference LST images. The approach, combining ASTER TIR with ASTER visible/infrared (VNIR) and Sentinel-2 images according to the GWRK method, performed better than all of the remaining state-of-the-art downscaling methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article investigates the encounter of the categories of epistolary novel with autobiography in Rousseau's Nouvelle Heloise and Foscolo's Ortis. The aim is to prove that, even though the epistolary novel seems to provide the instruments to build a polyphonic discourse, most of these novels eventually represent, through the first person singular, the personal worldview of the author and some aspects of his personality. Whether Rousseau exploits the dialogue of the different characters of his novel to create a debate around his own personal philosophy, Foscolo, through the characters of Jacopo Ortis and Lorenzo, represents his young self.

TI  - Strengthening Routine Data Systems to Track the HIV Epidemic and Guide the Response in Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The global HIV response has entered a new phase with the recommendation of treating all persons living with HIV with antiretroviral therapy, and with the goals of reducing new infections and AIDS-related deaths to fewer than 500,000 by 2020. This new phase has intensive data requirements that will need to utilize routine data collected through service delivery platforms to monitor progress toward these goals. With a focus on sub-Saharan African, we present the following priorities to improve the demand, supply, and use of routine HIV data: (1) strengthening patient-level HIV data systems that support continuity of clinical care and document sentinel events; (2) leveraging data from HIV testing programs; (3) using targeting data collection in communities and among clients; and (4) building capacity and promoting a culture of HIV data quality assessment and use. When fully leveraged, routine data can efficiently provide timely information at a local level to inform action, as well as provide information at scale with wide geographic coverage to strengthen estimation efforts.

TI  - Assessment of land cover dynamics in the Tahaddart Ramsar wetland (North-western Morocco)
T2  - REVUE D ECOLOGIE-LA TERRE ET LA VIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover and land cover dynamics, in both time and space, were analysed in the Tahaddart wetland (Northern Morocco) to determine the evolution of the environmental quality of this Site of Biological and Ecological Interest (since 1996), also classified as a Ramsar site (since 2005). Remote sensing was used to estimate the impact of land use changes on natural habitats over a 35-year period from 1978 to 2013. The first image used MSS captures from 1978 with a spatial resolution of 80 m. The resolution was improved since 1991 with the use of Landsat 4 satellite images (spatial resolution of 30 m in multi-band modes) and then with satellite images from Landsat 7 and 8 (spatial resolution of 15 m in panchromatic mode). The images were classified and then analysed using Erdas Imagine 9.2 software program. The results were verified using a confusion matrix, which provided a global precision rates ranging from 82 to 86 %. This qualitative data on the land cover evolution revealed that despite its important conservation status, the Tahaddart wetland has been subject to substantial changes over time. Important declines in natural habitats such as forests, estuarine vegetation and sand dunes were observed for the benefit of an increase of areas of urbanization and bare soil. This analysis demonstrates the important anthropogenic pressures that affect the site and the need to enforce current legislation in order to conserve local biodiversity over the long-term.

TI  - Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics and Modeling of Urban Land Expansion by the Integration of Cellular Automata and Markov Chain
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the past and present land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes and urban expansion pattern for the cities of the Kathmandu valley and their surroundings using Landsat satellite images from 1988 to 2016. For a better analysis, LULC change information was grouped into seven time-periods (1988-1992, 1992-1996, 1996-2000, 2000-2004, 2004-2008, 2008-2013, and 2013-2016). The classification was conducted using the support vector machines (SVM) technique. A hybrid simulation model that combined the Markov-Chain and Cellular Automata (MC-CA) was used to predict the future urban sprawl existing by 2024 and 2032. Research analysis explored the significant expansion in urban cover which was manifested at the cost of cultivated land. The urban area totaled 40.53 km(2) in 1988, which increased to 144.35 km(2) in 2016 with an average annual growth rate of 9.15%, an overall increase of 346.85%. Cultivated land was the most affected land-use from this expansion. A total of 91% to 98% of the expanded urban area was sourced from cultivated land alone. Future urban sprawl is likely to continue, which will be outweighed by the loss of cultivated land as in the previous decades. The urban area will be expanded to 200 km(2) and 238 km(2) and cultivated land will decline to 587 km(2) and 555 km(2) by 2024 and 2032. Currently, urban expansion is occurring towards the west and south directions; however, future urban growth is expected to rise in the southern and eastern part of the study area, dismantling the equilibrium of environmental and anthropogenic avenues. Since the study area is a cultural landscape and UNESCO heritage site, balance must be found not only in developing a city, but also in preserving the natural environment and maintaining cultural artifacts.
