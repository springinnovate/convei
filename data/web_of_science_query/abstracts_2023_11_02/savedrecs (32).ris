AB  - This paper hopes to contribute to overcoming the corona disaster. What we want is not simply to restore our daily lives, but to provide an opportunity for a better world. We will look at this problem in terms of proximity and distance, using Heidegger and Ulrich Beck as the framework of analysis. Ulrich Beck argues that industrial societies systematically and continuously produce risk factors, which, if exceeding the critical point, become global risks. This is a risk society. However, since risk is a social construction, it is not considered as a risk without social recognition. The industrial society has continued to grow by treating risk merely as a secondary result of growth, and has become a risk society as it is today. But Beck argues that if the risk becomes global, cosmopolitan would act in solidarity and engage in political action in the face of a common fear. Differently from Beck, Heidegger attacks the conventional notion that technology is a tool. Ethical and political requests like Beck's are possible because of this, but this is an illusion. Because technology is more than just a tool: it changes people's attitude to the world and enslaves them to it. And the technological worldview of our time sees the world as something human can grasp and arbitrarily change. This has created a risk like the corona virus. Therefore, in order to overcome the risk, we must step outside the technological worldview and see the world as it is(die Gelassenheit zu den Dingen) and open to its secrets(die Offenheit fur das Geheimnis).

AB  - We explore the ecological message of Hildegard von Bingen (1098-1179) a medieval abbess, mystic, preacher and helper of the sick and focus on her creative spirit and how her ecological views, which have been influential for more than 900 years, are now gaining power in her town Bingen (Germany), and how her message is passed on.We first look at her life and writings, and then examine her worldview of the world, especially with the focus on her visionary book “das Buch vom Wirken Gottes”, and analyze the concept “viriditas” that is central here.Viriditas (Latin, literally "greenness," formerly translated as "viridity") is a word meaning vitality, fecundity, lushness, verdure, or growth. It is particularly associated with abbess Hildegard von Bingen, who used it to refer to or symbolize spiritual and physical health, often as a reflection of the Divine Word or as an aspect of the divine nature.In this writing, the abbess makes the world shine before the reader's eyes as a work of art of God. Hildegard of Bingen shows the reader the relationship of the microcosm and macrocosm to the almighty Creator. The book shows the ten visions "Of the work of God" based on the origin, development and fate of the entire cosmos.In this work, I pay particular attention to their essential keyword "viriditas" the following 3 points: 1.     The relationship between viriditas and God 2.     The relationship between viriditas and the human soul and body 3.     The relationship between viriditas and nature He then examined the places and institutions of the city of Hildegard of Bingen, and how Hildegard was being transmitted and taught in Bingen.Finally, from Hildegard's ecological message, to those of us who live in the ecological crisis today.

AB  - Up-to-date statistics of crop cultivation status is essential for farm land management planning and the advancement in remote sensing technology allowsfor rapid update of farming information. The objective of this study was to develop a classification model of rice paddy or winter crop fields basedon NDWI, NDVI, and HSV indices using Sentinel-2 satellite images. The 18 locations in central Korea were selected as target areas and photographedonce for each during summer and winter with a eBee drone to identify ground truth crop cultivation. The NDWI was used to classify summer paddyfields, while the NDVI and HSV were used and compared in identification of winter crop cultivation areas. The summer paddy field classification withthe criteria of –0.195<NDWI<0.15 was 90.9% accurate on average when compared with ground truth. Model performance for the winter crop fieldclassification was also excellent showing the accuracy greater than 98.2% on average for both models. However, cloud and greenhouses appeared todemonstrate optical similarity with paddy in the NDWI values, implying additional caution should be taken when removing cloud and greenhouseeffects. Overall the developed methods for paddy and winter crop classification performed reasonably well at the irrigation district level and furtherstudies are needed to investigate model performance at regional or national scales.

AB  - The volumes of water in the reservoirs constitute the main raw material in hydroelectric power plants, being components of great relevance in the energy matrix of the region, for which the study of these is of complete relevance. This document exposes the process for determining water volumes from the analysis of the number of pixels of water from satellite images (specifically of the Synthetic Aperture Radar type) during a period of the last four years on the reservoirs of El Salvador. The resources used correspond mainly to images of the Sentinel-1 satellite constellation available on the Google Earth Engine platform and data collected by the Transactions Unit of El Salvador.

AB  - Over the last 50 years there have been significant changes in land cover and land use, mainly those classified as artificial. This process, and its generalisation on a global scale, affect directly the basic functions of the soil, increasing other problems such as the loss of biodiversity, pollution, soil degradation, flooding and the effects of climate change. In the study area (Mazarron, Region of Murcia) this problem is exemplary: the binomial urban development associated with the increase of beach tourism and intensive agriculture (under greenhouses) alter drastically the nature of the soil. The aim of this paper is twofold: to establish a supervised classification model that distinguishes, with an assumable error, the different classes established, highlighting those considered as sealed surfaces and, in addition, to make a comparison with the latest Corine Land Cover available information (2018). For this purpose, Sentinel 2A satellite images were selected and a maximum likelihood classification was performed. To validate the results, a confusion matrix was developed and an overall accuracy of 89% was obtained. Finally, a significantly underestimation by the Corine Land Cover of 75% of the sealed surfaces was observed, mainly due to its resolution.

M3  - Article
AB  - The tradition of depending on plant derived products for medicinal purposes evolved several years ago as a part of human culture. Recent advancements in technology have a positive impact on medicinal crop production monitoring and mapping. In this study an innovative approach of 'individual sample as mean' based fuzzy modified possibilistic c-means classification technique was experimented for mapping Isabgol (Psyllium husk) medicinal plant. Five indices- CBSI-NDVI, NDVI (NIR-Red), NDVINRE1 (NIR-Red edge 1), NDVINRE2 (NIR-Red edge 2) and NDVINRE3 (NIRRed edge 3) as input to fuzzy machine learning algorithm were tested using Sentinel-2 data. While optimum temporal data were selected using separability analysis on indices data. Handling of heterogeneity within class has been directly observed in the form of variance parameter, which was reduced from 0.022 to 0.020 for CBSI-NDVI when 'Individual sample as mean' based approach is used. Test fields of Isabgol were found to be close to training fields, while monitoring MMD values with training and testing Isabgol fields, which were too low (0.044 for CBSI-NDVI). Whereas, MMD between the training field of Isabgol and other crops were too high (0.688 for Cumin, 0.644 for Mustard, 0.307 for wheat, 0.278 for Castor and 0.115 for Fenugreek) indicating other crops were well separated.

TI  - Patterns and predictors of relapse in Merkel cell carcinoma: Results from a population-based study
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and purpose: Prospective data evaluating the role of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) for Merkel Cell Carcinoma(MCC) is lacking. To better understand the efficacy of adjuvant RT, a population-based patterns of failure study was conducted.Methods: We identified MCC patients treated from 1988 to 2018. Primary outcome measures were recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival (OS) and MCC-specific survival (MCC-SS). Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was also calculated.Results: 217 patients with mean age 79 (range: 33-96) were analyzed. The median follow-up was 40 months. Treatments were: surgery(S) alone (n = 101, 45%) or S + RT (n = 116, 55%). Local recurrence (LR) was low in stage I (n = 6, 6.5%) with clear margin of >= 1 cm, negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) without high-risk factors, irrespective of adjuvant RT. Tumor size >= 2 cm (HR:2.95; p = 0.024) and immunosuppression (HR:3.98; p = 0.001) were associated with high risk of nodal failure. Adjuvant RT was associated with significant reduction in regional failure (HR:0.36; p = 0.002). Distant metastases (DM) were infrequent in stage I (4/90) and stage II (4/34), compared to stage III (32/93). Adjuvant RT improved RFS but did not influence MCC-SS and OS. CCI was a significant predictor of OS.Conclusions: Adjuvant RT improved RFS, without impact on MCC-SS and OS. Co-morbidity rather than RT influenced OS. Adjuvant RT may be avoided in stage I patients with negative SLNB and no associated high-risk factors. Prophylactic RNI could be considered in stage II with high risk features, inspite of negative SLNB. Stage III patients benefited from adjuvant RNI, but no impact on prevention of DM.

AB  - With the rise in the number of remote-sensing satellites in the past decade, interest has been drawn towards the fusion of satellite data. This study investigates the fusion of features obtained from the L-band ALOS-2 Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and the Sentinel-2 optical satellite by the use of neural networks. It identifies the prominent features by using an inverse-mapping algorithm. The fusion results show an increased classification accuracy compared to that of independent sensors. The algorithms have been tested on the data of the 2018 earthquake in Sulawesi, Indonesia.

AB  - This study examines the process of becoming hospitable towards social Others, from the aesthetic perspective of novels, focusing on Wanseo Park’s Subplot of Jeomunnal series. The three books in this series have a double structure in their plots. Real events and negative experiences of elderly people in the community are initially perceived as obstacles to hospitality, but as they overcome this attitude later, they gradually develop a more hospitable worldview, as revealed by their self-reflection and their actions. These novels are structured analogically, with an inferred connection between two themes. Subplot of Jeomunnal 1 deals with recognition and hatred, Subplot of Jeomunnal 3 with gift-giving and cultural hypocrisy, andSubplot of Jeomunnal 2 with visiting and conversation. As a result, hospitality in Wanseo Park’s novels is not a fixed concept, but a process, with self-reflection and dialogue communicating an evolution towards the possibility of hospitality. This analogical process of emerging hospitality meaningfully connotes the value of developing as a citizen of the community, while acknowledging human vulnerability and the sharing of one’s daily life with others.

AB  - Recently, the risk of water disasters are increasing due to climate change and the aging of river levees. Existing conventional riverembankment inspections have many limitations due to the consumption of a lot of manpower and budget. Thus, it is necessary to establisha new monitoring and forecast/warning method for effective flood response. This study proposes the river levee health monitoring systemby analyzing the relationship between river levee deformation and hydrological factors using Sentinel-1. The variance index calculated inthis study was classified into 4 grades. And the levees collapse section was judged to be a high vulnerable point in which the variancerapidly increased based on the result of the rapid increase in soil moisture. In the future, it is expected that it will be possible to advancelevee maintenance technology and improve national disaster management through the advancement of the existing levee managementsystem and automated monitoring through the forensic method that combines remote technology.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Nampo (南圃) Kim Man-yeoung (金萬英) has been spotlighted as a Neo-Confucianist in academia. In order to attempt to examine Kim Man-yeoung’s literature beyond the limitations of existing researchs, this paper first focused on his prose. As a result, the following three characteristics were largely captured.First of all, Kim Man-yeoung had an identity as a ruralist to such an extent that he claimed to be a scholar who studies and a farmer. To express this identity, he created a form of prose called ‘Self-narrative’. In these works, he partially revealed for his life and goal different from the world by setting questions and answers between virtual characters he had made. In addition, through composition and development similar to Tao Yuan-Ming (陶淵明)’s ｢Wuliuxiansheng-zhuan (五柳先生傳)｣, the joy of being a ruralist and Zhuangzi (莊子)’s worldview were revealed.He also found a motif in the prose of Han Yu, borrowed Han Yu’s prose development methods and rhetoric, but fused his own philosophical perspective of life. He created a unique sense of aesthetics by expressing subjects that would otherwise be serious and banal, such as ‘self-sufficiency (self-sufficiency)’ or ‘seek truth (求道)’ as a rather light comedy.Finally, the diverse application of the Personal Process prose is also a characteristic of the prose. They personified pear, plum, and heart, respectively, and showed completely different writing styles depending on the style.The prose works examined in this paper represent the literary aspect of Kim Man-young. The theme consciousness of these works may eventually be close to the character of a Neo-Confucianist, but his literary temperament played a role in expressing the subject. This unique expression of a universal subject is clearly the literary achievement of Kim Man-yeoung’s prose.

AB  - In the modern era, where the light and shade of the scientific era were sharply divided, an intellectual event that could be used as learning a lesson by the follies of others occurred in late modern Germany. It is a fierce intellectual battle over the pantheism controversy initiated by Jacobi and Mendelssohn and the authority of reason and legitimacy of metaphysical ideas associated with it. The pantheism controversy began with religious concerns that Spinozism and speculative philosophy, along with natural science, would be inevitably reduced to atheism and skepticism by Jacobi, but behind it was distrust of the metaphysical system and the authority of reason itself. In this intellectual crisis, Mendelssohn wanted to restore the authority of metaphysics and reason through epistemology, and at that time many intellectuals, including Kant, argued about Mendelssohn's metaphysic rationalism. Therefore, the pantheism controversy was not an issue limited to modern theological themes, which defended orthodox Christian faith, but that of metaphysical worldview regarding the right and legitimacy of reason. In the last period of the late 19th century, it became the origin of materialism debate in Germany. At the same time, the authority of reason, which was the standard of truth judgment in the Age of Enlightenment, was shaken by Kant's self-critique on reason ability, that is, meta-critique, and reason itself was not excluded from the critique. The criticism on the absolute authority and autonomy of the Enlightenment reason, which began with Heinrich Jacoby at this time, led to the pantheism controversy about Spinozism. Therefore, this study attempts to analyze Heinrich Jacoby's philosophy of feeling, critique of idealism, interpretation of Spinozism in the pantheism controversy, and philosophical evaluation on Jacoby's fideism and critique of reason from a diachronic point of view. At the same time, the researcher will examine the historical contexts in the crisis situations of Enlightenment reason and philosophy, considering the metaphysical advocacy and Spinoza's critique raised in Mendelssohn's philosophy.

AB  - Among the Jade tomb, the first cemetery, and the second cemetery, which were the stone mound altartomb of the second period of Xiaonanshan Culture(from B.C.7200  to around B.C.6600) belonging to Whanguk(桓國) period, the earliest altartombs were the stone mound altartombs in the first cemetery-district III. The main types of the jadestoneware excavated here were ‘Byeog(璧)Bu(斧)Guans(管類)(Guanthe bottomless tube- shaped stoneware石無底筒形器)’. In particular, the bottomless tube-shaped stoneware of Guans later led to the bottomless tube-shaped pottery(陶無底筒 形器) of Hungsan culture in Liaoxi(遼西) areas. And the general types were ‘BuChok(鏃)’ and among them,  the status of ‘Bu’ was high.  Also ‘Byeog+Power cane among Tools(Bone pointer)’ tradition of Malta culture in the late Paleolithic period led to ‘Byeog+Power cane among Tools(Bu)’ tradition in the first cemetery-III district.The four major types of the jadeㆍstonewares of the Jade tomb, which was later than the first cemetery-district III and was the highest-class tomb, were ‘[Byeogs(ByeogㆍHwan環ㆍGyeol玦) + Tools(BuㆍBi匕ㆍChok)] + Guans + Taeahyeong-gi(胎芽形器, 曲玉). As the main types of the first cemetery- district III were ‘ByeogㆍBuㆍGuans’ and the main types of the Jade tomb were ‘Byeogs(ByeogㆍHwanㆍGyeol), Tools(BuㆍBiㆍChok), Guans’, we can understand that the main types had continued unchanged.  In addition, Taeahyeong-gi, which had been a representative energy symbols since the Paleolithic period along with Byeog,  also appeared.  In addition, ‘Byeog+Power cane among Tools(Bone pointer)’ tradition of Malta culture Tools(Bu)’ of first tradition the and  ‘Byeog+Power cane among cemetery-district III led to ‘Byeogs(ByeogㆍHwanㆍGyeol)+Tools(BuㆍBi)’ of the Jade tomb. Over time, the material and form had changed, but the basic composition of ‘Byeogs+Power cane among Tools’ had not changed.The four major types of the jadeㆍstonewares of the Jade tomb had been passed down to the jadeㆍstoneware culture of Neolithic era to Bronze Age in Northeast Asia,  so we can see the prototype of the jadeㆍstoneware culture of Northeast Asia as Xiaonanshan culture.In the four major types of the jadeㆍstonewares of Xiaonanshan culture, the worldview of Sundo(仙道) called ‘the harmony idea of Cheon(天)ㆍJi(地)ㆍ In(人)’ and the birth and death view of Sundo called ‘Seongtong(性通)  Gongwan(功完)  Jocheon(朝天)’,  and the practice view of Sundo called ‘Jigam(止感)ㆍJosik(調息)ㆍGeumchok(禁觸)’ were reflected. Among the jadeㆍ stonewares of Xiaonanshan culture, the three types of ‘ByeogsㆍPower cane among ToolsㆍTaeahyeong-gi’ were handed down to Dangun Joseon(檀君朝 鮮) as three bronze vessels for Sundo heaven ritual(仙道祭天),  namely ‘Cheonbu Samin(天符三印:  tree symbols of Sundo,  Bronze mirrorㆍBronze swordㆍTaeahyeong-gi(or Bronze drop)’.

TI  - Object-Based High-Rise Building Detection Using Morphological Building Index and Digital Map
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-rise buildings (HRBs) as modern and visually unique land use continue to increase due to urbanization. Therefore, large-scale monitoring of HRB is very important for urban planning and environmental protection. This paper performed object-based HRB detection using high-resolution satellite image and digital map. Three study areas were acquired from KOMPSAT-3A, KOMPSAT-3, and WorldView-3, and object-based HRB detection was performed using the direction according to relief displacement by satellite image. Object-based multiresolution segmentation images were generated, focusing on HRB in each satellite image, and then combined with pixel-based building detection results obtained from MBI through majority voting to derive object-based building detection results. After that, to remove objects misdetected by HRB, the direction between HRB in the polygon layer of the digital map HRB and the HRB in the object-based building detection result was calculated. It was confirmed that the direction between the two calculated using the centroid coordinates of each building object converged with the azimuth angle of the satellite image, and results outside the error range were removed from the object-based HRB results. The HRBs in satellite images were defined as reference data, and the performance of the results obtained through the proposed method was analyzed. In addition, to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed technique, it was confirmed that the proposed method provides relatively good performance compared to the results of object-based HRB detection using shadows.

AB  - Although satellite-based sea surface temperature (SST) is advantageous for monitoring large areas, spatiotemporal data gaps frequently occur due to various environmental or mechanical causes. Thus, it is crucial to fill in the gaps to maximize its usability. In this study, daily SST composite fields with a resolution of 4 km were produced through a two-step machine learning approach using polar- orbiting and geostationary satellite SST data. The first step was SST reconstruction based on Data Interpolate Convolutional AutoEncoder (DINCAE) using multi-satellite-derived SST data. The second step improved the reconstructed SST targeting in situ measurements based on light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) to finally produce daily SST composite fields. The DINCAE model was validated using random masks for 50 days, whereas the LGBM model was evaluated using leave-one-year-out cross-validation (LOYOCV). The SST reconstruction accuracy was high, resulting in R2 of 0.98, and a root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.97Â°C. The accuracy increase by the second step was also high when compared to in situ measurements, resulting in an RMSE decrease of 0.21–0.29Â°C and an MAE decrease of 0.17–0.24Â°C. The SST composite fields generated using all in situ data in this study were comparable with the existing data assimilated SST composite fields. In addition, the LGBM model in the second step greatly reduced the overfitting, which was reported as a limitation in the previous study that used random forest. The spatial distribution of the corrected SST was similar to those of existing high resolution SST composite fields, revealing that spatial details of oceanic phenomena such as fronts, eddies and SST gradients were well simulated. This research demonstrated the potential to produce high resolution seamless SST composite fields using multi-satellite data and artificial intelligence.

AB  - In this paper looking into the relationship between nature and practitioners in Taoist immortal narratives who pursued immortality and to extend their lives, I tried to figure out that to be a Taoist immortal is the result of the will of self-transcendence with which men wanted to unify themselves and nature. In a life-centered worldview it was analyzed at what point the desires and empirical knowledge of the people of that time intersected and grew into a unique cultural product as the Taoist immortal focusing on the practitioner’s posture and attitude. In the process of discussion, this paper includes the reflection on narrow-minded thinking that considers and criticizes the existence of ‘Taoist immortal’ as a component with anti-natural characteristics of only the outer shell of Taoism.The practitioners of Liexian zhuan(『列仙傳』) and Shenxian zhuan(『神仙傳』) tried to embody the vitality of nature in their body by imitating animal behavior and taking Taoist immortal drug made of plants and minerals. They practiced to recreate the vitality of animals, plants, and minerals in the body of a microcosmic human being and to resemble the eternity contained in nature. For practitioners, nature was an organic principle and method with infinite potential to complete their body and mind wholly.To become a Taoist immortal is not against nature, but a willingness to return to nature through nature, and an attempt to transcend one’s own limits through self-control and regulation. It is not the pursuit of destroying or conquering the order of nature, but the result of efforts to embody the tao of nature in own body. It is not only a pursuit to extend the life of the body, but also a journey to desire the liberation and freedom of the soul.

AB  - This study is an attempt to dispel misunderstandings by analyzing the modern Korean calligraphy of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which had been perceived as retrogressive and pessimistic.The bureaucrats and intellectuals who took the initiative through the Gabo Reform of 1894 promoted cultural enlightenment. Whether they insisted on independence through strenuous efforts(自强獨立) or taking the old as the basis ad referencing the new(舊本新參)', the culmination of the cultural enlightenment they pursued has in common: establishing a civilized modern state. The ideological tendencies that bureaucrats and intellectuals held in social and historical conditions directly affect the aesthetic and critical activities of those around them. The most notable people during this period are Oh Sechang and Ahn Jungsik. The editorial cartoon, composed of Oh Sechang's writings and Lee Doyeong's drawings, reflected the worldview of those who wanted independence through strenuous efforts.Ahn Jungsik, Oh Sechang, and Kim Gyujin, who dominated the central calligraphy group, were representatives of the field of calligraphy and painting at that time. In terms of the reform of calligraphy, they sometimes cooperated, but they mostly took different stances and tended to be passive. By the way, there were great calligraphers in each region. Some of them went down to the province after being recognized on the central stage, and others devoted themselves to calligraphy and painting by keeping their distance from the central calligraphy group.After the Gabo Reform of 1894, Korea laid the foundation for modern school education. Although there were laws on the subject of writing practice, there were no textbooks and no historical material for textbooks. However, writing practice was a major subject because it was included in the elementary school end-term exam subjects. Since the colonialist education policy implemented by the Japanese Residency-General of Korea was based on civilization education and realistic education, the writing practice education in the Department of the Korean Language is literally about learning and writing characters, not calligraphy education. Until the late period of Joseon, there were no national or public primary education institutions in Korea, only Seodang by the private sector. It is significant that Calligraphy Education Center, a private art education institution operated from July 1907 to January 1908, attempted comprehensive art education, although it was a short period.In this paper, I have looked into articles and discourses published in newspapers and magazines as well as works about Korean modern calligraphy from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century. I hope that this paper will clear up any misunderstandings in the past. Furthermore, I believe it will help find the way forward for Korean modern and contemporary calligraphy, which is gradually falling into the shade.

AB  - This article examines how Dasan Jeong Yak-yong's 'logic of inner discovery' and the logic of practice are combined. The era experienced by Jeong Yak-yong coincided with the path of overcoming the triades of Neo-Confucianism, Catholicism, and Silhak in order to find a new self-conscious subject. Digging into the boundary between orthodoxy and heresy, I tried to find the meaning of independence in the ambivalence of the supernatural heaven, the activity of human nature. To this end, the practice morals of cultivation (heart) and intellect (intelligence) were created through independent world awareness by reinterpreting Lee and suggesting the theory of signs (嗜好). The methodology is not the time series of historical flow or content arrangement of Neo-Confucianism, Catholicism, and Silhak, but reinterprets the 'meaning' that is internalized in Neo-Confucianism itself through the method of proof of Yi Gyeong, Seohak and Mencius. This was accomplished by digging into the universality and specificity of the scriptures of the logics of the sutras. It was resonant in that the mixture and identity of spirituality, discipline, and morality were deposited in a way that distanced itself from the flow of conventional Zhuism, did not fall into Catholicism, and reconstructed Toegye's theory and Mencius. This is not a method of articulating the worldview of the articulation of discourses between 'Confucianism' and 'Seohak', while supposing the absolutism of the times of Neo-Confucianism, the Catholic theories and religious worldviews, and the issue of awakening human nature back to the people and politics. It can be found in Jeong Yak-yong that it was a theoretical attempt to overcome the problem of external objectivity that exists within.

AB  - “The period of turning point” is a slogan that Japan often adopts when it seeks to change its system, and the term was used to emphasize the meaning of “revival” beyond contradiction or criticism. The logic that “the period of turning point equals the revival period” adopted after Japan lost the war was a unique and irreplaceable rhetoric for replacing the universality of the Western Renaissance with the Japanese Renaissance. This brought about the logic that modernity began from human revival; according to that logic, modernity existed during the early modern period of the East, and it started earlier there than the West. It was connected to the logic that Japan had continued to maintain the Oriental modernity, and that the modernity had already begun during the early modern period. This was adopted by Marxists after the war to relativize capitalism and socialism, democracy and fascism so as to define the concept of freedom. In other words, they considered these concepts as “forms of” social “consciousness,” and thought that based on such consideration, confrontational worldview had emerged. It comprises the logics of class, system, and nation and started by reconsidering this. In order to assemble these three concepts while disassembling them, the logic of human revival that existed in Japan was discovered. It was morality and spirituality. This was an aspect of Japaneseism attempted by Takayama Chogyu in the Meiji period of Japan and was the subjectivity theory as an expression of a spiritual worldview. This reminded of the fact that even figures from the West made the same argument after the war such as Spengler who argued for the fall of the West and Nietzsche with his logic. The arguments of Manabu Sano, a postwar Marxist, and Kojiro Sugimori, as well as criticism of Russian communism are transformed into militarism, which justifies the peace of the country as a human revival in democracy. Thus, it was argued that this morphology of social consciousness should be connected to culture, and that the people who have become aware of cultural construction, humanity and morality should be the subjectivity. Also, the selfishness of Adam Smith was abandoned, the discussion on the importance of publicity was revived, and the meaning of global contributions was reconsidered. It was the “Japanese Revival Theory” that was adopted to rationalize the rebirth of the Japanese people based on the logic that “the Renaissance, the period of turning point, and the revival period all equal” while relativizing the fascism before the war and connecting the reconstruction of East-West ideology.

T2  - STUDIA Z FILOLOGII POLSKIEJ I SLOWIANSKIEJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this article is to reconstruct the linguistic and cultural image of Moscow at the turn of the twentieth century using the paradigm of cultural linguistics. This paradigm was selected as the theoretical framework of the study considering that it practically has not been applied in Russian linguistics. The article shows that the intricate image of the urban space is created by means of cultural elements (the coat of arms, the flag, the bugle call, architecture) and, most of all, linguistic elements whose major exponent is a given urban dialect. It is a wide-ranging construct whose lexis, apart from native elements, also includes a large number of foreign components and proprial (official and unofficial) vocabulary. The conglomerate of these elements can be regarded as a specific language of the urban space.

T2  - Western Indian Ocean Journal of Marine Science
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed at quantifying changes in shoreline and the riverbanks caused by tropical cyclones (TCs) and associated rainfall in the Rufiji Delta, southern Tanzania. Long term changes of the shoreline and riverbanks were analysed using medium resolution (Landsat TM and ETM) satellite imagery (1991, 1997 and 2007), while short-term changes (2013 to 2014) were analysed using high resolution (Pleiades) satellite imagery. Delineation of the shoreline and riverbank changes were accomplished through the analysis of appropriate coloured image composites, Sobel filtering and maximum likelihood classification of land cover. Analysis of Landsat data showed a relatively higher magnitude of erosion between 1991 and 2007, followed by minor changes between 1997 and 2007. Simbauranga was the most severely eroding site, with an estimated magnitude of erosion of 83 to 100 m during the study period. The maximum magnitude of short-term changes of the riverbanks were estimated at about 31m2. Apart from the erosion of the riverbanks, other changes were the conversion of water to vegetation covered areas (amounting to approximately 200 m2). Short-term shoreline changes were up to 206 m with higher magnitude of accretion (142 m) than erosion (-4 m). The study conclusively calls for detailed research on shoreline and riverbank changes based on the impacts of TCs on land cover.

AB  - A plethora of risk-assessment methodologies have been developed for the detection of rockfall-prone areas. In this study, a freely available add-on for QGIS software named QPROTO, was chosen for hazard and susceptibility analyses of a well-studied rockfall in Platiana village of Ilia prefecture. QPROTO is based on the Cone Method and focuses on the identification of areas vulnerable to rockfall phenomena. The software takes into consideration the slope's topography and various empirical parameters (e.g. dip direction theta, energy angle phi p, lateral angle a). It calculates block velocity, kinetic energy, as well as the estimation of the time-independent relative rockfall hazard. The basic input parameters in QPROTO are a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), aspect, detachment propensity, boulder mass, energy line angle and lateral spreading angle. Slope characteristics (slope inclination, forest coverage) and block characteristics (block volume, block shape) are the main parameters that influence the evolution of a rockfall phenomenon. As DEMs extract details pertaining to the topography of the slope it is an essential factor for rockfall quantative computation via the aforementioned plugin. Eight free available DEMs have been evaluated in this work aiming to assess the most efficient ones. A DSM created from UAV data, a DSM from the Greek Cadastral, DSM from the Ministry of Agriculture, ALOS AW3D30 DEM, ASTER GDEM, SRTM30 DEM, SRTM90 DEM and TanDEM_X are used. Diverse analyses were performed and the results are presented. It is proved that the spatial resolution of the DEM is very crucial for the accuracy of the results.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to one of the aspects of the linguistic substantiation of the connection between language and culture: the identification of lexical units with a potential conceptual meaning in thematic groups, which allows them to participate in the creation of aphoristic idioms (aphorisms, proverbs, sayings). From the standpoint of linguistic typology in the lexico-semantic sphere, the words denoting a dog and a horse in the Khanty and Khakass languages are considered. The empirical base of the study was the author's notes of the spoken language of the Khanty, dictionaries of the Khanty and Khakass languages, a collection of Khanty riddles, a collection of Khakass proverbs and sayings. As a result of the study, a circle of idioms (indicated languages) with a distinct cognitive and mental, worldview basis is outlined. The methods used are the method of typological interpretation of lexical material and descriptive. When analyzing the semantics of these words, special attention was paid to the indication of regular stable phrases: it is the associative potencies that are the basis for the development of further connotations, the logical conclusion of which is the participation of certain words in idioms. It has been established that idiomatic constructions with the lexemes `dog' and `horse' characterize not so much these animals as the way of life of two different ethnic groups, as well as the human qualities of the representatives of these peoples, shed light on their ideas about life.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Surface Water Classification for Four Major Rivers from the Peruvian Amazon
T2  - DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We describe a new minimum extent, persistent surface water classification for reaches of four major rivers in the Peruvian Amazon (i.e., Amazon, Napo, Pastaza, Ucayali). These data were generated by the Peruvian Amazon Rural Livelihoods and Poverty (PARLAP) Project which aims to better understand the nexus between livelihoods (e.g., fishing, agriculture, forest use, trade), poverty, and conservation in the Peruvian Amazon over a 35,000 km river network. Previous surface water datasets do not adequately capture the temporal changes in the course of the rivers, nor discriminate between primary main channel and non-main channel (e.g., oxbow lakes) water. We generated the surface water classifications in Google Earth Engine from Landsat TM 5, 7 ETM+, and 8 OLI satellite imagery for time periods from circa 1989, 2000, and 2015 using a hierarchical logical binary classification predominantly based on a modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI) and shortwave infrared surface reflectance. We included surface reflectance in the blue band and brightness temperature to minimize misclassification. High accuracies were achieved for all time periods (>90%).

TI  - Ideological Legitimation of Aggressive Wars and Construction of the Image of the Enemy in Russian Historiography
T2  - UKRAINSKYI ISTORYCHNYI ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to contribute to the debunking of the unscientific nature of Russian historiography, its ideologization and subservience to the rulers of Muscovy, and thus of the Russian and Soviet empires, to expose the manipulative attempt of the current leaders of the Russian Federation to use arguments from history to legitimize the genocidal aggression against Ukraine, its rationale and justification, to find out motives of glorification of wars of aggression in it and creating of the image of the enemy. The research methodology is based on systematic adherence to the principles of historicism, continuity, anthropological, sociocultural and critical-analytical approaches, refutation of falsifications and distortions in historical narratives, the involvement of methods of historiographical analysis and synthesis, comparative studies, methods of historical-chronological, historical-genetic knowledge and personal reflections. Relevance and scientific novelty are determined by the very formulation of the problem, which in the context of the current war and its historical segment acquires special significance, as it allows a deeper understanding of the origins of the great-state essence and servile nature of Russian historiography, starting from the times of V.Tatishchev, N.Karamzin, M.Pogodin and ending with modern Kremlin historians, to more fully realize the need for the final release of Ukrainian historians from its ideological and methodological influence. For the first time, on the basis of historiographical sources, works of predecessors and author's studies, the technologies of glorifying the role of wars in the history of Russia, creating the image of an internal and external enemy, forming hostility and hatred towards Ukraine and the Western world are analyzed. Conclusions. The result of the research is aimed at proving the unscientific nature of Russian historiography, its appropriation, ideological commitment and bias, its appropriation of the historical and cultural heritage of the Kyivan Rus state, the debunking of post-colonial stereotypes, distortions, fabrications, arbitrary interpretation of historical sources, falsifications of the history of Russia and Ukraine, and the justification of the need to refute them. The process of replacing concepts by Russian historians, distorting facts, spreading myths, instilling stereotypes of thinking with the aim of manipulating historical consciousness and preserving Ukrainian historical science in the so-called common information space, imposing one's vision of the historical process on it has been traced. Attention is drawn to the need to further distance Ukrainian historiography from Russian one, to oppose its worldview core - the paradigm of the "Russian World" / "Russkiy Mir", the concepts of "one nation" and "common history", debunking the anti-humanity of the ideology of aggressive rashism (ruscism), the falsehood and immorality of Moscow's historical myths regarding the nature and goals of the current the war of occupation and conquest against Ukraine, silencing its genocidal direction. A number of proposals have been made regarding the further exposure of Russia's expansionist policy under the guise of "the gathering of originally Russian lands", its modern modifications, including its attempts to control the intellectual and informational space of historical science and education, to use it in the interests of the great powers.

AB  - The territorial zones of the Katangan copper belt are among the main receptacles of a strong demographic and mining sites concentration in DR Congo. As a result, the spatial pattern of their natural landscapes are undergoing profound changes. This study characterizes land cover changing trends before and after mining liberalization in 2002. Three Landsat image mosaics (TM 1990, ETM + 2002 and OLI 2015) have been classified into "Forest " and "Non Forest ", and validated by the Kappa coefficient values. The results showed a growing landscape disturbance, especially after mining liberalization. The landscape matrix, initially "Forest " patches, has been degraded and / or converted into "Non Forest " class. Subsequently, attrition and dissection of forest patches in opposition to creation of "Non Forest " patches have been identified as spatial transformation processes. The regressive dynamics of forest ecosystems resulting from several human activities including agriculture, fuelwood production and mining activities performed in synergy, has been further amplified in the Kasenga zone. Territorial administrators will urgently need to declare protected areas and create nature reserves to preserve forest ecosystems.

AB  - Observing the pollution level of the atmosphere, waters, and bottom sediments in terms of physical, chemical, and hydrobiological indicators in order to study the distribution of pollutants in time and space, assess and predict the state of the Gorky Reservoir water area is an important and urgent task. To develop a regional algorithm for determining the hydrological parameters of the reservoir using satellite data, it is necessary to carry out atmospheric correction which will have significant errors without taking into account field measurements of the main optical characteristics of atmospheric aerosol over the studied water area.The study of the atmospheric aerosol optical characteristics over the Gorky Reservoir is carried out because of in-situ measurements using the SPM photometer as well as satellite data of high spatial resolution Landsat and Sentinel. The resulting irregular data set is insufficient for a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the spatial and temporal variability of regional aerosol characteristics. The obtained seasonal results of the analysis of optical characteristics require regular monitoring and are promising and relevant for research.

AB  - Remote sensing data gathered by various satellites (cross-sensor data having) are used to have a significant impact to lower down the performance of the stand-alone land cover classification model. The collected data from source and target regions have different probability distributions due to the different resolution of images and different geographical locations. To deal with this problem, an adversarial network-based unsupervised cross-sensor domain network has been investigated by considering two source -> target scenarios using hyperspectral and aerial image datasets. Initially, an unsupervised generative adversarial network (GAN) has been implemented to minimize the distribution between both domains. Following that, the transformed target images are obtained using the trained GAN architecture. Thereafter, a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) has been trained using the source images and finally, the trained DCNN is used to predict the land cover classes under a multi-sensor framework. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme has been compared with the state-of-the-art techniques, and the results are found to be promising to handle the issues under an unsupervised cross-sensor environment.

TI  - Deep Learning-Based Cross-Sensor Domain Adaptation Under Active Learning for Land Cover Classification
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-sensor remote-sensing data have a significant impact on degrading the performance of traditional land cover classification (LCC) models. This occurs due to different probability distributions of the collected data from different satellites (having diverse image resolutions and different geographical locations). To resolve this, a cross-sensor domain adaptation (DA) strategy is investigated by considering two source -> target scenarios using hyperspectral and aerial image datasets. At the onset, a feature extraction (FE) along with a "stacking of sample" (whenever required) strategy is proposed to balance the cross-sensor data in terms of feature dimensions and the available number of samples. Thereafter, a standard deviation (SD)-based active learning (AL) technique is investigated by exploiting the labeled source images to get the "most-informative" target samples. Finally, the labeled source and "most-informative" target samples are merged to train a classifier which is then used to predict the land cover classes under a multi-sensor framework. Experimental results are found to be promising for the proposed scheme to handle the DA problem under a cross-sensor environment.

TI  - Survival rate, blood feeding habits and sibling species composition of Aedes simpsoni complex: Implications for arbovirus transmission risk in East Africa.
T2  - PLoS neglected tropical diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Aedes simpsoni complex has a wide distribution in Africa and comprises at least three described sub-species including the yellow fever virus (YFV) vector Ae. bromeliae. To date, the distribution and relative contributions of the sub-species and/or subpopulations including bionomic characteristics in relation to YF transmission dynamics remain poorly studied. In this study conducted in two areas with divergent ecosystems: peri-urban (coastal Rabai) and rural (Rift Valley Kerio Valley) in Kenya, survival rate was estimated by parity in Ae. simpsoni s.l. mosquitoes sampled using CO2-baited BG Sentinel traps. We then applied PCR targeting the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2), region followed by sequencing and phylogenetic analytics to identify the sibling species in the Ae. simpsoni complex among parous and blood fed cohorts. Our results show that Ae. bromeliae was the most dominant sub-species in both areas, exhibiting high survival rates, human blood-feeding, and potentially, high vectorial capacity for pathogen transmission. We document for the first time the presence of Ae. lilii in Kenya and potentially yet-to-be described species in the complex displaying human feeding tendencies. We also infer a wide host feeding range on rodents, reptile, and domestic livestock besides humans especially for Ae. bromeliae. This feeding trend could likely expose humans to various zoonotic pathogens. Taken together, we highlight the utility of genotype-based analyses to generate precision surveillance data of vector populations for enhanced disease risk prediction and to guide cost-effective interventions (e.g. YF vaccinations).

AB  - The Operational Land Imager 2 (OLI-2) is flying on the Landsat 9 satellite that launched on September 27, 2021. OLI-2 collects data in nine spectral bands in the solar reflective region with a ground sample distance (GSD) of 30 m for all bands except the panchromatic band, which has a 15 m GSD. OLI-2 is the second in a series of instruments flying aboard Landsat platforms. Its predecessor, the Operational Land Imager (OLI), onboard the Landsat 8 satellite, has been operational since 2013. Both satellites fly in a sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 705 km. The OLI-2 telescope completed alignment in December 2017 at Ball Aerospace. In this paper we present a summary of the as-designed and as-built performance of the telescope that demonstrates compliance to the OLI-2 requirements. In addition, we provide a comparison of the OLI-2 telescope performance to the reported OLI telescope performance. Performance parameters discussed include measurement of effective focal length, modulation transfer function, optical throughput, polarization, stray light, and pointing.

AB  - The study aims to compare land use land cover (LULC) change between Bangladesh and Indian Sundarbans from 1975 to 2020 using Landsat Satellite images. We performed supervised maximum likelihood (ML) to classify the study area at four time periods over 45 years (1975, 1990, 2005, and 2020). The classification was assigned to five classes: dense forest, moderate forest, sparse forest, barren land, and water body. Accuracy assessment of the classified images was completed with 250 control points for each year. The findings of our study revealed that the dense forest cover of Bangladesh and Indian parts was 54% and 31%, respectively, whereas, for the whole Sundarbans, it was 45% in 1975. However, the dense forest of Bangladesh and Indian Sundarbans decreased by an annual rate of 1.20% and 1.60%, respectively, from 1975 to 2020. From 1990 to 2005, Bangladesh Sundarbans slightly increased the dense forest cover by an annual rate of 0.68%, while the Indian Sundarbans decreased by an annual rate of 0.63%. The moderate dense forest of Bangladesh and Indian Sundarbans increased by giving almost the same annual rate of 3.62% and 3.59% from 1975 to 2020, whereas the increasing rate of the sparse forest was much higher for Bangladesh (8.36%) Sundarbans than Indian (3.36%) parts. The water bodies of Bangladesh and Indian Sundarbans increased by giving an annual rate of 0.48% and 0.71%, respectively, from 1975 to 2020. Our study found that most of the barren lands were located near the boundary between forest and human settlement of Indian Sundarbans compared to Bangladesh. The findings of the comparative assessment between these two countries can support sustainable forest management and planning by considering the best policy options.

AB  - Willy the Wimp   is the work that gave birth to the globallyloved Anthony Browne's Willy series. The main character, Willy, symbolizes Anthony Browne's shadow self, and Willy's lifestyle or way of life reflects what the author thinks of the children's life. In this study,   Willy the Wimp   was reviewed according to Vanhoozer's cultural interpretation methodology. Through the world of the text itself, Darwin's evolutionary theory and existentialist absurdity ideas, that existentialism and surrealism influenced Anthony Browne by examining the world behind the text, are seen, and through the analysis of the world ahead of the text, readers found that even if they lacked an understanding of the content, they trusted the artist's reputation and evaluated the picture books positively. As a result, it is revealed that Darwin's evolutionary worldview penetrated this picturebook   Willy the Wimp  . Furthermore, it is found that Darwinian theory leads to a semantic nihilism that denies all meanings and values. This study has the significance of revealing that Anthony Browne's ideological basis lies in Darwin's theory of evolution. On the other hand, adult readers were not aware of this and evaluated it as an educational picture book for children. However, this study has limitations because it analyzed only with Internet book reviews in the world in front of the text that examines the reader's response. Therefore, this study suggests that adult readers have ethical responsibilities in choosing and reviewing books, and suggests a follow-up study on in-depth analysis of adult readers' reading competencies.

AB  - The Korea Augmentation Satellite System (KASS) is the Satellite-Based Augmentation System (SBAS) under development in Korea. KASS navigation service support navigation Safety of Life (SoL) service. KASS signal provides corrections to Global Positioning System (GPS) data received from KASS Reference Stations (KRS) and is broadcast form Geostationary Earth Orbiting (GEO) satellites to KASS users and is used by GPS/SBAS user equipment to improve the accuracy, availability, continuity and integrity of the navigation solution. Seven KRS’s collect the satellite data and send them to the KASS Processing Stations (KPS) for the generation of the corrections and the monitoring the integrity. For performing its computation the KPS needs to know accurate and reliable KRS antennas coordinates. These coordinates are provided as configuration parameters to the KPS. This means that the reference frame in which the KPS work is the one represented by the set of coordinates provided as input. Therefore, the activity to maintain the accuracy of the KRS antenna coordinates is necessary, knowing that coordinates can evolve due to earth plates movements or earthquakes. In this paper, we analyzed the geodetic survey results for KRS antenna coordinates from Site Acceptance Test (SAT) #1 in December 2020 to August 2022. In the future, it is expected that these activities and planning for KRS coordinates maintenance will be produced and provided to KASS system operators for KPS configuration updates during the KASS lifetime of 15 years. Through these maintenance activities, it is expected that monitoring and analysis of unpredictable events such as earthquakes and seism will be possible in the future.

TI  - Decoding the Partial Pretrained Networks for Sea-Ice Segmentation of 2021 Gaofen Challenge
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-ice segmentation is of great importance for environmental research, ship navigation, and ice hazard forecasting. Remote sensing (RS) images have been a unique data source for rapid and large-scale sea-ice monitoring. The 2021 Gaofen Challenge has offered a track of sea-ice segmentation based on optical RS images. For the initial competition, our team ranked 3rd place (deepjoker) in the accuracy leaderboard and the solution has been the most efficient algorithm to achieve a segmentation score above 97.79%. In this article, we briefly introduce our three strategies of the achievement including: 1) decoding the partial pretrained networks which can simultaneously capture the complex boundaries of sea ices and decrease the computational cost without the performance drop; 2) employing the classwise Dice loss for solving the gradient vanishing problem when most ground-truth maps are backgrounds; and 3) replacing the commonly exploited decoder with the one proposed by Silva et al. (2021). The main contributions are twofold: 1) an efficient and effective sea-ice segmentation method is proposed and 2) the gradient vanishing problem of binary Dice loss is investigated under some scenarios and solved by introducing its classwise version. Comparison and ablation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with respect to other commonly adopted deep segmentation models.

However, despite the spatial difference between this world and the next world, from the Chinese view of the next world was also depicted as similar to the real life in this world.In the emotional aspect, the living and the dead must live in their respective worlds that are divided into this world and the next world by death, but it was found that the ancient Chinese tried to overcome the fear of death by believing that the two worlds are not permanently separated and imagining links that would connect them in several forms.In the material aspect, it was considered that the concept of paper money and the use of it for funerals were based on the ancient Chinese's consideration for the dead in terms of a material tribute.The narrative of the next world discussed in this study is an affirmation of life that continues in any form after death, and a representation of an active worldview that does not consider death as the end of everything. The love, regrets, sorrows, and desires depicted as experienced by the living and the dead in these stories are not new to us today.

AB  - This article studies the education of the church that instills a new worldview and a story of hope through catechesis in the reality that school is distorted due to the prevailing worldview, and students suffer from academic stress and move away from faith. This study supports students to discover God's calling by interpreting the story of the Bible and to understand the meaning of their studies anew according to that calling to form a holistic faith in adolescence.This study accepts the realm of study as the realm of God's reign and uses the Christian worldview to reconstruct students' world of schoolwork. In addition, comprehensive understanding of faith helps Christian youth develop their identity by integrating all relationships in their studies and life within the system of faith.Adolescent catechesis should be able to explain the doctrines constructed from the Bible in connection with the daily interests of the students. In this respect, today’s catechesis requires a worldview and lifeview interpretation,  and can help students to understand the important life tasks in adolescence in a new biblical-doctrinal structure. I hope that the Korean church can prepare today’s catechesis for youth by denomination or in a united effort so that they can build pillars of faith for their present and future. I propose that the catechesis in the church should be based on the historical-religious creed of the Reformed faith (Belgic Confession of Faith, Heidelberg Catechism, and the Canons of Dordt) and in the language and context applicable to today’s youth.First of all, in this paper, we focus on the Our World Belongs to God: A Contemporary Testimony, which contains biblical insights on modern issues of the 21st century, based on the religious education books of the historical Reformed Church(Belgic Confession of Faith, Hidelberg Catechesim,  and the Cannons of Dordt), by the American CRC denomination, a descendant of the Dutch Reformed Church. This paper provides a model of catechesis for Korean high school students by using this Contemporary Testimony.

AB  - Objectives This study was conducted for the purpose of in-depth exploration of the meaning of learning derived from the process of youth forming groups voluntarily and experiencing social activities based on the three-dimensional model of experiential learning.Methods This study was conducted as a qualitative case study method. First, through the literature review, the researchers' initial problem consciousness, the main point and problem of research were drawn. Second, in order to collect qualitative data, in-depth interviews were conducted after selecting 6 research participants through intentional sampling among young people who had been social active for more than 5 years. The average active years of the study participants was 6 years and 8 months, and their average age was 26 years. Third, qualitative data analysis was conducted through constant comparison method, and in the categorized process, the words and phrase used by study participants were utilized. Finally, to get the validity and reliability of the research results, triangulation, researchers’ check and peer-review were performed.Results First, the content dimension consisted of six categories related to knowledge, understanding, and function, and derived the meaning of learning that youth found opportunities to understand themselves in accidental situations by participating in social activities. Second, the incentive dimension consisted of six categories of motivation, will, and emotion, and it was derived as a meaning of learning that youth actively explored new methods to maintain balance between their minds and bodies. Third, the social dimension consisted of five categories related to behavior, dialogue, and cooperation, and was derived as a meaning of learning that an individual's worldview was expanded through interactions between various resources related to youth.Conclusions The suggestion for the above research results was that first, it should be viewed as a research object and learner that could characterize youth in various ways. Second, learner participation should be discussed from a broad perspective that encompasses how to help learners utilize knowledge in connection with outside of the educational system. Third, educational institutions should seek an open learning ecosystem that considers not only the area of education and learning, but also the daily life of individuals. Fourth, educational support should be provided considering that the current youth requires an experience suitable for themselves.

TI  - Downscaling solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence for field-scale cotton yield estimation by a two-step convolutional neural network
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest cotton-growing region in China, Xinjiang has contributed more than 80% of the total national cotton production in recent years. Timely and accurate estimation of cotton yield in Xinjiang is important for sustainable agricultural development and food security. However, most current studies have been devoted to the linkage of crop yield with remotely sensed reflectance and climate parameters. This has caused numerous uncertainties due to that these explanatory variables are unable to quickly reflect the actual photosynthetic dynamics of crops. Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), as a direct proxy of plant photosynthesis (gross primary productivity, GPP), has recently been suggested to be a promising method for crop yield estimation, but the spatial resolution of current SIF products derived from satellites is usually very low (such as Global 000-2 SIF (GOSIF): 0.05 degrees). This greatly limited the ability of SIF to accurately estimate field-scale cotton yield in Xinjiang. Here, we first proposed a two-step convolutional neural network (CNN) strategy to downscale the monthly GOSIF products sequentially from 0.05 degrees, 0.005 degrees to 0.0005 degrees to match the size of cotton field parcels, and then linear regression and random forest (RF) regression were respectively conducted using the monthly downscaled SIF product (CNN-SIF) to assess its feasibility to estimate field-scale yield. Results showed that the proposed stepwise approach for downscaling GOSIF worked well, indicating a high goodness of fit (R-2 > 0.85) with the referenced SIF as well as strong correlations to both GPP products and fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) (the median r > 0.90). On this basis, preferable accuracies (the optimal R-2 = 0.62 and the ratio of prediction to deviation = 1.64) were also achieved for our proposed cotton yield estimation models in the Mosuowan region, Xinjiang only by the 0.0005 degrees SIF products. With the assistance of NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), the higher performance was given (R-2 = 0.67 and RPD = 1.72). This study reveals the importance of finerresolution SIF products for accurate crop yield estimation and offers a promising and practical approach for estimating agricultural yield, especially for fragmented farmlands.

TI  - Red tide monitoring method in coastal waters of Hebei Province based on decision tree classification
T2  - APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND NONLINEAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the water characteristics of the coastal waters of Hebei Province, this paper selects the data of the Marine Environmental Quality Bulletin of Hebei Province from 2009 to 2018 published on the website of the Department of Natural Resources of Hebei Province, and proposes a red tide monitoring method based on decision tree classification for the pre-processed MODIS 1B image data. The most important thing in the construction of decision tree is the determination of threshold, and this process is finally determined according to the value of Entropy. In this paper, the newly constructed red tide monitoring method is used to extract the occurrence area of red tide and count the red tide area. Finally, the decision tree classification method is compared with other typical red tide monitoring methods. The experimental results show that the red tide occurrence area and statistical area extracted by the red tide monitoring method based on decision tree classification are closer to the data displayed in the Ocean Bulletin, which demonstrates that this method is suitable for red tide monitoring in the coastal waters of Hebei Province.

TI  - Improved retrievals of aerosol optical depth and fine mode fraction from GOCI geostationary satellite data using machine learning over East Asia
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and Fine Mode Fraction (FMF) are important information for air quality research. Both are mainly obtained from satellite data based on a radiative transfer model, which requires heavy computation and has uncertainties. We proposed machine learning-based models to estimate AOD and FMF directly from Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) reflectances over East Asia. Hourly AOD and FMF were estimated for 00-07 UTC at a spatial resolution of 6 km using the GOCI reflectances, their channel differences (with 30-day minimum reflectance), solar and satellite viewing geometry, meteorological data, geographical information, and the Day Of the Year (DOY) as input features. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning approaches were applied and evaluated using random, spatial, and temporal 10-fold cross-validation with ground-based observation data. LightGBM (R-2 = 0.89-0.93 and RMSE = 0.071-0.091 for AOD and R-2 = 0.67-0.81 and RMSE = 0.079-0.105 for FMF) and RF (R-2 = 0.88-0.92 and RMSE = 0.080-0.095 for AOD and R-2 = 0.59-0.76 and RMSE = 0.092-0.118 for FMF) agreed well with the in-situ data. The machine learning models showed much smaller errors when compared to GOCI-based Yonsei aerosol retrieval and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Dark Target and Deep Blue algorithms. The Shapley Additive exPlanations values (SHAP)-based feature importance result revealed that the 412 nm band (i. e., ch01) contributed most in both AOD and FMF retrievals. Relative humidity and air temperature were also identified as important factors especially for FMF, which suggests that considering meteorological conditions helps improve AOD and FMF estimation. Besides, spatial distribution of AOD and FMF showed that using the channel difference features to indirectly consider surface reflectance was very helpful for AOD retrieval on bright surfaces.

AB  - The symbolic system of game graphics is information about games and enables linguistic communication between players. Game visual effects, one of the game graphics elements, provide special visual effects on the character, background, and interface to convey information about the character’s state or current behavior, and is limited by computer technology, but is also the most noticeable visual fun factor in game graphics. Since it is expressed as an abstract image, it is important to visualize the implied and symbolic meaning for information transmission. <World of Warcraft> is MMORPG where the expression of the character’s skill visual effects is important due to the strong content of PVP (Player VS Player) due to the confrontation between the Horde and the Alliance camp. By classifying the visual effects of <World of Warcraft> into attack and weakening/recovery and reinforcement, this study finds archetypes shared in the unconsciousness of mankind reproduced in the game visual effect and analyzes the meaning of symbols.Historically, humans have created very similar myths and images, and in between there existed archetypes, the same order that penetrated them. The human archetypes are reproduced through symbols, and it requires a high degree of creative imagination to create a new symbol. The form shown in game visual effects has a universal symbol that can be obtained without our recognition, and players interpret and learn symbols through imagination while playing the game.The symbolic expression of the form conveys the meaning of game visual effects and at the same time stimulates the player’s imagination to immerse himself in the game. As a result of the study, game visual effects showed that the universal form, archetype of mankind, was recreated by imagination to express symbolism related to the worldview of the game, and that a unique symbolic system was built, not just an image.

AB  - Game graphics provide players with a sense of immersion, leading to active participation. This paper aims to analyze the mythological meaning for symbolic design of game skill visual effects that reproduce the narrative and the worldview of games borrowing myths. The research method classified the visual effect image into a symbol of the form of a universal archetype representation and a symbol of color expressing the narrative in the game, and analyzed it by applying Roland Barthes' semiological scheme. Through this study, it was possible to analyze the meaning of visual effects as a mythical meaning that can be universally sympathized and an implicit meaning that symbolizes the narrative of the game. The symbolic expression of the visual effect, which reproduces the narrative of the game reflecting the myth, can induce players to engage and participate, and the design direction was intended to provide the visual effect to have a unique symbolism that reflects the game's mythical worldview of the game.

AB  - Storytelling of games creates a worldview based on various mythological stories, and game graphics create a virtual world that fits the worldview. Game graphics, which symbolize storytelling, enable immersion and experience in the game worldview, and in particular, color is an important graphic element in charge of linguistic functions. The method in which the symbolic meaning of color is generated by storytelling was studied by classifying the colors expressed in game graphics by magic schools and analyzing the narratives related to characters and environments. According to the research results, it was confirmed that color acts as a functional element of storytelling. Through this study, I propose that the color symbol method that allows players to experience the narrative of the game can be a useful design method in game graphics production.

TI  - SFR-Net: Scattering Feature Relation Network for Aircraft Detection in Complex SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aircraft detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images plays a significant role in dynamic monitoring and national security. Previous methods have difficulty in obtaining the desirable detection performance due to the interference of complex scenes and diversity of aircraft sizes. In order to solve these problems, we propose an innovative scattering feature relation network (SFR-Net) in this article. First, considering that the strong scattering points of the aircraft in SAR images are usually discrete, we leverage the proposed scattering point relation module to fulfill the analysis and correlation of scattering points. By enhancing the characteristics and relationships among the scattering points, this method is beneficial to guarantee the completeness of aircraft detection results. Second, we design a salient fusion module to adaptively aggregate the features from different layers of SFR-Net with rich semantic information and plentiful details, which can highlight the significant objects with different sizes and enhance the distinguishable features. Third, to reduce the false alarm and improve the localization accuracy, the contextual feature attention is presented to capture the global spatial and semantic information with a large receptive field. Overall, the SFR-Net is designed based on the SAR imaging mechanism and the scattering characteristics of aircrafts. The extensive experiments are conducted on the SAR aircraft detection dataset (AIRD) from the Gaofen-3 satellite to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SFR-Net and also illustrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - THE ADVENTURES OF "NEOLIBERALISM"
T2  - LOGOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper examines the genealogy and metamorphosis of the term "neoliberalism" as one of the most fashionable and widespread concepts, actively used today in wide array of social disciplines from sociology, history, and geography to anthropology and gender studies. Neoliberalism is regarded by its critics as the most successful ideology in the whole history. It is argued to constitute the meaning and essence of the modern era and to be the cause of all the problems of today's world - inequality, poverty, climate change, globalization, financial crises, the COVID-19 pandemic, etc. The first part analyzes the unique features of this concept: the absence of real "neoliberals," pejorativeness, ideological asymmetry (existence only in the lexicon of leftist theorists), semantic emptiness, vastness. The second part examines five different historical incarnations of neoliberalism, from the original one, which emerged in the first decades of the twentieth century, to the contemporary one.Neoliberalism 1 was born in Austria in the 1920s due to efforts of Marxist and protonazi authors. Neoliberalism 2 originated from the famous economist and sociologist Alexander Rustow, a member of the German Ordoliberal circle. Neoliberalism 3 appeared in Latin America in the 1970s, when leftist intellectuals began to label in such a way the economic reforms in Chile under Augusto Pinochet. Neoliberalism 4 was the intellectual brainchild of the French philosopher Michel Foucault, who chose the term as the generic term for all schools of "economic" liberalism. Finally, modern Neoliberalism 5 emerged as a hybrid of Neoliberalism 3 and Neoliberalism 4. In the course of these metamorphoses, "neoliberalism" has changed its meaning and evaluative character more than once. The author concludes that "neoliberalism" is a key element in the worldview of contemporary leftist intellectuals, where it takes the form of a faceless metaphysical evil that spreads its wings over all mankind and leads it from one disaster to another.

AB  - Single image super resolution (SISR) technology has been attracted much attention from remote sensing community due to its proven potentials in remote sensing applications. Existing SISR techniques varying from conventional interpolation methods to different network architectures. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are one of the latest network architectures proven a greater potential as a SISR method whereas least attention has been given by the remote sensing community. Several studies have already been carried out on this context. However, yet there is no generalized GAN based approach to super resolve remote sensing imageries. Therefore, this study investigated the potentials of enhanced super resolution generative adversarial (ESRGAN) model to super resolve very high to medium resolution images from high to coarse resolution images for remote sensing applications. Two models were trained and Worldview-3 (WV3) images used as for very high resolution images. Whereas, down sampled WV3 and Sentinel-2(S2) were used as low resolution counterparts. Model performances were qualitatively and quantitatively analysed using standard metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, UIQI, CC, SAM, SID. Evaluation results emphasised super resolved images were preserved the original quality of the satellite images to a greater extent while improving its ground resolution.

TI  - Response Spectra-Based Post-Earthquake Rapid Structural Damage Estimation Approach Aided with Remote Sensing Data: 2020 Samos Earthquake
T2  - BUILDINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective post-event emergency management contributes substantially to communities' earthquake resilience, and one of the most crucial actions following an earthquake is building damage assessment. On-site inspections are dangerous, expensive, and time-consuming. Remote sensing techniques have shown great potential in localizing the most damaged regions and thus guiding aid and rescue operations in recent earthquakes. Furthermore, to prevent post-earthquake casualties, heavily damaged, unsafe buildings must be identified immediately since in most earthquakes, strong aftershocks can cause such buildings to collapse. The potential of the response spectrum concept for being associated with satellite-based remote sensing data for post-earthquake structural damage estimation was investigated in this study. In this respect, a response spectra-based post-earthquake structural damage estimation method aided by satellite-based remote sensing data was proposed to classify the buildings after an earthquake by prioritizing them based on their expected damage levels, in order to speed up the damage assessment process of critical buildings that can cause casualties in a possible strong aftershock. A case study application was implemented in the Bayrakli region in Izmir, Turkey, the most affected area by the Samos earthquake, on 30 October 2020. The damage estimations made in this research were compared with the in situ damage assessment reports prepared by the Republic of Turkey Ministry of Environment and Urbanization experts. According to the accuracy assessment results, the sensitivity of the method is high (91%), and the necessary time spent by the in situ damage assessment teams to detect the critical buildings would have been significantly reduced for the study area.

AB  - Today, water resources, which are one of the important environmental issues, are of vital importance for life. Monitoring of lakes with remote sensing technologies has become popular in recent years. The management of the lakes with the right policies is crucial in terms of protection and sustainability. In this study, the spatial and temporal changes of Terkos Lake, one of the most important drinking water resources of Istanbul, were examined using satellite images between 2000 and 2020. In order to analyze this temporal change in the water surface area of Terkos Lake, 1160 existing Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI images were processed on the Google Earth Engine cloud platform. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to extract the water surface of the lake. The obtained water surface areas were evaluated with annual and seasonal trends. According to the results, the water surface area of the lake in 2000 and 2020 was compared. There is 6.9% decrease in 2020 compared to 2000. When the main reasons for this decrease are investigated, it is determined that the lake is in danger of extinction due to the rapid population growth and unstable precipitation regime in Istanbul.

TI  - Automatic Color Detection-Based Method Applied to Sentinel-1 SAR Images for Snow Avalanche Debris Monitoring
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we develop a novel method to automatically detect areas of snow avalanche debris using a color space segmentation technique applied to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image time series through January 2018 in the Swiss Alps. Debris avalanche zones are detected assuming that these areas are characterized by a significant and localized increase in SAR signal relative to the surrounding environment. We undertake a sensitivity study by calculating debris products by varying the D-M reference images (a stable reference image taken several weeks before the event). We examine the results according to the direction of the orbit, the characteristics of the terrain (slope, altitude, orientation), and also by evaluating the relevance of the detection with the help of an independent SPOT database by Hafner and Buhler [1] including 18 737 avalanche events. Small avalanches are not detected by SAR images, and depending on the orientation of the terrain some avalanches are not detected by either the ascending or the descending orbit. The detection results vary with the reference image; best detection results are obtained with some selected individual dates with almost 70% of verified avalanche events using the ascending orbit.

TI  - Farmers' Cultural Biases and Adaptation Behavior towards Drought: A Case in Sistan Plain
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent droughts have aroused extensive concerns on crop and food production in the world. Since agricultural sector is the leading water consumer in Iran and farmers are most vulnerable to drought, a correct understanding of farmers' adaptation behavior towards drought can help policymakers develop proper drought-coping policies and strategies. The present study aimed to investigate farmers' drought adaptation behavior and the effect of cultural biases on it among farmers in the Sistan Plain, Iran. A sample of 361 farmers was taken by the multi-stage randomization technique. The measurement instrument was a questionnaire whose face validity was confirmed by a panel of experts and its reliability was estimated by calculating Cronbach's Alpha in a pilot study. The results showed that the worldview of the farmers had a significant effect on their attitude, social norms, and perceived behavioral control. Also, behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control had a significant positive effect on the farmers' drought adaptation behavior. It is concluded that farmers' worldviews may be involved in the process of drought adaptation behavior and can influence their attitude, social norms, and perceived behavior control directly, and their intention and behavior indirectly.

TI  - THE TRADITIONALISM OF RENE GUENON IN THE DISCOURSE OF PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY AND SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides a complex analysis of the problems of traditionalism in the teaching of Rene Guenon, a famous French philosopher author of works on metaphysics, symbolism and initiation. Attention is drawn to the fact that traditionalism sublimated and produced a theoretical formulation of ideals, systems, values aimed at the conscious cultivation of this worldview. The roots of the philosophical reflection of traditionalism, which originated in ancient times, starting with ancient Chinese and ancient Indian philosophy, through ancient Greek philosophy to its modern doctrines, are analyzed. The concept of Tradition, which Guenon defined as the so-called Primordial Tradition, is considered. A comparative analysis of the problem of intellectual intuition of Rene Guenon and Henri Bergson in the context of social philosophy is carried out. Particular attention is paid to the concept of Rene Guenon's philosophy of history, in which the basic position is occupied by the theory of cosmic cycles based on the cosmology of Hinduism.

TI  - A Deep Learning Model for Road Damage Detection After an Earthquake Based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Field Datasets
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is a new assessment of damaged roads after the Kumamoto earthquake in southern Japan (2016) using remotely sensed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, field data and deep learning. Three SAR images from descending orbits of Sentinel-1 in vertical-vertical polarizations are considered for radiometric calibration, geocoding and interferometric analyses. Field data in terms of the international roughness index (IRI) were gathered over more than 530 km using a smartphone accelerometer and the BumpRecorder application. The relationship between SAR data and IRI data was investigated in a binary (0 and 1) mode to establish a multilayer perceptron model of damaged and intact roads. We found the remote sensing SAR datasets suitable, not only for the detection of damaged roads, but also as an indicator of road roughness changes. The classification results for damaged and intact roads indicated that our datasets (SAR and field measurements), together with a deep learning model, yielded acceptable overall accuracy (87.1%).

AB  - Super-resolution is used to recover high resolution images from low resolution images. We use this concept in a slightly different context to achieve higher quality knowledge from low resolution satellite images. The technique involves transfer learning from high to low resolution images using a Gaussian Process Regression model. We use high resolution drone images to train the model. This technique is applied in three case studies to verify the consistency of results in case of NDVI computation. However, the same technique can be applied to obtain for other application of satellite images in plant vigor assessment.

TI  - A Framework for Interactive Visual Interpretation of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning methods have shown tremendous success in understanding earth observation data; however, recently, there is a rising claim toward explainable machine learning approaches. Concerned researchers found interpretable visualizations to be greatly helpful in understanding how a model works. In this research, we propose a framework for interactive and interpretable visualization of remote sensing data using two machine learning models and an Elasticsearch (ES) database. Two explainable machine learning models, namely, bag-of-visual-words (BoVWs) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) are chosen to model the data in an unsupervised manner and give a textual representation. The textualized remote sensing data are stored in an ES database. This framework offers several fast content-based search functionalities exploiting the full-text query capabilities of ES based on the respective representations and also offers an efficient storage mechanism for the data.

CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - In recent years, we have been dealing with the dynamic technological progress of the space sector, which allows for the observation of the Earth with better temporal, spatial and spectral resolution. The increasing availability of satellite data has contributed to the development of data processing algorithms Thanks to the use of digital image processing methods and deep neural networks, it is possible to perform automatic image classification, segmentation or detection and recognition of objects on the images. This article presents the methodology that allows to accelerate the classification process of satellite images representing the Amazon rainforest based on the Transfer Learning method. Additionally, the influence of the choice of optimization, i.e. the network weight estimation strategy, on the classification of objects was checked. In order to verify the method, an additional raster image classifier was created on the basis of Lidar data. Research shows that the transfer learning method allows the preparation of an image classifier based on a small database (less than 100 images representing one class). The network training process can be shortened to a few minutes.

TI  - Using Super-Resolution Algorithms for Small Satellite Imagery: A Systematic Review
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, we have witnessed significant development in the space sector, in particular regarding Earth imaging. Small satellites, whose size and construction make their production much cheaper, are becoming increasingly popular. As a result, a larger number of satellites may be placed in space, and thus, they may perform more frequent observations of selected spots on Earth. Unfortunately, the construction of these satellites also affects their observation capacity as they have a weaker spatial resolution. Scientists have been dealing with the problem of improving the spatial resolution of satellite imaging for many years. Numerous methods were developed that allow for the best possible representation of high-resolution images based on low-resolution images. However, the application of traditional solutions to improve the resolution of digital images requires an additional high-resolution image. As far as images obtained by small satellites (e.g., nano, micro, or mini) are concerned, the difference between the spatial resolution of panchromatic and multispectral images is small (e.g., for SkySat-3 - SkySat-15 satellites, it is only 0.16 m). The need to increase the spatial resolution of an image that does not have a corresponding higher resolution image (e.g., a panchromatic image or a sequence of images) causes additional problems. This article presents a review of the methods to improve the spatial resolution of small-satellite imaging. The authors analyze the interpolation, pansharpening, and digital image processing methods. Additionally, the article focuses on presenting solutions based on deep learning that enables the enhancement of the spatial resolution of images obtained from small satellites. The methodology of creating databases used for network training is described. Finally, the authors present the main limitations of the analyzed solutions and future development trends that will enable to improve the spatial resolution with the use of a single image.

TI  - Long-term spatial and temporal shoreline changes of the Evinos River delta, Gulf of Patras, Western Greece
T2  - ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GEOMORPHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study deals with the long-term shoreline displacement of the Evinos River delta in Western Greece using various geospatial data sets from different sources. The comparison between the extracted coastlines allowed us to identify segments where the delta progrades and parts of the delta that are being eroded over the periods 1945-1969 and 1969-2015. Coastal area variations giving land losses or gains of the most active sectors of the delta associated with changes in shoreline position were calculated over the periods 1993-2002 and 2002-2018 using Landsat TM satellite images. The results showed that nearly 46% of the Evinos delta is in retreat. Erosion is essentially affecting the eastern deltaic shoreline with retreat rates commonly reaching up to 8 m/yr in places. In addition, the area of the artificially closed pre-1959 mouth of the river has retreated at an average rate of 14 m/yr over the past 57 years. The old natural mouth of the river (depicted in a map of 1885) at Akra Evinou (Cape Evinos) has retreated up to 350 m (5 m/yr) over the last 71 years. West of the active river mouth, mobile elongated features such as sand spits and barriers are formed by deposition of sediment produced by the erosion of the abandoned eastern delta coastline. The main natural cause of the long-term Evinos River delta coastline displacements is the nearshore current activity induced by the dominant incoming wind generated waves. Land loss of the active part of the delta (at rates up to 16,797 m2/yr) has been recorded over the period 2002-2018. This generalized erosion can be attributed to human activities that include: the construction of a dam in the upper reaches of the catchment that dramatically decreased the suspended sediment concentrations in the delta, the extensive sand and gravel mining in the distributary channel, and a small earth dam constructed at the apex of the delta for irrigation purposes.

TI  - THE CONTEMPORARY PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE: AN ETERNAL RETURN
T2  - EPISTEMOLOGY & PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE-EPISTEMOLOGIYA I FILOSOFIYA NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article explores the contemporary philosophy of science in the context of the idea of eternal return. The problematization of the intellectual field "after postpositivism" runs through the re-newed questions "what?", "how?", "who?" and "for what?" of scientific research. This questioning is a search for bearings in the historical space and time that determines "after what?" or "back to whom?" the thinking about science unfolds. Such a reflexive appeal to the origins leads to the ideas of the philosophy of sci-ence of the first half of the twentieth century. It is then that the main differences within the research of science were formed: between sociological and methodological approaches, between philosophy and disciplines that study science, between the goals of forming a worldview and managing science. The philosophy of science "after postpositivism" expresses itself in the controver-sial interpretation of the subject matter and method of the study of science, in the division of labor between disciplines and ap-proaches that lose the possibility of constructive interaction and reach the point of "science wars". In conclusion, it is argued that philosophy as the "hard core" of scientific research, a historical appeal to the origins of scientific activity and the interpretation of the scientific revolution as a renewal of tradition can make such modernity valuable for return.

T2  - SOUTH OF RUSSIA-ECOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. Assess the change in the hydrological regime of the Torey Lakes based on a probabilistic forecast of the parameters of the water balance of these reservoirs, taking into account anthropogenic influence. Material and Methods. The study used materials from the state observation network of Roshydromet, Earth remote sensing data, research materials from scientific organisations and other sources of information that are in the public domain. Methods of statistical data analysis, mathematical modeling, hydrological calculations, including the water balance method and methods of processing and decoding satellite information were used. Results. With the implementation of the planned water management project, accompanied by additional non-returnable water consumption in Mongolia, the consequences for the water regime of the Torey Lakes can be significant, especially in the low-water phase of the water cycle, when the level decrease in the Barun-Torey Lake will average 70 cm and in Zun-Torey - 80 cm. Through this project, the faster drying of the lakes, on average 2-3 years earlier, will be avoided. Conclusions. The ecological systems of the Dauria region are characterized by a process of cyclic succession and are mainly adapted to the contemporary climatic moisture cycle. For these ecosystems, any changes in external factors are fundamentally important, since they can lead to the irreversibility of natural processes. Based on the results obtained in this study, it is possible to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the anthropogenic impact on the state of the Torey Lakes and nearby ecosystems.

M3  - Article
AB  - The temperature increase is one of the indicators of global warming. Therefore, Land Surface Temperature (LST) trends can be used to identify climate change. The objectives of this study were (i) to analyze the trend of LST change in Chiang Mai province (ii) to investigate the suitable models for predicting LST in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The observation data used in this study were obtained from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST Data on the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) website and referred to as LST MODIS. The data were collected every 8 days from January 1, 2001, to December 27, 2020 (920 observations).The data were split into 70%-30% proportions for training and checking datasets, respectively. In this study, the simple linear regression was used to analyze trends of the average LST change over 20 years. It is found that, the average LST in Chiang Mai province has been slightly increasing around 0.0184 degrees Celsius per year. The autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model has been applied for predicting LST, and the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-squared) were used to measure the model performance. The results showed that ARIMA(2,0,0) model had the smallest RMSE for both training and checking data sets. In addition, all fitted ARIMA models can describe the LST with R-squared ranging from 0.6404 -0.7871.

AB  - Forecasting crop phenology helps in crop production estimation, irrigation scheduling and crop identification. In this article, we propose a methodology that uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from the bands of an optical multispectral satellite (Sentinel-2) data for forecasting crop phenology stages using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. Firstly, the LSTM network is built for forecasting the NDVI values of the potato crop, until the end of the season. Then the crop phenology estimation technique is applied to this forecast data to obtain the phenology points. The potato plots considered for the study were grown around the Gujarat state in India. The performance of the LSTM network on the test dataset is given by MAE approximate to 0.19, MSE approximate to 0.06 and RMSE approximate to 0.23, and the phenology points are detected with a mean deviation of +/- 10 days.

AB  - Monitoring the status of the vegetation is required for nature conservation. This monitoring task is time consuming as kilometers of area have to be investigated and classified. To make this task more manageable, remote sensing is used. The acquisition of airplane remote sensing data is dependent on weather conditions and permission to fly in the busy airspace above the Netherlands. These conditions make it difficult to get a new, dedicated acquisition every year. Therefore, alternatives for this dependency on dedicated airplane surveys are needed. One alternative is the use of optical satellite imagery, as this type of data has improved rapidly in the last decade both in terms of resolution and revisit time. For this study, 0.5 m resolution satellite imagery from the Superview satellite is combined with geometric height data from the Dutch national airborne LiDAR elevation data set AHN. Goal is to classify vegetation into three different classes: sand, grass and trees, apply this classification to multiple epochs, and analyze class transition patterns. Three different classification methods were compared: nearest centroid, random forest and neural network. We show that outcomes of all three methods can be interpreted as class probabilities, but also that these probabilities have different properties for each method. The classification is implemented for 11 different epochs on the Meijendel en Berkheide dunal area on the Dutch coast. We show that mixed probabilities (i.e. between two classes) agree well with class transition processes, and conclude that a shallow neural network combined with pure training samples applied on four different bands (RGB + relative DSM height) produces satisfactory results for the analysis of vegetation transitions with accuracies close to 100%.

TI  - What Has Hybridity Got to Do with Ecology? What Christian-Buddhist Hybridity-as-Hermeneutical-Lens Can Suggest to the Theological Conversation on Ecology
T2  - BUDDHIST-CHRISTIAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay offers some insights that "hybridity" utilized as a hermeneutical para-digm might contribute to the wider theological conversations going on about the global ecological crisis. The hybridity in question here is-what can be expressed as a-"Christian-Buddhist hybridity." That refers to a sensibility that seriously takes into consideration the two spiritual-religious traditions of Christianity and Buddhism as a "hybrid way" to view the world in general and spiritual-religious- theological themes in particular.This study will argue that, despite the significant gains in the Catholic Christian reflection on ecology achieved through Pope Francis' Laudato Si', it cannot be denied that Christian theology in general, as well as how it treats ecological themes in par-ticular, is still fundamentally characterized by an anthropocentric focus that dualisti-cally distinguishes too strongly between humans, on the one hand, and nature, on the other. Thus, Christian theological reflection on ecology might be helped and complemented by utilizing a nondual and unitive paradigm. One such paradigm is the Buddhist teaching on interbeing as expressed, for example, by teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh.Moreover, the goal of hybridity (as a hermeneutical tool) is to build a world in which the thick wall between "us" and "them" can be hammered and broken down in favor of a new worldview in which the intimate connections among different worlds are highlighted and in which the presence of what we typically consider "other" is increasingly found within our very own selves. In that sense, Buddhism and aspects of the Dharma about Sunyata or Emptiness do seem to be a more effective means to realize hybridity's goal of overcoming and transcending the radical divide between "us" and "them" (with "them" in this case being "Nature").

TI  - Radiation Belt Model Including Semi-Annual Variation and Solar Driving (Sentinel)
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth's outer radiation belt response to geospace disturbances is extremely variable spanning from a few hours to several months. In addition, the numerous physical mechanisms, which control this response depend on the electron energy, the timescale, and the various types of geospace disturbances. As a consequence, various models that currently exist are either specialized, orbit-specific data-driven models, or sophisticated physics-based ones. In this paper, we present a new approach for radiation belt modeling using Machine Learning methods driven solely by Solar wind speed and pressure, Solar flux at 10.7 cm, and the angle controlling the Russell-McPherron effect (theta(RM)). We show that the model can successfully reproduce and predict the electron fluxes of the outer radiation belt in a broad energy (0.033-4.062 MeV) and L-shell (2.5-5.9) range, and moreover, it can capture the long-term modulation of the semi-annual variation. We also show that the model can generalize well and provide successful predictions, even outside of the spatio-temporal range it has been trained with, using > $ > $0.8 MeV electron flux measurements from GOES-15/EPEAD at a geostationary orbit.

AB  - This paper focuses on understanding the temporal behaviour of Ice Aprons (IAs) in the Mont-Blanc massif using high resolution SAR coherence matrix. InSAR coherence is estimated between all possible pairs of TerraSAR-X images acquired in 2009 and 2011 as well as between PAZ images acquired in 2020, both at 11-day interval. The results show that coherence values in summer are higher in 2020 than in 2009 and 2011. Coherence matrices are also computed for different regions of a glacial system. The results are compared with those of IAs to understand the differences in their temporal and physical behaviours. In summer, all IAs show an increase in coherence values, while other glacier regions show very low or no coherence. This information could be useful for automatic classification methods, where IAs could be classified separately as a different class from the other types of glaciers.

TI  - MONITORING HANGING GLACIER DYNAMICS FROM SAR IMAGES USING CORNER REFLECTORS AND FIELD MEASUREMENTS IN THE MONT-BLANC MASSIF

AB  - This paper focuses on the monitoring of a small hanging glacier with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using a combination of artificial Corner Reflectors (CRs) and dGNSS field measurements. First, to test the performance of the CRs in high-resolution X-band and medium-resolution C-band images acquired by PAZ and Sentinel-1 satellites respectively, a series of tests was performed with two CRs installed in the Chamonix valley. After the confirmation of good visibility in the valley datasets from both satellites, four CRs were installed in summer 2021 on a steep (approximate to 52 degrees average slope) hanging glacier on the North face of Aiguille du Midi (3842 m a.s.l., Mont-Blanc massif). After the successful installation on the hanging glacier, all CRs were visible in both sets of images (PAZ and Sentinel-1). Using the CRs as a reference, glacier displacements were estimated in SAR images using complex cross-correlation, and validated by using ground measurements (dGNSS) and theoretical relationships between ice thickness and surface velocity. We observed average summer velocities of approximate to 0.05 m/day at the front of the glacier from field measurements and approximate to 0.04 m/day from SAR displacement estimates. The study shows the potential and limitations of using CRs as a tool for monitoring glaciers in complex topographies.

TI  - Being in Photography: Photosophy of Arvydas Sliogeris and Henry Parland
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article two different authors are compared: a Finnish-Swedish writer Henry Parland and a Lithuanian philosopher Arvydas Sliogeris. They are compared in the sense of the philosophy of photography. Alternatively, if to apply the term of Sliogeris' phototography philosophy, these two authors are compared in terms of their photo-sophy. The article analyzes Parland's city multicultural worldview as in contrast to Sliogeris's worldview of Lithuanian countryside and nature. Parland's attitude towards the technique of making photos during the period of 1929-1930 while living in Kaunas is discussed. In parallel, the attitude of Sliogeris towards photography technique is discussed, including his entire photosophy, which explains why he is against photo art and what is photo-truth. Also attention is given to the age difference of these two intellectuals as well as their life style - one of them dies at the age of 22 in 1930 while living bohemian life style, the other dies at 75 in 2019 after philosophically choosing to be a countryside person, intellectually turning his back to Western civilization. Due to the lack of time, Parland did not develop his photosophy, we know only what he wrote in his novel Sonder [To Pieces], whereas Sliogeris develops his photosophy only at the end of his life in 2011 in his book Lietuviskose parastese [In the Lithuanian Margins], although his photo album is published a bit earlier - in 2009.

TI  - Arvydas Sliogeris' Search for "Lithuanian" Being in Painting
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article the author analyzes the search for Being in art according to Arvydas Sliogeris. Although Sliogeris selected the picture of The Great Pine tree painted by Paul Cezanne for his art philosophy - we see that in the book The Thing and Art - the philosopher himself is very Lithuanian, his thinking and his theoretical worldview is permeated with Lithuanian spirit. It is especially clear when he interprets Ciurlionis' paintings titled Sonata of the Grass Snake, the vision of the Grass Snake. A Grass Snake, who is sacred in the pagan tradition in Southern part of Lithuania called Dzukija, is interconnected with Sliogeris' philotopia in Dzukija region. From the cultural point of view, it is far away from French region of Provence, which was the inspiration for Cezanne. The article also analyzes why Sliogeris did not choose the sea theme in painting. After all, the openings of Being could be found in the painting of dramatically stormy sea with a sail ship tipping over the waves. By refusing to search for Being in sea paintings, and instead opting for the region of Southern Lithuania, he evidently makes a subjective selection, looking at the world through the prism of the self "I". It is, owever, impossible otherwise. After all, philotopia as such, inevitably presuposes subjectivity.

TI  - Fifty Years of Tidewater Glacier Surface Elevation and Retreat Dynamics along the South-East Coast of Spitsbergen (Svalbard Archipelago)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidewater glaciers on the east coast of Svalbard were examined for surface elevation changes and retreat rate. An archival digital elevation model (DEM) from 1970 (generated from aerial images by the Norwegian Polar Institute) in combination with recent ArcticDEM were used to compare the surface elevation changes of eleven glaciers. This approach was complemented by a retreat rate estimation based on the analysis of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. In total, four of the 11 tidewater glaciers became land-based due to the retreat of their termini. The remaining tidewater glaciers retreated at an average annual retreat rate of 48 m year(-1), and with range between 10-150 m year(-1). All the glaciers studied experienced thinning in their frontal zones with maximum surface elevation loss exceeding 100 m in the ablation areas of three glaciers. In contrast to the massive retreat and thinning of the frontal zones, a minor increase in ice thickness was recorded in some accumulation areas of the glaciers, exceeding 10 m on three glaciers. The change in glacier geometry suggests an important shift in glacier dynamics over the last 50 years, which very likely reflects the overall trend of increasing air temperatures. Such changes in glacier geometry are common at surging glaciers in their quiescent phase. Surging was detected on two glaciers studied, and was documented by the glacier front readvance and massive surface thinning in high elevated areas.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - All-weather satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are widely used to identify surface water bodies when clouds and shadows cause detection errors from optical data. Algorithms for mapping water bodies are often based on determining a threshold value from a backscattering coefficient histogram. The threshold cannot always be found in the case if the "water" and "land" classes are imbalanced. An approach to backscattering coefficient threshold selection is proposed and substantiated in this paper. It is based on a maximum similarity between SAR water mask and the reference mask generated from an optical multispectral satellite image. The parameters of SAR data preprocessing are selected to ensure the best compliance between the optical and SAR water masks. It has been substantiated that the optimal threshold, determined on a reference date, provides high accuracy of water bodies detection on the validation date of observation.

TI  - Bilateral Inflammatory Breast Cancer That Developed Two Years after Treatment for Triple-negative Breast Cancer
T2  - INTERNAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - A 66-year-old woman underwent partial mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy for left breast can-cer; the pathological diagnosis was invasive ductal carcinoma (pT1aN0, pStage I, triple-negative subtype). Postoperative radiotherapy was performed. Two years later, she developed redness and induration at both breasts. The diagnosis was bilateral inflammatory breast cancer. After four cycles of dose-dense epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by 12 weekly paclitaxel cycles, bilateral total mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection were performed. At the one-year follow-up after undergoing operation and radiother-apy, she remained alive without recurrence. Dose-dense treatment regimens may help patients achieve com-plete resection without short-term recurrence.

AB  - Remote sensing of the Earth allows to receive medium information, a high spatial resolution from space vehicles, and to conduct hyperspectral measurements. This study presents a remote sensing application using time-series Landsat satellite images to monitor the solid waste disposal site (WDS). In this work, neural network image processing methods are used as part of the proposed algorithm for computer modeling of the fractal-percolation process of the underlying surface filtrate in remote sensing imaging. Investigations related to the analysis of the filtrate and decryption of space images are carried out using the apparatus of discrete orthogonal transformations and two convolutional neural networks. The first neural network detects a waste disposal facility, the second works to localize the area of the leachate identified based on the first network. The results obtained can serve as a basis for developing a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of measures to neutralize the underlying surface of waste disposal sites from leachate and its seepage into the soil using remote sensing technologies. This technique can become the object of further research on developing a medical-prophylactic expert system at the territorial level for the detection and neutralization of unauthorized waste disposal sites based on medium and high-resolution space images. As a result, the proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in detection the solid waste disposal site on real satellite images.

AB  - Remote sensing of the Earth allows to receive medium information, a high spatial resolution from space vehicles, and to conduct hyperspectral measurements. This study presents a remote sensing application using time-series Landsat satellite images to monitor the solid waste disposal site (WDS). The article proposes algorithms for working with spatial information, namely the transformation (convolution) of these manifolds into a one-dimensional sample. Recursive quasi-continuous sweeps are used for which the following conditions are satisfied: 1) preservation of the topological proximity of the original and expanded spaces, 2) preservation of correlations between the elements of the original and transformed spaces. An automated system is proposed for detecting and investigating waste objects based on the concept of fractal sets and convolutional neural networks. The first neural network detects WDS, the second works to localize the waste objects. This technique can become the object of further research on developing a medical-prophylactic expert system at the territorial level to detect and neutralize unauthorized waste disposal sites based on medium and high-resolution space images. As a result, the proposed method demonstrates good accuracy in detecting the solid waste disposal site on real satellite images.

AB  - As a result of human activity, a huge number of landfills and industrial waste is formed. For timely intervention in the process of environmental pollution from unauthorized landfills and industrial waste, it is necessary to have a global automated (automatic) space monitoring system. A model of such a global system for landfill monitoring is proposed using remote sensing methods from space. Modern methods for designing information systems are applied. Several innovative methodologies have been developed and used in the proposed model. The use of different images from the following satellites is classified: QuickBird; Ikonos; IRS-1C/1D; Landsat 8; RapidEye; WorldView2; NOAA; Terra; Meteor-3M and Radarsat-1.

TI  - Determination of site quality and productivity of <i>Palo Santo</i> forests in northern Argentina
T2  - BOSQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - The general objective of this study was to provide information regarding the productivity and site quality of Palo Santo forests in their Argentinean distribution area in order to establish guidelines for sustainable management and use. We used data taken from 482 plots as part of national, regional and local forest inventories in northern Argentina, carried out in native forests within aboriginal and peasant community tenures and management plans. Basal area, stem volume and dominant height of Palo Santo trees were used to determine site quality class. This was correlated to forest structure by using a classification mosaic from Landsat satellite images. A sustainable cutting cycle duration and harvest intensity for Palo Santo forests were calculated according to their site quality. The results suggest that the current stocks of Palo Santo are sufficient to continue with its sustainable use without compromising its long-term availability. This information is useful for decision makers and defines the potential of the species to provide resources to regional economies and provincial productive development.

AB  - Increasing uncontrolled industrialization causing untreated wastewater and marine traffic, coupled with specific weather conditions makes the Marmara Sea face major challenges, such as the mucilage outbreak in the summer of 2021. Cleaning up the Sea of Marmara will continue to be critical to the long term survival of the fishing industry and tourism, and new methods and techniques for monitoring its behaviour will be important for benchmarking. In this specific context, this paper discusses the potential of using unmixing approaches for the analysis of multispectral images in order to understand and map the abundance of mucilage coverage, in connection with its chemical compositions related to varying levels of aggregation. A WorldView-3 multispectral image, acquired on May 25, 2021, was chosen for the study due to its high spatial resolution and VIS/NIR spectral region. Unmixing provides the spectral characteristics of endmembers (i.e., water, ship and different types mucilage), and the abundance associated with each endmember. Preliminary results were discussed and some research aspects for understanding mucilage phenomena using EO were put forward.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision monitoring of infrastructure using artificial reflectors is possible with freely available Sentinel-1 data, but large reflectors are needed. We find that a triangular trihedral corner reflector should typically have at least 1-m inner leg length. As such large reflectors are often not feasible for use in urban areas for essential infrastructure monitoring, we designed a multiple corner-reflector array to replace a single corner reflector with an inner leg length of 1 m. In this case, we use four reflectors where each of them is a truncated triangular trihedral with an inner leg length of 0.33 m. We measured interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) amplitude, phase, and coherence of this reflector array with various configurations of alignments of the array. We find that as long as great care is taken in the relative positioning of the four corner reflectors, so that they constructively interfere, each horizontal or vertical configuration provides the expected amplitude, coherence, and phase stability. Applications of multiple small corner reflectors in urban areas range from essential infrastructure monitoring (e.g., bridges, overpasses, and tunnel constructions), through assessment of structural health of buildings, to monitoring highway and railway embankments. We show that the multiple corner array works when placed in a single InSAR resolution cell, but depending on the application, the number and projection of corner reflectors can be varied, as long as sufficient signal-to-clutter ratio is achieved in the area of interest.

AB  - Yerba mate belongs to the most important agricultural products of Argentina. Due to climate change, together with El Nino and droughts, yields are negatively affected. Drought propagation from precipitation deficits to plant water stress, its impacts and especially its predictability are becoming an emerging field of research. This paper explores how the future yerba mate production in the states of Misiones and Corrientes, north-eastern Argentina, can be projected by using climate variables and satellite data. The applied methodology focuses on a machine learning approach based on multiple linear regression and random forest regression. The results indicate a significant relationship between yerba mate and the NDVI as well as the SOI. The highest yerba mate productivity is expected during weak La Nina events. The methodology of this analysis can successfully predict mate productivity based on satellite and climate data and can also easily be used for further research areas.

TI  - Documentary Evidence of 17th Century Landcover and Climate Change in Northern China and Mongolia Compared to Modern Spectral Greening Trends
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fighting land degradation of semi-arid and climate-sensitive grasslands are among the most urgent tasks of current eco-political agenda. Particularly, northern China and Mongolia are prone to climate-induced surface transformations, which were reinforced by the heavily increased numbers of livestock during the 20th century. Extensive overgrazing and resource exploitation amplified regional climate change effects and triggered intensified land degradation that forced policy-driven interventions to prevent desertification. In the past, however, the regions have been subject to continuous shifts in environmental and socio-cultural and political conditions, which makes it particularly difficult to distinguish into regional anthropogenic impact and global climate change effects. This article presents analyses of historical written sources, palaeoenvironmental data, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal series from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to compare landcover change during the Little Ice Age (LIA) and current spectral greening trends over the period 2001-2020. Results show that decreasing precipitation and temperature records triggered increased land degradation during the late 17th century in the transition zone from northern China and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region to Mongolia. From current climate change perspectives, modern vegetation shows enhanced physical vegetation response related to an increase in precipitation (Ptotal) and temperature (T). Vegetation response is strongly related to Ptotal and T and an increase in physical plant condition indicates local to regional grassland recovery compared to the past 20-year average.

TI  - FEW SHOT CROP MAPPING USING TRANSFORMERS AND TRANSFER LEARNING WITH SENTINEL-2 TIME SERIES: CASE OF KAIROUAN TUNISIA
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - In this paper, we present an approach to land cover mapping from Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite image time series using deep learning methods in the context of few shots in agricultural areas which aims to learn a classifier to recognize unseen classes during training with limited labelled examples. In many countries, there is a lack of Land Parcel Information Systems (LPIS) and thus of agricultural crop type annotations. Annotations are still based on fastidious digitization of parcels and in-field observations that are available in few numbers. Our idea is to transfer learning from pre-trained models on existing LPIS in France and apply them to a different geographical area in Kairouan in Central Tunisia. We build on work employing multi-headed self-attention mechanisms that have contributed to results that outperform other deep learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in agricultural context using S-2 Time series. We used two transformer-based deep learning models PSE-TAE (Pixel-Set Encoders + Temporal Self-Attention) and PSE-LTAE (Pixel-Set Encoders + Lightweight Temporal Self-Attention). We first studied their generalisation capacity in a few shot context and on different geographical study site. Then, by transferring the knowledge of these models and adapting them to the Tunisian context with the transfer learning techniques we have demonstrated experimentally that the adaptation of these methods is efficient for land cover mapping in agricultural areas with few in-field observations in terms of accuracy with an overall accuracy for both models reaching almost 93% for a detailed classification level with 17 classes.

TI  - Revisiting surgical management of breast cancer in a geriatric population
T2  - REVISTA DA ASSOCIACAO MEDICA BRASILEIRA
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Breast cancer is a leading cause of death not only in the young population but also in the elderly. There are no consensus treatment guidelines for elderly breast cancer patients. We purposed to discuss surgical treatment options for breast cancer cases over 80 years concerning morbidity and mortality.METHODS: This retrospective study includes 58 patients over 80 years of age at the time of surgery for breast cancer between 2006 and 2017. A sum of 58 cases (54 females and 4 males), over 80 years of age, with an average age of 84.5 +/- 4.07 (80-94) years were included in the study. The modified radical mastectomy was the most common surgical modality in 30 (51.7%) cases, and the axillary intervention was performed on 41 (70.7%). Axillary dissection and sentinel lymph node biopsy were performed for 30 (51.7%) and 11 (18.9%) cases, respectively.RESULTS: Minor and major complications were observed in 8 (13.8%) cases. The average follow-up period of the patients was 37.5 (1-120) months. During the follow-up period, breast cancer-related mortality was observed in 9 (15.52%) cases. No statistical differences were detected in mortality with/without axillary intervention and chosen surgical modality.CONCLUSIONS: Comorbidity, the American Society of Anesthesiologists score, and life expectancy should be considered in the management and surgical planning of patients over 80 years of age with breast cancer. Minimally invasive approaches should be preferred for the elderly whenever feasible and applicable in the light of oncologic surgery principles in order to reduce complications and mortality rates.

AB  - African rangelands are threatened by anthropogenic land-use activities, adverse climate phenomena such as droughts, and poor land management. These undermine their capacity to support various fauna and flora, provide ecosystem services, and sustain livestock agriculture, i.e., a key economic activity in Africa. Therefore, preserving the integrity of African rangelands is critical for addressing African food security challenges. Using multi-sensor Earth observation data and Random Forest classifier, this study characterized the spatial distribution of African rangelands, to support grazing and browsing capacity modelling, assessment of rangeland changes, and rangeland management policy development and decision making. The results show that rangelands could be characterised with good accuracies exceeding 70% in most AfriCultuReS pilot countries using the high-resolution land cover map and MCD12Q1 products as training and validation data. The spatial distribution maps can be used as masks that would aid accurate monitoring of rangeland health, productivity, phenology and changes.

TI  - Simple and spatialized approach to optimize irrigation water and wheat yield in the semi-arid areas
T2  - IX INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON IRRIGATION OF HORTICULTURAL CROPS
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Symposium on Irrigation of Horticultural Crops
CL  - Univ Basilicata, Matera, ITALY
AB  - In this study, we developed a simple and spatialized wheat yield method based on the Monteith's three efficiency model. The originality of the method consists in: (1) the expression of the conversion coefficient (epsilon(conv)) by considering an appropriate stress threshold (k(sconv)) for triggering irrigation, (2) the substitution of the product of the two maximum coefficients of interception (epsilon(imax)) and conversion (epsilon(conv_max)) by a single parameter epsilon(max), (3) the modeling of epsilon(max) as a function of the Cumulative Growing Degree Days (CGDD) since sowing date, and (4) the dynamic expression of the harvest index (HI) as a function of the CGDD and the final harvest index (HI0) depending of the maximum values of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The calibration and validation of the proposed model were performed by using observed dry matter (DM) and grain yield (GY) on wheat conducted on the irrigated zone R3 of the Haouz plain (center of Morocco), during three agricultural seasons 2002/2003, 2008/2009 and 2012/2013. The model calibration allowed the parameterization of epsilon(max) in four periods according to the wheat phenological stages. By contrast, a linear evolution was sufficient to represent the relationship between HI and CGDD. The model validation was performed at the field and regional scales. For the field scale, the obtained results showed a good agreement between the estimated and observed values of DM and GY with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of about 1.07 and 0.57 t ha(-1), respectively. Likewise, at the regional scale, the proposed approach was tested over the irrigated district (R3) by using Landsat/spot images for mapping GY and DM. The RMSE values were 1.21 and 0.34 t ha(-1) between measured and simulated DM and GY, respectively.

TI  - On the Exploitation of Multimodal Remote Sensing Data Combination for Mesoscale/Submesoscale Eddy Detection in the Marginal Ice Zone
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection and analysis of ocean eddies via remote sensing have become a hot topic in physical oceanography during the last few decades. However, eddy identification and tracking via remote sensing can be a challenging task, since each sensor has some limitations. In order to overcome potential challenges, it is crucial to exploit the complementary information provided by different sensing systems. As one of the steps toward this aim, we have investigated the pertinence of applying the scheme, including a texture features extraction and a superpixel segmentation method, in order to distinguish eddies in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) using multisensor remote sensing data. Nevertheless, not all the images available from various sensors are of actual importance, since they can be corrupted, redundant, or simply unnecessary for a particular task. Therefore, we are additionally exploring the relevance of different sensors separately and simultaneously as well as with extracted texture features for eddy monitoring.

AB  - This study was conducted on Lake Hamrin situated in Diyala governorate, focal Iraq, between latitudes 44o 53' 26.16 '- 45 degrees 07 ' 28.03" and 34 degrees 04' 24.75" -34 degrees 19' 12.74" . As in this study, the surface area of Hamrin Lake was calculated from satellite images during the period from October 2019 to September 2020, with an average satellite image for each month, furthermore,by utilizing the Normalized Differences Water Index (NDWI), the largest surface area was 264,617 km2 for October and the lowest surface area 140.202 km(2) for September. The surface temperature of the lake water was also calculated from satellite images of the Landsat 8 satellite, based on bands 10 (Thermal Infrared 1) and 11 (Thermal Infrared 2) that are sensitive to thermal radiation, as the highest surface temperature reached in June 45.49 degrees C degrees Celsius due to the high temperatures for this month and the lowest in February 3.09 degrees C degrees Celsius, which is one of the months in which temperatures drop to the lowest level. The utilization of remote sensing and GIS innovations has helped a lot in checking changes, whether in surface area or temperature, which saves effort, time and cost. The results of this study put decision makers in taking the necessary precautions for the seasons of water scarcity and drought to meet the community's water needs in the areas of multiple human consumptions and at the same time take advantage of rainy seasons and water abundance to develop long-term strategic plans to maintain a sustainable water balance.

TI  - Multispectral Image Classification Based on the Bat Algorithm
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are many traditional classification algorithms used to classify multispectral images, especially those used in remote sensing. But the challenges of using these algorithms for multispectral image classification are that they are slow to implement and have poor classification accuracy. With the development of technologies that mimic nature, many researchers have resorted to using intelligent algorithms instead of traditional algorithms because of their great importance, especially when dealing with large amounts of data. The bat algorithm (BA) is one of the most important of these algorithms. This study aims to verify the possibility of using the BA to classify the multispectral images captured by the Landsat-5 TM satellite image of the study area. The study area represents the Mosul area located in the Nineveh Governorate in northwestern Iraq. The purpose is not only to study the ability of the BA to classify multispectral images but also to obtain a land cover map of this region. The BA showed efficiency in the classification results compared to Maximum Likelihood (ML), where the overall accuracy of classification when using the BA reached (82.136%), while MLreached (79.64%).

AB  - Particulate matter (PM) is a composition of air-borne particles and liquid droplets containing acids. PM is a major air pollutant that causes harm to both human health and the environment. The main categories of PM include coarse particles (PM10), and fine particles (PM2.5). Relying only on ground monitoring stations while assessing PM trends is challenging due to limited data availability. Therefore, satellite remote sensing for Aerosols optical depth (AOD) is essential for the long-term analysis of PM. This research investigates the variation of AOD across the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and to cross-verify results using PM ground monitoring stations data as there is a lack of studies in this region. Yearly satellite images for AOD obtained using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) will be used to demonstrate the change across the UAE for the past 16 years (2005-2020). Moreover, trend analysis of monthly PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels retrieved for the last three years (2018-2020) from several stations located in Abu Dhabi, Al-Ain, and Dubai are compared against satellitederived AOD across the UAE to verify the outcome. The yearly investigation showed that AOD levels varied throughout the study period and were relatively highest in the coastal region within UAE, elevated AOD levels were detected during the year 2012 whereas the lowest was noticed in the year 2005. Dust storms and other anthropogenic activities may have contributed to the changes detected within UAE. Results show that seasonal analysis using ground-monitoring PM data and satellite-derived AOD are in agreement where the highest levels were detected during summer, followed by spring season, autumn, and finally Winter. Moreover, the correlation conducted to verify the satellite retrieved AOD was carried out by comparing the monthly average of PM from the year 2018 to 2020 obtained at Abu Dhabi, Al Ain, and Dubai city with the monthly average AOD at the same location for each of the 9 ground stations analyzed. It was found that Al Ain city PM levels showed a higher correlation with the AOD retrieved at the same location with an R2 value of 0.719, followed by Abu Dhabi whereas Dubai station data showed the lowest correlation.

T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article presents a review of the Siberian Meteorological Dictionary compiled by talented researchers V. P. Vasiliev and E. V. Vasilyeva (Kemerovo, Kemerovo State University), which implements the idea of synthesizing the traditional summarized lexicographic description of dialect units and the approaches of the modern culturally and cognitively oriented theory of language. The dictionary of this glossary includes dialect names "meteonyms", as well as semantically related words and stable expressions. The dictionary presents a detailed analysis of speech contexts (dialect texts) that implement the collected meteonyms in the real everyday speech of dialect users, which makes it possible to interpret a separate atmospheric phenomenon ("rain") chosen by the authors of the dictionary as a particular concept of the dialect worldview of rural residents of Siberia in its entirety and originality, including cultural and evaluative connotations, omens, beliefs, superstitions, etc. Thus, the cultural-cognitive description of the basic meteonym "rain" presented in the Dictionary vividly illustrates new approaches in the field of modern dialect lexicography. A detailed description of the theoretical foundations of the suggested approach is harmoniously combined with a careful analysis of speech contexts reflecting the centuries-old experience of rural man's interaction with nature.

TI  - Evaluation of sentinel lymph node biopsy using 1% methylene blue in node-responsive postneoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSurgical management of the axilla in breast cancer has evolved greatly in the past 20 years. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), which was first investigated in the early 1990s, has replaced routine axillary lymph node dissection with its associated greater morbidity in early-stage node-negative patients. However, the role and timing of SLNB, management of the axilla, and technical aspects of the procedure in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) are matters of controversy. Although data on SLNB and NACT are accumulating, the accuracy of SLNB to stage the axilla and the value of SLNB in relation to long-term outcomes remain to be seen.ObjectivesTo evaluate the use of 1% methylene blue (MB) as a single agent tracer for the detection of sentinel lymph node after NACT for locally advanced breast cancer with the calculation of the identification rate and false-negative rates (FNRs).Patients and methodsA total of 31 patients with cT3-4(a-c) cN1-3, M0 breast cancer after NACT who showed downstaging of their nodal status to N0 were injected with 1% MB, retroareolarly or peritumorally, followed by axillary lymph node dissection, and the results were studied to detect the identification rate and FNR.ResultsThe median age of the patients was 48 years, with 83.8% of the patients above the age of 40 years. The identification rate was found to be 83%, and a FNR of 11.5% was detected. FNRs were found to be less when more than three sentinel lymph nodes were dissected, with no statistically significant difference relating FNRs to the initial nodal state of the disease.ConclusionThe use of 1% MB after NACT showed a comparable identification rate and FNRs to other single tracer techniques, yet all single tracer techniques are lesser than ideal in this group of patients.

TI  - Evaluation of the technique of endoscopic axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage node-negative breast cancer
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has emerged as an alternative to routine axillary node dissection in early-stage node-negative breast cancer. However, there have been controversies in clinical application because of its various identification rates and false-negative rates. We analyzed endoscopic sentinel node biopsy as a feasible procedure for visualization of the axillary space and resection of the sentinel node using endoscopic technique.ObjectiveTo evaluate the implementation of the technique and to compare the feasibility, effectiveness, outcome, and complications of endoscopic axillary SLN biopsy versus open technique in early-stage breast cancer. Patients and methodsBetween October 2020 and May 2021, 48 patients with breast cancer with clinically node-negative results were injected methylene blue or patent blue dye.A total of 24 female patients underwent endoscopic sentinel node biopsy and 24 female patients underwent the traditional method at the breast unit of Department of Surgery at Cairo University Hospitals. The following were evaluated during the study period: feasibility of technique, seroma formation, shoulder mobility, numbness, and pain at the postoperative site.ResultsIn 24 patients undergoing the endoscopic technique using insufflation and minimal instrument dissection, the SLN at level I was inspected at its anatomical site and individual lymph nodes were easily identified. One patient developed lateral chest wall infection in the form of cellulitis (4%). The same patient experienced postoperative seroma. Intercostobrachial nerve affection was seen in 29% in the endoscopic method; however, it was 75% in the open method owing to nerve manipulation, not owing to direct injury. ConclusionUsing endoscopy, we found that this technique allows (a) a minimally invasive working space, (b) recognition of anatomic landmarks, and (c) instrument manipulation within the axilla to identify and extract lymph nodes and apply the sentinel node technique. In almost every case, an excellent anatomical orientation was achieved. The retrieval rate for the sentinel node in endoscopic technique was 100% as found in the open technique.

T2  - NOVYI ISTORICHESKII VESTNIK-THE NEW HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The higher school of any country and its regional scientific and educational complexes are the drivers of many economic, socio-cultural and other processes. The leading role here has always belonged to universities as a focus of education, science, and worldview transmission practices, which also have a close connection with the national economy. In the USSR, this role of universities was most clearly manifested on the periphery, rather than in the center. Important milestones in the development of Asian Russia were associated with universities, starting in the last quarter of the 19th century with the appearance of the first university in Asian Russia, and ending in the 1970s - with the expansion of the university network in the context of the last modernization breakthrough of the USSR. For the first time in Russian historiography, the article undertakes the research task of identifying the main trends and content of the largest Soviet "universityfication" of higher education and determining its impact on peripheral regions. The methodological novelty of the study is the complex application of several research strategies to the material of Russian science and higher education, seen from a macro-regional perspective: the theory of modernization and the concept of "center-peripheral relations", with the latter being differentiated into national and peripheral systems of such relations. The author identifies the inner periphery of the Asian macro-region, manifested in the building of "center-peripheral" relations between "old" and "new" universities, determines the three main trajectories of the creation of new universities with an analysis of their specific features, specifies the "third role" of universities and characterizes the criteria of their influence on the regions.

TI  - THE CHOICE OF LOVE AND THE NUMINOUS: EXISTENTIAL AND GENDER CONTEXTS
T2  - FILOSOFIYA-PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - The authors of the article analyze the influence of the numinous as an existential state and the structure of the unconscious, which causes sacred amazement and fear in a person on the choice of love in its gender-based manifestations. On the basis of the methodological strategy of metaanthropology, the choice of love is conceptualized in the ordinary, the ultimate and the transcendent existential dimensions of human being, which correspond to the ordinary, the personal and the philosophical worldview. In the methodological coordinates of C. Jung's psychoanalysis, the manifestations of the numinous in the archetypes of Anima and Animus and their influence on the decisive manifestation of love in the life of a man and a woman during the formation of a worldview are investigated.The actualization of the philosophical worldview, in which there is a free maturation of ideals, values, the destruction of outdated worldview attitudes and the establishment of a new being, leads to the integrity of the personality and the unity of individuals in love and co-creation. Under the influence of this, the emphasis in the numinous changes from horrible to sacred. This leads to worldview freedom in the choice of love, which becomes truly humanistic and constructive.

TI  - An Estimation of the Land Surface Temperature, Derived from the Landsat Satellite, for the Major Cities in Sindh Province, Pakistan
T2  - Sindh University Research Journal -Science Series
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared remote sensing data are used to make estimates of the land surface temperature (LST) by recording the radiant energy emitted by the surface of the Earth. Satellite data and image processing software also allow for LST estimation. Since its launch, two thermal infrared bands aboard the Landsat satellite have been used to continuously observe Earth, providing data for the estimation of LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Due to the significant uncertainty in data from both Landsat 5 thematic mapper (TM) thermal band 6, which has a wavelength of 10.40-12.50 m, and Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) Band 11, as indicated by USGS calibration notifications, it was advised to use TIRS Band 10 data as a single spectral band for LST estimation. For LST estimation from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8, the mono-window (MW) approach was used with TM and TIRS Bands 6, 10, and data with a resolution of 120 and 100 m. (Path-152 and Row-40, 41, 42, and 43). The emission coefficient was calculated using the operational land imager (OLI) Bands 4 and 5 (30 m resolution) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) proportion of vegetation method. Based on the results, the LST was higher in the arid regions, whereas the NDVI was higher in the less arid parts. Also, the LST findings were compared to the air temperature data, both data were found to be consistent with one another. The approach of MW algorithm could be a useful tool for estimating LST from TM data acquired from Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 TIRS Bands 6 and 10.

T2  - APPLIED WATER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Proterozoic basement aquifers are the primary source of water supply for the local populations in the Aseer (also spelled "Asir" or "Assir") province located in the southwest of Saudi Arabia (SA) since high evaporation rates and low rainfall are experienced in the region. Groundwater assets are receiving a lot of attention as a result of the growing need for water due to increased urbanization, population, and agricultural expansion. People have been pushed to seek groundwater from less reliable sources, such as fracture bedrocks. This study is centered on identifying the essential contributing parameters utilizing an integrated multi-criteria analysis and geospatial tools to map groundwater potential zones (GWPZs). The outcome of the GWPZs map was divided into five categories, ranging from very high to negligible potential. The results concluded that 57% of the investigated area (southwestern parts) showed moderate to very high potentials, attributed to Wadi deposits, low topography, good water quality, and presence of porosity and permeability. In contrast, the remaining 43% (northeastern and southeastern parts) showed negligible aquifer potential zones. The computed GWPZs were validated using dug well sites in moderate to very high aquifer potentials. Total dissolved solids (TDS) and nitrate (NO32-) concentrations were highest and lowest in aquifers, mainly in negligible and moderate to very high potential zones, respectively. The results were promising and highlighted that such integrated analysis is decisive and can be implemented in any region facing similar groundwater expectations and management.

AB  - Monitoring freshwater quality is a global concern because of increasing harmful algal blooms (HABs). Therefore, it is important to detect HABs especially in small lakes as they hold great socioeconomic value. This study estimates the potential of using Sentinel-2 for estimating chlorophyll-a value in small inland lakes. In particular, this study uses support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF) and adaptive boosting (AB) for Seneca lake. The processing power of Google Earth Engine (GEE) was used to extract the input features. The results indicate the superior performance of machine learning models in comparison to linear regression. Furthermore, AB provided the best results (R-2=0.85) as compared to RF and SVR. In terms of ensemble, the combination of all three models performed best in terms of R-2 (0.76), RMSE (0.633 mu g/L) and MAE (0.728 mu g/L).

TI  - A Novel Framework for Multiple Ground Target Detection, Recognition and Inspection in Precision Agriculture Applications Using a UAV
T2  - UNMANNED SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been recently used for different civilian applications such as remote sensing, search, and rescue (SAR), precision agriculture (PA), etc. A UAVs ability to sense and find targets remotely and, based on that, hover close to the target for a particular action makes it an ideal platform for the aforementioned applications. There has been extensive work carried out in the field of visual-based detection, navigation, and control, but the problem of detecting different ground targets and performing certain actions is still an open research area. This study proposes a novel framework for multiple target detection, recognition, and navigation of the UAV to the desired target and closely inspect it. This proposed framework can be deployed for accurately spot spraying in PA applications or SAR. The target detection and recognition in the framework are achieved through a computationally efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained model, whereas the close inspection of the target is achieved through a PID-based tracking algorithm which ensures the UAV hover around the target for few seconds. The developed framework performed the desired objective in five stages employing Lawson's control theory of sense, process, compare, decide and act. The target detection and recognition in the framework were validated with the field experiment, while the entire framework was validated through a variety of simulation flights conducted in Gazebo and PX4. The experiments' results showed the versatility of the developed system to many complex missions where the targets are added or removed.

AB  - Multi-spectral satellite images that remotely sense the Earth's surface at regular intervals are often contaminated due to occlusion by clouds. Remote sensing imagery captured via satellites, drones, and aircraft has successfully influenced a wide range of fields such as monitoring vegetation health, tracking droughts, and weather forecasting, among others. Researchers studying the Earth's surface are often hindered while gathering reliable observations due to contaminated reflectance values that are sensitive to thin, thick, and cirrus clouds, as well as their shadows. In this study, we propose a deep learning network architecture, CloudNet, to alleviate cloud-occluded remote sensing imagery captured by Landsat-8 satellite for both visible and non-visible spectral bands. We propose a deep neural network model trained on a distributed storage cluster that leverages historical trends within Landsat-8 imagery while complementing this analysis with high-resolution Sentinel-2 imagery. Our empirical benchmarks profile the efficiency of the CloudNet model with a range of cloud-occluded pixels in the input image. We further compare our CloudNet's performance with state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as SpAGAN and Resnet. We propose a novel method, dynamic hierarchical transfer learning, to reduce computational resource requirements while training the model to achieve the desired accuracy. Our model regenerates features of cloudy images with a high PSNR accuracy of 34.28 dB.

TI  - A multiparametric approach for rejuvenation of the Gaurikund geothermal spring system in the Northwest Himalayan region
T2  - CONTRIBUTIONS TO GEOPHYSICS AND GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaurikund town falls on the way of the famous trekking route to Kedarnath that faced the wrath of the 2013 flood disaster. This fateful event severed more than 5000 casualties, demolished several infrastructures, and shifted the course of Gaurikund spring from its original position. Nevertheless, the Gaurikund geothermal spring system located in the Himalayan Geothermal Belt of the Garhwal region is preeminent for religious beliefs, balneotherapeutic values and a gateway to delve within the geothermal and hydrological characteristics of the area. In this perspective, restoration of Gaurikund geothermal spring system becomes a necessity. A multiparametric approach comprising geospatial, geology, hydrochemistry and geophysics has been used to study and justify these aspects at Gaurikund. The geological studies infer that the geothermal spring gets recharged by the steep, southerly dipping joints in granite gneiss. Subsequently, the deep percolated water heats up due to the high geothermal gradient and then emerge along the Vaikrita Thrust and its sympathetic minor fault-thrust system by advection. Moreover, four spring outlets are inventoried, with discharge varying from 7.46 to 95.54 L/min. The normal emissivity model uses the pre and post-disaster satellite data and generates maximum kinetic temperature images, showing a positive correlation between land surface temperature and spring discharge. Two-dimensional Electrical Resistivity Tomography (Schlumberger, Wenner and Gradient configurations) survey revealed two low resistivity zones proximal to the geothermal spring on the right bank of the Mandakini river. The engineering interventions carried out by bank protection and construction of small gully plugs in the catchment area is recommended along Gaurikund-Sonprayag section on the right bank of Mandakini river.

TI  - Comparing Time-Lapse PhenoCams with Satellite Observations across the Boreal Forest of Quebec, Canada
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Intercomparison of satellite-derived vegetation phenology is scarce in remote locations because of the limited coverage area and low temporal resolution of field observations. By their reliable near-ground observations and high-frequency data collection, PhenoCams can be a robust tool for intercomparison of land surface phenology derived from satellites. This study aims to investigate the transition dates of black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) phenology by comparing fortnightly the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) extracted using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform with the daily PhenoCam-based green chromatic coordinate (GCC) index. Data were collected from 2016 to 2019 by PhenoCams installed in six mature stands along a latitudinal gradient of the boreal forests of Quebec, Canada. All time series were fitted by double-logistic functions, and the estimated parameters were compared between NDVI, EVI, and GCC. The onset of GCC occurred in the second week of May, whereas the ending of GCC occurred in the last week of September. We demonstrated that GCC was more correlated with EVI (R-2 from 0.66 to 0.85) than NDVI (R-2 from 0.52 to 0.68). In addition, the onset and ending of phenology were shown to differ by 3.5 and 5.4 days between EVI and GCC, respectively. Larger differences were detected between NDVI and GCC, 17.05 and 26.89 days for the onset and ending, respectively. EVI showed better estimations of the phenological dates than NDVI. This better performance is explained by the higher spectral sensitivity of EVI for multiple canopy leaf layers due to the presence of an additional blue band and an optimized soil factor value. Our study demonstrates that the phenological observations derived from PhenoCam are comparable with the EVI index. We conclude that EVI is more suitable than NDVI to assess phenology in evergreen species of the northern boreal region, where PhenoCam data are not available. The EVI index could be used as a reliable proxy of GCC for monitoring evergreen species phenology in areas with reduced access, or where repeated data collection from remote areas are logistically difficult due to the extreme weather.

TI  - Herma-shaped Medieval Sculptures in the Basin of the Middle Reaches of the Siversky Donets: Issues of Interpretation and Chronology
T2  - STRATUM PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers a group of medieval statues with traces of processing along the entire length, but without hands and feet, which makes them similar to ancient herma. Hairstyles, headdresses and pectoral decorations depicted on them are similar to the costume details depicted on full-figure statues that are associated with the Cumans. At the same time, some elements of the costume cannot be understood without knowing how these elements were depicted on full-figure statues.Medieval sculptures played an important role in the funerary and post-burial rites of the nomads, and thought to be "substitutes" of the deceased. Probably, during the rituals, the clothes of the deceased were put on hermetic statues, and the sleeves replaced the missing image of the hands. Unusual is the absence or a schematic representation of the vessel on the herma-shaped sculptures, since the vessel is interpreted as the "receptacle of the soul" of the deceased ancestor. Apparently, this is due to changes in the religious worldview of the nomads as a result of socio-political upheavals in society.All of this points to the late dating of the herma-shaped sculptures. They probably appeared in the second half of the 13(th) century along with the influx of a new population and continued to exist until the beginning of the 14(th) century, when Islam replaced pagan rites among the nomads of the Eastern European steppes.

TI  - METHODOLOGICAL FEATURES OF MULTILINGUAL EDUCATION OF FOREIGN STUDENTS IN INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION
T2  - AD ALTA-JOURNAL OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Modern trends in the system of higher education are indicated by a new format: the expanding multicultural interaction of the subjects of the educational process. Accordingly, this sets the tasks of a different level for university teachers, since the learning process is the realization of the needs, attitudes, interests, motives of the subjects of educational activity as equal partners. The article shows that the main task of a teacher of a modern innovative university is to stimulate the intellectual and emotional activity of students, taking into account the specifics of linguistic, ethnocultural, and personal-professional characteristics of the subjects of education. The teacher, first of all, should contribute to the search for the student's own individuality and the activation of his personal and professional development. The most significant and new results, as well as their scientific novelty are determined, first of all, by the fact that the study reveals the fundamental didactic conditions for the effectiveness of multilingual education of foreign students, in connection with which a multilingual approach to teaching foreign students is considered as a way to achieve a high level of their professionalism. subject, language, and intercultural competencies.

AB  - Surface temperature is one of the key observations to analyse the greenhouse effect on the Earth. The surface of the ocean can be captured using satellite sensors and transmitted to a meteorological center for real-time analysis. The use of the deep learning paradigm in super resolution has its potential in geoscience applications to increase the data transmission latency and enhance low-quality observation from remote sensing data. In this paper, the deployment of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture is studied to apply resolution reconstruction using the South China Sea sea surface temperature data. In addition, the development of spectral normalization is added to the Enhanced Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) architecture to improve the training mechanism of generator and discriminator. This improved ESRGAN is compared with its super resolution performance against peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index evaluation metrics. The experiment shows that the low resolution of South China Sea data can be inferred to obtain a higher resolution with a more realistic resolution as compared to the conventional upsampling approaches.

TI  - Western European Intellectual Practices of a New Type in Russian Everyday Life at Early 18th Century (case of Feofan Prokopovich) br
T2  - MGIMO REVIEW OF INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The focus of this study is the views of Feofan Prokopovich, a unique Orthodox thinker whose world outlook was shaped by an obvious influence of the ideas of the Protes-tant and Catholic Enlightenment. Talking about the Enlightenment, modern historiography focuses on the versatility of the phenomenon, preferring to talk about the Enlightenment, including the religious or confessional Enlightenment, aimed at rethinking the role of reli-gion and the church. The Religious Enlightenment was a pan-European phenomenon that embraced Protestantism, Catholicism, Judaism, and Orthodoxy, and grew out of the desire to create an intelligent religion free of superstition and serving society. The intellectual movement of the religious Enlightenment sought to reconcile the natural philosophy of the 17th-18th centuries with a religious worldview, while trying to overcome the extremes of re-ligious fanaticism, on the one hand, and nihilism and godlessness, on the other. The process of forming a new intellectual environment is marked by the coexistence and mutual influ-ence of the most diverse, sometimes poorly compatible traditions, their transformation and modification. Comprehensively arguing the need for unlimited autocracy in Russia, Feofan Prokopovich, nevertheless, actively used the discourse of the Enlightenment in his writings, discussing the problem of the origin of the state, the mode of government, the boundaries of the power of the monarch, the rights and duties of subjects. On the example of Feofan Prokopovich, we can talk about the emergence and rooting of intellectual practices of a new type in Russian everyday life. The integration of Western European ideas and practices into Russian culture was ambiguous, multifaceted and depended on their adaptation to the socio-political space of Russia. Being well acquainted with the works of European authors of the 17th - early 18th centuries, he rather took on the formal side of their discussions on socio-political topics, adapted a conceptual glossary that was new for the Russian educated public, which opened up opportunities for talking about politics in a new way

AB  - The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations of several Polar lows observed in the Barents and Norwegian seas are evaluated using satellite data. The modeled surface wind speed (SWS) is compared to the SWS retrieved from the measurements of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Advanced Scanning Microwave Radiometer (AMSR-E). The ASCAT and AMSR-E data combined with the images of the Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) were used to validate the simulated PL trajectories. A series of numerical experiments using different model setup shown that although the reanalysis dataset used to obtain initial and boundary conditions and the initialization time of simulations are the major contributing factors for the model results, the choice of combination of the parameterization schemes may also significantly influence the simulated direction of the PL trajectory and SWS estimates.

AB  - The Christian worldview is in crisis. The cause of the crisis lies in the misguided perception and diagnosis of the world. The existing worldview argues that the dualism that separates faith and life is the fundamental problem. On the contrary, this article points to syncretism. The heart of the crisis is not that the church fails to actively participate in society because it falls into a wrong dichotomy of secular and sacred, but rather that the church lost its ecclesiastical identity and is not differentiated from the world. Three questions are to be answered to establish the cause. Is the Christian worldview biblical, realistic, or theoretical? A glance at the Old and New Testaments reveals that criticism of the secularized people of God is the most important issue. Next, I will explain that Constantinianism is the source of the problem both in Western church history and Korean church history. Finally, by examining the arguments of theorists who criticize dualism, I will clarify that they are actually questioning syncretism.Therefore, the Christian worldview movement should not criticize the church immersed in dualism, but the church immersed in syncretism, and pursue ontological monism and ethical dualism. Then the worldview movement at the edge of the brink will be revived, and it will be positioned as a worldview movement that fits the reality of the Korean church, and take a step towards original purpose, church renewal and social transformation.

TI  - Typology of pragmatic implications from the point of view of interaction between pragmatics and semantics
T2  - RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LINGUISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The subject matter of the study is communicative implications as one of the forms of implementation of speech acts. The starting point is the well-known theory of H. P. Grice, in which pragmatic implications are based on the principle of cooperation. The author shows the limitations of Grice's theory, which presents the communicative conditions of implications, but does not present the communicative consequences. As an alternative, the author proposes the concept of pragmatic implications, taking into account the premises and consequences of indirect speech acts. Considering implication as a two-place relation between antecedent and consequent, the author identifies three types of implications that differ in the type of information in the antecedent and consequent parts: 1) semantic antecedent > pragmatic consequent; 2) pragmatic antecedent > pragmatic consequent; 3) pragmatic antecedent > semantic consequent. This approach makes it possible to present indirect communication to the fullest extent, and also to explain many communicative phenomena in terms of the interaction between semantics and pragmatics. Implications are interpreted as the result of mental processing of conditionally categorical syllogisms, in which the first premise is an element of the cultural worldview. Thus, the author shows the relative nature of the opposition of conventional and communicative implications. The article uses the material of the modern Russian language, borrowed from various sources: journalism, fiction, the Internet, urban folklore and colloquial speech. The leading research method was pragmatic, namely, illocutionary, analysis with elements of discourse content analysis.

TI  - Soil salinity assessment of a natural pasture using remote sensing techniques in central Anatolia, Turkey
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is a major land degradation process reducing biological productivity in arid and semi-arid regions. Therefore, its effective monitoring and management is inevitable. Recent developments in remote sensing technology have made it possible to accurately identify and effectively monitor soil salinity. Hence, this study determined salinity levels of surface soils in 2650 ha agricultural and natural pastureland located in an arid region of central Anatolia, Turkey. The relationship between electrical conductivity (EC) values of 145 soil samples and the dataset created using Landsat 5 TM satellite image was investigated. Remote sensing dataset for 23 variables, including visible, near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR) spectral ranges, salinity, and vegetation indices were created. The highest correlation between EC values and remote sensing dataset was obtained in SWIR1 band (r = -0.43). Linear regression analysis was used to reveal the relationship between six bands and indices selected from the variables with the highest correlations. Coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.19) results indicated that models obtained using satellite image did not provide reliable results in determining soil salinity. Microtopography is the major factor affecting spatial distribution of soil salinity and caused heterogeneous distribution of salts on surface soils. Differences in salt content of soils caused heterogeneous distribution of halophytes and led to spectral complexity. The dark colored slickpots in small-scale depressions are common features of sodic soils, which are responsible for spectral complexity. In addition, low spatial resolution of Landsat 5 TM images is another reason decreasing the reliability of models in determining soil salinity.

AB  - The Open Data Cube (ODC), created and facilitated by the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), is an open-source software architecture that continues to grow in popularity around the world. In late 2021, CEOS released a new ODC sandbox tool that provides global users with a free and open programming interface connected to Google Earth Engine datasets. The open-source toolset allows users to run application algorithms using a Google Colaboratory ("Colab") Python notebook environment [1]. This tool demonstrates rapid creation of science products anywhere in the world without the need to download and process the satellite data. One example application has been developed and demonstrated to support flooding disasters and recovery using Sentinel-1 radar data. This application can be easily used to monitor peak flooding extent, flooding recovery, and the time series flood history of a region.

AB  - In Holistic theory of organisms, Taoism's worldview is similar to the ecological one. Taoism hold that Nature and Human society are connected with opposites. As all things in the universe we are connected with others in the great circle of Cosmic life. Everything in the universe is made up of the same substance as Qi energy(氣).A number of ecological sentences in Taoist texts encouraging respect for the Nature and environmental circumstances of all things. human being as all things is itself in its responsive attunement with the fluidity of natural process. All thing is one as same substance. each single being is potentially in accord with and complete in itself. Therefore all things in the universe are equal without discrimination The holism of Taoism is the dynamic interconnectedness of particulars. Human beings have no element of superiority to natural objects. There is self-generative logic of things, which is inherently naturalistic and environmental in cosmic fluid. These are the ecological characteristics of Taoism.

AB  - Religious Taoism and Ecology share a similar organic worldview. Human views are logically derived from the worldview. Taoist human beings are divided into two types: secular humans(凡人) and holy humans(神仙). Secular human beings can reach the level of holy human beings by self-cultivation. Holy human beings are ecologically united with nature.Human beings in religious Taoism have three characteristics: naturality, provision of nature, inter-relational response. According to religious Taoism, for instance things of the same kind cluster while sounds of same frequency harmonize.Like religious Taoism, in the Ecological worldview, humans are only part of nature. Human nature is like nature. Humans communicate with nature in ontological dimension. Religious Taoism and Ecology have fundamental similarities in understanding the relationship between the Nature and human beings. At this point, religious Taoism's view of humanity reaches a match-point where it can naturally meet with ecological one.

AB  - This study evaluates the accuracy in identifying the burned area in South Korea using multi- temporal data from Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat 8/9 OLI. Spectral indices such as the Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relative Difference Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), and Burned Area Index (BAI) were used to identify the burned area in the March 2022 forest fire in Uljin. Based on the results of six indices, the accuracy to detect the burned area was assessed for four satellites using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9, respectively. Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 produce images every 16 and 10 days, respectively, although it is difficult to acquire clear images due to clouds. Furthermore, using images taken before and after a forest fire to examine the burned area results in a rapid shift because vegetation growth in South Korea began in April, making it difficult to detect. Because Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 images from February to May are based on the same date, this study is able to compare the indices with a relatively high detection accuracy and gets over the temporal resolution limitation. The results of this study are expected to be applied in the development of new indices to detect burned areas and indices that are optimized to detect South Korean forest fires.

AB  - This article compares <The Hen who dreamed she could fly> with <The Doggy Poo> and examines its characteristics as a fable. The attributes of characters, which are auxiliary concepts, are often recognized as human status, race, or gender in fables due to personification; this intensifies allegorical interpretation or causes confusion. In the case of the picture book <The Doggy Poo>, the characters were overly simplified, which poses a risk of the image of the puppy poop sacrificing itself for the dandelion being perceived as discrimination based on innate conditions. Similarly, in <The Hen who dreamed she could fly>, the main character’s biological characteristics follow the species characteristics of a hen; however, her thoughts are described as human-like, creating a character called “Ipssak,” who has existential concerns. Consequently, to expand the violence of the theme of self-sacrifice to the ecological theme of coexistence beyond species, a strategy of expanding “me” to “us” was used. And the cracks created in the process are diluted with the ecological theme of an “ultimate us” that even includes the weasel. And this dialectic of coexistence, in which even the enemy becomes part of “us,” is completed by an animistic worldview that understands the body and mind in a dualistic way.

AB  - Having a high-resolution and high-accuracy Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is essential for flood modelling to increase the reliability of the resulting flood analysis and flood maps. However, it is quite a challenge to acquire highly reliable DEM as it is often confidential, time consuming and/or costly. This paper presents the latest continuous effort to further enhance the satellite DEM using 0.25 m resolution RGB (Red, Green and Blue) color values from Google Earth in addition to the remote sensing data from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) satellite is selected to demonstrate the ongoing satellite DEM enhancement effort; also a very high surveyed spatial resolution of 0.25 m is used in this study. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained with 0.25 m reference DEM which were obtained with Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging). ANN is first trained with reference DEM of a training area and then applied to other areas for validation. The validation result shows that ANN generates a much clearer view of the area and result in a significant error reduction (RMSE) of about 30%.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to provide a theological basis that can properly respond to the Church’s concerns about the Metaverse. Its main focus is on the “chaos of worldview” that occurs between the real world and the virtual world. In order to analyze that chaos, firstly, it examines Jacques Lacan’s psychoanalysis of the symbolic, imaginary, and real orders. In order to compare the virtual reality and the kingdom of God. Secondly, it investigates the “Christ and Culture in Paradox” typified by H.Richard Niebuhr. In order to compare the virtual world and the heavenly world.Thirdly, it explores Karl Barth’s logos Christology and Reinhold Niebuhr’s Christian realism. Through this research process, it is suggested that Christian theology should emphasize the importance of the real world in the so-called Metaverse church or worship. Furthermore, it is proposed that a contemporary culture of theological discourse suitable for the Metaverse era should be formed promptly through thorough preparation.

AB  - In the interpretation of the role of the communist or National Socialist worldview, which are considered in this work, two "camps" emerge: authors who regard ideology as an external corpus outside of the fighting troops (portray the army as "free of ideology"), and those that assume a great influence of ideological factors on all areas of the war. In the novels examined, the protagonists blame "the others" for the abuse of soldiers, the so-called ideology mediators - "commissioners" or "Nazis". They are responsible for the losses and for the entire regime.In general, the National Socialist crimes go unmentioned in both the literary works of German and Russian authors. The historical fact that National Socialist Germany waged a war of conquest and annihilation against the Soviet Union motivated by power politics and race ideology does not find any literary resonance. The reasons for this are different: After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian writers are concerned with settling accounts with their own regime and the crimes of their own leadership, as whose victims one portrays oneself; the German authors are concerned with family members. Although the East, Russia, was the main scene of the war, it remains a secondary scene of the crimes in the portrayal of German women writers. As a result, the war against the Soviet Union loses its special character. It is noticeable that even Russian authors do not mention the National Socialist racial ideology. This could be because there was no discussion of the ideological components of National Socialism in the Soviet Union and in post-Soviet Russia. The lack of preoccupation with the National Socialist ideology among the writers has its origins in the Soviet declaration of National Socialism as a "radical expression of capitalism", whereby the racial madness and anti-Bolshevism of the Nazis was ascribed to the "capitalists", which meant that the "common man" had all responsibility withdrawn. In none of the protagonists you can find the feeling of hatred towards the Germans, which is partly only possible by ignoring the Nazi ideology. A military solidarity community is being constructed under the motto "We were all victims of the war". This enables rapprochement with the former enemy and reconciliation; however, a real "work-up" cannot take place in this shortened way.

TI  - Estimation of Mean Radiant Temperature in Urban Canyons Using Google Street View: A Case Study on Seoul
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme heat exposure has severe negative impacts on humans, and the issue is exacerbated by climate change. Estimating spatial heat stress such as mean radiant temperature (MRT) is currently difficult to apply at city scale. This study constructed a method for estimating the MRT of street canyons using Google Street View (GSV) images and investigated its large-scale spatial patterns at street level. We used image segmentation using deep learning to calculate the view factor (VF) and project panorama into fisheye images. We calculated sun paths to estimate MRT using panorama images from Google Street View. This paper shows that regression analysis can be used to validate between estimated short-wave, long-wave radiation and the measurement data at seven field measurements in the clear-sky (0.97 and 0.77, respectively). Additionally, we compared the calculated MRT and land surface temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 on a city scale. As a result of investigating spatial patterns of MRT in Seoul, South Korea, we found that a high MRT of street canyons (>59.4 degrees C) is mainly distributed in open space areas and compact low-rise density buildings where the sky view factor is 0.6-1.0 and the building view factor (BVF) is 0.35-0.5, or west-east oriented street canyons with an SVF of 0.3-0.55. However, high-density buildings (BVF: 0.4-0.6) or high-density tree areas (Tree View Factor, TVF: 0.6-0.99) showed low MRT (<47.6). The mapped MRT results had a similar spatial distribution to the LST; however, the MRT was lower than the LST in low tree density or low-rise high-density building areas. The method proposed in this study is suitable for a complex urban environment consisting of buildings, trees, and streets. This will help decision makers understand spatial patterns of heat stress at the street level.

AB  - Recently, the seriousness of climate change-related problems caused by global warming is growing, and the average temperature is also rising. As a result, it is affecting the environment in which various temperature-sensitive creatures and creatures live, and changes in the ecosystem are also being detected. Seasons are one of the important factors influencing the types, distribution, and growth characteristics of creatures living in the area. Among the most popular and easily recognized plant seasonal phenomena among the indicators of the climate change impact evaluation, the blooming day of flower and the peak day of autumn leaves were modeled. The types of plants used in the modeling were forsythia and cherry trees, which can be seen as representative plants of spring, and maple and ginkgo, which can be seen as representative plants of autumn. Weather data used to perform modeling were temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation observed through the ASOS Observatory of the Korea Meteorological Administration. As satellite data, MODIS NDVI was used for modeling, and it has a correlation coefficient of about –0.2 for the flowering date and 0.3 for the autumn leaves peak date. As the model used, the model was established using multiple regression models, which are linear models, and Random Forest, which are nonlinear models. In addition, the predicted values estimated by each model were expressed as isopleth maps using spatial interpolation techniques to express the trend of plant seasonal changes from 2003 to 2020. It is believed that using NDVI with high spatio-temporal resolution in the future will increase the accuracy of plant phenology modeling.

AB  - This article purports to investigate the formation and its development of the relationship between the teacher(s)/speaker(s) and the learner(s)/audience throughout the book of Proverbs. Characteristics of the relationship between speaker(s) and audience, made progressive developments in Proverbs 1-9; 10:1-22:16; 22:17-24:34; 25-29, and 30-31, can be summarized as follows: first, the boundary of the teacher(s)/speaker(s) is gradually extended until the form of education utilizes the means of communal learning. Second, the boundary of learner(s)/audience is also extended until the form of education shapes the learner becomes the teacher. Third, the book of Proverbs is suggestive of a communal context of education that enables the teacher also learns from the learner. Fourth, wisdom education thereby deals with all elements of the life of the learner, which culminates in the formation of the wisdom worldview through the lens of the fear of the Lord. Fifth, this form of education leads the learning community to practice righteousness, justice, and equity. In conclusion, the book of Proverbs helps us to understand that the teacher is also to participate in the learning process, which eventually forms a communal context of education. Education in the book of Proverbs never assumes a closed ending in the educational context, yet an open ending: continual form of the re-education for Christian education.

AB  - This article examines an economic aspect of globalization to form the necessary character of global citizenship. To accomplish this purpose, this study investigates a Christian alternative to economic globalization, which drives globalization. This article uses a method by which Bob Goudzwaard's economic globalization model is added to Traugott Jahnichen’s ‘world civil society’ model. The ‘world civil society’ model is a model for human freedom and dignity that embraces Konrad Raiser’s ‘another globalization.’ This study adds an economic globalization model to Jahnichen’s model and starts with the assumption that God’s kingdom and globalization can coexist within a Christian worldview. This study argues that Christians, as global citizens with messianic hope, can achieve alternative globalization to protect and preserve life and human rights through their awakening change and solidarity.

AB  - This study examines the point of view of settlement of Genesis in the Hebrew Bible from a humanistic perspective based on archaeological and historical-theological achievements. Based on the surplus product theory suggested by Gordon Childe, this study regards cultivation, settlement, and urban formation as the whole process of urbanization. This study, through a series of stories of the Garden of Eden and Paradise Lost, the descendants of Cain and the civilizations built by them, the collapse of the town of Babel, the wanderings and settlements of the Abraham family, and the fall of Sodom in Genesis, identifies the consistent point of view that is anti-settlement, anti-agricultural and pro-nomadic, anti-urban, anti-authoritarian, and anti-state. This perception is presumed to result from the experiences of the Jews during the Babylonian exile around 600-540 BC. The Jews who were taken to Babylon were forced to be put into the construction of Babylon’s splendid agricultural civilization as slaves or serfs. The series of worldviews mentioned above changed somewhat through the Jews’ settlement in Palestine and the promotion of agricultural life. However, it can be confirmed that only the anti-urban perception is firmly maintained. Hereafter, this anti-urban awareness has formed a part of the anti-urban worldview of Western Christian culture.

With such academic activities, we can say that <Korea Association of Japanology> has played roles as a platform for research on Japan in Korea and also functioned positively for Korea-Japan relationship that is full of conflicts and confrontations. On the other hand, there is also a voice that research on Japan has failed to overcome the form of self-centeredness and harvestism. This implies that the current research agenda should aim for open value/worldview beyond nationalism. In this sense, from now on, <Korea Association of Japanology> is expected to pursue humanities and AI along with the global digital era, socially demanded pragmatism in the digilog era, creative next generation, interdisciplinary collaboration, and joint research in convergent/hybrid forms, which will enhance its multi-centered value/image further. It is because academic competitiveness in the global digital era can be finally secured through a research agenda in the universal/hybrid form beyond national/ethnic/ideological limitations.

TI  - Eliminating murine norovirus, <i>Helicobacter hepaticus,</i> and intestinal protozoa by embryo transfer for an entire mouse barrier facility
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pathogens can affect physiological and immunological reactions in immunocompromised animals and genetically engineered mice. Specifically, murine norovirus (MNV), Helicobacter, and intestinal protozoa are prevalent in rodent laboratory facilities worldwide. In this study, microbiological test results of the soiled bedding of sentinel mice showed the prevalence of MNV (50.9%, 28/55), Helicobacter hepaticus (29.1%, 16/55), Trichomonas spp. (14.5%, 8/55), and Entamoeba spp. (32.7%, 18/55). No single infections were detected as all cases were confirmed to have complex infections with two or four pathogens. In previous studies, the success rate of the cross-fostering method was not perfect; therefore, in this study, the entire mouse strain of the SPF rodent facility was rederived using embryo transfer. For up to three years, we confirmed that the results were negative with regular health surveillance tests. Embryo transfer was, thus, determined to be an effective method for the rederivation of specific pathogen free (SPF) barrier mouse facilities. This is the report for the effectiveness of embryo transfer as an example of successful microbiological clean-up of a mouse colony with multiple infections in an entire SPF mouse facility and embryo transfer may be useful for rederiving.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper conducts a case study through the ‘three-step transcendental method’ aimed at ‘holistic spiritual healing’. Holistic spiritual healing is based on the dynamic transcendence movement of the human mind and refers to the ‘transcendence technique’ through the integrated performance of ‘emotion’, ‘reason’, and ‘spirituality’, all of which are based on ‘question’. At this time, the transcendental technique fundamentally differs from the inherent transcendental technique of psychotherapy and is a unique method of philosophical counseling devised with an overall view based on philosophical insight. ‘Transcendence’ in philosophical counseling is a driving force to overcome self-limitation and enter the path of healing by inviting the client to a wider world of reality beyond the narrow frame of thought that confines themselves to a limited and distorted interpretation that can be never understood within the limited experience of the client’s life. In particular, spirituality related to healing is the ‘power’ that helps to move toward new thoughts by aiming at the maturity of personality and expansion of consciousness. Spirituality is the ability of human beings to transcend the reality they face and use as a healing power that enables them to overcome negative experiences in life. On the basis of this transcendental technique, this paper presents its effectiveness through the case of philosophical counseling based on specific conversations with clients suffering from self-deprecation.

The study also aims, to explore the relationship and influence between variables, so that early childhood teachers can be ideal models for eco-life behaviors. To this end, data were collected from 214 early childhood teachers using a background questionnaire and the 'ecological sensibility' and 'eco-life behaviors' scales, and differences, relationships, and explanatory power were analyzed using the SPSS 21.0 program. First, early childhood teachers with experience in eco early childhood education teacher training and implementation of eco early childhood education showed high ecological sensibility and eco-life behaviors. Second, the higher the ecological sensibility of early childhood teachers, the higher the eco-life behaviors. Third, the eco early childhood education teacher training and eco early childhood education implementation experience, and the relative explanatory power of ecological sensibility were all significant. Therefore, considering the purpose of the Nuri curriculum, which takes the cultivation of an ecological worldview that respects and love people and nature as its main compositional focus, promoting the eco-life behaviors of early childhood teachers is key. Thus, there is a need for an eco early childhood education teacher training program to improve the execution ability of early childhood education.

Water is an element that forms all the universe and nature. From the primordial time, water is the most fundamental and substantial element. Water is associated with mentality and emotions of human beings that have been creating and changing the world.As a natural element, water symbolizes many things, such as chaos, a source of destruction and creation, purifying power, and many dualistic meanings: black vs. white, contamination vs. purification, destruction vs. creation, a fundament of life vs. death, and so on.In Slavic folk belief, including mythology, legends and folktales, water has a variety of meanings and roles: a source of energy, power, creation, purification, generation of life, etc. Long time ago, Slavs think that water has dual characteristics of good and bad, white and black, and destruction and creation, etc. In addition, water is considered as a place where vicious spirits or souls hide, and therefore all the water is drained after death of any family member.After Kiev Rus’s the baptism of Christianity, Slavs emphasize the important role of ‘baptizing’ and ‘christening’ as a purifying power. For example, water is a place where there live Rusalki and Vodjanoj that people consider vicious and unlucky. At the same time, water is where there is a power to create a new world.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to identify uniqueness of Jeong Ji-yong’s christian worldview presented in poems written in his late life. Belief on religiosity of beauty, so-called ‘Spiritism’, is the foundation of his poetry. The core of his poetic spiritism is that a poem should consider the relationship between the Absolute and the self as the ultimate subject and a poet can found infinite in a finite object through the process. ‘Spiritism’ contains the thinking that we can meet the Infinite only through obedience, which endures sufferings and accepts finite of the existence without questioning. For example, the poetic theme of ‘Baekrokdam’ and ‘Jangsusan’, which represent poetry, is such consideration. In poems, he does not avoid or transcend sufferings and refuses attempts to forget sufferings with worthless comfort or false fulfillment. He just tries to find the value of submissive attitudes. The spirits of endurance contains ‘obedience’, which makes people reach at the Infinite by admitting powerless as creatures and accepting suffering as a whole. This paper found that the theological theme shown in his poems is the religious attitude to confront ontological emptiness under desperate circumstance with non-existence of the God.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Son Chang-Seup seems to have been obsessed with extreme shame since childhood. This obsession is related to his mother’s remarriage, which seems to have been amplified by the conflict with the “man like a boar” who surrounded her. As a result, Son seems to have failed to properly enter the symbolic world and properly accept social authority. This mechanism drove him to suicidal thoughts, which seemed to have been exacerbated by nocturia as he was growing up. Internally, the child was unable to enter into the symbolic world because he saw his mother as both parent and object of sexual desire owing to his conspiratorial relationship with the boar-like man and the stranger who took his father’s place; instead, he was captured by horrifying visions and fantasies.However, it is judged that accepting Christianity made the growth of the child possible. Despite his unfortunate childhood, difficulties with his studies, the shame and anger triggered by nocturia, and desires for revenge, the main characters appears to be a scholar. One reason for this impression may be his Christian faith.The primary motif that dominates Son’s early and later novels is his mother, which means that his mother is disproportionately represented in his novels. His novels can be regarded as a process of affirming his mother. In one novel, his mother appears as prostitute simply because she remarried for money, which is why the author has an excessive affection for prostitutes The Bible saves that the author from the ethical reality of condemning prostitution. The story “The Woman Who Committed Adultery” gave him a justification for revealing himself as the author only in the end, and through this faith, he finally begins to confront reality. The adversary was supported by this apocalyptic worldview, enabling it to fight intransigently with reality. However, the characters' process of struggle is one of recognition rather than apocalypse, but this struggle for recognition is based on a social discourse of the society, resulting in a dialectic of masters and slaves who want to be respected by society.In this dialectic, slaves are equal with their masters in thought, but in reality, they cannot escape the circumstances of slavery. In addition, in order to be in the position of a master, many things must be covered up and the affection for the weak he pursued disappears and only respect for oneself remains. It is believed that the main character’s awakening to the selfishness and hypocrisy of the corrupt group, of which he had been so critical, appeared the same to him and led him to seek a new path. “God’s joy” was created by the main character’s own destruction because he was so attached to being recognized by the ruling group, and the reason it had to be so brutally destroyed was that it was so persistent that it could not otherwise be cut off, as can be seen in “Hwankwan.”

TI  - Wildfire Impact on Cerro Cora National Park Measured Using Landsat and Sentinel Images
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - To prepare for and recover from damage due to wildfires, it is necessary to investigate and analyze the impacts of wildfires. To date, various wildfire research methodologies have been conducted and analyzed. The impact of fire tends to be difficult to generalize because it is closely related to many factors, such as the characteristics of the area and the seasonal distribution of vegetation. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct case studies considering the geographical, vegetational, and seasonal characteristics of the area for impact estimation. Quantitative and qualitative analyses of the wildfire that occurred in Cerro Cora National Park, Paraguay in August 2021 are needed to recover from the damage and to prepare for future wildfires. Therefore, in this study, we analyzed the impact of the wildfire in Cerro Cora National Park. To calculate the damaged area and severity, the normalized burn ratio and normalized difference vegetation index obtained from Landsat and Sentinel images were used. The tasseled cap transformation was also used to investigate the characteristic variation. To calibrate the seasonal factor, long-term analysis was performed, and short-term analysis was performed to determine the immediate impact of the wildfire. As a result, the damaged area, severity, and restoration for each area were estimated. In addition, characteristic variations of the area were identified. Furthermore, the reliability of the study was enhanced by comparing the results from each satellite image and index.

AB  - Medium and high-resolution optical satellites have proven their effectiveness in detecting wildfire areas. However, smoke plumes generated by wildfire scatter visible light incidents on the surface, thereby interrupting accurate monitoring of the area where wildfire occurs. Therefore, a technology to extract smoke in advance is required. Deep learning technology is expected to improve the accuracy of smoke extraction, but the lack of training datasets limits the application. However, for clouds, which have a similar property of scattering visible light, a large amount of training datasets has been accumulated. The purpose of this study is to develop a smoke extraction technique using deep learning, and the limits due to the lack of datasets were overcome by using a cloud dataset on transfer learning. To check the effectiveness of transfer learning, a small-scale smoke extraction training set was made, and the smoke extraction performance was compared before and after applying transfer learning using a public cloud dataset. As a result, not only the performance in the visible light wavelength band was enhanced but also in the near infrared (NIR) and short-wave infrared (SWIR). Through the results of this study, it is expected that the lack of datasets, which is a critical limit for using deep learning on smoke extraction, can be solved, and therefore, through the advancement of smoke extraction technology, it will be possible to present an advantage in monitoring wildfires.

AB  - In this paper, “fascist historical cognition” is defined as “history cognition that summons national traditions by advocating the entire nation (state) to politically mobilize the public.” Ahn Ho-sang is a person who typically shows fascist historical perception. He tried to combine ideological philosophy, great religion, and national thought studied in Germany. He engaged in political activities such as the Minister of Education and the head of the Hakdo National Defense Corps, and exercised a certain influence until the Park Chung-hee administration. It shows a fascist worldview in a way that values the whole, prioritizes “freedom of the state,” opposes both capitalism and communism, and finds universal democracy in Korean traditional ideas. Emphasizing Dangun and Hwarangdo, he also put forward the succession of nationalist history. He was advocating nationalism as a discourse on overcoming liberal individual ideas developed in the modern West. Those such as Lee Bum-seok, who values pedigree of the time, and Kang Sang- woon, who argues for the merits of national socialism, were also supporters of the fascist worldview. At that time, positive arguments using terms such as ‘national socialism’ instead of fascism or Nazism were also popular. It was also an era of indulgence when terms of universal value such as democracy were added while presenting a similar perspective to fascism. Therefore, it shows the appearance of finding and emphasizing democratic elements in our traditional ideas. It is like arbitrarily attaching the concept of democracy while vaguely understanding it. However, this is used as the basis that our nationalism is not fascism. This is because democracy is paired with the opposite concept of fascism. It is a typical way to conceal fascist historical perception.

T2  - The Korean History Education Review
T2  - 역사교육
M3  - research-article
AB  - Several objections were raised during the National Assembly discussion before the ‘humanitarianism’ was adopted as the Korean educational ideology. There were concerns that it could limit the values of democracy and liberalism and become a fascist logic, but there was generally a consensus that the universal (Western) value of ‘democracy’ should be transformed (ethnic) according to our situation. Therefore, the ‘democratic national education theory’ could be proposed by Ahn Ho-sang, the first Minister of Education. Ahn Ho-sang argued that he avoided both the exclusivity of nationalism and the visa nature of democracy and combined it into “democratic national education.” However, it was fascistic in that it filled the empty space with the people and the state by denying most of the existing political ideologies.Through the presentations of the Democratic National Education Research Conference held in March 1949 and a book called Democratic National Education Theory, we could get a glimpse of how education officials and field teachers accepted Ahn Ho-sang’s Democratic National Education Theory. Education officials basically recognized democracy and nationalism as conflicting and contradictory concepts, but took a passive attitude to suture the two concepts. Like Sa Gong-Hwan, director of the Higher Education Bureau, there were cases where “democratic national education” was justified by weaving nationalist historical perceptions such as Shin Chae-ho, Ahn Ho-sang, Ahn Jae-hong, and Son Jin-tae. There was also a contradiction that the social life and contents newly established to introduce American-style democracy of the time fell into “organic nationalism.” Field teachers also often sympathized with the (guardian) theory that individualistic education and class education should be denied, and that individuals should sacrifice for the people, citing the succession of the Hwarangdo spirit and the Samil independence movement spirit. Some people asked what was essentially the core of “democratic education” and diagnosed that excessive “national education” was being advocated as a reaction to the U.S. military government education policy, but only a few. Education expert Oh Chun-seok also consistently opposed the ‘democratic national education theory’. He criticized that the theory of nationalism education was actually based on a fascist worldview. As a result, however, it did not go further from the level of awareness that seeks the possibility of harmony between democracy and nationalism and concerns about the exclusivity of nationalism.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to propose the measurement of improving DEM by using the water surface range of SAR image analysis for river corridors and to suggest the construction of satellite-based 3D river spatial information of inaccessible regions such as North Korea. For this research, it has been progressed from the accessible area, watershed of Namgang river, the branch of Nakdonggang river. The satellite image was collected from SAR satellite image data for a year in 2021 which was provided by ESA from Sentinel-1A/B data and extracted from the seasonal water surface area. Ground gauge water level was collected from hourly intervals data by WAMIS. The DEM was improved by analysis of the river altitude of water surface area change by the combination of the ground water level of minimum to maximum water surface area data extracted from SAR image analysis. After the improvement of DEM, the altitude of the river varied that it is defined to comprise more natural form of river DEM than the existing DEM. The correction validation of improvement DEM was necessary in field survey elevation data; however, the correction validation was not progressed due to the absence of the data. Although, the purpose of this research is to provide the improvement of DEM by using the analyzed water surface by existing DEM data and SAR image analysis. After the progression of additional correction validation research, we would plan to examine the application in other places and to progress the additional methodological research to apply in inaccessible and unmeasured area including the North Korea.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to find the main implications for establishing a correct view of the disabled based on the Christian worldview of creation, fall, redemption, and completion, in which churches and Christians are clearly distinguished from the world. To this end, we first examine the general social attitude toward the disabled through an overview of history and recent preceding studies. Next, we examine the records related to the disabled in the Bible, and examine the Christian attitude toward the disabled through previous studies. Based on these research results, the implications for establishing a Christian worldview of the disabled are as follows. First, the modern church and Christians must establish a firm Christian worldview that is clearly distinct from the world. Second, all human beings are valuable, meaningful and dignified beings created in the image of God. Third, the essential identity and sense of mission of the church and of Christians must be recognised. Fourth, the active will of improvement and practical efforts such as reflective Bible interpretation and sermons of theologians and pastors is an important foundation.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This article aims at the basic understanding for the liminality, which is the significant cultural-anthropological concept, for the current age of the diverse, innovative changes and their diccontinuity. THe liminality is one of the major social-scientific paradigms that explain the various changes at the multiple levels of human societies. The Christian rediscovery as well as the introductory comprehension of the cultural-anthropological liminality have been investigated for understanding the new paradigm to interpret the current changes. One of the main characteristics of liminality is the ambiguity and inbetweenness, especially in temporal dimension. It is said that the liminal transition appears in the progress of the following three stages: separation, margin, and aggregation. Even though the liminal stage is the unstructured situation with chaos, it is likely to be able to offer the optimistic perspective for the future since it is the transitional period as the inter-structure, which separates from the previous paradigm, and simultaneously, pursues the coming future’s paradigms.Therefore, the paradigm of the liminality can be the effective instrument to understand the social-scientific changes in terms of the Christian history and worldview. Particularly, the necessity of liminality paradigm is elevated by the accelerated changes by the hyper-technology, pandemic phenomena, etc. nowadays, which require the continuing pursuit for the uncertain future as well as the radical adaption of separation from the past root paradigms.Additionally, it is helpful to regard that the marginalization of the Chrisitianity in this age can be reinterpreted as the phenomena of temporal liminality. The praxis for this liminal period is summarized as the concentration upon the fundamental Christian values, the endurability against the ambiguity, and the understanding of the emergence rather than the mechanical and analytical solutions.

M3  - research-article
AB  - With the development of launch vehicles, the number of satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been increasing. Satellite-based SAR can acquire high-resolution images at day and night regardless of the weather. Since SAR resolution is determined by a chirp bandwidth, corresponding a generation technology of wideband chirp is essentially required for high-resolution SAR images under consideration of relatively small and light weight SAR system. Therefore, an ideal chirp waveform generation, which is challenging task in actual hardware, is proposed by modifying a chirp equation for phase calibration, and is verified based on Sentinel-1 satellite SAR parameters. The proposed method is applied to our SAR hardware and we confirm the calibrated waveform. Evaluation results using SAR observation simulation show that the impulse response with the proposed method has better performances.

AB  - South Korea is quite vegetation rich country which has 63% forests and 16% cropland area. Massive NOx emissions from megacities, therefore, are easily combined with BVOCs emitted from the forest and cropland area, then produce high ozone concentration. BVOCs emissions have been estimated using well-known emission models, such as BEIS (Biogenic Emission Inventory System) or MEGAN (Model of Emission of Gases and Aerosol from Nature) which were developed using non-Korean emission factors. In this study, we ran MEGAN v2.1 model to estimate BVOCs emissions in Korea. The MODIS Land Cover and LAI (Leaf Area Index) products over Korea were used to run the MEGAN model for June 2012. Isoprene and Monoterpenes emissions from the model were inter-compared against the enclosure chamber measurements from Taehwa research forest in Korea, during June 11 and 12, 2012. For estimating emission from the enclosed chamber measurement data. The initial results show that isoprene emissions from the MEGAN model were up to 6.4 times higher than those from the enclosure chamber measurement. Monoterpenes from enclosure chamber measurement were up to 5.6 times higher than MEGAN emission. The differences between two datasets, however, were much smaller during the time of high emissions. More inter-comparison results and the possibilities of improving the MEGAN modeling performance using local measurement data over Korea will be presented and discussed.

AB  - Existing domestic studies on estimating rice yield were mainly implemented at the level of cities and counties in the entire nation using MODIS satellite images with low spatial resolution. Unlike previous studies, this study tried to estimate rice yield at the level of eup-myon-dong in Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do using Sentinel-2 satellite images with medium spatial resolution, rainfall and soil data, and then to evaluate its accuracy. Five vegetation indices such as NDVI, LAI, EVI2, MCARI1 and MCARI2 derived from Sentinel-2 images of August 1, 2018 for Gimje-si, Jeollabuk-do, rainfall and paddy soil-type data were aggregated by the level of eup-myon-dong and then rice yield was estimated with gamma generalized linear model, an expanded variant of multi-variate regression analysis to solve the non-normality problem of dependent variable. In the rice yield model finally developed, EVI2, rainfall days in September, and saline soils ratio were used as significant independent variables. The coefficient of determination representing the model fit was 0.68 and the RMSE for showing the model accuracy was 62.29kg/10a. This model estimated the total rice production in Gimje-si in 2018 to be 96,914.6M/T, which was very close to 94,470.3M/T the actual amount specified in the Statistical Yearbook with an error of 0.46%. Also, the rice production per unit area of Gimje-si was amounted to 552㎏/10a, which was almost consistent with 550㎏/10a of the statistical data. This result is similar to that of the previous studies and it demonstrated that the rice yield can be estimated using Sentinel-2 satellite images at the level of cities and counties or smaller districts in Korea.

AB  - Due to climate change, temperature is rising worldwide. Since rapid growth has been achieved focused on cities, South Korea is experiencing serious environmental problems such as heat island and air pollution in urban areas. To solve this problem, the central and each local government are actively promoting tree planting campaigns. This study quantitatively calculated changes in green areas and vegetation of Gumi by the tree planting campaign, and analyzed the temperature changes accordingly. For the target area, the green area, vegetation index, and ground temperature were calculated for 4 different time periods using the given Landsat satellite images. As a result of the study, the green area of was increased by 7.24㎢ and 4.93㎢ for two regions, respectively. Accordingly, the vegetation index increased by 0.14 to 0.16, and the temperature decreased by 0.8 to 1.2℃. The Tree planting campaign not only plays a role in lowering the temperature of the city but also does various roles such as air purification, carbon absorption, and providing green rest areas to citizens. Therefore the campaign should be carried out continuously.

TI  - Accurate Water Level Measurement in the Bridge Using X-Band SAR
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bridges are an important infrastructure during natural hazards; however, the water levels of reservoirs on which exist bridges have often been restricted in practice owing to the lack of gauging stations. This letter presents a method for measuring the relative water level at bridges using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) single-look complex data with an X-band. Unique multiscattering between the bridge and water surface provides a basis for the range shifting of the strong backscattering in the SAR data according to the water level change. The performance was evaluated using multitemporal Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean Basin Observation (COSMO-SkyMed) images with strong backscatter related to the bridge. A time-series of water level is estimated from double-and triple-bounced backscatters and compared with the gauged data. The estimated relative water levels at the subpixel shift aided by oversampling of Hough image have a squared correlation coefficient of 0.985 and 0.999 for the double and triple bounce, respectively. The triple bounce was more consistent with the gauged water level, as the sensitivity of the range distance change is twice that of the double bounce, and the disturbance by the bridge substructure is low. In particular, the standard deviation of the relative water level change using the triple bounce was 0.17 m. The results demonstrated accurate water level measurements with subpixel precision. Therefore, it can be effectively used to monitor hydrological changes in remote areas with bridges.

TI  - Ainu Mythology and Today’s Sustainability Paradigm

M3  - research-article
AB  - The United Nations’ sustainability ideas and the Ainu’s worldview surprisingly coincide. It is not difficult to find ideas like the end of poverty, end of starvation, clean water, clean environment, climate action, justice, peace, and cultural diversity in the Ainu’s orally handed-down mythology. Still, the value of sustainability suggested today was actually not suggested from the Ainu’s perspective, but by the United Nations and their Western-oriented way of thinking. Chapter 26 of Agenda 21 (a non-binding action plan of the United Nations with regard to sustainable development) also mentions the support for indigenous people under the premise of “traditional and direct dependence on renewable resources and ecosystems.” In 1997, the Law for the Promotion of the Ainu Culture and for the Dissemination and Advocacy for the Traditions of the Ainu and the Ainu Culture was enacted in Japan. Considered a revolutionary event by many, it basically tore down the myth of Japanese homogeneity. From that point forward, the Ainu people were officially recognized by the Japanese state and a policy was undertaken to promote Ainu Culture. And yet the policy had limitations in that the Japanese government did not apologize for its role in the Ainu’s forced assimilation and that the Ainu people’s political rights were excluded in the execution of the policy. In fact, this policy started in very limited ways by pigeonholing Ainu people’s culture to nothing more than a “tradition.” While only the memory of their culture of living with nature was chosen to be emphasized, the political and economic independence issues in Ainu culture were not properly taken into account. Under the banner of promoting a multicultural symbiosis, Ainu culture was integrated into the diverse “cultures of Japan.” It certainly has meaningful value to preserve the Ainu culture of the past as well as the value of an ethnic minority. However, the political issue that is included in its sustainability should be more closely examined.

AB  - The river network is one of the essential topographical characteristics in river management. The river network which as previously constructed by the ground surveying method has recently begun to be efficiently constructed using the remote sensing datasets. Since it is difficult to remove these obstacles such as bridges in the urban rivers, it is rare to construct the urban river networks with the various obstacles.In this study, the Sentinel-2 satellite imagery was used to develop the automatic method for detecting the urban river networks without the obstacles and with the preserved boundaries as follows. First, the normalized difference water index image was generated using the multispectral bands of the given Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, and the binary image that could classify the water body and other regions was generated.Next, the morphological operations were employed for detecting the complete river networks with the obstacles removed and the boundaries preserved. As a result of applying the proposed methodology to Han River in Seoul, the complete river networks with the obstacles removed and the boundaries preserved were well constructed.

AB  - The purpose of this studyis to organize Yun No-bin's "New life Philosophy " from a bio-philiosophy perspective and reflect on the current situation in Korea through interpretation of it under the awareness of "recovery" and "connection" that can overcome the problems in our society today. In "New Life Philosophy," Yoon No-bin diagnoses and presents the difficulties of modern society, especially individuals and ethnic groups living in the era of division, and what complex reasons the difficulties originated from. First of all, based on the Bergsonic elements revealed in Yoon No-bin's "New Life Philosophy", we will analyze that Yun No-bin's biological philosophy can be defined as an attempt of epistemological evangelism aimed at expanding our perception by evangelizing our habitual thinking methods. Next, we will analyze the philosophical meaning of the transition from a static worldview to a dynamic worldview while reinterpreting the expansion of perception through epistemological conversion from the perspective of bio-philosophy. Finally, the meaning of liberating life and life through critical perception of various problems in Korean society can be reconsidered as the concept of 'survival'.Yoon No-bin's "New Life Philosophy" is a living philosophy directly connected to our reality, an expansion of understanding based on empathy for life suffering in a concrete reality, and a Copernicanian awareness and practice of the sympathy of life. This can be said to be awareness of life as being-in-relationship, liberation, and freedom.

AB  - Landfast sea ice forms near coastlines in polar regions. Continuous monitoring of this sea ice is important, as it plays a key role in the marine ecosystem and affects the operation of nearby research stations. This study detected landfast sea ice around Jang Bogo research station in East Antarctica by stacking interferometric coherence images of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data with 6-, 12- and 18-day temporal baselines. A total of 50 landfast sea ice maps were generated covering July 2017 to June 2018. The time series revealed regional differences in the timing of the maximum extent as well as growth rate of landfast sea ice. Overall, detecting landfast sea ice using interferometric SAR coherence seems promisingly feasible; however, limitations remain owing to low backscattering coefficients from new and smooth sea ice surfaces and subtle movements of sea ice in contact with the Campbell Glacier Tongue.

AB  - During  the  Japanese  colonial  period,  the  migration  of  Koreans  to Japan  proceeded  under  the  name  of  Dohang.  However,  the  Japanese imperialists  controlled  the  Dohang(渡航,  legal  voyage)  of  Koreans depending  on  their  political  and  economic  conditions.  As  a  result, many  Koreans  who  were  prevented  from  traveling  by  the  Japanese colonial  rule  chose  to  stowaway.  As  for  Dohang,  several  discussions have been held in relation to the issue of Korean residents in Japan for  a  long  time.  However,  research  on  stowaways(密航,  illegal passage), which played a certain role in the migration of Koreans to Japan along with Dohang, is far from sufficient. As long as the number of farmers collapsing in rural areas due to Japanese colonial rule grew, the number of travelers and stowaways was bound to increase.  Therefore,  stowaway  during  the  Japanese  colonial  period was simply not an illegal act simply by personal deviation. It was an important phenomenon and a big event derived from social structural problems of colonial socity.By analyzing the stowaway in detail during the Japanese colonial period, this paper examined the cause of the increase or decrease of smugglers by period, the total size of smugglers during the Japanese colonial period, various methods of smuggling, and the destination of smugglers.  As  a  result,  the  research  revealed  that  the  increase and decrease  of  stowaways  not  only  depend  on  Japanese  imperialism  but also  on  natural  disasters  caused  by  drought  and  flooding.  Alos, the study  confirmed  that after  1940, the  number  of  stowaways who  took advantage  of  the  forced  mobilization  of  Japanese  imperialism increased. the stowaways during the Japanese colonial period, were estimated that about 3% to 8% of Koreans living in Japan around the mid-1930s.Regarding  the  stowaway  method,  stowaway  by  the  stowaway  aboard small  engine  boats  broker  was  the  first  choice  until  1939,  but  after 1940,  stowaway  by  fake  certificates  took  priority.  there  were  two reasons  why  stowaway  fell  to  second  place  after  1940.  One  was  that the  Japanese  Empire  enacted  the  Doryeong(道令)  in  May  1940  and strongly cracked down on stowaway. The other was that stowaways turned  to  stowaways  using  forced  mobilization,  and  the  wartime control economy also caused the engine ship to face a oil shortage. The destination of the stowaway ships were 86% to 96% concentrated in four prefectures in western Japan, geographically close to the Korean    Peninsula.    Among    these    four    prefectures,    Yamaguchi Prefecture  ranked  first,  and  Nagasaki  Prefecture  ranked  second  to third.  Especially  76%-82%  stowaways  arrived  at  Tsushima,  Nagasaki. The reason why the majority of stowaways arrived at Tsushima was that they were using Tsushima as an intermediate stopover.

AB  - In this study, a method for extracting the waterbody of small- to medium-sized streams is verified using SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images based on the shortest plane distance (DST). The areas investigated are the Hantangang River and Jungnangcheon stream. To verify the waterbody extraction method, SAR satellite image data (Sentinel-1) and PlanetScope, which is a high-resolution optical satellite, are used simultaneously. After preprocessing the Sentinel-1 images, their brightness distribution is equalized via histogram matching. To realize an efficient stream extraction, a weight, which is the DST from the stream centerline, is added. After combining this weight value and Sentinel-1's VH and VV polarizations, the optimal parameter value is obtained using the k-means method. This value allows the waterbody to be extracted from Sentinel-1 images with maximum accuracy, depending on the resolution limit. Based on the correlation among the VV, VH, and DST, the waterbody extraction can be calculated using an elliptic equation. Results show that the average accuracy is 0.45-0.75, and the average Kappa coefficient is 0.60-0.85. This study shows that the waterbody area can be estimated using the DST. Additionally, the proposed method extracts the waterbody more simply and rapidly than the existing waterbody extraction method.

AB  - In the novel <Taewonji> in the late Joseon Dynasty, Confucian and non-Confucian thought work mutually. Although Confucianism’s concept of ‘destiny [天命]’ penetrates the superficial narrative, the concrete world conception is based on the experience of voyages in the West, the Daegu theory of the ancient Chuyeon, and the archaeological astronomy mathematics of the Qing dynasty, which has been focused on intellectual experiments since the 18th century, are getting involved. The acceptance of this intellectual movement is realized through narrative composition based on a sense of number, geography imagination, imagination around the world, and a multi-dimensional worldview.<Taewonji> is active in the use of numbers to the extent that it is said to be a novel made up of numbers. It embodies figures and imaginary geography with numerical information and images. This provides realistic impressions and logical realism to fictional characters and virtual worlds. <Taewonji> is a scene of natural displacement from the East Sea to the West Sea during the voyage, and by narrating the imagination of the circumnavigation, it reveals the mathematical logic and empirical worldview of round earth, and recognizes fictional works logically and empirically. However, the circle of <Taewonji> is not a simple physical cycle, but is connected to a symmetrical plural world that moves to the same space with a different order and character. Taewon, which arrived in this way, is a symmetrical plural world of Jungwon, and has the character of ‘the beginning of the Jungwon’, which is historically and civilly located in ancient times.<Taewonji> reflects the competitive knowledge field in the late Joseon Dynasty. However, the attitude of narrative thought experiments that do not passively accept the intellectual movement is also found. <Taewonji> provides an opportunity and experience to reexamine the cultural framework of the late Joseon Dynasty, which was taken for granted, by narratively adapting the thought experiment that causes tension in the existing cultural framework. It also shows the circumstances in which novels in the late Joseon Dynasty participated in thought experiments with an open attitude to the dynamic intellectual environment. A novel cannot be completely free from the cultural framework of the times, but it also does not unilaterally accept the existing cultural culture. The novel participates in the field where the cultural framework of its time is reconstructed, and can serve as a place of experimentation to contemplate new thoughts through highly scalable popular writing.

AB  - This study explored changes of the preservice biology teachers’ epistemological worldviews about teaching and learning before and after science methods courses and after field experiences. Further, their reflections on constructivist teaching during field experiences were explored. The preservice teachers learned about constructivism, and science learning theories through science methods course I during the spring semester and had chances of simulated instruction utilizing constructivist teaching approach through science methods course II during the autumn semester. Then they had a chance of field experiences during the next year of spring semester. Data were collected using the survey of epistemological worldviews on the beliefs about teachers’ role, students’ role, curriculum and evaluation. Pretest, posttestI, and posttestII were administered for three consecutive semesters. Further, the open-ended questionnaire about their reflection on constructivist teaching during the field experience were administered after the field experience. The results indicated that there were no statistical differences among pretest, posttestI, and posttestII of epistemological worldviews. However, the analysis of open-ended questionnaire revealed that the preservice biology teachers most represented relativist views (82.4%) about teachers, while contextualist views (47.1%) about students after the field experience. Also, the preservice science teachers most represented contextualist views about curriculum (70.6%), which is acquisition of situationally relevant knowledge and skills after field experience. Finally, the preservice teachers most represented both contextualist view (47.1%) and relativist view (47.1%) on evaluation after field experience. In addition, about 43% of the preservice teachers mentioned that they implemented the constructivist teaching during the field experiences.

Ariyoshi's works are largely divided into this study examines the works from an "eco-feminism" perspective that all oppressed beings through the representative works "The Twilight Years" and "Complex Pollution".The focus on nature in these works is characterized by the author’s approach to environmental pollution the behavior of elderly people with dementia and their caregivers and their responses to natural objects.Second, the fact that Shigezo reacts to the small and fragile natural elements of modern people and sympathizes with the voices of farmers dealing with the earth and nature clearly reveals the aspect of eco-feminism. In “Complex Pollution” it is shown through an analysis of the attitude with which society’s most vulnerable-such as children, the elderly, pregnant women, and fetuses-are dealt that the spirit of eco-feminism heralds women and nature and rejects.Finally, Ariyoshi rebels against industrial development through the tone of her works, and expresses her worldview of resistance to the paradigm of Western development as well as scientific omnipotence.

AB  - This study aims to examine the direction of Korean politics by analyzing the characteristics of the presidential election, the expected leader image, and the Christian young adults’ role as members of society through interviews on the experiences of the Christian young adults participating in the 20th presidential election vote. The study was conducted through interviews with young people who had attended the church for more than 10 years, and the participants were eight unmarried individuals, five men and three women, age 21 to 32, who had attended church for more than 10 years. The 20th presidential election was characterized by the participants as with mental hardship, the occurrence of problems caused by the unification of candidates, the selection of the second worst candidate, the prominence of conflict and division, and the use of conflict in political parties. The participants’ desired president is one with the heart for the people, morality and sincerity, communication skills, integration, and capacity for governance. The participants’ desire for society is to offer future hopes, build social infrastructure, and solve housing problems. The participants’ roles as social members are to form a Christian worldview, achieve a calling with sincerity, have social sensitivity, and perform with distinctiveness and holiness. In this study, the negative experiences and emotions experienced by young people during the election process were dominant. Considering that the study participants expect the president to have a heart toward the weak, morality and sincerity, communication skills, and conflict integration skills, it was found that they value the president's values and attitudes to respect the people and shape “we community.” In addition, regarding their roles, the value and attitude of looking at society and themselves with a Christian worldview, achieving a calling with sincerity, forming social sensitivity, and pursuing holiness were found to be important. Based on the results, it is hoped that the president and the government, whose term recently started, will respect and accept Christian young adults' emotions and wishes to shape a healthy and visionary Korea. In doing so, as the participants expected from the president and society, this researcher also looks forward to Korea where morality and common sense are worked, people are respected, and people can live with hope.

AB  - This article’s issue is how Korean Christian worldview movement can integrate Korean state  violence victims’ memories and Christian education. According to Lim, Jie-hyun, throughout western languages, the term “responsibility” has more meaning of “response+ability” than of duty. So response to victims’ memories is a responsible response of people of God to triune God that memories and responses to human suffering. Especially Miroslav Volf’s explanation about Martin Luther’s soteriology and eschatology proves this point well. Based on such theological insights, Korean Christian worldview movement must integrate state violence victims’ memories into Christian education through catechism and Eucharist.

AB  - This paper studies how the Buddhist ideas of emptiness, interdependent co-origination, and compassion govern W. S. Merwin’s poetic world. In his determination to become the poet of all living beings, Merwin insists that the earth is the living space of all nonhuman beings as well as humans. At the basis of his ecological thoughts lies his compassion for all creatures suffering under the severe environmental degradation caused by ignorant and merciless humanity. He diagnoses that anthropocentrism and specietal chauvinism are the main causes of our mad rush to ecological disaster. He finds an alternative way of life in the Buddhist idea of emptiness and interdependent co-origination. With the sharp scalp of emptiness, which teaches the original no-selfness of all things, he attempts to cut off anthropocentrism, the most harmful disease in the ecosystem. To do this, he negates and discards the language of humanity, thereby uncovers the futility of human-centered worldview that is based on the discriminating intelligence. Silence is his answer to this corrupt language. Silence drastically changes humanity’s position as the only and prestigious speaker into a passive listener of all languages of nonhuman beings. In this sense, Merwin’s poetics is the poetics of inter-subjectivities between humanity and nature. Only by discarding our chronic disease of anthropocentrism and changing our attitude toward nature can we keep the small hope of the continual existence of humanity and nature.

AB  - This study aims to examine the characteristics of the Pythagorean’s theological mathematics that appeared in fashion in the 1920s, focusing on the works of Jean Patou, Jeanne Lanvin, Madeleine Vionnet, and Sonia Delaunay. This research aims to explore the followings: First, the concept of the Pythagorean’s theological mathematics. Second, the definition of the components of the theological mathematics called arithmetike, harmonike, geometria, and astronomia and the conceptual attributes of theological mathematics extracted based on this. Third, the kind of relationship between theological mathematics's conceptual attributes and fashion design's characteristics in the 1920s. Fourth, the features of the theological mathematics inherent in the collections of Patou, Lanvin, Vionnet, and Delaunay. This study’s research methods are based on the study of literary and content analysis. The theological mathematics is an intellectual worldview regarding the harmony between the metaphysical concept of human, the universe of natural philosophy, and the hypothesis of numbers. The concept Tetrakys established the source of creativity by revealing the order in which the numbers from 1 to 10 are made and the axiomatic correlation between each of them. Meanwhile, fashion designers in the 1920s explored modularized formative beauty and proportional beauty through the harmony between their spiritual and material worldviews developed by the scientific proofs of time and space. This aesthetic concept identified by the balance of heterogeneous elements is aligned with Pythagoras’s expression of the inherent polarity of the mind and body, God and human, ethics and axiom, and metaphysics and reason. Monad was derived from the differentiation in the world and revealed the source of harmonious creation through spiritual purification. Therefore, the theological mathematics of the Pythagorean was the basis of fashion design in the 1920s, characterized by the harmony of heterogeneous elements such as positivity, abstraction, functionalist artistry, geometric body beauty, and pure decorativeness.

AB  - Sijo is a genre of poetry that was created and enjoyed by Sadaebu during the Chosun Dynasty. Sadaebu placed a priority on social responsibility by going to public office once their own personal moral discipline was premised. They regarded the creation of literary works such as Chinese poetry as the basic means of discipline, among which Sijo and Gasa are the literary style which best reflects their worldview and aesthetic point of view. Yoon Seondo, who wrote 75 pieces of Sijo in total, was a person who abided by the Seongrihak ideology throughout his life. This article will delve into the meaning of his early work, Gyeonhoiyo, as well as his perception of reality. Uhuyo, which was written around the same time, will be referred for better understanding Yoon Seondo’s perception of reality.Gyeonhoiyo, which is composed of a total of 5 pieces, is his earliest work. The use of Chinese characters was minimized and the simple Hangeul(Korean letter) was used in his work. Yoon Seondo, one of the representative Sijo poets of the Chosun Dynasty, began his work from his exile period. He criticized the ruling powers at those times, for which he was sentenced to exile by the king’s order. His exile, where he was secluded from the outside world, must have been reflected in his works.As Gyeonhoiyo and Uhuyo were written during this time, they make good resources to probe Yoon Seondo’s perception of reality.Yoon Seondo played a role in raising the potential of Hangeul and connecting literature with life by his Sijo genre. As his works mainly chanted the beauty of nature, he has been evaluated as ‘poet of natural beauty’, and the language and rhythm used in his works are outstandingly soft and lyrical. Yoon Seondo, who took a principled stance on every political issue, had been the target of criticism and checks from other sides, which, in turn, led him to resignation and exiles on several occasions. Yoon Seondo expressed his feelings by creating a piece of Sijo at every major phase of his life. Gyeonhoiyo in this regard will be a great window through which his perception of reality can be best observed.In this article, the aspects of his life in exile at the time of writing Gyeonhoiyo will be examined, which will be preceded by the review of the appeals containing unrestrained criticism of those in power in his time. The conflicts that was developed by the appeals will also be briefly reviewed. In addition, the meanings of the Chinese poems and Sijo works will be reflected, which were created in Gyeongwon, Hamgyeong Province, where Yoon Seondo lived in exile. Based on this, Yoon Seondo’s works of Gyeonhoiyo and Uhuyo will be reflected and his perception of reality at the time of creation will be discussed.

AB  - Background: With the increase in multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative rods, colistin treatment is increasingly required. Reliable susceptibility testing is important for managing infectious patients with MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa . This study evaluated the reliability of an automated colistin susceptibility assay.Methods: In total, 195 non-duplicated P. aeruginosa blood isolates were collected from nine sentinel hospitals in Korea in 2020. Colistin susceptibility with Sensititre KNIHCOL Trek diagnostic system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, England), a commercial broth microdilution (BMD), was compared with that of the gram-negative MIC panel type 44 card (Beckman Coulter, USA). Isolates with discrepant results were reconfirmed using AST-N225 (bioMerieux SA, France).Results: Categorical agreement was 92.8%, and nine colistin-resistant isolates with BMD were colistin-intermediate with two automated colistin susceptibility assays.Conclusions: The failure to detect colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa could not be safely excluded with an automated colistin susceptibility assay.

So, In this study, a worldview of Myeongjuboweolbing seires was constructed focus on core elements of the worldview, Mythos, Topos, Ethos. Mythos is the key to understanding the story world. Mythos in the Myeongjuboweolbing series is ‘The world where the dominance of the spiritual master Yunhyeon and the guardian Hwadosa is affected’, ‘The world where bad monks uses the evil pill made by Kim, Hu-seop.’, ‘The world where fatalism and a fatalistic view of fate coexist’, and ‘The world in which independent family histories have close relationship’. Topos is about a specific point in time and a geopolitical space in the world. Topos in the Myeongjuboweolbing series is a real time ranging from Jinjong Song to Injing, an unreal time in which past and reincarnation exist, a real space where YunÂ·HaÂ·JeongÂ·Um family work, and a boundary space where reality and fantasy world coexist, and an unreal space such as the underworld or heaven. Ethos is the ethical norm that governs the world of novel. Ethos in the Myeongjuboweolbing series is ‘The world that keeps the faith of the relationship created by Myeongju and Boweol’, ‘The world in which they adapt as members of a family by keeping the family life norms to maintain their marriage’, ‘The world in which family should be prioritized over individual desires’, ‘The world where sinocenter and barbarian are separated’, ‘The world where the state can ask the state to solve individual problems’, ‘The world that strictly follows the Neo-Confucian order but is flexible in using kwondo’. Based on this study, transmedia storytelling that spreads the Myeongjuboweolbing series to various media platforms will be possible.

TI  - THE UKRAINIANS' RESISTANCE TO THE ANTI-RELIGIOUS POLICY OF THE SOVIET TOTALITARIAN STATE ON THE WAY OF PRESERVING THEIR NATIONAL AND SPIRITUAL VALUES: the 1960s - the 1970s
T2  - SKHIDNOIEVROPEISKYI ISTORYCHNYI VISNYK-EAST EUROPEAN HISTORICAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Seeing the spread of a religious worldview as a serious threat to the monopoly of the CPSU - KPU, the Soviet government during the 1960s - the 1970s of the 20th century strongly exercised control over the spiritual life of the Ukrainians and instilled atheism in them forcibly. The Ukrainian worshippers became the object of increased attention of the state security authorities. However, the party leadership did not succeed in displacing the religious worldview from the Ukrainian ethnic environment completely. Persecution of worshippers gave rise to religious dissidence. The purpose of the article is to do research on the active resistance of the Ukrainians to the anti-religious policy of the communist authorities of the Ukrainian SSR during the 1960s and the 1970s on the way to preserve their own national and spiritual values. The Research Methodology. During the research, such scientific methods as analytical and logical, historical and systemic, explanation, search, synthesis, comparison, complex selection have been applied. In the article there has been also used the method of analysis to find out the level of growth of the Ukrainians' national consciousness. The principles of systematicity and multifactoriality, etc., have been used to determine the role of the Ukrainian intelligentsia in the defense, preservation and promotion of the Ukrainian national identity in the 1960s and the 1970s. The Scientific Novelty. In the the article there has been elucidated the role of spiritual opposition in preserving the ethnic identity of the Ukrainians in the 1960s and the 1970s; the manifestation of national self-awareness of the Ukrainians during the Soviet anti-religious campaign of the 60s - 70s of the 20th century has been demonstrated; the desire of the Ukrainians to preserve their own national and spiritual separateness has been highlighted. The Conclusion. Despite the anti-religious policy of the Soviet totalitarian state, total oppression by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union - the Communist Party of Ukraine, the Ukrainians did not retreat from the church, but resisted the communists'atheistic policy actively. Christian values continued to be the basis of the spiritual life of the absolute majority of the Ukrainian ethnic group.

TI  - Decolonizing Social Work Education Through Indigenous Family-Based Research
T2  - INTERSECTIONALITIES-A GLOBAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK ANALYSIS RESEARCH POLITY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Family-based research is an Indigenous methodology that engages the self, family, and relationships as important sites of resistance and resurgence. Grounded in an Indigenous worldview, family-based research invokes a broad concept of family that recognizes both human and non-human relations. Family-based research is explicitly introspective and emphasizes the power of personal, relational, and small-scale change in supporting the broader movement of Indigenous resistance, resurgence, and transformation. Mainstream social work education does not know how to deal with, assess, or value family-based research. Western academia claims to have "made space " for Indigenous research, yet there remain limits to this acceptance. Social work education continues to privilege Western methodologies. In doing so, social work disciplines Indigenous students into pursuing research that supports Western theories of knowledge production and Western strategies of change. If social work is truly committed to transforming Canada's colonial reality, then changes to social work curriculum, assessment, and training standards are needed to support diverse understandings and strategies of Indigenous resistance and resurgence, including Indigenous methodologies such as family-based research. To improve student experience, social work education needs to unpack its ongoing role in colonizing Indigenous students through academic gatekeeping.

TI  - Biases and limitations of Global Forest Change and author-generated land cover maps in detecting deforestation in the Amazon
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying land use change in protected areas (PAs) located in tropical forests is a major conservation priority due to high conservation value (e.g., species richness and carbon storage) here, coupled with generally high deforestation rates. Land use change researchers use a variety of land cover products to track deforestation trends, including maps they produce themselves and readily available products, such as the Global Forest Change (GFC) dataset. However, all land cover maps should be critically assessed for limitations and biases to accurately communicate and interpret results. In this study, we assess deforestation in PA complexes located in agricultural frontiers in the Amazon Basin. We studied three specific sites: Amboro and Carrasco National Parks in Bolivia, Jamanxim National Forest in Brazil, and Tambopata National Reserve and Bahuaja-Sonene National Park in Peru. Within and in 20km buffer areas around each complex, we generated land cover maps using composites of Landsat imagery and supervised classification, and compared deforestation trends to data from the GFC dataset. We then performed a dissimilarity analysis to explore the discrepancies between the two remote sensing products. Both the GFC and our supervised classification showed that deforestation rates were higher in the 20km buffer than inside the PAs and that Jamanxim National Forest had the highest deforestation rate of the PAs we studied. However, GFC maps showed consistently higher rates of deforestation than our maps. Through a dissimilarity analysis, we found that many of the inconsistencies between these datasets arise from different treatment of mixed pixels or different parameters in map creation (for example, GFC does not detect reforestation after 2012). We found that our maps underestimated deforestation while GFC overestimated deforestation, and that true deforestation rates likely fall between our two estimates. We encourage users to consider limitations and biases when using or interpreting our maps, which we make publicly available, and GFC's maps.

TI  - Development of InSAR Neutral Atmospheric Delay Correction Model by Use of GNSS ZTD and Its Horizontal Gradient
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) often suffers from atmospheric disturbances due to the microwave propagation delay effect, which limits the surface displacement detection accuracy to an order of centimeters or more. Here, I developed a new neutral atmospheric delay correction model for InSAR by using the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) zenith total delay (ZTD) and its horizontal gradient data. The proposed model at first retrieves the regularly gridded ZTD distribution at sea level and the linear height dependence from GNSS ZTD and gradient observations by the least-squares method. Then, the gridded ZTD is projected onto the InSAR coordinate to correct the neutral atmospheric delay. I evaluated the correction model performance by applying it to the L-band Advanced Land Observing Satellite 2 (ALOS-2)/Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar 2 (PALSAR-2) ScanSAR interferograms over the Kanto plain in Japan. The correction result showed that, by applying the proposed delay correction, the phase standard deviation decreased by 33.87% on average. By comparing it with the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) for the InSAR model and the correction by the Japanese regional mesoscale model (MSM), the proposed GNSS-based model outperformed others in my test case. The sensitivity test indicated that including the delay gradient could improve delay reproducibility under situations with fewer available GNSS stations. Although the proposed correction model's applicability depends on the number of available GNSS stations in the area of interest, the proposed model has the potential to effectively mitigate the neutral atmospheric delay and improve the detection ability for small-amplitude surface displacements.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - OCEANS Conference
CL  - Chennai, INDIA
AB  - Adayar river flows through Chennai city of India. A portion of the sewage from Chennai city drains into the Adayar, which needs flushing into the sea to avoid pollution due to stagnation. The river mouth is characterized by the formation of sand bars at the confluence with the sea, thereby resulting in negligible exchange. A detailed scientific study was carried out for the sustainable opening of the Adayar River mouth consisting of field data collection (during July 2019) for bathymetry, beach profiling and sediment characteristics and desk studies, including analysis of satellite imageries (2007-2016) using ARCGIS and numerical model study using DELFT 3D. Studies conducted using satellite imageries (2007-2016) and field measurements indicate that the mouth remained closed due to the sand bar formation up to the onset of the northeast monsoon in October. Assessment studies have been carried out using satellite data to understand the inlet closure problem and the behavior of the Adyar river mouth. The data analysis shows that the reversal in the current direction and its impact on the accretion/erosion pattern is typical of the phenomenon observed along the East coast of India. To devise a suitable scheme for sustainable mouth opening, dredging of the river mouth and sediment nourishment scheme is evaluated using the numerical model study. The model has been calibrated and validated using the data from the field data collection during July 2019. The model run with the proposed scheme was carried out from July 2017 to August 2018, during which continuously measured wave data was available. From the results, dredging of river mouth and nourishment of eroded northern coast is found to be suitable for the Adyar river mouth, considering the positive impacts on the adjacent shoreline

AB  - Agriculture drought is deemed one of the most horrible phenomena that mankind has been facing. In a nation like India, dry spells are causing such vulnerability due to the inconsistency of precipitations. Administrative bodies are saving energy and cash for the potential dry seasons, yet this procedure is a tedious and testing. Favorable position of geospatial technology is useful to comprehend the dry season inclined territory and its seriousness level through satellite pictures. In the present study, we are working on the Ayacut of Hemavathy river basin, which is located in the southern part of Karnataka, India. The study is mainly about assessing the risk of agricultural drought by using satellite images and meteorological data. Analytical processing of data and preparing maps of NDVI, LULC, rainfall, slope, and drainage was carried out. The study was done using the Landsat 7 images of the decocainizing years. The results indicated that a drought occurred in 2002.

AB  - Tropospheric delay variability remains a significant source of error in the InSAR-derived measurements. Numerical weather models have been proposed as an alternative technique to mitigate tropospheric delays in InSAR and have become a standard procedure for some multi-temporal InSAR processing workflows. This study evaluates the viability of three numerical weather models for mitigating tropospheric delay in InSAR for a tropical region. We assess their performance in correcting tropospheric delay in Sentinel-1 interferograms at different spatial wavelengths using variograms. Their performance is validated using GNSS tropospheric delay and our proposed SAR-derived tropospheric delay estimates. The results indicate that numerical weather model estimates do not mitigate short-wavelength turbulent delays, but can mitigate long-wavelength stratified delays to some extent, which may also introduce additional errors in interferograms. At a spatial wavelength of 40 km, 36% of the interferograms showed increased spatial autocorrelation after correction with GACOS, 55% with ERA-5, and 51% with MERRA-2. In contrast the InSAR-derived tropospheric delays resulted in a significant reduction in variance at all wavelengths indicating the ability to mitigate both turbulent and stratified delays. Our study demonstrates the limited potential of numerical weather model estimates to satisfactorily mitigate trophospheric noise in InSAR and the capability of InSAR-derived trophospheric delay to significantly correct tropospheric noise in InSAR.

AB  - A glacier's mass balance and dynamics are regulated by changes in ice velocity. As a result, estimating glacier flow velocity is a crucial part of temporal glacier monitoring of its health, response to climate change parameters, and its effect on increasing the sea level rise. In this study, we estimated the Gangotri glacier surface velocities from 2014 to 2021. We used remote sensing-based techniques to estimate the Gangotri surface velocity since it provides such measurements regularly for a vast geographical area. Sub-pixel correlation of Landsat 8 imagery was used by using the COSI- Corr (co-registration of optically sensed images and correlation) tool to determine surface velocities over the Gangotri glacier. Our derived velocities values match the ground truth velocities values comparatively well. Gangotri surface velocities vary over the various regions of the glacier, and from year to year. Our study indicated that the middle region of the ablation zone and the accumulation zone had higher velocities across all the years, while the boundary regions of the glacier show lower speeds. The average velocities range varies from similar to 13 m/year in the accumulation zone to similar to 22m/year. For the ablation zone, the average velocities range from similar to 11m/year in the ablation zone to similar to 18m/year. The average surface velocity showed a high decrement of 26 % from 2014 to 2021. The general surface velocities in Gangotri vary from similar to 8 m/y to similar to 61 m/y +/- 1.9 from 2014 to 2021.

TI  - Vegetation Behavior Analysis from MODIS Sensor Indices, in Santa Cruz, Argentina
T2  - INFORMES CIENTIFICOS Y TECNICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of remote sensing allows the evaluation and management of vegetation, in large extensions and at low cost. Some attributes of vegetation cover, such as Net Primary Productivity and growing season, are obtained from the vegetation indices generated with this technology. The objective of this work was to analyse four vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, SAVI and ARVI) in ecological areas of the province of Santa Cruz, with data from the MOD13Q1 sensor, from February 2000 to March 2021. The data, averaged by area, were obtained using Google Earth Engine and statistically analysed with the R-Studio program. Descriptive measures and the attributes of the annual mean curve attributes were obtained for each index. The correlation between indices was analysed. The four indices identified the moments of maximum productivity and were correlated. The NDVI was the index with the best correlation, showing a more homogeneous behaviuor with respect to the vegetation. In relation to the attributes of the NDVI, Andean Complex and Humid Magellanic Steppe showed a maximum in October, Dry Magellanic Steppe had a bimodal behaviour (October and April) and the other areas did not show clear patterns. The differences found are possibly due to the heterogeneity of each region. This could be verified by studying representative sites within each area.

TI  - MAIN INTERPRETATIONS OF POVERTY IN ECONOMIC SCIENCE
T2  - ACADEMY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The article attempts to generalize some interpretations of the poverty phenomenon in Economics. We take into consideration the fact that the problem of poverty has not only economic but also political, social, legal, cultural and other dimensions. In modern science, there is a pluralism of approaches to the definition, classification and measurement of poverty, that depend on the country, time frame and the researcher's own opinion.Many publications of Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Danish, Chilean and other researchers have been used in this article. We have tried to apply the results of their researches to Ukrainian reality.Modern authors consider many dimensions of poverty. It can be explained as the financial, socioeconomic, moral and psychological state of a person, family or the whole population of a country or a region. Poverty is also considered as the inability of a certain section of society to participate in full-fledged social and economic life.Economic, financial, material, social, psychological and other factors of poverty have been considered. Positive correlation between physical abilities and disabilities and poverty has been shown. Some features of the worldview and behavior of the poor are described.Active, passive and parasitic poverty have been distinguished. People who suffer from active poverty usually rely on their own resources. Due to social mobility, some of these people are sometimes able to raise themselves above the category of the poor. Passive poverty means the lack of resources due to the circumstances that are beyond people's control. Parasitic poverty is tightly connected with the use of other people's resources and is characterized by deviant behaviour, which is generally condemned by society and punished by the state.The main indicators of poverty are given. Absolute and relative poverty are considered. Relative poverty cannot be eliminated, since even in the richest countries there are people who cannot afford the benefits available to others.It has been shown that poverty is hereditary, and the children of poor parents are more likely to become poor in the future. Families with many children are often poor, so they cannot afford good education for their children. Therefore, young people without good education remain poor. It has been underlined that poverty is associated with social exclusion and deprivation. Poor citizens do not have the opportunity to organize themselves, as well as to maintain social ties and defend their interests.The interpretations of poverty given by Ukrainian scientists have been considered. In particular, the authors analyze poverty as a consequence of the de-industrialization in independent Ukraine. Special attention has been paid to the following trend: the smaller a town or a village, the higher the level of poverty.

TI  - The Neo-scholastic Metaphysics of Ales Useni?nik and its (Post)Modern Critique
T2  - BOGOSLOVNI VESTNIK-THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY-EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ales Usenicnik was one of the leading representatives of Slovenian neo-scholastic thought, which was built on the Aristotelian assumptions of the "pe-rennial philosophy". The first part of this article presents Usenicnik's neo-scho-lastic metaphysics and his understanding of Christianity and Catholicism. Usenicnik is highly critical of modernity, which refuses the eternal truths of classical metaphysics, and that Usenicnik considers incompatible with the Cath-olic faith. The second part of the article questions both Usenicnik's critique of modernity and the necessity of Aristotelian-inspired metaphysics as the "natu-ral basis" of the Christian worldview. It is argued that there is a tension between the novelty of Christian revelation and Greek metaphysics, and that is one of the important causes of the rise of modernity. Christianity with its biblical un-derstanding of time and history cannot be expressed in a static and rigid meta-physical structure. The third part of the article addresses the challenges of postmodernity and its rejection of metaphysics, which is not acceptable from the Christian point of view. It is therefore important to look for a new under-standing of metaphysics, as to be able to recognize the positive dimensions of tradition - including Usenicnik - while taking into account the peculiarity of biblical revelation in its existential-historical dimension.

TI  - The Image of Childhood in the Short Stories by Fyodor Sologub
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the features of the artistic embodiment of the image of childhood in the short stories by Fedor Sologub, a Russian writer of the late 19th - early 20th century. In his works, the author turned to the theme of the tragedy of human earthly existence and the image of a suffering child. 'Ihe theme of childhood in Sologub's creative quest is integrated in the context of the leading artistic and aesthetic trends, trends, styles of the turn-of-thecentury period - symbolism, naturalism, decadence. In his short stories, which address children's images and destinies, Fyodor Sologub assigns a dominant role to symbols. The writer's works about childhood contain numerous symbolic images that acquire unexpected forms and semantic content. The author delves into the world of children's consciousness, which is turned towards transcendental, supersensible knowledge. In this regard, Sologub's short stories are saturated with images of death and motifs of a child's altered consciousness. The essential features of Fyodor Sologub's ideas of childhood are determined by the specifics of his philosophical beliefs. The writer's creative path and his worldview are inextricably linked with the philosophical views of Arthur Schopenhauer and Friedrich Nietzsche. The author's desire to embody the cult of beauty, death and madness in his works of fiction about children was the result of his fascination with the ideas of German philosophers. The theme of the child hero's departure from the hardships of earthly reality into the world of dreams, art, beauty, madness, death was prioritized in the writer's work. The saturation of texts with landscape and color images, which are often juxtaposed, contrasted, was an important setting of the artistic world of Sologub's short stories about childhood. Color symbolism is extremely significant in the works of the writer, revealing the theme of childhood. The ambiguity and semantic saturation of color imagery endows the short stories about childhood with uniqueness and individuality. The principle of duality, the idea of the supra-world nature of the child-hero, the borderline of his inner worldview was expressed in the writer's prose devoted to the theme of childhood. The image of a child appearing in the short stories fully reflects the author's belief in the mystery, uniqueness, and incomprehensibility of the inner world of a little person. The writer felt close to the theme of suffering and humiliation of a child, which first emerged and was fully shaped in the Russian literature of the 19th century.

TI  - On Earth and as It Is in Heaven-There Is No Sex Trafficking in Heaven: A Qualitative Study Bringing Christian Church Leaders' Anti-Trafficking Viewpoints to Trafficking Discourse
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a lack of contributions in sex trafficking the academic literature from Christian evangelical leaders despite their prominence in global counter-trafficking activism. Given that the academic literature influences professional and pedagogical discourse, the lack of evangelical Christian representation could diminish the complexity of trafficking discourses, limit balanced views of the flaws and strengths of evangelical counter-trafficking, and limit the opportunities for academia to understand and address problematic areas in evangelical counter-trafficking through an emic understanding of evangelical paradigms. Using a phenomenological lens to engage evangelical Christian pastors (n = 17) in the midwestern United States, this study examined the meaning faith leaders attach to counter-trafficking initiatives. Four themes emerged: (1) God cares about survivors of sex trafficking, giving Christians a moral obligation to intervene; (2) God, the Christian, and the survivor all have essential roles in tackling sex trafficking as part of helping humanity; (3) congregations' faith-inspired but imperfect efforts to help an imperfect and complex world create many complexities; and (4) managing complexity involves applying the truths that underpin the Christian worldview, namely that God is good and people are valuable. These findings underscore the need to create an inclusive knowledge-producing forum that allows for a pragmatic exchange of ideas to expand the discourse between multiple counter trafficking actors.

M3  - research-article
AB  - Objective: The establishment of a proper emergency care system can significantly decrease the number of deaths and disabilities. However, this is neglected in many low- and middle-income countries, including Cambodia. At present, many Cambodian hospitals lack designated emergency departments, formal triage systems, and staff trained in emergency medicine. This study sought to measure the functional capacity of the Cambodian emergency care system corresponding to each hospital level using the Emergency Care Assessment Tool (ECAT).Methods: We conducted a survey from April 19, 2021, to April 27, 2021, by distributing survey sheets to a total of eight Cambodian medical staff who were invited to a hospital in South Korea for an educational program. The ECAT comprises items evaluating the capability of hospitals to perform signal functions for each of the six emergent sentinel conditions that could occur prior to death. We analyzed the data by categorizing the hospitals into basic, intermediate, and advanced levels.Results: Basic-level hospitals had weaknesses in signal functions related to altered mental status and trauma care. The intermediate-level hospital showed weaknesses in signal functions related to respiratory failure, altered mental status, shock, and trauma care. Advanced-level hospitals had weaknesses in signal functions related to respiratory failure, trauma, and shock.Conclusion: Our survey shows that most Cambodian hospitals lack the capability to perform the emergency signal functions expected at each level. We believe that this gap can be bridged with proper customized education targeting medical staff based on the level of their hospital and ensuring a proper supply of medical devices.

AB  - As another long-term project to draw analogies between past and present, this paper will aim to explore the irony of the transition from virtuous mercantilism to darker sides of modern Capitalism by examining Shakespeare’s representation of antagonism between Judaism and Christianity in The Merchant of Venice. This paper will probe the compatibility between Christianity and Capitalism as well. Antonio and Shylock are early capitalists, and Shylock’s interpretation of Jacob’s reward to his own advantage is no better than Antonio’s understanding of mercantile venture to his own profit. Together with the nobles’ hypocrisy and materialism, their stances are contradictory to their faith. Mammonism seems unavoidable in a capitalist’s worldview, but it is not the core value of Judeo-Christianity. Therefore, Shakespearean rendering of problematic aspects of Christians from the antagonism between the Jews and the Christians is overlapped with criticism against financial Capitalism. The amalgam of eclecticism all the characters adopt in the play is the prophetic mimesis of widening income polarization where interest and speculative capital play a vital role.

T2  - Rastitel'nye Resursy
M3  - Article
AB  - The age composition and features of the altitudinal distribution of natural stands of Pinus pallasiana D. Don on the southern macroslope of the Crimean Main ridge were evaluated. Using data of Landsat 8 satellite sensor, forest inventory materials, method of hypsometric profiles and strip survey, the stands' age structure and features of their spatial distribution were studied. It was found that natural P. pallasiana forests occupy an area of 6.3 thousand hectares. They are most widespread at an altitude of 500 m above sea level. A sharp reduction in the forest area in the lower growth zone is determined by the negative anthropogenic impact. The age structure is dominated by 120-year-old stands, the total average age of plantings is 140 years, the average life expectancy of trees is 200-220 years, and specimens of 260-280 years of age are rare. A significant proportion of overmature and low representation of young stands indicate the demographic imbalance in P. pallasiana forests on the southern macroslope of the Main Ridge of the Crimean Mountains. It was uncovered, that a large-scale logging of P. pallasiana took place in 1942-1943 in the areas of high-quality plantations. The bioecological characteristics of its consequences influencing the current state and age composition of natural P. pallasiana forests are given. It is shown, that to maintain the genetic diversity and ecological potential of natural plantations of P. pallasiana it is necessary to ensure efficient protection and sustainable development of its individual populations.

T2  - OCEAN AND COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The cosmopolitan coccolithophorid, Emiliania huxleyi form populations composed of different morphotypes distinguished based on coccolith ultrastructure. The relative abundance of these morphotypes varies along the gradients of several environmental factors, including temperature, pH and nutrients, with significant ecological and biogeochemical outcomes as morhotypes differ in the calcite content, hence in their contributions to the downward carbonate transport. A scanning electron microscope examination of Emiliania huxleyi cells and coccoliths was conducted on samples from an Emiliania huxleyi dominated coastal phytoplankton community formation captured on the 29th and 31th of May 2019, performing a morphological and morphometric analysis and an assessment of the environmental nutrient characteristics. The main aim of the study was to describe the morphotype from a highly important ecosystem with E. huxleyi blooms, the Dardanelles Strait, Turkey and contribute to the present scientific understanding of their ecological preferences. The satellite-derived chlorophyll a and particulate inorganic carbon concentrations data were also included to expand the spatio-temporal coverage of the study. The nutrient data suggested nitrogen limitation of the phytoplankton community in general and an additional silicate limitation of the diatoms. The microscopic observations of samples, coccosphere/coccolith counts and the morphologic and morphometric examination of the coccoliths showed the presence of an E. huxleyi bloom solely composed of morphotype A. Furthermore, the satellite data showed the coccolithopore bloom started in the interconnected basin of the Black Sea and progressed into the Dardanelles via the Sea of Marmara.

TI  - Recent Advances and Future Directions in Brain MR Imaging Studies in Schizophrenia: Toward Elucidating Brain Pathology and Developing Clinical Tools
T2  - MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Schizophrenia is a common severe psychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of general population through the life course. Historically, in Kraepelin's time, schizophrenia was a disease unit conceptualized as dementia praecox; however, since then, the disease concept has changed. Recent MRI studies had shown that the neuropathology of the brain in this disorder was characterized by mild progression before and after the onset of the disease, and that the brain alterations were relatively smaller than assumed. Although genetic factors contribute to the brain alterations in schizophrenia, which are thought to be trait differences, other changes include factors that are common in psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, it has been shown that the brain differences specific to schizophrenia were relatively small compared to other changes, such as those caused by brain development, aging, and gender. In addition, compared to the disease and participant factors, machine and imaging protocol differences could affect MRI signals, which should be addressed in multi-site studies. Recent advances in MRI modalities, such as multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and multimodal brain imaging analysis, may be candidates to sharpen the characterization of schizophrenia-specific factors and provide new insights. The Brain/MINDS Beyond Human Brain MRI (BMB-HBM) project has been launched considering the differences and noises irrespective of the disease pathologies and includes the future perspectives of MRI studies for various psychiatric and neurological disorders. The sites use restricted MRI machines and harmonized multi-modal protocols, standardized image preprocessing, and traveling subject harmonization. Data sharing to the public will be planned in FY 2024. In the future, we believe that combining a high-quality human MRI dataset with genetic data, randomized controlled trials, and MRI for non-human primates and animal models will enable us to understand schizophrenia, elucidate its neural bases and therapeutic targets, and provide tools for clinical application at bedside.

T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - The current state and mass balance of some glaciers of the Trans-Ili Alatau (Zailiyskiy Alatau, Tien Shan, Kazakhstan) is estimated in the paper. The remote sensing data (images of the Pleiades satellites) and detailed field geodetic measurements (differential global positioning system with the South G6 instrument)were used for the analysis. The field works were carried out in August-September 2021on the northern slope of the Zailiyskiy Alatau ridge. A digital relief model had been built for the analysis as well. Negative trends in the area of the studied glaciers have been revealed, which generally correspond to the average rate of degradation of the glaciation of the Trans-Ili Alatau from 1955 to the present. A comparison of glaciological (contact, i.e., obtained as a result of measurements made on the glacier) and geodetic (resulted from analysis of remote sensing data) methods for estimating the annual mass balance of the Central Tuyuksu glacier for the period 2016-2021 showed that the final values calculated by these two methods are very close in values. For example, the sum of annual balances calculated by the glaciological method for this period was -2.9 m w.e., or -0.58 a(-1) m w.e. per a year, while the balance calculated by the geodetic method for the same period was 0.63 a(-1) m w.e. Thus, the results of comparison of the above methods of the glacier mass-balance investigation confirm that the geodetic one based on satellite measurements and the ground surveys using the South G6 instrument is in a good agreement with results of glaciological methods of measurements and calculations.

AB  - Machine learning tools are at the spotlight of research and human scientific activities that perform image processing and object detection. The Earth observation domain in particular heavily relies on change detection on images employing image segmentation techniques and a variety of prediction models. In this paper, we focus on such an application, that performs change detection on multi-temporal Sentinel-2 satellite images. The goal of this work is to explore High Level Synthesis capabilities of Intel OpenCL SDK to produce an efficient architecture for accelerating the applications focusing on optimization of a single prediction while taking into account the fragmentation of the problem. Our two-level approach first employs built-in optimization techniques to impact microarchitectural attributes and then scales this baseline to leverage coarse-grain and fine-grained parallelism. The result for the fastest implementation we acquire is a speedup of x7.14 over the Python-TF2 implementation.

AB  - A significant leap forward in the performance of remote sensing models can be attributed to recent advances in machine and deep learning. Large data sets particularly benefit from deep learning models, which often comprise millions of parameters. On which part of the data a machine learner focuses on during learning, however, remains an open research question. With the aid of a notion of label uncertainty, we try to address this question in local climate zone (LCZ) classification. Using a deep network as a feature extractor, we identify data samples that are seemingly easy or hard to classify for the model and base our experiments on the relatively more uncertain samples. For training of the network, we make use of distributional (probabilistic) labels to incorporate the voter confusion directly into the training process. The effectiveness of the proposed uncertainty-guided representation learning is shown in context of active learning framework where we show that adding more certain data to the training pool increases model performance even with the limited data.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL WARMING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is described that the ecological resources of forests is their ability to absorb the greenhouse gases and accordingly to mitigate the climate fluctuations. A forecast empirical-statistical analysis of carbon cycle regulation by the forest cover of the Volga River basin is presented. The adsorption potential of primary and derivatives of boreal and nemoral forests has been established, their ability to mitigate climate changes, including reducing anthropogenic warming, has been evaluated. The losses of ecological resources in forests since the beginning of intensive forest and land use in them were quantitatively assessed. Thermo-arid transformation of forest ecosystems leads to the general decrease in positive carbon balance in most groups of forest formations. Verification of the forecast calculations of the carbon balance was carried out using measurements in the forests of Central Canada. A numerical experiment was executed to assess the effect of the elastic stability of forest formations on their carbon balance.

TI  - ORTHODOXY INSIDE-OUT: HOW CERTAIN ORTHODOX IDEAS ARE REFLECTED IN LEV TOLSTOI'S RELIGIOUS THINKING
T2  - PHILOLOGICAL CLASS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lev TolstoI developed his religious ideas in conscious opposition to the Orthodox faith in which he was raised. He was deeply imbued with Orthodox thinking and incorporated important elements of Orthodox spirituality into his religious system. However, in its basic structure, his teaching differed significantly from the Orthodox worldview. The elements he took from Orthodox spirituality underwent a radical change of meaning when it was applied to his teaching. Thus, in defining Tolstoi's relationship to the Orthodox Church, we must simultaneously emphasize both continuity and rupture. To say that Tolstoy was influenced by Orthodox spirituality is not to say that he was an Orthodox believer in any way - obviously he was not. Rather, we must acknowledge that in 19th-century Russia, the worldview of the Orthodox Church rubbed off on even some of its most vehement detractors.In A Confession, his first religious text after his spiritual crisis in the late 1870s, Tolstoi argued that in Orthodoxy there is "both truth and falsehood". This view can be found even in his most viciously anti-Orthodox work, An examination of Dogmatic Theology, an almost forgotten book which is important for our understanding Tolstoi's attitude towards Orthodoxy. In this article, I focus on two points: his anthropology and his view on how we can understand God. I combine textual and contextual analysis, that is, a careful reading of this book with a reading of the theological treatises on which he based his criticism.

M3  - Article
AB  - Meditativeness today is considered one of the characteristic features of spiritual searches and, at the same time, specifics of various types of creativity. This is the result of the actualization of its factors in the religious, psychological, philosophical and certainly artistic and other spheres of culture of the last century. The purpose of this research and the necessary prerequisite for the subsequent understanding of the peculiarities of the development of meditativeness as one of the principles of modern musical creativity is the initial generalization of data about those opuses in Western academic creativity and experimental planes of musical art of the 20th century, in the title of which the term "meditation" is present. The following conclusions emerge from this investigation: as a result of the generalization of data on "Meditation", which was carried out on the basis of the titles of works with the presence of the term "meditation" in them in Western academic creativity and experimental planes of musical art of the 20th century, it can be asserted that, in this area, genre-forming processes and certain stages dominated by certain stylistic devices are enough clearly visible. These tools are endowed, on the one hand, with the typological unity of aesthetic-stylistic and semantic concepts; on the other hand, they represent the originality of the author's approaches and spread their influence on the next milestones in the development of meditativeness, close to its acquisition of worldview or stylistic significance.

TI  - Ocean Surface Wind Speed Retrieval From the RADARSAT Constellation Mission Co- and Cross-Polarization Images Without Wind Direction Input
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - New techniques for automated retrieval of ocean surface wind speed from the RADARSAT Constellation mission (RCM) without input wind direction have been developed and tested. We collected a large number of collocated and coincided ocean buoy wind measurements and RCM co- and cross-polarization observations acquired over the West and East coasts of Canada from February 1, 2020 to July 25, 2021: 1190 data points for RCM ScanSAR 50 m (SC50M) VV & x2013;VH, 3819 points for SC50M HH & x2013;HV, and 397 points for ScanSAR Low Noise (SCLN) HH & x2013;HV images. The observations captured a wide range of wind conditions with the maximum wind speeds of 22.3, 23.8, and 19.7 m/s for SC50M VV & x2013;VH, SC50M HH & x2013;HV, and SCLN HH & x2013;HV, respectively. For these three types of RCM data, the ocean surface wind speed was modeled as a function of the co-polarization (VV or HH) and cross-polarization backscatter (VH or HV) as well as the noise floor and the incidence angle. The models were tested on completely independent subsets of data, and their performance was compared against CMOD5.N (for VV) and CMODH (for HH) models which require input wind direction. The root-mean square errors (RMSEs) for the proposed models in the testing subsets are 1.20, 1.52, and 1.26 m/s, while CMOD models showed 1.37, 1.91, and 3.06 m/s for SC50M VV & x2013;VH, SC50M HH & x2013;HV, and SCLN HH & x2013;HV, respectively. The proposed models are being integrated in various Environment and Climate Change Canada applications including ice and wind data assimilation systems and the National SAR Winds program.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the problem which is insufficiently studied - the formation and spread of the practice of making endowments as a form of charitable donations based on the example of the activities carried out by Siberian merchants of the 19th - early 20th centuries. The purpose of the study is to provide a holistic overview of the activities of these merchants in the considered region. As a result of the study, about forty cases of the collective and individual endowments of Siberian merchants as well as their names and the size of their contributions have been identified based on the scientific and reference books, literature and archival sources. Moreover, the spheres, for which such donations were sent, have been analyzed. The connection between the development of the institute of endowments and the peculiarities of the credit and financial system of the region has been pinpointed. The results have also shown that the first endowments in the region appeared in the 1830s, but became more widely spread in the post-reform period. Most of such contributions were meant to support public education, the poor and medical institutions. Furthermore, one part of these target capitals was directed to support scientific research, orthodox churches and urban improvement. Special attention is paid to the history of creation and functioning of the Irkutsk orphanage house of E. M. Medvednikova. It is concluded that the practice of making endowments reflected the worldview of merchants and public moods. The article is intended both for historians as well as the widest circle of readers.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network Model for Estimating Ocean Heat Content in the Sea Ice-Covered Arctic Regions Using Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean heat content (OHC) is an essential parameter to assess Earth's energy imbalance, global warming, and climate change over the historical record. An accurate estimate of the OHC in the Arctic sea ice regions is challenging due to the lack of in-situ data and satellite-based algorithms. In this study, an artificial neural network-based (ANN) novel approach is presented for estimating OHC changes at various standard depth extents (in line with the World Ocean Atlas-2018 depth levels) in the Arctic sea ice regions based on the relationships of the sea ice thermodynamic parameters from the satellite measurements and in-situ OHC estimates. Because of the potential uncertainty that arises from the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer in the in-situ OHC estimates, a preliminary ANN model was developed with a set of approximations to account for the in-situ OHC stored in the respective depths within the inaccessible near-surface oceanic layer. The ANN model architecture was optimized for a depth extent of 700 m and adopted for the remaining depths of 20 m, 30 m, 40 m, 50 m, 100 m,150 m, 200 m, 250 m, 300 m, 350 m, 400 m, 450 m, 500 m, 550 m, 600 m, and 650 m. The new model was robust in capturing the spatial, temporal, and depth variabilities of OHC in the sea ice-covered Arctic regions with greater accuracy (mean bias error 0.022 GJ m-2, mean bias percentage error 0.015%, mean absolute error 0.182 GJ m-2, mean absolute percentage error 0.148%, root mean square error 0.24 GJ m-2, R-2 0.94, slope 0.93, and intercept 25.05 GJ m-2). This model is capable of estimating OHC and its temporal trends from satellite data which will have implications for understanding the global climate change and its impacts in the Polar Oceans.

TI  - Spatial Context Awareness for Unsupervised Change Detection in Optical Satellite Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting changes on the ground in multitemporal Earth observation data is one of the key problems in remote sensing. In this article, we introduce Sibling Regression for Optical Change detection (SiROC), an unsupervised method for change detection (CD) in optical satellite images with medium and high resolutions. SiROC is a spatial context-based method that models a pixel as a linear combination of its distant neighbors. It uses this model to analyze differences in the pixel and its spatial context-based predictions in subsequent time periods for CD. We combine this spatial context-based CD with ensembling over mutually exclusive neighborhoods and transitioning from pixel to object-level changes with morphological operations. SiROC achieves competitive performance for CD with medium-resolution Sentinel-2 and high-resolution Planetscope imagery on four datasets. Besides accurate predictions without the need for training, SiROC also provides a well-calibrated uncertainty of its predictions.

TI  - A Spectral-Spatial Feature Extraction Method With Polydirectional CNN for Multispectral Image Compression
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Convolutional neural networks (CNN) has been widely used in the research of multispectral image compression, but they still face the challenge of extracting spectral feature effectively while preserving spatial feature with integrity. In this article, a novel spectral-spatial feature extraction method is proposed with polydirectional CNN (SSPC) for multispectral image compression. First, the feature extraction network is divided into three parallel modules. The spectral module is employed to obtain spectral features along the spectral direction independently, and simultaneously, with two spatial modules extracting spatial features along two different spatial directions. Then all the features are fused together, followed by downsampling to reduce the size of the feature maps. To control the tradeoff between the rate loss and the distortion, the rate-distortion optimizer is added to the network. In addition, quantization and entropy encoding are applied in turn, converting the data into bit stream. The decoder is structurally symmetric to the encoder, which is convenient for structuring the framework to recover the image. For comparison, SSPC is tested along with JPEG2000 and three-dimensional (3-D) SPIHT on the multispectral datasets of Landsat-8 and WorldView-3 satellites. Besides, to further validate the effectiveness of polydirectional CNN, SSPC is also compared with a normal CNN-based algorithm. The experimental results show that SSPC outperforms other methods at the same bit rates, which demonstrates the validity of the spectral-spatial feature extraction method with polydirectional CNN.

TI  - Prediction of Changeable Eddy Structures around Luzon Strait Using an Artificial Neural Network Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mesoscale eddies occur frequently in the Luzon Strait and its adjacent area, and accurate prediction of eddy structure changes is of great significance. In recent years, artificial neural network (ANN) has been widely applied in the study of physical oceanography with the continuous accumulation of satellite remote sensing data. This study adopted an ANN approach to predict the evolution of eddies around the Luzon Strait, based on 25 years of sea level anomaly (SLA) data, 85% of which are used for training and the remaining 15% are reserved for testing. The original SLA data were firstly decomposed into spatial modes (EOFs) and time-dependent principal components (PCs) by the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. In order to calculate faster and save costs, only the first 35 PCs were selected as predictors, whereas their variance contribution rate reached 96%. The results of predicted reconstruction indicated that the neural network-based model can reliably predict eddy structure evaluations for about 15 days. Importantly, the position and variation of four typical eddy events were reconstructed, and included a cyclone eddy event, an eddy shedding event, an anticyclone eddy event, and an abnormal anticyclone eddy event.

TI  - Variability of the Arctic Frontal Zone Characteristics in the Barents and Kara Seas in the First Two Decades of the XXI Century
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The article is devoted to studying the long-term variability of the characteristics of surface manifestations of the Arctic Frontal Zone formed seasonally in the Marginal Ice Zone of the Arctic seas.Methods and Results. To identify the frontal zone, the satellite measurements of surface temperature carried out by the MODIS/Aqua and VIIRS/Suomi NPP from August to September 2002-2020 are used as initial data. The Arctic Frontal Zone position and characteristics were determined using the cluster analysis. In the warm period of the year, the average long-term thermal surface gradient in the Arctic Frontal Zone is revealed to be 0.06 degrees C/km, and its area - 348,000 km(2). Variability of the interannual gradient estimates in this region ranged from 0.04 to 0.09 degrees C/km, and the area - from 159,000 to 489,000 km(2).Conclusions. During the last two decades, spatial position of the frontal zone has been characterized by a significant shift to the north (81 degrees-82 degrees N). The surface temperature in the frontal zone in the last decade was on average higher than that in the previous one. Such dynamics is conditioned by retreat of the arctic ice cover edge. The thermal gradient maximum values in the Arctic Frontal Zone were recorded in 2009, 2016 and 2018 at the significant near-surface wind speeds and the reduced ice cover concentration. The surface temperature, the thermal gradient and the frontal zone area are shown to be conditioned by the ice area and concentration in last year's autumn season. It is established that during a warm season, the North Atlantic Oscillation winter index governs variation of the surface temperature in the Arctic Frontal Zone.

T2  - ACTA GEODYNAMICA ET GEOMATERIALIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Underground mining activity in the region of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) results in ground displacements scattered on a large area. Both the locations and the velocities of the displacements depend on many factors, such as the current location of the mining front, the mining depth and system, as well as geological conditions. Although SAR interferometry techniques allow the monitoring of such ground displacements, in a regional scale (as is the case of the USCB) SAR images must be appropriately processed (from a number of frames and swaths), and this is the problem addressed in this article. The implementation of algorithms for analyzing time series allows observations of displacements in both time and space. The authors also analyze the influence of mining operations on the road infrastructure and mining waste heaps located in the area and investigate the potential for the monitoring of secondary influence (due to induced seismic tremors). As a result of these investigations, the article presents the quality of the InSAR-SBAS data and the potential for their employment in the measurements.

TI  - THE SOVIET PAST THEME IN THE 2021 DUMA CAMPAIGN
T2  - POLITEIA-JOURNAL OF POLITICAL THEORY POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY AND SOCIOLOGY OF POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the theme of the Soviet past in the 2021 Duma elections. The author shows that, in comparison with 2016, the relevance of this topic has not decreased, but has in fact increased. While in the previous Duma elections the confrontations on the issues of the Soviet past dissolved into broader cleavages, this time they manifested themselves very clearly.The author documents the change in the structure of the confrontations on the issues of the Soviet past. If a year earlier such confrontations ran along the lines of "Communists vs. Anti-Communists" and "Liberals vs. Statists", in 2021 they rather went along the lines of "Defenders of the Soviet period vs. its Critics" and "Reds vs. Whites", with communists surpassing liberals and assuming the leading role in such confrontations. The author explains this shift by the growing importance of the topic of the Soviet past in the interparty discussion, because it is the communists who are its main promoters and beneficiaries.The article reveals that the confrontation "Defenders of the Soviet period vs. its Critics" quite convincingly explains the second electoral cleavage. In one of the models, it even displaces the general confrontation between liberals and conservatives in the worldview issues.The use of an alternative methodology based on a double factor analysis allowed the author to detect the opposition "Communists vs. Liberals", as well as an additional one associated with the special position of the Liberal Democratic Party on the issues of the Soviet past. These confrontations colored a number of electoral cleavages, including some of those that otherwise would be impossible to interpret politically.The author interprets an increase in the importance of the Soviet past in the mass consciousness as the evidence that the process of "Left vs. Right" confrontation shifting from the socio-economic area to the socio-cultural one, which is typical for the European and North American democracies, has partially affected Russia.

TI  - Formation of the "Self-Made-Man" Idea in the Worldview of the Renaissance and Reformation
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is the reflection on ways of philosophical legitimation for the "Self-made-man" idea in the worldview of the Renaissance and Reformation. Theoretical basis. Historical, comparative, and hermeneutic methods became the basis for this. The study is based on the works of Nicholas of Cusa, G. Pico della Mirandola, N. Machiavelli, M. Montaigne, E. Roterodamus, M. Luther, J. Calvin together with modern researchers of this period. Originality. The analysis allows us to come to the conclusion that casts doubt on the still widespread belief according to which the emergence of the "Self-made-man" idea is localized by the process of forming the American cultural code and the ideological heritage of Benjamin Franklin. It is highlighted that the formation of this idea is the result of a long process that originated in the ancient world and gains a special impetus in the Renaissance and Reformation. Precisely in the cultural context of the latter, the ancient intention to recognize the individual's right to self-determination and self-government, which in the depths of Christian theology acquires only a potentially universal character, becomes not only acceptable but also, in the context of Protestantism worldview, the only admissible, in fact, individual's obligatory life guidelines. Conclusions. Humanistic and reformation thoughts quite naturally led to further ideological legitimation of the person's idea of who is creating oneself. This legitimation was during the complex interaction of numerous factors of culture in the Late Middle Ages, as well as ideas and intentions inherited from Antiquity. Key among them was the gradual formation of a new social order, in essence, indifferent to paternalistic rudiments, together with the ethics of Protestantism corresponding to it. The latter does not only legalize but, de facto, sacralizes the individual's reorientation from hopes for the synergy of God's grace and own free will in personal salvation, toward the self-reliance and personal efforts, awareness of personal responsibility for the own fate as key principles of the "Self- made-man" concept.

TI  - Thermal Denoising of Cross-Polarized Sentinel-1 Data in Interferometric and Extra Wide Swath Modes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An updated algorithm for the removal of thermal noise in Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) level-1 ground range detected (GRD) data in cross-polarization is presented. The algorithm is comprised of two steps: correction of the annotated thermal noise magnitude (previously proposed in Park et al., 2018) and a novel correction of the annotated thermal noise range dependence. The magnitude of the annotated thermal noise is corrected by applying scale and offset coefficients tuned on a few hundred of Sentinel-1 data acquired over surfaces with low backscatter in interferometric wide and extra-wide swath modes in HV and VH polarizations. The values of coefficients for all modes and polarizations for data processing with the Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) version 3.1-3.3 are provided. The range dependence is corrected by minimizing a cost function between the annotated range profiles of thermal noise and antenna pattern gain (APG). An objective validation metric based on a comparison of averaged backscatter at interswath boundaries is proposed. Validation is performed on hundreds of Sentinel-1 scenes acquired over the open ocean, doldrums, deserts, and sea ice. It shows that the new algorithm outperforms the standard thermal noise removal algorithm proposed by European Space Agency in almost all cases. Analysis shows that the new algorithm worsens noise correction in cases when the range dependence of the annotated APG does not match with the observed signal, indicating either problems with signal processing on IPF or imprecise annotation of APG.

TI  - CHRISTIAN VIEW ON TREATING ANIMALS: THEOLOGICAL CRITICISM OF P. SINGER*
T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work analyses critical theses of Christian theologians against counterreligious arguments of Peter Singer. This criticism considers Singer's interpretation of canonical Christian texts and Christian tradition as a whole. Singer's ethics, which is a variant of preference utilitarianism, suggests that equal consideration of interests (preferences) should include interests of animals as well, because of their ability to suffer. To discriminate creatures based on their species, claims Singer, has no more basis than doing this based on skin color. Thus, Singer questions the Christian anthropocentrism. Singer's conception openly contradicts Christian ethics and religious worldview in general on many issues. Among the points of conflict are issues related to abortion, euthanasia, animal rights, &c. Using several sources, the article examines how Christian thinkers respond to Singer's criticism of the Holy Scriptures, dogmata and practices of the Christian religion. It is shown that in matters of animal rights and relation to nature, the counterargument tends rather not to challenge the positions of Singer's teaching, but, on the contrary, to show that his ethical theses are quite compatible with the Christian teaching. However, this requires a significant expansion in the interpretation of Scripture and other Christian dogmata. It can be stated that the theological position which advocates for the rights of animals does not follow the Thomist tradition; rather, it is rooted in specific branches of Reformed Christianity. For the most part, theologians view Singer's theses on Christianity as a caricature of the Christian tradition. Analysis of the underlying ethical traditions shows that utilitarianism in Singer's version and Christian ethics are little compatible in the essential questions of the animal ethics.

TI  - Humanism: The "Third Denomination" or "Leading Culture"
T2  - SOCIOLOGICESKOE OBOZRENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - After the unification of Germany in 1990, German society became less religious. There is a significant part of the population that does not consider itself belonging to any religion/religious community (Konfessionslos). They do not have a single, integral worldview. However, they are mostly non-religious, and their number has been steadily growing in recent years (now about 40% of the population). Under these conditions, the secular organizations operating in the country seek to attract the interest of this group by offering alternatives to religious culture and worldview. The paper examines the two most influential concepts of secular humanism promoted in Germany, as well as the organizations that promote them. The concept of humanism as a "third denomination" implies the unification of Konfessionslos under the auspices of the German Humanist Union, which represents its members and helps them to cultivate a secular worldview. The concept of humanism as a "leading culture" suggests radically changing the status quo, proclaiming the values of humanism and Enlightenment at the state level, starting their dissemination in schools, and depriving religious organizations of existing privileges.The study examines the prerequisites for the emergence of both concepts, their possible connections with other secular traditions, and the prospects for their success concepts in the future. In particular, an attempt is made to reconstruct the identities of the Konfessionslos in order to determine their role in the processes of secularization. It is shown that the basics and features of the concepts are closely related to the practice of those organizations promoting them. Additionally, the theses of S. Schroder on different types of organizations are critically considered. It is shown that the composition and moods of citizens who do not belong to religious organizations or to convinced believers play a great role in the potential success of the concepts. We describe previous studies of this population group, and show the need for a more thorough study. Finally, we draw conclusions on the relationship of competing concepts and their position in the general logic of secularization processes.

T2  - PSYCHOLOGY AND LAW
M3  - Article
AB  - This material is focused on the problems of psychological and educational work with juvenile delinquents who showed various types of antisocial psychopathies. It describes the main characteristics, features and properties of the most common types of antisocial psychopathies identified in adolescents with deviant behavior. Regarding each type of such psychopathies, appropriate forms of psychological and educational influence were proposed to address the personal qualities and the worldview of adolescent delinquents, to correct their behavior and improve their social adaptation. The author concludes that in the process of using the proposed work practices it should be borne in mind that disorders and deviations in adolescents with antisocial psychopathies manifest most strongly in the emotional-volitional component of their personality structure impacting its entirety at the same time. This fact, in turn, necessitates intensifying efforts from the subjects of psychological and educational work to correct the mental set, world outlook orientations, priorities and life goals of the children in their care and to instill in them true and socially approvable attitudes towards social communications.

AB  - Since the number of in-situ observation data in the ocean region is limited, satellite and model data have been utilized to observe the phenomena of the atmosphere and the ocean. This paper compares satellite and model data with in-situ observation data, which are considered candidates for data assimilation of a numerical weather prediction model, and analyzes quantitative and qualitative differences between them. The accuracy evaluation was based on RMSE, error rate, and correlation coefficient, and seawater temperature had a small error and a high correlation. Comparing in-situ observation data and model data, a high correlation was obtained for a significant wave height, atmospheric pressure, seawater temperature, and although a low correlation for an atmospheric temperature, salinity, and flow velocity, the error rate was low. Regarding sea surface temperature of satellite data, although the correlation was low, the RMSE was less than 0.5 degrees, within the accuracy range of the satellite.

AB  - This work presents SeasoNet, a new large-scale multi-label land cover and land use scene understanding dataset. It includes 1 759 830 images from Sentinel-2 tiles, with 12 spectral bands and patch sizes of up to 120 pxx120 px. Each image is annotated with large scale pixel level labels from the german land cover model LBM-DE2018 with land cover classes based on the CORINE Land Cover database (CLC) 2018 and a five times smaller minimum mapping unit (MMU) than the original CLC maps. We provide pixel synchronous examples from all four seasons, plus an additional snowy set. These properties make SeasoNet the currently most versatile and biggest remote sensing scene understanding dataset with possible applications ranging from scene classification over land cover mapping to content-based cross season image retrieval and self-supervised feature learning. We provide baseline results by evaluating state-of-the-art deep networks on the new dataset in scene classification and semantic segmentation scenarios.

AB  - This paper presents the development of a methodological framework, based on deep learning, for the efficient mapping of main land cover classes (built-up, vegetation, barren land, water body) on different urban and suburban landscapes. In particular, the proposed framework integrates the superpixel segmentation (an essential procedure) with deep learning. A combination of spectral bands and indices is introduced to produce optimal results, ensuring adequate discrimination between built-up and barren land classes. A UNET architecture is implemented, which can learn the characteristics of main land cover classes from the input data that can be deployed from a Colab notebook without excessive computational needs. The resulted classifications depict promising accuracy values (above 90%).

AB  - The paper analyzes the oikonymic space of Ukraine in two aspects onomastic and linguistic, and cultural. The relevance of such a study is dictated by the need to consider onomastic phenomena from the point of view of linguistic and cultural studies to investigate them in systemic-structural and anthropocentric paradigms. It is substantiated that linguistic onomastics as a science contains historical, geographical, ethnographic, sociological, and cultural components and uses their analysis vectors while constantly producing and improving its own. It has been proven that astioculturonyms encode two large layers of information onymic and appellative. Modeling the linguistic and cultural portraits of astonyms of the onymic code made it possible to consider the genesis, functioning features, cultural-historical and national conditioning of each of the names motivated by the onymic. Emphasis is placed on the worldview value of astioculturonyms motivated by appellatives and anthroponyms.

AB  - The article concerns the estimation of land deformation in an area of copper mining using the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique and C-band data coming from the Sentinel-1 satellite. The aim of the work is a comparison of two different PSI approaches exploiting passive corner reflectors deployed pairwise, oriented towards the satellites in ascending and descending orbits. The comparison was done in the line of sight geometry. In addition, a validation was carried out using GNSS measurements. The results achieved using the two PSI approaches are consistent and mutually coherent. They are also congruent with observations from GNSS stations. These results proves that the method proposed to identify pixels on multi-looked images is correct. In addition, the intermediary results on the corner reflectors shows that their responses, in terms of dispersion of amplitude and the coherence, is slightly different. This needs to be further studied.

CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Autonomous navigation of robots in harsh and GPS denied subterranean (SubT) environments with lack of natural or poor illumination is a challenging task that fosters the development of algorithms for pose estimation and mapping. Inspired by the need for real-life deployment of autonomous robots in such environments, this article presents an experimental comparative study of 3D SLAM algorithms. The study focuses on state-of-the-art Lidar SLAM algorithms with open-source implementation that are i) lidar-only like BLAM, LOAM, A-LOAM, ISC-LOAM and hdl graph slam, or ii) lidar-inertial like LeGO-LOAM, Cartographer, LIO-mapping and LIO-SAM. The evaluation of the methods is performed based on a dataset collected from the Boston Dynamics Spot robot equipped with 3D lidar Velodyne Puck Lite and IMU Vectornav VN-100, during a mission in an underground tunnel. In the evaluation process poses and 3D tunnel reconstructions from SLAM algorithms are compared against each other to find methods with most solid performance in terms of pose accuracy and map quality.

TI  - Integrated Primary Production in the Deep-Sea Regions of the Black Sea in 1998-2015
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The work is aimed at estimating monthly changes in the integrated primary production in the deep-sea zone of the Black Sea in 1998-2015 using mathematical modeling based on the satellite measurements.Methods and Results. Based on the SeaWiFS and MODIS satellite observations, the integral primary production was calculated using the model modified by the authors. The algorithm developed in the Marine Hydrophysical Institute, RAS based on the in situ measurements performed in 1997-2015, was used for reconstructing the chlorophyll a concentration by the satellite measurements in the spectrum visible range. The applied sea brightness coefficients for three wavelengths 490, 510 and 555 nm permitted to take into account the colored solute absorption; they are weakly sensitive to the errors of atmospheric correction and to the light backscattering by suspension. The integral primary production was calculated using the Behrenfeld and Falkowski adapted model that had included the phytoplankton physiological parameters derived from the in situ data for the Black Sea. The data on seasonal variability of the fortnight-averaged primary production values for the central part of the Black Sea in 1998-2015 are presented.Conclusions. Over 18 years, in the deep-sea zone (below 500 m), productivity in the water column averaged 157-158 gC . m(-)(2) year(-1). In course of an annual cycle, three periods of increase in the integral primary production, namely the winter-spring, summer and late autumn ones were observed. No productivity trends were noted over the time period under study. The decline of indicators was recorded after 2008. In the eastern and western deep-sea regions, the characters of the primary production changes were similar. The productivity values obtained for 1998-2015 are consistent with those of the previous studies. In the Black Sea, observed are the alternating periods of increase and decrease in the production indicators that is conditioned mainly by climatic effects.

TI  - Food Safety Governance and Guardianship: The Role of the Private Sector in Addressing the EU Ethylene Oxide Incident
T2  - FOODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sesame seeds within the European Union (EU) are classified as foods not of animal origin. Two food safety issues associated with sesame seeds have emerged in recent years, i.e., Salmonella contamination and the presence of ethylene oxide. Fumigation with ethylene oxide to reduce Salmonella in seeds and spices is not approved in the EU, so its presence in sesame seeds from India was a sentinel incident sparking multiple trans-European product recalls between 2020-2021. Following an interpretivist approach, this study utilises academic and grey sources including data from the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) database to inform a critical appraisal of current EU foods not of animal origin legislation and associated governance structures and surveillance programs. This is of particular importance as consumers are encouraged towards plant-based diets. This study shows the importance of collaborative governance utilizing data from company testing and audits as well as official regulatory controls to define the depth and breadth of a given incident in Europe. The development of reflexive governance supported by the newest technology (e.g., blockchain) might be of value in public-private models of food safety governance. This study contributes to the literature on the adoption of risk-based food safety regulation and the associated hybrid public-private models of food safety governance where both regulators and private organizations play a vital role in assuring public health.

AB  - The tremendous potential of ALOS-4/PALSAR-3 for further advancements in forest monitoring from local to global scales are discussed on the basis of the groundbreaking achievements made by its predecessor ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, the first long-term L-band SAR forest observation mission in history. The unprecedented seamless and frequent dual-polarization observation of the entire tropical forest belt between 2016 and 2022 has revolutionized the idea of global forest monitoring. In the upcoming ALOS-4 era, wide-area imaging with greatly improved spatial resolution and image quality at shorter revisit times will further boost the reliability for all kinds of forest remote sensing applications including forest classification, biomass estimation and deforestation detection.

AB  - Nearing 8 years in orbit, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 has acquired the world's first long-term pantropical L-band SAR forest monitoring data archive. The unprecedented dual-polarimetric time-series data allow to revolutionize our knowledge of the complex spatial-temporal processes governing the backscattering behaviors in tropical forests from local to global scale. The paper discusses ALOS-2's tremendous contributions to fundamental SAR forest research, forest cover mapping, biomass estimation, and deforestation monitoring, from better forest/non-forest maps and improved forest type classifications to all-new detailed flooded forest maps and groundbreaking insights on the rainfall impacts on L-band SAR imaging shedding light on the often overlooked relation between precipitation and forest backscatter. Based on these pioneering achievements a novel AI-supported false alarm suppression method was developed for the JICA-JAXA forest early warning system in the tropics (JJ-FAST) enabling the first operational fully automatic near real-time deforestation detection service with overall accuracies above 80% in the Amazon basin.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Here we investigate the intensity of eddy generation and their properties in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) regions of Fram Strait and around Svalbard using spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Envisat ASAR and Sentinel-1 in winter 2007 and 2018. Analysis of 2039 SAR images allowed identifying 4619 eddy signatures. The number of eddies detected per image per kilometer of MIZ length is similar for both years. Submesoscale and small mesoscale eddies dominate with cyclones detected twice more frequently than anticyclones. Eddy diameters range from 1 to 68 km with mean values of 6 km and 12 km over shallow and deep water, respectively. Mean eddy size grows with increasing ice concentration in the MIZ, yet most eddies are detected at the ice edge and where the ice concentration is below 20%. The fraction of sea ice trapped in cyclones (53%) is slightly higher than that in anticyclones (48%). The amount of sea ice trapped by a single 'mean' eddy is about 40 km(2), while the average horizontal retreat of the ice edge due to eddy-induced ice melt is about 0.2-0.5 km center dot d(-1) +/- 0.02 km center dot d(-1). Relation of eddy occurrence to background currents and winds is also discussed.

T2  - BOGOSLOVNI VESTNIK-THEOLOGICAL QUARTERLY-EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - The author of the discussion (Man is a ritual-dialogical being and a being of celebration) focuses on the fact that man is a ritual being, independent of time and space, culture or religion, and presents how this homo liturgicus has been affirmed by ritual dialogue since antiquity, communicating through it with close ones and with the transcendent (God). The discussion shows how despi-te modern-day denials and the search for alternative rituals man remains a ritual being with a touch of transcendence, which has been and remains the "red thread" of human ritual engagement throughout history. This is supported by the fact that social rituals and festive practices have always been and are directly related to the worldview of a specific community or society and its perception of its own identity, since rituals and ritual dialogue with them have been an essential part of public and social life from prehistory to the present. At the end of the discussion, the author derives seven characteristics of ritual dialogue from the biblical passage about "the two disciples on the road to Em-maus" (Luke 24:13-35), which confirm that humans are ritual-dialogical beings and beings of celebration.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The concurrent imaging technique enables parallel acquisitions with different beams or modes, e.g., a wide area Stripmap mode with a High-Resolution Spotlight mode. Such a concurrent Stripmap/Spotlight imaging technique is investigated for TerraSAR-X. This technique employs a pulse-to-pulse interleaving scheme to acquire two acquisitions-even of disjunctive areas-at the same time, offering products with different resolution and coverage portfolios. This capability is especially interesting for customers interested in an overview of a larger area but at the same time observing an area of interest with higher resolution, e.g., for infrastructure monitoring or reconnaissance applications. The basic concepts, as well as the driving system parameters, are discussed in detail, together with a coverage analysis revealing the high availability rate of the mode combinations on a global scale. A processing approach re-using a substantial part of the existing infrastructure is described and exemplary acquisitions are shown, together with a detailed performance analysis with respect to resolution and ambiguities.

AB  - The world-wide absolute geographic positioning accuracy of optical Satellite imagery is mostly about a few pixels of the image resolution. So for example WorldView-3 images have a CE90 of about 4 m. Also the direct georeferencing without ground control information of aerial imagery is in the same range of one to a few metres. These inaccuracies originate predominantly in uncertainties of angular measurements for the sensor attitude. An angular error of only one arc-second at a satellite 750 km above ground results in an absolute error on ground of 3.6 metres. On the other hand radar satellites like TerraSAR-X or TanDEM-X do not measure angles but signal runtimes. So if we identify the same point in an optical image and in a radar image we can solve the problem of inaccurate angle-measurements in the optical sensor models and are able to georeference optical images world wide absolute to below one pixel. In this paper we present a method for identification of point-objects which can be detected in both types of images: the footpoints of poles. If such a footpoint of a pole can be detected simultaneously in both types of images the geoposition of the optical image can be corrected to the accuracy of the point-measurement in the radar image. To achieve a high accuracy also a nearly perfect correction of all errors in signal propagation times of the radar signals has to be conducted. In this paper we describe how the footpoints of poles will be extracted in optical spaceborne or air-borne imagery and how these footpoints are correlated to the potential footpoints of poles detected in the radar imagery.

AB  - The article analyzes the current problems of using certain special knowledge in the investigation of murders. The essence and basic forms of special forensic knowledge (participation of a specialist in conducting investigative (search) actions, consultations of specialists, conducting forensic examinations) used in the process of investigation of these criminal offenses are determined. Emphasis is placed on the expediency of more frequent use of such types of expertise as phonoscopic, soil science and handwriting, the theoretical foundations and methodological basis of which need to be updated and adjusted to take into account the latest techniques and leading world practices. It is concluded that the level of development of relevant methodological recommendations in Ukraine in the field of phonoscopic, soil science and handwriting, their lack of focus on today's problems of investigative and judicial practice. The solution to this problem will be facilitate by the development at the state level and updating of the training program for novice experts, which should include a thorough study of both classical and modern methods and techniques, advanced foreign experience, which will expand the professional worldview research in proving the circumstances of committed criminal offenses, including murder.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the performance of the newly proposed Integrated SAR Vegetation Index (ISVI) in discriminating the crops under two different seasons (Kharif and Rabi) using Sentinel-1 SAR data of C-band frequency. The widely adopted empirical SAR simulations, namely Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index (DPSVI) and Dual Polarimetric Radar Vegetation Index (DpRVI), were employed for both seasons to retrieve the biomass of selected Rabi and Kharif crops. The results of DPSVI and DPRVI found that the simulations have difficulty discriminating certain crops in the lower and higher ranges, respectively. To address this practical difficulty encountered by both SAR models in estimating the biomass, the new empirical model ISVI was proposed. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the proposed simulation effectively discriminates the crops of Rabi (R-2 =0.90) and Kharif (R-2 =0.87) seasons based on their biomass values with an overall accuracy of 84% and 76%.

TI  - THE NAME AND THE CHURCH: OLD TESTAMENT AND EARLY CHRISTIAN VENERATION OF GOD'S NAME AND A. F. LOSEV'S PHILOSOPHICAL ONOMATOLOGY
T2  - VESTNIK PRAVOSLAVNOGO SVYATO-TIKHONOVSKOGO GUMANITARNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA I-BOGOSLOVIE-FILOSOFIYA-RELIGIOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies theological origins of Losev's philosophy of name. It is shown that the ideas about name as energy and about name as cosmos are related to Losev's use of the vestiges of the terminological tradition to employ the notion "name" in order to convey the idea about the divine presence though energies in the created world; these traces are found in the text of the Old Testament and in Early Christian literature. Due to the adaptation of the Greek philosophical terminology by the Christian thought that took place in the early Middle Ages, the idea about the divine presence in the created world came to be conveyed by the term "divine energy". Losev claims that identifying the name and the object that it designates is a feature of pre-philosophical mythological thinking. This explains the use of the divine name in the Old Testament. Philosophical, or rather secular, thinking abandons this element in the worldview. For this reason, it may be argued, the two above-mentioned terminological traditions can be evaluated as vestiges of philosophical vs. archaic worldviews which were reflected in Christian theological terminology as well. However, the use of the Greek philosophical system of categories did not lead Christian theology to complete abandonment of the ontologically understood "name" in Christian theological reasoning. This article argues that the ancient biblical tradition of conveying the thought about the divine presence by means of the categories "name" and "glory" occurs in several Christian authors, e.g. in St. Justin the Philosopher, St. John Chrysostom, St. Isaac of Nineveh. The term "name" which is adjacent to the the term "energy" is according to Losev more appropriate in theological texts. This being said, Losev's idea about God's name as the ontological energy-laden foundation of the cosmos (which is usually seen as borrowed from Neoplatonism) goes back, among other things, to the doctrine of the church as the mystical body of Christ.

TI  - The Boundaries of Philosophy in the Interpretation of Renaissance Skepticism (Pierre Charron)
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The question of the subject and limits of philosophy received various solutions throughout its history, but invariably it was at the center of worldview conflicts of turning epochs. Skeptical constructions have always been of particular importance in this series. One of the most fruitful pages in the development of skepticism is associated with the late Renaissance. In this regard, the figure of Pierre Charron is extremely noteworthy. In his oeuvre, it would be wrong to see only a scholastic repetition of Montaigne's ideas. Of course, the influence of the native of Perigord on Charron's thinking is undoubtedly. But the significance of Charron's legacy goes far beyond simply repeating other people's theoretical attitudes. He approached the construction of his skeptical system through a deep thinking. The starting point on this path is a treatise on the basics of religion. Charron opposes Duplessis-Mornay's concept, which justified the need to fight Catholicism under the slogan of freeing the Church from tyranny. Reflections on the problem of a correct understanding of the essence of religious clashes that resulted in a series of civil wars are a prerequisite for his main work - the treatise On Wisdom. By distinguishing between types of wisdom, he separates religion from philosophy and morality. He accuses modern theologians and metaphysicians of wandering on dead ends. According to Charron, skeptical philosophy was called upon to replace their erroneous constructions, refusing to try to reveal the essence of things and concentrating on civilian life. This kind of philosophy is based on self-knowledge and its true core is morality. Not intending to break with religion, Charron to a large extent stimulated the reflections of subsequent freethinkers. The article focuses on three dimensions of Charron's skepticism.

TI  - Displacement Characterization and Spatial-Temporal Evolution of the 2020 Aniangzhai Landslide in Danba County Using Time-Series InSAR and Multi-Temporal Optical Dataset
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 17 June 2020, a large ancient landslide over the Aniangzhai (ANZ) slope, Danba County, Sichuan Province, China, was reactivated by a series of multiple phenomena, including debris flow triggered by heavy rainfall and flooding. In this study, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired by the Sentinel-1A/B satellite and optical images captured by the PlanetScope satellites were jointly used to analyze and explore the deformation characteristics and the Spatial-Temporal evolution of the ANZ landslide before and after the multi-hazard chain. Several areas of pre-failure movements were found from the multi-temporal optical images analysis before the reactivation of the ANZ landslide. The large post-failure surface deformation over the ANZ slope was also retrieved by the optical pixel offset tracking (POT) technique. A major northwest movement with the maximum horizontal deformation of up to 14.4 m was found. A time-series InSAR technique was applied to analyze the descending and ascending Sentinel-1A/B datasets spanning from March 2018 to July 2020, showing that the maximum magnitudes of the Line of Sight (LoS) displacement velocities were -70 mm/year and 45 mm/year, respectively. The Spatial-Temporal evolution over the ANZ landslide was analyzed based on the time-series results. No obvious change in acceleration (precursory deformation) was detected before the multi-hazard chain, while clear accelerated deformation can be observed over the slope after the event. This suggested that heavy rainfall was the most significant triggering factor for the generation and reactivation of the ANZ landslide. Other preparatory factors, including the deformation behavior, the undercutting and erosion of the river and the outburst flood, the local terrain conditions, and earthquakes, might also have played an important role in the generation and reactivation of the landslide.

TI  - Performance of Speckle Filters for COSMO-SkyMed Images From the Brazilian Amazon
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Speckle filtering is an important step for target detection in SAR images since this effect makes it difficult or even impossible to extract information from these images. There are several filters available in the literature although evaluating their performances is not a trivial task since it requires comparing the filtered images with a speckle-free image, which is generally unknown. This evaluation is even more complex when the features in the images are heterogeneous, for example, from tropical forests. The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of the Lee, deGrandi, GammaMAP, single Anisotropic Nonlinear Diffusion (ANLD), multitemporal ANLD, Fast Adaptive Nonlocal SAR (FANS), and Fast GPU-Based Enhanced Wiener filters to reduce the speckle present in the COSMO-SkyMed Stripmap X-band images from the Brazilian Amazon forest region. The evaluation was conducted qualitatively through the visual inspection of the ratio image and the edge detection in the ratio images and quantitatively through the alpha beta estimator and other statistical parameters of the filtered images. The GammaMAP filter showed the best performances, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and the FANS filter only qualitative.

A description of the burial complex is offered, descriptions of the painted reliefs of the stone burial couch and a stone panel above the tomb door, as well as the complete commented translation of the epitaph of the deceased are provided. Two versions of interpretation of stone reliefs' semantics are proposed: an idealized report on the earthly life to higher powers or ideas about the afterlife. The identification of specific features of the funerary rite, the stylistic and semantic analysis of images on reliefs in comparison with epigraphic data confirm the thesis about the syncretic nature of the studied complex, which combined elements of the Zoroastrian, Confucian, and Buddhist religious and worldview traditions.

AB  - Soil texture is an important parameter influencing a multitude of ecosystem services. However, its determination in the laboratory is complex, time-consuming, and only reveals soil texture at a specific sampling point. Therefore, topsoil soil texture determined from space-borne remote sensing data offers advantages (areal and temporal availability, expanding possibilities with upcoming hyperspectral satellite systems). Since no hyperspectral satellite data are available, we use hyperspectral reflectance data provided in the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS) dataset by the European Soil Data Centre. We resample the provided 4200 bands to the Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) Resolution of 222 bands. Hereafter, we classify soil texture as sandy, silty, clayey, and loamy from these by applying distinct Transformer architecture as well as a one-dimensional convolutional neural network. Our best models multitemporal SimpleVIT and an ensemble approach score 65.89 % and 67.62 % overall accuracy, respectively.

AB  - This work addresses the challenge of the portability of Autoencoder models for the lossy compression of different spatially independent and unknown hyperspectral satellite data. We propose an advanced 1D-Convolutional Autoencoder architecture for lossy hyperspectral data compression with high transferability to unknown spectral signatures. In the first experiment, the model is trained on a single PRISMA data set, and in the second experiment it is trained on five PRISMA data sets from all over the world. The abstraction ability of the two models is verified by processing six spatially independent hyperspectral PRISMA satellite data sets. The evaluation is based on the reconstruction accuracy using the SNR and SA metrics and compares it to other learning-based lossy compression techniques. We demonstrate the high transferability and generalization of our 1D-Convolutional Autoencoder for a fixed compression ratio on each PRISMA satellite data set, which results in superior reconstruction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

M3  - Article
M3  - Book Chapter
AB  - In Britain, the Scouting movement founded by Lord Baden-Powell constituted a pedagogical revolution: rearing children to become lawabiding, class respecting, and imperially minded citizens, it employed storytelling, make-believe, games and sports to achieve is, as opposed to the more stifled approaches of youth associations prior to the advent of Scouting. In this chapter, the early history of the Scouting movement in the Netherlands is read against its British source of inspiration. The Dutch Scouting organizations remained more traditional in their pedagogical approach, and employed only a small amount of Baden-Powell's innovations. Two different strands of imperial ideology - a romantic, conservative worldview, in the British case, and a liberal, development-oriented imperial ideology in the Dutch case - lie at the heart of these difference. Yet, both these ideologies left little room for subaltern agency in the empire, as the racialized stereotypes that were so prevalent during the 1937 World Scout Jamboree show.

TI  - Modeling direct above-ground carbon loss due to urban expansion in Zanzibar City Region, Tanzania
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Expansion of urban fabric on carbon storages is estimated to cause loss of 1.38 Pg of Above-Ground Carbon (AGC) in pan-tropics between 2000 and 2030. This would be approximately 5% of all emissions caused by tropical land use changes. Despite the significance of the phenomenon, these emissions are rarely measured, monitored, or addressed in climate change mitigation plans, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, we demonstrated a state-of-the-art approach predicting AGC loss of Zanzibar City Region under multiple alternative urban planning scenarios between 2013 and 2030. The AGC information was modeled based on field measured forest inventory sample plots and RapidEye satellite data from 2013, while the future urban expansion model was calibrated with data of happened expansion between 2004, 2009 and 2013, and geospatial independent variables influencing the expansion patterns. This model was then projected until 2030, while alternative urban planning scenarios were integrated to the model by modifying the geospatial variables. The combination of these two models indicates that 42,000 Mg or 15% of total AGC in Zanzibar City Region can be anticipated to be lost by 2030 due to urban expansion. Majority of the loss will take place in the agroforest and fruit tree plantations surrounding the city, while natural forest face limited impacts. None of the tested alternative urban planning scenarios significantly impact the loss of AGC compared to the business-as-usual scenario. Therefore, alternative policies and plans are seriously needed to address the issue in Zanzibar. These could include promoting urban densification, directing urban expansion to low carbon areas, improving soil carbon management, and preparing an urban forestry and greenery strategy. All in all, the study indicates that data and methods are available for monitoring and predicting the phenomenon in Sub-Saharan Africa. Research based on a comparable methodology should be produced from all the main cities in the region that are surrounded by significant carbon storages and facing high urban expansion rates to support climate change mitigation.

AB  - Early-stage wheat detection is quite useful and important for monitoring national food security and crop management systems. However, it is difficult to differentiate early-stage wheat among the ploughed and bare lands using medium to low-resolution satellite data at a large scale. Further, the estimated wheat sowing area would be erroneous due to misclassifications of one class to the other class. On the other hand, drones provide high-resolution data at the field level. Hence, there is a need to fuse drone and satellite data for precision agriculture information at a large scale. Therefore, in this paper, we have explored the application of machine-learning classifiers for early-stage wheat detection using drone and sentinel 1A SAR data. Further, the area is estimated for each class and is compared with the area estimated from the high-resolution drone image. Both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the obtained classification results is carried out with the help of field survey data.

TI  - The Problem of Fate and Heroism in Lermontov and Leo Tolstoy. Philosophical Analysis
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides a philosophical analysis of the problem of fate and heroism based on the works of Mikhail Lermontov and Leo Tolstoy. The author examines this problem against the background of the modern cultural and philosophical context, bringing the philosophy of literature closer to the philosophy of culture and philosophical anthropology. The article demonstrates that for Lermontov and Tolstoy a hero becomes a hero when he meets his fate, opposing his will and honor to inevitability, strives to become a demigod and to compare to eternity and multicolored fullness of the nature's life. The author analyzes the motives of childishness, merging with nature, meeting with destiny, aristocratic rejection of modern European rationalism (the philosophy of the bourgeois and raznochintsy), the rejection of history with its reasonable "sense and purpose" and the ideas of justice and retribution. All these features of the worldview and art of Lermontov and Tolstoy are dictated by their heroics. An unreasonable and unjust world where blind fate reigns is the world depicted in their works and aesthetically justified in them. The article also discusses Lermontov and Tolstoy's zealous persecution of pseudo-heroism of "our time": the profanation of fatalism leads to the degeneration of heroism. Thus, the European world of "knowledge and doubt", which has rejected the idea of fate, is contrasted with the world of heroic play. Both the former and the latter are mythologemes, Lermontov and Tolstoy strive to build another, mythological world of childishness and aristocracy outside of history next to the real world of the Pechorins.

TI  - Detecting, extracting, and mapping of inland surface water using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager: A case study of Pune district, India.
T2  - F1000Research
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: Recent developments in optical satellite remote sensing have led to a new era in the detection of surface water with its changing dynamics. This study presents the creation of surface water inventory for a part of Pune district (an administrative area), in India using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and a multi spectral water indices method. Methods: A total of 13 Landsat 8 OLI cloud free images were analyzed for surface water detection. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) spectral index method was employed to enhance the water pixels in the image. Water and non-water areas in the map were discriminated using the threshold slicing method with a trial and error approach. The accuracy analysis based on kappa coefficient and percentage of the correctly classified pixels was presented by comparing MNDWI maps with corresponding Joint Research Centre (JRC) Global Surface Water Explorer (GSWE) images. The changes in the surface area of eight freshwater reservoirs within the study area (Bhama Askhed, Bhatghar, Chaskaman, Khadakwasala, Mulashi, Panshet, Shivrata, and Varasgaon) for the year 2016 were analyzed and compared to GSWE time series water databases for accuracy assessment. The annual water occurrence map with percentage water occurrence on a yearly basis was also prepared. Results: The kappa coefficient agreement between MNDWI images and GSWE images is in the range of 0.56 to 0.96 with an average agreement of 0.82 indicating a strong level of agreement. Conclusions: MNDWI is easy to implement and is a sufficiently accurate method to separate water bodies from satellite images. The accuracy of the result depends on the clarity of image and selection of an optimum threshold method. The resulting accuracy and performance of the proposed algorithm will improve with implementation of automatic threshold selection methods and comparative studies for other spectral indices methods.

TI  - Use of LSTM for Sinkhole-Related Anomaly Detection and Classification of InSAR Deformation Time Series
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinkholes exhibit precursory deformation patterns. Such deformation patterns can be studied using InSAR time-series analysis over constantly coherent scatterrers (CCS). In the past we identified Heaviside and Breakpoint changes as two important forms of anomalous behavior. It is challenging to efficiently detect and classify these sudden step and sudden velocity changes in deformation time series, especially in the presence of tens of thousands CCS. To address this challenge, we propose to classify these forms of anomalous behaviorwith a deep learning-based supervised time series classification. In this study, we used a two-layered bidirectional long short term memory (LSTM) classification model for this purpose. The classified deformation classes were analyzed as well in the context of scattering mechanisms. We implemented thismodel on a sinkhole affected region spanning similar to 63 x 44 km(2) in Ireland, using 104 Sentinel-1 A SAR images acquired between 2015 and 2018. Our results show that the CCS with a linear trend can be correctly classified with a maximum accuracy of similar to 99%, whereas for the CCS categorized as anomalous Heaviside and Breakpoint changes the accuracy drops to a maximum of 62%. Multithreshold-based filtering of samples increased the classification accuracy by as much as 50%. We conclude that themethod thatwe propose is effective in detecting anomalous deformation changes. Future research should investigate how it can be applied to other hazard-related detection and classification problems.

AB  - The Hybrid-polarimetry (hybrid-pol) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors are capable of providing: a sufficient amount of information about the surface that helps to accurately identify the oil-spill, and the reduced satellite revisit time that helps to efficiently monitor the oil-spill and identify minor spills before they can spread out and cause widespread damage. Based on the oil-spill descriptors derived directly from the hybrid-pol Stokes vector, we evaluated the performance of hybrid-polarimetry in separating oil-spills from clean-sea areas. For the analysis, ALOS-PALSAR L-band satellite dataset, acquired over the Gulf of Mexico, is implemented.

TI  - Prognosis of boundary layer assimilative capacity over a landlocked urban district in India: A prelude to exposure risk assessment
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The planetary boundary layer has many dynamic features, and one of them is its assimilative capacity to endure the pollution load. The present study deals with the boundary layer's load-bearing capacity changes over the past two decades and its future projection with a prelude to PM2.5 exposure risk assessment. The surface atmospheric Ventilation parameter (SAVP) is considered to assess boundary-layer assimilative capacity. Twenty years (2000-2019), micro-meteorological parameters from radiosonde & radio wind (RS/RW) data are used to compute surface atmospheric ventilation parameter at a geopotential height of 850 hPa (approx.1.5 km). The atmospheric aerosol load is considered and extracted from the satellite data. The AirQ+ model designed by the World Health Organization (WHO) is exercised for quantifying adult mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) attributed to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5. Boundary-Layer Assimilative Potential (BLAP) is formulated in amalgamation with SAVP and PM2.5 concentration for two different seasons (summer and winter) during the past 20 years (2000-2019). The prognostic analysis using the Holt-Winters method is performed based on which coming decades scenario is forecasted. By assessing the atmosphere's assimilative potential, the study aims to project health risk exposure and mortality and support in building sustainable urban planning.

TI  - Calculating forest species diversity with information-theory based indices using sentinel-2A sensor's of Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary.
T2  - PloS one
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Tropical forest serves as an important pivotal role in terrestrial biological diversity. The present study makes an attempt to identify the concentration of species among tree diversity in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary, Bundelkhand, India. Four important ecological indicator indices namely Shannon-Weiner index (H'), Simpson's diversity (D), Margalef index (SR) and Pielou's (J) indices were make the most for species diversity measurement. The research outcomes revealed that Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H/) was found to be the best index for assessing species richness while Simpson's diversity (D) index was more suited for determining species diversity. The Shannon-Weiner index value calculated for different transects not only represent the species richness but also the species evenness in each transect. The potential application of forest diversity can be used a mechanism for forest management. The methodology will retrofit better policy implementation for maintaining the health of forest species in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary and can be applied on other reserve forest of socio-ecological significance.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 6th International Symposium on Cyber Security Cryptography and Machine Learning (CSCML)
CL  - Beer Sheva, ISRAEL
AB  - In this work, we present a novel idea to enhance the cybersecurity of a low earth orbit (LEO) satellite link assuming that the communication between the satellite (Alice) to the ground station receiver (Bob) is done at sub-THz frequency bands. Such short wavelength creates highly directional antenna beam with very small spot on the ground and thus making it difficult for eavesdropping. However, the satellite transmitter power can be further tuned close to the noise floor so as to make the eavesdropping even more practically difficult. In order to augment the security of the link further, we communicate only within a very specific and designated angle of arrivals of the satellite signal with transmitter power tuned close to the noise floor. The lowering of transmitter power will lead to a lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the ground station receiver and will thus cause a very high probability of eavesdropper (Eve) outages. In order to improve the SNR of Bob's receiver, we derive an optimization algorithm considering the impact of thermal noises from the sky, the ground and the receiver circuit. The algorithm adapts the inter-element spacing between the phased array elements to shape the gain pattern so as to minimize the required transmitter power for a given SNR at the receiver of Bob.

TI  - Modeling the spatial variation of urban park ecological properties using remote sensing data
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Parks perform a wide range of ecosystem services in urban environments. The functional importance of parks depends on the composition and structure of the tree stand and the specific influence on soil and microclimatic conditions. The article reveals the dependence of soil and microclimatic properties on the structure of the crown space of a park stand. Spectral indices were also shown to be applicable for predicting the spatial variability of soil and climatic properties and indicators of crown space. Soil properties (temperature, moisture, and electrical conductivity in the 5-7 cm layer) and microclimatic parameters (light exposure, air temperature, and atmospheric humidity) were measured in the park plantation using a quasi-regular grid. The canopy structure and gap light transmission indices were extracted from the true-colour fisheye photographs. Thirty species of trees and shrubs were detected in the stand and understory. Robinia pseudoacacia L. was found most frequently (24.5% of all tree records). Acer negundo L. and A. platanoides L. were also frequent (12.4% and 15.5%, respectively). The first four principal components, whose eigenvalues exceeded unity, were extracted by the principal components analysis of the variability of ecological properties and vegetation indices. The principal component 1 explained 50.5% of the variation of the traits and positively correlated with the spectral vegetation indices. The principal component 1 reflected the variability of tree cover densities due to the edaphic trophicity. The principal component 2 described 13% of the variation in the feature space. This component correlated positively with the spectral indices. The principal component 2 was interpreted as a trend of vegetation cover variability induced by moisture variation. The principal component 3 described 8.6% of trait variation. It was most strongly correlated with the atmospheric humidity. An increase in atmospheric humidity was associated with an increase in the soil moisture and electrical conductivity and a decrease in the soil and atmospheric temperature. The principal component 4 described 7.5 % of the variation of traits. An increase in the values of principal component 4 was associated with an increase in the soil moisture and electrical conductivity and atmospheric moisture and was associated with a decrease in the soil and atmospheric temperature. The combinations of the trophotope and hygrotope create the optimal conditions for specific tree species, which is a condition for achieving the maximization of ecosystem services. The mineral nutrition conditions of plants and soil moisture exhibit spatial patterns that allow them to be considered in the design and management of park plantations. The ecological indices measured in the field were shown to be predicted using the vegetation indices. Multiple regression models were able to explain 11-61% of indicator variation. The regression relationships between markers of soil and microclimatic conditions and vegetation predictors are important for monitoring the condition of park plantations and evaluating the performance of park plantation management tools.

TI  - Estimation of Flood Inundation and Depth During Hurricane Florence Using Sentinel-1 and UAVSAR Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied the temporal and spatial changes in flood water elevation and variation in the surface extent due to flooding resulting from Hurricane Florence (September 2018) using the L-band observation from an unmanned aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) and C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors on Sentinel-1. The novelty of this study lies in the estimation of the changes in the flood depth during the hurricane and investigating the best method. Overall, flood depths from SAR were observed to be well-correlated with the spatially distributed ground-based observations (R-2 = 0.79-0.96). The corresponding change in water level (partial derivative h/partial derivative t) also compared well between the remote sensing approach and the ground observations (R-2 = 0.90). This study highlights the potential use of SAR remote sensing for inundated landscapes (and locations with scarce ground observations), and it emphasizes the need for more frequent SAR observations during flood inundation to provide spatially distributed and high temporal repeat observations of inundation to characterize flood dynamics.

CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Due to the relatively complex construction and demolition waste (C&DW) spectrum and texture, it is difficult to identify C&DW by simply constructing a remote sensing index. Therefore, this study proposes an automatic identification method of C&DW based on deep learning and the Gaofen-2 (GF-2) Data. Pingdingshan City and Dining City in China were selected as the research areas in the study. The dataset used for deep learning training and testing in the study area was captured by the GF -2 Data. On the basis of this dataset, the deep learning model DeepLabv3+ is used to identify C&DW. The overall accuracy rate of the deep learning model for identifying C&DW is 82.02%, and the overall mIoU is 82.39%. The accuracy of the model for the identification of C&DW areas is further verified by ground verification. The results of this study are helpful for the survey and management of C&DW, which is beneficial to the study of spatial and temporal distribution of urban C&DW, resource utilization and environmental pollution risk reduction.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses a group of medieval items whose differences are manifested in the structural use of a chronologically much older component - an axe, most often Neolithic. Their execution with a view to combat use should be considered doubtful. The executioner's sword (Richtschwert) from Reutlingen (Germany), dated to the first half of the 16(th) century (Heimatmuseum Reutlingen), is worth to be mentioned. Other finds of military character also indicate the reuse of prehistoric stone products (finds fom Khlepen', Smolensk region, Russia, the Waal River near Nijmegen, Netherlands, Gdansk, Poland). The most famous artefact in the category of objects under consideration is the so-called hammer St. Martin, stored at the Catharijneconventin Museum in Utrecht, the Netherlands. The stone axe comes from the Late Bronze Age (around 1000 BC), while the silver binding of the haft was created around 1300. Formal and - probably - functional (ceremonial) kinship is connected with the hammer of St. Martin with two Neolithic "axes" kept in the collection of the Hermitage in Saint Petersburg. The final form of these items was given at the beginning of the 18(th) century. Adapting the discussed objects to new realities inevitably entailed attributing new content and applications to them, reflecting the current mental and worldview horizon of people manifested itself in magical-religious (syncretic) thinking.

AB  - This article aims to contextualize and problematize Alexandre Kojeve's Note on Hegel and Heidegger, written in 1936 and unpublished during his lifetime, which is being introduced into Russian-language scholarship. A translation of the Note is published in the same issue with the permission of the cop-yright holders. This paper provides a general introduction to Kojeve's philosophy, illustrates possible reading strategies for Kojeve and the place of the translated Note in his corpus of the philosopher's texts, and describes the philosophical and historical circumstances of the text, namely that it was composed as an extension of a review on Tragische Existenz. Zur Philosophie Martin Heidegger by Alfred Delp written and published by Kojeve that same year in Recherches philosophique. The article reconstructs the lines of reference that are essential to understanding Alexandre Kojeve and provides a critique of certain statements. Finally, on the basis of an analysis of Kojeve's language, it offers a broader thesis on the epistemological problems of Kojeve's philosophy, the discovery of which led him to make a series of debatable statements in the philosophy of history (on the necessity for the philosopher to participate in the realization of the end of history), in anthropology (on the difference between people in their capac-ity to be philosophers or sages depending on a philosophical and religious attitude that is not entirely dependent on them), and in his decision to leave academia and turn to the ideological and diplomatic provision of economic integration of European states during the Cold War.

AB  - 1. Vegetation memory describes the effect of antecedent environmental and ecological conditions on the present ecosystem state and has been proposed as an important proxy for vegetation resilience. In particular, strong vegetation-memory effects have been identified in dryland regions, but the factors underlying the spatial patterns of vegetation memory remain unknown. 2. We aim to map the components and drivers of vegetation memory in dryland regions using state-of-the-art climate-reanalysis data and refined approaches to identify vegetation-memory characteristics across dryland regions worldwide. 3.

Synthesis. Our study offers a global picture of the vegetation response to two climate forcing variables using satellite data, information which is potentially relevant for mapping components and properties of vegetation responses worldwide. However, the large differences in the spatial patterns in intrinsic vegetation memory in our study compared to previous analyses show the overall sensitivity of this component in particular to the initial choice of extrinsic forcing variables.

AB  - With the beginning of the war on February 24, 2022, a different life began not only for the population of Ukraine, but also for the whole world. Those issues and problems that have been fixed for years and did not require critical attention came to the fore. First of all, the issue of food security arose, since Ukraine was one of the largest suppliers of agricultural products to countries in Europe and Africa. Considering the fact that almost the entire south of the country is under occupation and in the zone of active hostilities, and only 7 southern regions of Ukraine sowed the same area with sunflowers and grain crops as the other 17 regions, we can immediately conclude that problems in the world are inevitable. In this work, a study was conducted on the comparison of cropland area on the territory of Ukraine in 2022 based on crop classification maps based on satellite data. It was determined that the total sown area in 2022 decreased by 10%, which is significant for such big country as Ukraine.

AB  - As a result of the resolution of the armed military conflict on the territory of Ukraine on February 24, 2022, the agricultural infrastructure of the latter was marked by large- scale destruction. Accurate identification of war-affected areas is necessary for the correct allocation of resources for the restoration of damaged fields. In this work, the search for war-damaged agricultural fields is based on data from the Sentinel-2 satellite. Cloud- free composites of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are compared for the immediate period before and after active hostilities in a specific area (dates and locations obtained from ACLED source). Pixels whose relative difference exceeds a given threshold are considered damaged. The survey of the country's territories was conducted from February 24 to September 25, 2022, with the dates divided into two-week periods. According to the results of research, such damage to agricultural fields as funnels from explosions and shelling, traces of machinery, burnt fields, etc., were found. Detected damaged areas were verified using ACLED data. It was established that more than 50% of the total number of identified damaged areas are located within a radius of up to 5 km from the combat zone.

AB  - 1st July 2021 the law on the creation of land market start effect in Ukraine. As a result, land appraisal became cornerstone task in Ukrainian agriculture sector. The official methodology on land appraisal includes use of soil fertility characteristics combined with coefficients related to the distance to the infrastructure objects or settlements and placing of field in specific functional areas, like recreational, or areas with high level of radiation pollution. In this study we collected open source infostructure geospatial information and characteristics of fields obtained from remote sensing data - crop types and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to build land price predictive model trained on the official land market information. This work designed to investigate potential of geo-informational technologies and remote sensing in the land appraisal use. We separated all available ground truth land price data into three groups by fields size - very small, small, medium and big. We found different relationships between field characteristics and prices. For very small fields the most important features are area, altitude, slope, bonitet and distances to elevators, villages and roads. For small fields the most important are bonitet, altitude, area and distances to cities and roads. For medium and big field's area, slope, distance to cities, roads and historical NDVI.

TI  - Ten Years Assessment of Shifting Cultivation on Land Cover and Carbon Storage in Timor Island, Indonesia
T2  - FLORESTA E AMBIENTE
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of shifting cultivation has led to forest degradation and deforestation in the Sisimeni Sanam Forest Area, with Special Purpose (SSFAwSP). Therefore, this study aims to assess land cover and carbon storage changes of the practiced shifting cultivation in SSFAwSP over the last ten years using 2013, 2016, and 2021 Landsat imagery. A hybrid classification approach that combines the forest canopy density model and supervised classification of maximum likelihood was used to create land cover maps to detect changes in forest land cover and carbon storage. The results showed that for ten years, the extent and annual rates of deforestation, forest degradation, forest regrowth, and changes in carbon storage were 662.62 ha (4%), 319.18 ha (3%), 163.8 ha (1%), and-54.51 kilo Ton C (3%), respectively. This finding indicated that shifting cultivation contributed only 10% and 1% of total deforestation and forest degradation, respectively.

AB  - Earth observation via remote sensing imagery provides a fast way to define alteration levels. In this work 12 stands of Araucaria-Nothofagus forests were selected in southern Chile, which represented four alteration levels: (i) None (ii) Low (iii) Medium and (iv) High. The stands were surveyed measuring 379 field plots and Google Earth Engine was used to collect a composite of Sentinel-2 images over a one-year range, from June 2019 to June 2020. The following approaches were tested: (i) aggregating the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of each image and selecting the 95th and 99th percentile values of NDVI for each pixel; (ii) creating a composite imagery with best pixels over one year timeline using NDVI as weighting factor and NDVI value band itself (NDVI) - this is similar to the 99th percentile in the previous point, but with maximum values of NDVI; (iii) aggregating the composite as in the previous approach, but using the full spectral information of Sentinel-2 and then random forest machine learning for classification over alteration areas with k-fold validation with k=5. Results show that the 95th and 99th percentile of NDVI values from approach (i) do not discriminate the four classes correctly. The maximum NDVI from approach can distinguish all four classes. It must be noted through that statistical significance does not necessarily imply a strong practical significance; medium and high alterations have very similar NDVI distributions. Random forest results provided an F-score for each class higher than 80% except for the "medium alteration" class.

TI  - Using digital maps to identify areas of mass developmentof phytoplankton in small freshwater reservoirs
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the results of field observations and interpretation of space images, the authors of the article have analyzed the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of phytoplankton development in four reservoirs of the Kirov region (Russia) from 2015 to 2021. Characteristic features of reservoirs are high color and turbidity of water, high content of organic substances in water. To identify areas of mass development of phytoplankton, the authors calculated four spectral vegetation indices. These are the normalized difference algoindex (NDAI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the chlorophyll a concentration index (TBDO) and the normalized difference turbidity index (NDTI). The initial data for the calculation were satellite images from the Sentinel-2 satellite, posted on the resource EarthExplorer (U.S. Geological Survey). Based on the results of the calculation of spectral indices in the QGIS software product, the authors built digital maps of the studied reservoirs. They noted that phytoplankton developed mainly in coastal shallow areas of reservoirs. The mass development of algae and cyanobacteria was most often observed in July and August. This is typical for reservoirs of temperate zone. The most intense "blooming" of water was in July and August 2016, 2018, 2020 and 2021. At the same time, the following species dominated in phytoplankton samples: Anabaena lemmermanniiP.G.

T2  - NOVYE ISSLEDOVANIYA TUVY-NEW RESEARCH OF TUVA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides a comparative analysis of the naming units of milk and milk drinks that make up the lexical and semantic group "dairy products". They are an invariable and important element of the material culture of two closely related Turkic peoples - the Tuvans and Khakas who have inhabited the vast territories of southern Siberia from the dawn of time. Using lexicographic sources and field data, we have found about 50 lexical units which are divided into three lexical and semantic groups: milk, milk drinks and milk dishes. The collected facts give us the opportunity to reveal the linguistic worldview of the Tuvan and Khakas ethnic groups and to determine the functioning of gastronomic vocabulary (dairy products) in modern languages. The names of dairy products in the Tuvan and Khakas languages are not the same by origin. Along with Turkic roots, there is a significant number of Mongolian elements in them, in particular in the Tuvan language. This group of words in the compared languages reflects their historical contacts with both related and unrelated peoples. In addition, in the names of dairy products we can find traces of the vocabulary that emerged as a result of the formation and development of dialects of the Tuvan and Khakas languages. It has been revealed that dialect vocabulary still exerts a noticeable impact on the contemporary literary languages of the Tuvans and Khakas. All these facts testify to the enrichment of the vocabulary of the Khakas and Tuvan languages with terms of traditional folk material culture from various sources, especially from folklore texts.

TI  - PERCEPTION OF THE CREATION MYTH IN YAKUT EPIC FOLKLORE
T2  - STUDIA LITTERARUM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the ideas about the Creation myth in the Yakut epic folklore. This topic is little-known in Yakut folklore studies, which indicates the relevance if the research. The author of the article identifies and examines traditional ideas about the creation of the world, using the folklore recordings. The novelty of the research lies in the fact that it reveals this issue with involvement of a wide range of materials on mythology and folklore, and also presents a comparison with the oral tradition of other peoples, for the first time. The author identifies motifs about the creation of the world, which are implemented in various ways (expansion, extraction, production, nomination), and shows diachronous coats in the traditional worldview of the Sakha people in the Yakut myths, folk songs and the epic poems, such as "The world has expanded from a small point" ("Expanding Universe"), "A diver pulls the Earth out of the sea," "The Earth and its inhabitants appeared after the drying up of the primary sea," "The world was created by God," "The world was created by God and the devil," "The world created by three brother-gods," "The Universe is divided into three worlds as a result of the conflict of three creators," "At the creation of the Universe, the Middle World was divided into eastern and western Siberia," "Heavenly heroes create the Middle World." The author founds close connections with the worldview of the Evenks, the Evens living in the neighborhood with the Yakuts, as well as the Altai, Mongol -speaking peoples.

TI  - MACROECONOMIC BASIS OF RUSSIAN AGGRESSIVENESS
T2  - ACADEMY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the problem of the roots of Russian aggression in the international arena. It was found that there is a certain correspondence between the dynamics of Russia's GDP and the beginning of aggressive actions of the Russian Federation against neighboring countries. It was found that the beginning of aggression by the Russian Federation coincides with the beginning of the declining phase after a period of GDP growth. To reduce the risk of Russian aggression, it is proposed to develop tools to remove excessive revenues earned from the sale of raw materials. This should neutralize the upheavals of macroeconomic dynamics, which serve as a trigger for the beginning of Russian aggression.The article examines Russian aggression in the system of interdependence and interaction between the individual, society and the state. The authors conclude that each of these groups of actors is responsible for the escalation of Russian aggression. The state commits violence and aggression, which reduces the living standards of individuals. Individuals, faced with a decline in welfare, begin to show more aggression in the fight against their peers. Aggressive Russian individuals form patterns of aggressive behavior and form an aggressive Russian society. Aggressive Russian society demonstrates support for the aggressive actions of the Russian state. This support is growing significantly with the beginning of Russia's attack on neighboring states.Research leads to the conclusion that the problem of aggressiveness of Russians has deep roots associated with the immaturity of their worldview, its attachment to the way of life characteristic of the appropriating economy. Accordingly, a radical solution to the problem of Russian aggression is impossible until the Russian people achieve institutional development. In the meantime, the world community must make efforts to keep the welfare of the Russian population at a consistently guaranteed, albeit low, level. To do this, the peak growth of Russia's GDP must be "cut" in advance with the help of instruments to extract in favor of other countries excessive income of Russian entities from natural rents with rising world energy prices.

T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the validity of snowmelt calculation methods, which are mostly used in hydrology, for the Larsemann Hills oasis (East Antarctica). The study bases on snow surveys data obtained on catchments of Law Lake, Reid Lake and Stepped Lake during the 65th season of the Russian Antarctic Expedition (RAE) in 2019-2020. Materials of the fond of Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) are also used: snow surveys data collected on the catchment of Stepped Lake during the 57th RAE season in 2012 and on catchments of Law Lake, Reid Lake, Scandrett Lake and Stepped Lake during the 62th RAE season in 2017. Considered three methods of snowmelt calculation were derived by P. P. Kuz'min, E. G. Popov, Yu. B. Vinogradov Results of calculation are compared with snowmelt value obtained according to snow surveys. The paper shows two variants of calculations: in the first albedo of snow is determined from function of snow age as different values for each day, in the second albedo is determined from remote sensing data as average value for all period. Results of snowmelt calculation depend on the method which sets value of snow albedo: relative inaccuracies of results obtained of all discussed methods are smaller when albedo is determined as average value. The equation by Kuz'min gives the smallest inaccuracies of snowmelt calculation results in relative to real snowmelt values estimated from snow survey data. This snowmelt calculation method in the majority of cases reviewed gives satisfactory results and should be recommended for estimation of snowmelt values for this Antarctic territory.

AB  - Introduction: at the present time, when modern society is undergoing a process of rethinking of spiritual values, the question of the literary traditions of modern literature becomes very relevant. The study of the artistic experience of Komi literature in connection with the classical heritage contributes to identify the spiritual foundations of life and the activities of modern society, the specifics of their development. The article considers the connection of the creative searches of modern Komi prose writer A. I. Vurdov with the spiritual heritage of K. F. Zhakov, the philosopher, the creator of the original philosophical system, the largest Komi writer who became famous in Russia at the beginning of the XX century.Objective: to identify the connection of the works of modern Komi prose writer A. Vurdov with the creative heritage of K. Zhakov, expressed in the field of narration Research materials: the works by K. F. Zhakov, which became available to a reader at the end of the XX - beginning of the XXI centuries, as well as the experience of small prose by A. I. Vurdov.Results and novelty of the research: one of the aspects of a significant problem is considered - the literary traditions of the newest Komi prose. For the first time, the connection of the works by A. Vurdov with the creative work of K. Zhakov, expressed in the sphere of narration, is revealed. It is established that the nature of the artistic thinking of modern Komi prose writer A. Vurdov is in many ways related to the peculiarities of K. Zhakov's worldview; this connection is also expressed in the features of the narrative sphere of artistic works, the actualization of such a phenomenon of artistic text as understatement. The idea about the features of artistic understanding of reality by the newest Komi prose is enriched

CP  - Conference on Remote Sensing for Agriculture, Ecosystems, and Hydrology XXIV Part of SPIE Remote Sensing Conferene

AB  - Agricultural runoff and municipal sewage generate excessive nutrient input in estuaries, which disturbs the ecosystem's natural balance. Most monitoring programs require in situ measurements, which are expensive, time-consuming, and lack spatial and temporal resolution. Extensive research focuses on mitigating these costs by minimizing the indicators or using remote sensing tools. One of the currently investigated options is the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) data since it can narrow the multi-resolution gap between the in situ and satellite data. As an initial step of such a multi-scaling approach, we focused on testing the applicability of existing algorithms developed for the Sentinel-2 multispectral data (MS) on our hyperspectral (HS) data obtained using UAV. We applied the available algorithms to estimate three water quality (WQ) parameters: Chlorophyll a (Chl a), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM), and turbidity (TUR), for the in situ data acquired at the estuary of the River Jadro near the city of Split (Croatia). The higher spectral resolution obtained by HS imaging enabled us to use the specific wavelengths corresponding to the satellite bands for which the initial algorithms were developed. Moreover, we made one synthetic dataset of MS data, obtained by spectral resampling of HS data using spectral response functions for Sentinel 2 sensors given by ESA.By using these corresponding bandwidths, the initial study found medium and poor correlations with the WQ parameters: Chl a (R-2=0.48), turbidity (R-2=0.07), and CDOM (R-2=0.22). Furthermore, all algorithms revealed higher correlations when using HS data compared to synthesized MS data. However, to fortify these results, we need to test more algorithms and compare the results with satellite reflectance data. Moreover, the future goals of this study are to develop new algorithms which could serve as surrogate data for satellite predictions.

M3  - Article
AB  - As filter feeders, bivalves and ascidians can accumulate contaminants present in the environment and pass them on to higher food chain levels as vectors. The consumption of bivalves contaminated with the potent neurotoxin domoic acid (DA) can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans. The aim of this study was to determine seasonal differences in occurrence and accumulation of this phycotoxin in European oysters (Ostrea edulis Linnaeus, 1758) (n = 46), Queen scallops (Aequipecten opercularis Linnaeus, 1758) (n = 53), and edible ascidians of the Microcosmus spp. (n = 107), originating from the same harvesting area in the Northern Adriatic Sea. The quantification was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) preceded by derivatization with dansyl chloride. DA was found in very low concentrations throughout the year, with a maximum value of 810 mu g/kg in Queen scallops. This study reveals differences in the occurrence and accumulation of DA between Queen scallops and the other two investigated species (oysters and ascidians) and the highest concentrations during the colder part of the year. Even though DA was detected in all of them, Queen scallops showed higher DA accumulation compared to the other two (p < 0.001), hence representing a sentinel species suitable for the monitoring of DA level in seafood.

A total of 12,282 SARS-CoV-2 positive cases were identified, and 7,286 of the associated viruses were successfully sequenced. Two overlapping waves of SARS-CoV-2 activity were observed during the season. The B.1.1.7 (Alpha) lineage was dominant during February 2021 through May 2021. By July 2021, and continuing through the rest of the season, B.1.617.2/AY.x (Delta) lineage predominated and by September 2021 comprised 100% of identified SARS-CoV-2 lineages. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 coincided with substantial reductions in the circulation of seasonal influenza viruses and most other non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens. A total of 4,426 non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory pathogens were identified, including 71 influenza. Of the 71 influenza positives, 64 were successfully sequenced. The majority of influenza strains sequenced belonged to influenza A(H3N2) clades 3C.2a1b.2a2. The most common non-SARSCoV-2 respiratory pathogen detected was rhinovirus/enterovirus (n=3,058).

AB  - This study is for the software implementation to generate atmospheric and surface reflectance products from RapidEye satellite imagery. The software is an extension based on Orfeo Toolbox (OTB) and an open-source remote sensing software including calibration modules which use an absolute atmospheric correction algorithm. In order to verify the performance of the program, the accuracy of the product was validated by a test image on the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) site. In addition, the accuracy of the surface reflectance product generated from the KOMPSAT-3A image, the surface reflectance of Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) of the same site, and near acquisition date were compared with RapidEye-based one. At the same time, a comparative study was carried out with the processing results using QUick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC) and Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) tool supported by a commercial tool for the same image. Similar to the KOMPSAT-3A-based surface reflectance product, the results obtained from RapidEye Extension showed accuracy of agreement level within 5%, compared with RadCalNet data. They also showed better accuracy in all band images than the results using QUAC or FLAASH tool. As the importance of the Red-Edge band in agriculture, forests, and the environment applications is being emphasized, it is expected that the utilization of the surface reflectance products of RapidEye images produced using this program will also increase.

TI  - Machine Learning Methods for Forest Image Analysis and Classification: A Survey of the State of the Art
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The advent of modern remote sensors alongside the development of advanced parallel computing has significantly transformed both the theoretical and real implementation aspects of remote sensing. Several algorithms for detecting objects of interest in remote sensing images and subsequent classification have been devised, and these include template matching based methods, machine learning and knowledge-based methods. Knowledge-driven approaches have received much attention from the remote sensing fraternity. They do, however, face challenges in terms of sensory gap, duality of expression, vagueness and ambiguity, geographic concepts expressed in multiple modes, and semantic gap. This paper aims to review and provide an up-to-date survey on machine learning and knowledge driven approaches towards remote sensing forest image analysis. It is envisaged that this work will assist researchers in coming up with efficient models that accurately detect and classify forest images. There is a mismatch between what domain experts expect from remote sensing data and what remote sensing science produces. Such a mismatch or disparity can be reduced or alleviated by adopting an ontology paradigm methodology. Ontologies should be used to support the future of remote sensing in forest object classification. The paper is presented in five parts: (1) a review of methods used for forest image detection and classification; (2) challenges faced by object detection methods; (3) analysis of segmentation techniques employed; (4) feature extraction and classification; and (5) performance of the state-of-the-art methods employed in forest image detection and classification.

AB  - Although modern psychotherapy and counseling have developed numerous theories and methodologies designed to solve human psychological problems, a single theory that encompasses all aspects of treatment and change processes and has a distinct effect has not emerged. Awareness of this has led to studies on evidence-based therapy, and among them, cognitive behavioral therapy approaches based on mindfulness are being studied very actively. Acceptance-commitment therapy is the treatment approach that Christian counseling researchers are most interested in, and it is necessary to consider and integrate it based on the Christian worldview. To this end, this paper first examines the philosophical premise and core elements of ACT, understanding pain, psychological flexibility, functional contextualism, relational framework theory, and mindfulness. Next, the theological considerations and existing studies on avoidance of experience and the six core processes are reviewed and discussed. The ‘Faith-based acceptance-commitment therapy’ developed for practical integration is examined and its limitations are identified. Finally, a process with ‘heart’ as the key word for alternative Christian counseling that reflects these considerations is suggested. This paper is a literature study, and it is expected that it can be used as a basic data for critical consideration on ACT based on a Christian counseling alternative.

Folktales of animals repaying favors illuminate the friendly relationship between humans and animals. The folktale subtypes examined include helping and reward exchange, symbiotic relationships, and catastrophic endings.These East Asian folktales demonstrate a cultural consciousness that extends beyond the human-centered worldview and suggest the possibility of a mutually beneficial relationship between humans and animals. The folktales show that humans are not the center of the universe, but rather members of a global community that should live and work together. The folktales are especially relevant in light of current global concerns such as the climate crisis, and they demonstrate ecological consciousness such as compassion for animals, symbiosis between humans and animals, and catastrophes caused by human greed and mistakes.

AB  - This thesis examines the consciousness of historical criticism of Songnam (松 南) Cho Jaesam (趙在三) during the 19th century through the Songnamjabji (松南雜 識).Cho Jaesam’s Songnamjabji (松南雜識) is the representative lyuseo (類書) of the late Joseon Dynasty. At that time, intellectuals have organized vast amounts of data according to their preferences. Cho Jaesam also established his own classification system using this academic trend in order to organize knowledge and information.The Songnamjabji (松南雜識) embodies the world of Cho Jaesam, through which we can confirm his worldview, academic views, and view of history through his system of perception of all things. Among these, a consciousness of historical criticism can also be confirmed.This refers to through his the consciousness of restoration of the old land, the authenticity theory, the consciousness of the Qing Dynasty, and the rediscovery of the value of historical figures through historical criticism.He deplored the shrinking of the border and insisted on the restoration of the old land, which described the authenticity theory of the Chinese dynasty. He also, and emphasized his loyalty to the Ming Dynasty accordingly. He also presented historical figures who made significant achievements in the national war, revealing the consciousness of overcoming the invasion of the Western powers and induced the rediscovery of the value of historical figures through historical criticism.Through Songnamjabji (松南雜識), he accumulated and presented as much western knowledge as possible, and presented historical figures who have preserved the nation and its people by preventing foreign ’ invasions, claiming that foreign powers can be warded off through strong national defense and power.He also hoped for the restoration of Joseon Dynasty’s old land in a reality where it was impossible to restore China, and expected that the Joseon Dynasty would ideologically inherit China’s position by maintaining hisloyalty to the Ming Dynasty.

AB  - This study is concerned with the worldview of contemporary people expressed through zombies in movies.God originally gave men the mind of longing for eternity. However, due to sin and corruption in the Garden of Eden, men have completely lost the path to eternity. Men who left God barely lead their lives in the pain caused by sin and the fear of imminent death. Throughout all, men do not give up on hope of eternal life. They live their lives, dreaming of eternity in the arts, thoughts, and the framework of a religion.Zombies in movies are also one of the twisted forms of eternity men yearn for. Zombies in movies are afterlife beings that begin after death at last, and they are also eschatological beings in that they are connected to the global apocalypse as well as the individual’s afterlife. In addition, zombies are judgmental beings in that they reflect on human sin and guilt that caused fatal death, and zombies are also our images in that they express men suffering incurable diseases of death, who are locked up in eternal death, though they would project eternal life.The expression of human longing for eternity in the distorted and warped shape of a zombie perhaps is taken for granted, for men who left God who is the source of truth and life are unable to draw the ultimate eternity and life rightly. We should strive to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ, who is the way, the truth, and the life, toward the world that is desperate, looking at the ‘twisted eternity in the shape of a zombie.’ The message of eternal life found in the words of Jesus who feeds us with His flesh and blood is the best comfort and guarantee for us.

TI  - A Multi-Stage Approach Combining Very High-Resolution Satellite Image, GIS Database and Post-Classification Modification Rules for Habitat Mapping in Hong Kong
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification and mapping of various habitats with sufficient spatial details are essential to support environmental planning and management. Considering the complexity of diverse habitat types in a heterogeneous landscape, a context-dependent mapping framework is expected to be superior to traditional classification techniques. With the aim to produce a territory-wide habitat map in Hong Kong, a three-stage mapping procedure was developed to identify 21 habitats by combining very-high-resolution satellite images, geographic information system (GIS) layers and knowledge-based modification rules. In stage 1, several classification methods were tested to produce initial results with 11 classes from a WorldView-2/3 image mosaic using a combination of spectral, textural, topographic and geometric variables. In stage 2, modification rules were applied to refine the classification results based on contextual properties and ancillary data layers. Evaluation of the classified maps showed that the highest overall accuracy was obtained from pixel-based random forest classification (84.0%) and the implementation of modification rules led to an average 8.8% increase in the accuracy. In stage 3, the classification scheme was expanded to all 21 habitats through the adoption of additional rules. The resulting habitat map achieved >80% accuracy for most of the evaluated classes and >70% accuracy for the mixed habitats when validated using field-collected points. The proposed mapping framework was able to utilize different information sources in a systematic and controllable workflow. While transitional mixed habitats were mapped using class membership probabilities and a soft classification method, the identification of other habitats benefited from the hybrid use of remote-sensing classification and ancillary data. Adaptive implementation of classification procedures, development of appropriate rules and combination with spatial data are recommended when producing an integrated and accurate map.

AB  - K-pop stars are an important influence in the era of digital culture based on emotions. The purpose of this study is to visually express the identity and worldview of their music in the virtual and real world, and to promote Korea's current and past culture. The study also intends to appeal to the emotions of the global fans by designing original textile in their music video ‘IDOL’ on Tiny TAN - a symbol of world pop star BTS. For design development, traditional Korean images shown in the 'IDOL' video were collected, patterns for each member were selected, and a motif was designed on Adobe Illus- trator. We selected the dragon as the motif for V, cloud for Suga, chrysanthemums for Jin, mask for Jung Kook, hanok pavilion for RM, fan for Jimin, and Sam Taegeuk for J-Hope. The selected motifs were designed as per the four textile design arrange- ment methods: square pattern, 1/2 half drop pattern, turn-around pattern, and panel pattern. The design was presented by mapping Kwaeja to Tiny TAN character. The developed textile design can be used not only for character costumes in virtual space, but also for various products such as clothes, accessories, bedding, cosmetics, stationery, and food. By using it to pro- duce goods inspired by K-pop stars, it can be used as basic data for the development of high value-added competitive products in the global market and create synergy effects of K-Design, which would lead a new trend in the design world.

AB  - The preservation of cultural heritage and landscapes, which are constantly endangered by man-made hazards and natural disasters (earthquakes, landslides, floods, fires, urbanization, etc.) is a strategic priority for humanity Nowadays, remote sensing stands out as an important, innovative and cost-effective tool with great potentialities for the protection and monitoring of cultural heritage as well as the prevention of monuments and sites, due to non-invasiveness in such a vulnerable research objective. In this context, remote sensing data, acquired by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) surveys were utilized for the precise mapping and monitoring of rockfalls occurred over an eleventh-century BC. Holy Monastery. The monastery is built on a rocky slope, which hangs over the bank of the ancient river Triton, and it is located a few kilometers away of the village of Andritsena within the Region of Western Greece. Significant damages to the dome of the monastery were detected after the occurrence of rockfalls in late January 2021. Remote sensing data were collected over the monastery area and were processed appropriately. UAV and TLS point cloud were generated and change detection methods were applied for the precise mapping of the rockfalls. Moreover, UAV and TLS point clouds were integrated towards a more comprehensive mapping.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the history of everyday life of the clergy in the conditions of the breakdown of everyday life of the 1920's and 1930's. The given research fills the gaps in knowledge within theoretical and methodological approaches to studying the everyday life of the clergy.The theory of << semantic universum >> (A. Shiuts) considers the history of everyday life as a peculiar << semantic universum >>. This theoretical approach enables understanding the essential processes in the political, economical, cultural, and spiritual life in society, at the same time, avoid neglecting highlighting individual life activities and worldviews of particular representatives of the clergy. The study of the history of everyday life makes it possible to understand the extent to which a person/social stratum/group were involved in the historical process. This approach also encourages rethinking of processes and phenomena in terms of spatial and time dimension, allows reconstructing a portrait of a certain epoch, society, group, individual in the 1920's - 1930's. Therefore, the analysis of everyday life creates a peculiar interpretative matrix for the construction of image of life of one of the most influential stratum in Ukrainian society. The researchers use the methods of empiricism, analytical generalizations, and synthesis to study the cultural practices of everyday life of Ukrainian clergy, their transformations, disappearance, or the emergence of its new forms and contents. The task of the study is to describe the life strategies of the clergy, their worldview, the causes of particular everyday practices, and the mentality of the representatives of the Ukrainian clergy. At the same time, we are aware of the fact that there are a variety of reproductions of images of everyday life which can constisute the general picture of the epoch.

AB  - The settlement at the railroad foundation is often the leading cause of track irregularity and potential derailment. The control of such deformation is considered necessary in track maintenance practice. Nevertheless, the monitoring process performed by in situ surveying requires an excessive amount of manpower and cost. The InSAR, a remote sensing technique by RADAR satellite, is used to overcome such a burden. The PS-InSAR technique is preferred for a long-term precise monitoring method. However, this study aims to obtain relatively brief analysis results from only two satellite images using the D-InSAR technique, while a minimum of 25 images are required for PS-InSAR. This study verifies the precision of D-InSAR within a few millimeters by inspecting railroad facilities and land settlements in Korea Railroad Research Institute’s test track with images from TerraSAR-X Satellite. Multiple corner reflectors were adopted and installed on an embankment and the building roof to raise the surface reflectivity. Those reflectors were slightly adjusted periodically to verify the detecting performance. The results revealed the optimum distance between corner reflectors. Further, the deformation of railway tracks, slopes, and concrete structures was analyzed successively. In conclusion, this study indicates that the D-InSAR technique effectively monitors the short-term deformation of a broad area such as railway structures.

AB  - In narrative comics based on a variety of extensive worldviews, background information related to the story is often necessary. Background information derived from a work’s worldview helps readers understand the story and strengthens its plausibility, aiding the completion of the narrative. However, if the background information is not directly related to the flow of the main theme of the story, it could obstruct the same, and decrease engagement in narratives. Therefore, background information needs to be presented carefully in a way that minimizes friction with the story flow. This study examines the case of Koshi Ankokuden, comics written by Daijiro Morohoshi, to explore how to present background information. The work depicted the adventure of a sacred boy in ancient Asia, and offered extensive background information regarding ancient history, oriental philosophy, and anthropology. Three methods were used to present background information. The first is to add footnotes from an omniscient viewpoint. It is the simplest way to provide information about history, characters, and  wherever necessary. The second is to present background information according to the grammar of storytelling: deficiency and satisfaction. A story begins with motives with significant information deficiency, and is completed by adding background information to supplement the deficiency. on the third is to offer background information through the revelation of a guide who appears as a minor character and aids the adventures of a protagonist and imparts background information to the readers from an omniscient viewpoint. Unlike the first method, the second and third ones integrate background information into the story directly or indirectly, producing the effect of offsetting resistance being applied to the story flow. However, such methods may result in decreased engagement and empathy with the protagonist. Given this, it is necessary to think about ways of presentation that increase both empathy with characters and engagement in the narrative by combining background information and characters as a single story.

AB  - Nikolai Leskov's novel <Lefty>, published in 1881, as can be seen from the subtitle, “The Tale of the Lefty and Steel Flea in the Tula region.” It is a story about a genius russian blacksmith, who put heels on steel flea’s shoes, which is a product of British science and Nano-art technology. M. Gorky evaluated Nikolai Leskov as a ‘magician of language’, who secured an independent position in the history of Russian literature with a realistic russian people's language, comparable to Tolstoy and other masters of Russian literature. In fact, Leskov helped his relative’s business and traveled all over Russia, deeply understood life in Russian villages and the language of the people. Leskov's works are recognized as difficult to translate due to his unique style and social dialects with strong local colors. Therefore, the study of the linguistic and stylistic characteristics of Leskov's work, who is praised as the most peculiar russian writer, will help to understand the russian language and culture of the Russian public and furthermore, understand the structure of consciousness and worldview of Russians. Leskov's representative work <Lefty> is a so-called ‘Leskov lexicon’. He composed various word-combination and neologisms for new conceptions, which has no reference and no notions. Despite the fact that <Lefty> has a novel form, the author himself named a ‘story(skaz)’ through the narrative form of ‘storytelling’ by putting the narrative narrator (storyteller) in the foreground and separating Leskov's own author's narrative. It is stylistic strategy to give probabilities and realism of the narrative. Leskov intentionally gives the impression that it is not fictitious made-up story. In the contrasting position of Alexander I, who believed in Western civilization’s superiority, and Nicholas I, who believed in the superiority of Russians, Leskov represents the confrontation of the ambivalent conceptions, such as ‘Westernism and Slavism’, ‘rationalism and sentimentalism’, ‘left and right’, and ‘reason and faith’. As a symbol of Russian people, <Lefty> has great implications. This study illuminates the Russian soul and mentality based on the study of neologisms and social dialects appearing in the work <Lefty> by Nikolai Leskov, the most peculiar russian writer in the history of Russian literature, who occupies an independent position in the history of Russian literature.

AB  - The idiom expressing the emotional state of Russian ‘anger’ reflects the linguistic universality and unique cultural idiom based on universal human activities such as physical activity, brain activity, and emotional activity.In Russian idioms related to ‘anger’, physiological metonymy and conceptual metaphor interact to form a semantic structure. This is not a linear projection of one-to-one correspondence, but a directional metaphor that organizes the entire system based on the internal system of the spatialization metaphor. Directional metaphor is to give spatial orientation to certain concepts such as up-down, inside-outside, front-back, center-periphery, etc. The oriented metaphor of 'I'm feeling up now/I'm feeling down' is based on our daily experiential and cultural experiences.The external systematicity of the spatialization metaphor determines the coherence between the spatialization metaphors. For example, the spatialization metaphor of positive emotions gives [UP] orientation to general happiness, such as [Good is above], [Health is above], [Control is above], etc. On the other hand, the spatial orientation of the negative emotional expression of 'anger' is more dynamic than that of static emotional states such as ‘happiness’ or ‘sadness’. As an example of the incoherent external systemicity of the spatial metaphor of 'anger rises/the temperature of the fluid in the container increases', the negative emotion of 'anger' is directed toward [UP]. The negative emotion of 'anger' is based on the ‘container metaphor’ and the ‘metaphor of heat’, and it dynamically shows the way in which the emotion of 'anger' is vividly expressed the moving path of the emotional state through the ‘image schema’ of the spatial-oriented metaphor. Regarding the emotion of 'anger', the universality of the cognitive system is the basis, but in fact, when it is connected with a specific cultural model, it is not easy to find a clear correspondence between the concepts. Further, the more culturally constructed and historically based emotions are more variegated within individual cultures or more elaborated as conceptual metaphors. Therefore, these cultural idioms reflect the unique linguistic and cultural characteristics and linguistic worldview such as the unique cognitive mechanism and way of thinking of language subjects in the long history, they can be meaningful data for the study of the conceptual universality and specificity of emotions.

AB  - All human beings are Homo narrans, whose lives are formed through stories in history and culture, and they are beings who create new stories while living. In the context of the narrative of concrete life. a person’s self and identity are formed and manifested. The foundation and source of shaping and embodying the Christian self and identity are the Bible. Today, the Bible should go beyond being read as a propositional statement or doctrine and read as a grand narrative, a coherent and unified story of God’s redeem- ing history. Distrust in meta-narrative, which has exerted absolute influence depending on science and reason, is a characteristic of the post-modern era, and distrust in meta-narrative has confused human direction, vision identity, self, and worldview. However, reading the Bible as a metanarrative provides Christians with a vision and worldview of the authentic, valid, and true world. Through the story of God’s faithfulness to the covenant and the history of redemption working in absolute sovereignty, one can discover calling and vocation in the circumstances and places of our re- spective lives, and shape a holistic identity and self by reinterpreting all experiences of life. This study examines establishing a biblical worldview by reading the Bible as a metanarrative in a post-modern society where identity and self are confused by doubting and distrusting meta-narrative, thereby forming a unified and consistent vision and calling for life.

AB  - This paper intensively explores and studies post-human that attempt to improve human physical biology through fusion of humans and technology through advanced science and technology in the era of the 4th industrial revolution. It also examines the socio-cultural, historical, technical, theological, and educational significance and implications of the post-human era, which newly defines human meaning and identity. In particular, it emphasizes on Maurice Merleau-Ponty philosophical arguments on whether the function and role of the senses, which are key elements of human beings, will lead to expansion or regression through the realization of posthuman. Beyond Descartes' dualistic thinking, Merleau-Ponty argued that our bodies are not separate from the world by claiming that perception is not passive, but active, that body perception understands the world, and that it is already a judgment. However, post-human beings aim to improve humans through technology, but paradoxically, the essential sense of humans can be replaced by machines and degenerated, which can lead to a crisis of human identity. This paper argues that in the posthuman era, beyond Descartes' modern human view of education centered on reason and intelligence, humans should be raised personally and participated in the kingdom of God through Christian education through sense and perception. In addition, through the philosophy of Merleau-Ponty, it comprehensively and criticizes the senses of the posthuman era, and proposes practical implications and applications of Christian education based on the biblical worldview.

AB  - This paper discusses the relationship and direction between artificial intelligence and current theological education, the sum of technologies that are undergoing radical development in the context of the 4th Industrial Revolution, and the COVID-19 Pandemic situation. Artificial intelligence is causing various radical changes in many ways, from the direction and method to the content and order of education, which is expected to have a significant influence on the theological educational institutions that train ministers and pastors. This paper deals with the discussion of the technical characteristics of artificial intelligence and the advantages and disadvantages of utilization, and at the same time, timely and meticulously researches and explores the relationship and direction of how to understand, critically accept, and apply it in the field of theological education. In particular, since the use of Artificial intelligence education and the direction of theological education is being conducted separately, this paper examines the relationship between the two and deals with the orientation and direction at the fundamental, philosophical, and educational aspects. This paper suggests that to preemptively present biblical education and Christian Worldview on the ethics, morality, identity, and value determination of artificial intelligence based on participation and communication as the direction of theological education in the era of artificial intelligence, the use of application of education according to the development and technology of artificial intelligence should be actively used in practice-oriented aspects through critical acceptance and that a mid-to-long-term concrete road-map for activating artificial intelligence-based education through practical infrastructure is needed. Finally, innovation in theological education through the use of artificial intelligence, educational method, educational evaluation, and professional and specific use are proposed as follow-up research tasks.

TI  - Different Observations of Sea Surface Wind Pattern Under Deep Convection by Sentinel-1 SARs, Scatterometers, and Radiometers in Collocation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Strong ocean surface mean and gust winds associated with deep convection can cause significant damages. It is hard to estimate surface convective wind gusts since they may occur suddenly and become intense quickly. This problem is even more challenging for tropical and subtropical regions over which convection is particularly intense while one has little in situ and remote sensing data. This article presents the collocation of several low-earth orbit (LEO) acquired data sources to observe and estimate ocean surface convective winds. The LEO devices include Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), ASCAT-A/B/C scatterometers, Windsat, and SMAP radiometers. This combination enables the short- and long-term observations of ocean wind pattern variabilities, for instance, a mesoscale squall line and a submesoscale wind cell. Sentinel-1 data can offer convective wind gust estimates at a high spatial resolution, whereas the other sources (SMAP, Windsat, and ASCAT-A/B/C) only estimate wind gusts at a scale larger than 0.25 degrees grid. Also, thanks to the LEO data collocation, one can observe the displacement direction of surface wind patterns and their intensity variabilities (15-25 m/s). Surface wind patterns move according to the horizontal displacement of deep convective clouds aloft observed by the Meteosat geostationary satellite. Likewise, the wind intensity variability and deep cloud brightness temperature evolve accordingly. Using simultaneous rainfall and wind speed measurements from Windsat, this study showed that the high-intensity radar backscattering from C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data is mainly induced by convective winds rather than precipitation.

AB  - The 137 files in this directory contain all South Pole Station data required to reproduce the results of LaBelle et al. [2021] "Cluster satellite and South Pole Station ground-based measurements of escaping and leaked Auroral Kilometric Radiation." (Cluster satellite data used in this paper are available at the Cluster Science Archive, URL www.cosmos.esa.int/web/csa.) There are two types of files: 1) The first type of file (10 files) has file name pattern YYYYMMDD-000001-SPS-.data.binary.gray.gz where YYYY is the year (2019 or 2020 for all of the data in this set), MM is the month, and DD is the day; and SPS stands for South Pole Station, the site where the data were recorded. Each file covers the time interval 0000-0600 UT on the date encoded in the file name. When unzipped, each file has this format: sets of 8193 lines, each corresponding to a power spectrum; the first line in each set of 8193 lines is time of that spectrum in format HH:MM:seconds (on the date encoded in the filename), and lines 2-8193 in each set of 8193 lines are the relative powers in decibels corresponding to evenly spaced frequency bins ranging from 0-5000 kHz. These power spectra were obtained from analysis of signals from a 10 square-meter antenna in the science sector at South Pole Station, sampled at 10 MHz and analyzed by taking 16384-point FFTs each 0.2 seconds with Hanning window applied. The time in this file is kept exact to within a fraction of a millisecond by using the South Pole server. 2) The second type of files (127 files) has file name pattern YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-HHMMSS-SP-USRP-CHX.gz where YYYY is the year (2018, 2019 or 2020 for all of the data in this set), MM is the month, and DD is the day; the first HHMMSS gives the time of the first spectrum in the file in hours minutes seconds; the second HHMMSS gives the time of the last spectrum in the file in hours minutes seconds; SP stands for the site where the data were recorded (SP for South Pole for all of the data in this set), and X indicates which antenna the data are from (1 or 2). When unzipped, each file covers a time interval of 1-4 minutes. The data consist of a string of two-byte unsigned integers, alternately I and Q samples of data from one of two 40 square meter loop antennas, indicated in the file name, oriented perpendicular to each other on a 30-foot mast in the science sector at South Pole Station. The sample rate is 2 MHz and the center frequency is 1 MHz, so the data correspond to the bandwidth 0-2 MHz. The timing of the samples is estimated by dead reckoning through the file, using the start and end times encoded in the file name. The timing can drift by up to 1-2 seconds within the file; exact timing is obtained by correlating these data with the data in the other type of file, described above, which has exact timing. The IQ data in these files are calibrated. Taking a 2048 Fourier transform of the data yields a power spectrum which, when converted to decibels (10 log Power), 0 dB corresponds to an rms signal level of 65 mV/m.

TI  - Susceptibility to wildfire in a conservation unit located in the transition region of Cerrado and Atlantic Forest Biomes, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Created in 2014, the Serra da Gandarela National Park (SGNP), is repeatedly affected by wildfires. This Conservation Unit is located in the Iron Quadrangle (MG), in a transition zone between the Cerrado and the Atlantic Forest biomes, and is characterized by a complex mosaic of phytophysiognomies. The aim of this investigation was to compare the performance of two risk mapping models for forest fire in the SGNP and its surroundings, based on two different approaches, being one by multicriteria analysis, AHP method and the other a simple probability method, called Hot Spot History, which provided information on the areas of highest and lowest risk and their environmental and human characteristics. Spatial data from remote sensing and GIS were used to simulate, in sequence, the fire ignition, the fire spread and, finally, the risk of wildfire. The validation of the risk models was performed by the Kappa coefficient (K). The results showed that the model based on the History of Hot Points obtained greater accuracy (0.61) than the model generated by the AHP method (0.54). The Brazilian Savanna, Rupestrian Fields and Field coverings were the most susceptible to wildfire, as they are formed by herbaceous vegetations and are located very close to urban agglomerations and roads. The slopes oriented to the North and West were important for the prediction of wildfires slope and, on the other hand, the slope of the terrain was not important to discretize the areas of greater and lesser fragility to the referred ecological disturbance.

AB  - The shoreline is an important geographical zone, and knowledge of its accurate location can be crucial for coastal management and mapping. The ever-increasing number of aerial and satellite sensors is leading to research related to the development of new methods for the automatic extraction of the shoreline. Currently, there is a lot of research in this area with different research methodologies. In this paper, an analysis of shoreline extraction methods was carried out. Based on the analysis undertaken, current research processes in this field can be verified. This enabled the further evaluation of the research methodologies studied, including the identification of basic assessment elements for shoreline extraction accuracy. Practical aspects of this work include the ability to establish the correct methods to assess the accuracy of extracted shorelines for both research and production processes related to data extracted from remotely sensed images.

AB  - A deep energy transformation will be tried out across the globe in the next decades in order to detect potential green and renewable sources able to replace fossil fuels. Among the various alternatives, photovoltaic technology, recognized as sustainable, clean, and environmentally friendly essence, is considered one of the most relevant solutions. To date, the Remotely Piloted Aircraft System has been largely used to inspect solar parks albeit the treatment of very high-resolution satellite images through object-based models may be a valid option. In this work, the potentialities of two segmentation approaches (multi-resolution and mean-shift algorithms, implemented in eCognition Developer and Orfeo Toolbox software, respectively) in extracting photovoltaic panels from Sentinel-2 time series were explored and compared. Such techniques were tested in Montalto di Castro in Viterbo (Italy). Multi-resolution algorithm was applied by varying scale and shape parameters between 20 and 100 and 0.1 and 0.5, respectively. Conversely, the mean-shift approach was used by considering the default values of spatial radius and range radius. Their segmentation outcomes were compared on the base of i) minimum Euclidean Distance 2 (ED2), calculated in AssesSeg environment, ii) segmentation polygons statistics and areas value, and, lastly, iii) their performance in terms of processing time, versatility, ability of handling heavy data, and cost. ECognition Developer demonstrated a better performance in segmenting Sentinel 2-images for extracting PV systems in terms of segmentation parameters management and outcomes interpretation ability.

AB  - The Energy Union Framework Strategy is pushing the entire world to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy to tackle climate changes and mitigate their effects. Among the clean energy alternatives, the sun is recognized as the most abundant and inexhaustible source and the energy production can be carried out through photovoltaic panels. Nevertheless, such a solar park requires the use of large land areas, stolen, in such a way, from food production, which demand has strongly increased in the last few years due to the growing world population. Thus, agrophotovoltaic systems, also known as agrivoltaic structures, are under way to meet the above-mentioned needs synergistically. This has led to the necessity of monitoring solar panels amount and allocation. Their detection is challenging since, albeit their spectral signature is totally different from that one emitted from other land covers, their occurrence received little attention in the field of remote sensing. Thus, in this study, a proper rule-based model for distinguishing photovoltaic panels developed on eCognition environment was proposed. Such a model is based on the combination of Object-Based Image Analysis and machine learning algorithm. Indeed, after optimizing segmentation parameters and analyzing morphological features of the panels, the Random Forest classification algorithm was implemented. Lastly, classification accuracy was evaluated. The experimentation was conducted on the study area of Viterbo (Lazio Region, Italy) by adopting open medium-resolution satellite data (Sentinel 2). This research showed promising results in classifying targets for almost all months of the time series, except for the months of October and November where there is a lowering of the accuracy value due to the variability of spectral signatures.

AB  - The members of the ancient Koreans searched for an acceptable explanation for the collapse of their dynasties, which had such long history. They resolved the need to explain the destruction of Baekje and Goguryeo, which ended in the middle of the 7th century, with reincarnation and revenge of ghosts, symbols of new and full moons, and sensitive intellectuals leaving their country. Many of the factors mobilized to explain the fall of the two dynasties were based on the universal way of thinking of the ancients. Based on these discussions, this article explores the structure and perception of the discourse on the fall of Silla that appears in the historical information of Samguk-sagi and Kim Bu-sik's historical commentaries.Although Silla shared historical experience with the preceding two countries for a long time, the core logic of the discourse on the fall differed from them in two ways. One is a much more mature Confucian worldview during three hundred years until to the first half of the 10th century, when Silla disappeared. Another is the fact that the Silla royal family themselves surrendered to Goryeo, rather than defeating in a physical struggle. Therefore, in the discourse on the fall of Silla, the existence of a Confucian ideology and the justification of surrender were emphasized instead of the ancient way of thinking that was prominent in the 7th century. However, the fact that ancient thought lost its persuasive power is ironically judged to be the beginning of the crisis of Silla dynasty.

TI  - Combining LiDAR Metrics and Sentinel-2 Imagery to Estimate Basal Area and Wood Volume in Complex Forest Environment via Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play a fundamental role in natural balances and climate mechanisms through their contribution to global carbon storage. Their sustainable management and conservation is crucial in the current context of global warming and biodiversity conservation. To tackle such challenges, earth observation data have been identified as a valuable source of information. While earth observation data constitute an unprecedented opportunity to monitor forest ecosystems, its effective exploitation still poses serious challenges since multimodal information needs to be combined to describe complex natural phenomena. To deal with this particular issue in the context of structure and biophysical variables estimation for forest characterization, we propose a new deep learning-based fusion strategy to combine together high density three-dimensional (3-D) point clouds acquired by airborne laser scanning with high-resolution optical imagery. In order to manage and fully exploit the available multimodal information, we implement a two-branch late fusion deep learning architecture taking advantage of the specificity of each modality. On the one hand, a 2-D CNN branch is devoted to the analysis of Sentinel-2 time series data, and on the other hand, a multilayer perceptron branch is dedicated to the processing of LiDAR-derived information. The performance of our framework is evaluated on two forest variables of interest: total volume and basal area at stand level. The obtained results underline that the availability of multimodal remote sensing data is not a direct synonym of performance improvements but, the way in which they are combined together is of paramount importance.

AB  - Space-based radar has the characteristics of all-weather operation, and can accurately provide important data for understanding global environmental changes. On the other hand, with the rapid development of radio technology, space-based radar is facing more and more interference, such as terrestrial interference and inter-satellite interference, which greatly distort the measurements and degrade the image quality. In this paper, a novel interference mitigation method based on multi-temporal coupling analysis is proposed. The temporal-spatial coupling between time-series images could be modeled as low rank, while the interference follows the sparsity constraints due to the time-varying property. The interference extraction and mitigation on remote sensing images is realized by optimization by joint low-rank and sparsity regularization. The experimental results of Sentinel-1A data show that the method can achieve the separation of interference and restore clear remote sensing images with little distortion.

TI  - Analysis of reservoir environment evolution from 2000 to 2020: A case study in the Guanting Reservoir, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in different areas of the reservoir itself constitute the overall performance of the reservoir. This study obtains hydrological information based on continuous satellite images, and then makes zoning analysis of the reservoir to determine the best condition of good and stable operation of the reservoir. Based on a series of Landsat images, taking the Guanting Reservoir in Beijing, China as an example, this study quantitatively analyzed the distribution and changes in the laws of water volume and water surface temperature of the Guanting Reservoir from 2000 to 2020. Additionally, based on stability, the natural zoning of the reservoir area is carried out. The water surface range was obtained using the water index method. The water surface temperature was obtained by the radiative transfer equation method, which was analyzed in combination with the Reservoir Area Dynamic Degree (RADD) and Reservoir Shoreline Development Index (RSDI). In the last 21 years, the trend of water surface temperature of the Guanting Reservoir during different seasons has reversed. The year 2013 was a turning point, prior to which, the Guanting Reservoir experienced an obvious decline period (area reduction rate of 68.38%), followed by a rapid recovery period (area expansion rate reached 200.68%). When the reservoir water volume is relatively stable and RSDI is large, it is the best operation condition. According to the analysis of RSDI and average water surface temperature for many years, the stability of the reservoir is obtained for zoning. The unstable area of the reservoir or the general stable area, the water surface coverage and the water surface temperature change greatly, which is the area where the environment is most easily changed. The distribution of aquatic plants is consistent with the relatively unstable area of the reservoir. This study provides a valuable method for the rational management of reservoir submerged area. It also provides a basis for the rational planning of the reservoir area.

AB  - The intima-media complex of the common carotid artery is considered the sentinel of a silent killer disease called atherosclerosis. Morphological biomarkers such as the intima-media thickness are already exploitable, but dynamic biomarkers, which reflect tissue deformation over the cardiac cycle, remain to be validated. Recent motion estimation methods seek to quantify compression, shear, and elongation coefficients, but their clinical applicability has not yet been well defined, and their actual accuracy is difficult to assess due to the absence of ground truth. This lack of reference also is the main limitation to explore fully supervised deep learning methods that have shown great potential in other applications. With this in mind, we propose a simulation pipeline to produce realistic in silico sequences, by combining a physics-based simulator with a post-processing based on a generative adversarial network.

AB  - The quantity of remote sensing pictures being captured is rising dramatically due to advancements in earth observation technology, bringing remote sensing in a long and distinct period of history of big data. Discovering how to successfully harvest this enormous intensity of remote sensing data will be a new challenge. With deep learning, remote sensing data analysis may take on a narrative tone. CNNs are a Deep Learning model capable of directly extracting features from large volumes of picture data and are effective at exploiting realistic imagery data characteristics. With regards to computer vision, CNNs have shown to be highly successful. CNNs are a powerful tool. There have been several studies employing CNNs for remote sensing picture classification in the last few years, and these studies show that CNNs can produce fast and accurate results. It is the goal of this study to offer an overview of the most current and advanced applications of deep learning based on CNNs for remote sensing picture enhancement. To begin, the concepts and features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) will be briefly reviewed in this review. There are new innovations and structural enhancements to neural network models that make them more suited for RS picture enhancement, as well as data for remote sensing image categorization and augmentation approaches that may be obtained easily and quickly.. As a result of the survey, we expect remote sensing scientists will be better equipped to tackle categorization challenges utilizing cutting-edge deep learning algorithms and methodologies. To increase the number of training examples with a considerable reduction in model over-fitting, data augmentation is a well-known approach used in most ML & AI applications.

TI  - Estimation of the subsidence around the trace of the San Ramon Chile fault, using the SBAS DInSAR technique through TerraSAR-X images
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Chile is one of the countries with the highest seismicity in the world and is affected by three types of seismogenic sources; interplate, intraplate and superficial or cortical intraplate. In this context, in the eastern sector of the city of Santiago, capital of Chile, the Falla San Remit' (FSR) is located. It is a cortical seismogenic source, which threatens its habitants and the various economic activities that are located in that sector, geological hazards such as earthquakes and mass removals. In relation to the above, this study aims to identify and establish the subsidence areas in a longitudinal strip of the Santiago mountain front and its impact on the neighboring communes to the FSR trace during the years 2011 to 2017. To do this, The DInSAR technique was used with the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) algorithm through a time series of images from the TerraSAR-X (TSX) satellite. The results show subsidence zones, with average displacements ranging from -13.11 mm to +9.89 mm, with an average annual speed rate of -2.19 to +1.65 mm/year.

TI  - Alternative Physical Method for Retrieving Land Surface Temperatures from Hyperspectral Thermal Infrared Data: Application to IASI Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new two-step physical method was developed to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI) observations. This method relinearized the radiative transfer equation (RTE) by the tangents around the initial estimates of the LST, land surface emissivity (LSE), atmospheric equivalent temperature, and water vapor content . The Tikhonov regularization method and discrepancy principle (DP) iteration algorithm were employed to stabilize the ill-posed problem and obtain the final maximum likelihood solution of the LST with updating the initial estimation of LST, LSE, A new channel selection scheme was proposed for this physical method to obtain an accurate LST estimation. This physical-based algorithm was tested on both simulated and real data obtained from the IASI. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the simulated LST is 1 K based on an initial LST estimate with an RMSE of 2 K (1.9 K). The sensitivity analysis shows that the LST retrieval accuracy is 1 K based on an LST with a random error of 3 K, constant initial LSE (0.97), 10error, and 40error. Compared with the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer onboard Metop (AVHRR/Metop) LST product, the physical method achieves the LST retrieval accuracy of 1.5 and 1 K for real daytime and nighttime IASI data obtained in the study area. Based on the new method, the LST can be retrieved with an accuracy similar to that of the AVHRR/Metop LST product.

TI  - Dreissena polymorpha metabolome
T2  - Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS-KNAW)
M3  - Data study
AB  - The freshwater zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, is extensively used as a sentinel species for biosurvey of environmental contaminants in freshwater ecosystems and for ecotoxicological studies. However, little is still known about the input of its metabolome and particularly concerning a potential molecular sexual dimorphism observable in the different tissues of this organism. In an ecotoxicological point of view, inter-sex and inter-organ differences in the metabolome composition might induce bias and influence the robustness of data analysis or interpretation, especially in the case males and females would be used indifferently for specific biomarker measurements. Recent metabolomic approaches are more and more often used to identify new potent biomarkers. They can also be useful to develop experimental protocols and to specify the type of sample to focus on, in terms of sex and tissues. The purpose of this study is to use a non-target metabolomic approach to assess if the molecular fingerprints of various tissues of D. polymorpha may reveal tissue-specific molecular sexual dimorphism. Our results highlight the critical need of considering inter-sex differences in the metabolome of D. polymorpha, particularly if studies are focused on the observation of environmental effects on the molecular regulation in genital or digestive glands.

TI  - OSGeo/grass: GRASS GIS 8.0.0
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Overview of changes After more than 3 year of development the first stable release GRASS GIS 8.0.0 is available. Efforts have concentrated on making the user experience even better, providing many new useful additional functionalities to modules and further improving the graphical user interface. Breaking news: new graphical user interface with entirely rewritten startup sequence! This re-establishes user experience compatibility with QGIS and other connected software packages. The GRASS GIS 8.0.0 release provides more than 1,300 fixes and improvements with respect to the release 7.8.6. With the introduction of the semantic label raster metadata class, the temporal database was modified to version 3. Hence, to be able to read and process GRASS 7.x space-time datasets, users will be prompted to run t.upgrade. If users want to read newly created space-time datasets back in GRASS 7.x, they can run t.downgrade. Launching the software The user experience of the graphical user interface has been completely rewritten: no more clumsy selection screens - just enter the menu system directly! And on command line, GRASS GIS now starts versionless, i.e. as grass.

TI  - OSGeo/grass: GRASS GIS 8.0.0RC2
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - Overview of changes After more than 3 year of development the first stable release GRASS GIS 8.0.0 is available. Efforts have concentrated on making the user experience even better, providing many new useful additional functionalities to modules and further improving the graphical user interface. Breaking news: new graphical user interface with entirely rewritten startup sequence! This re-establishes user experience compatibility with QGIS and other connected software packages. The GRASS GIS 8.0.0 release provides more than 1,300 fixes and improvements with respect to the release 7.8.6. With the introduction of the semantic label raster metadata class, the temporal database was modified to version 3. Hence, to be able to read and process GRASS 7.x space-time datasets, users will be prompted to run t.upgrade. If users want to read newly created space-time datasets back in GRASS 7.x, they can run t.downgrade.

TI  - NIETZSCHE'S CHRISTIANITY
T2  - VERBO DE MINAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper intends to show how Nietzsche criticizes the devaluation of life. As a worldview derived from Judaism and Platonism that provides a weak form of life, Christianity becomes the target of Nietzsche's missives. It is true that the philosopher is a voracious critic of this religious tradition. He does not spare words to show this. However, he does so in a peculiar way and based on a criterion: to what extent does a system favor or weaken life? As we hope to show, this criterion runs through all his criticisms of Christianity, from its notion of God to the construction of its morality, whose evaluative principle despises the body, the earth, and, in effect, weakens life. After all, if the critique of Christianity finds its basis in the negation of life, Nietzsche is not purely and simply a demolisher of religion itself.

TI  - Remote Sensing Detection of Algal Blooms in a Lake Impacted by Petroleum Hydrocarbons
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to combine all available information on the state of Lake Pertusillo (Basilicata, Italy), both in the field and published, which included Sentinel-2A satellite data, to understand algal blooms in a lacustrine environment impacted by petroleum hydrocarbons. Sentinel-2A data was retrospectively used to monitor the state of the lake, which is located near the largest land-based oil extraction plant in Europe, with particular attention to chlorophyll a during algal blooms and petroleum hydrocarbons. In winter 2017, a massive dinoflagellate bloom (10.4 x 10(6) cell/L) of Peridinium umbonatum and a simultaneous presence of hydrocarbons were observed at the lake surface. Furthermore, a recent study using metagenomic analyses carried out three months later identified a hydrocarbonoclastic microbial community specialized in the degradation aromatic and nitroaromatic hydrocarbons. In this study, Sentinel-2A imagery was able to detect the presence of chlorophyll a in the waters, while successfully distinguishing the signal from that of hydrocarbons. Remotely sensed results confirmed surface reference measurements of lacustrine phytoplankton, chlorophyll a, and the presence of hydrocarbons during algal blooms, thereby explaining the presence of the hydrocarbonoclastic microbial community found in the lake three months after the oil spill event. The combination of emerging methodologies such as satellite systems and metagenomics represent an important support methodology for describing complex contaminations in diverse ecosystems.

TI  - Multisource Heterogeneous Transfer Learning via Feature Augmentation for Ship Classification in SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving ship classification performance in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery by the methods based on transfer learning (TL) is a newly emerging research topic and has great potential. The existing studies merely address the problem of TL from a single source domain (SD) [automatic identification system (AIS) or optical remote sensing (ORS)] to the target domain (TD) (SAR) based on the homogeneous TL (HoTL), which requires all domains to be represented by homogeneous features with the same dimensions. Our work takes a step forward and attempts to address a more meaningful and challenging problem that transfers knowledge from multiple SDs for the purpose of exploring and exploiting complementarity cross SDs to assist ship classification in the TD. To this end, our study develops a multisource heterogeneous transfer learning (MS-HeTL) method that liberates the restriction of utilizing the exact same features for all domains, allows each domain represented by a more appropriate feature, and, thus, improves the ship classification performance even further. Specifically, we first propose multisource heterogeneous feature augmentation (MS-HFA) to effectively solve the challenges brought by feature heterogeneity and fully exploit the complementarity cross domains. Then, a support vector machine (SVM) classification framework is specific-designed to be incorporated with the augmented feature representations in the common space to conduct knowledge transfer cross domains. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, HR-SAR and FUSAR, show that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and demonstrates its effectiveness and advantages. All datasets and source codes are available at https://github.com/BUCT-RS-ML/MS-HeTL-via-MS-HFA.

TI  - THE SOCIAL NATURE OF STAKEHOLDER UTILITY
T2  - ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - For better or for worse, one stakeholder's utility derives in part from their perceptions of how other stakeholders are being treated by the business. Yet, to date, the stakeholder literature has not explained well what stakeholders are actually looking for in a business's treatment of other stakeholders. We allow for and help explain an emerging view in the literature whereby stakeholders might be looking out for each other's interests, but we round out that view by also allowing for and explaining a different kind of possibility, whereby stakeholders disapprove of the favorable treatment of others or approve of their unfavorable treatment. Our model details how the other stakeholder serves three different roles with respect to the focal stakeholder's utility: (a) as a symbolic representation of the values the business prioritizes-especially compared to the focal stakeholder's own worldview, (b) as a referent for interpersonal equity comparisons, and (c) as either a perceived competitor for or facilitator of resources. We describe these three roles and then show how they interrelate in a process model. In doing so, we provide a more detailed and complete understanding of stakeholder utility than currently exists in the literature.

TI  - Serological and Molecular Study of the Duffy Blood Group among Malarial Endemic Region Residents in Brazil
T2  - REVISTA DA SOCIEDADE BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The atypical chemokine receptor 1 (ACKR1) gene encodes the Duffy blood group antigens in two allelic forms: FY*A (FY*01) and FY*B (FY*02), which define the Fy(a+b-), Fy(a-b+), and Fy(a+b+) phenotypes. FY*BES (FY*02N.01) is a single T to C substitution at nucleotide -67 that prevents the FY*B from being expressed in red blood cells (RBCs).Methods: We evaluated 250 residents from a Brazilian malarial endemic region (RsMR). All individuals were phenotyped for Fya and Fyb antigens and genotyped for FY*A, FY*B, FY*B-SE, and FY*B-weak alleles.Results: Among the 250 individuals, 209 (83.6%) reported previous malaria infection, and 41 (16.4%) did not. The Fy(a+b+) phenotype was present in 97/250 (38.8%), while the Fy(a-b-) was present in 7/250 (2.8%). The FY*A/FY*B was found in 130/250 (52%) and the FY*A/FY*A in 45/250 (18%). The c.1-67>TC was present, in homozygosity, in 11/250 (4.4%). Among 34 individuals with the Fy(a+b-) and FYA*/FYB* mutations, 4/34 (11.8%) had homozygosity for the c.1-67T>C. One individual presented the Fy(a+b-), FY*A/FY*B, and c.1-67T>C in homozygosis, whereas the other presented the Fy(a+b-), FY*A/FY*A, and c.1-67T>C in heterozygosis.Conclusions: We reported a low prevalence of the Fy(a-b-) in persons who had previously been infected with Plasmodium vivax (67.5%). We observed that 102/141 (72.3%) individuals expressing the Fyb antigen had a P. vivax infection, indicating the importance of the Fyb antigen, silenced by a c.1-67T>C mutation in homozygosis, in preventing the P. vivax infection. We showed that the c.1-67T>C mutation in the FY*A did not silence the FY*A expression on RBCs.

TI  - Intraoperative Molecular Analysis of Total Tumor Load in Sentinel Lymph Node: A Predictor of Axillary Status in Early Breast Cancer.
T2  - Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) remains the standard of care in breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph node (SLN). However, approximately 40-60% of patients with positive SLNs have not developed to non-SLN metastasis and ALND seems to be an overtreatment. The purpose of this study was to analyze predictors and define a specific cut-off of total tumor load (TTL) of CK19 that can be used as a predictive factor of non-SLN metastasis in early breast cancer patients.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The records of 238 patients with cT1-3N0 breast cancer who had an intraoperative SLN evaluation performed through One-Step nucleic acid (OSNA) assay at Songklanagarind Hospital between 1 January 2015 and 31 December 2019 were examined. Univariate and Multivariate analysis was used to identify clinicopathologic features in SLN-positive patients that predict metastasis to non-SLNs. Finally, receiver operative characteristics (ROC) curves were used to choose an optimal TTL cut-off value.RESULTS: Of a total of 110 patients who had a positive SLN, only 48 (43.64%) were found to have positive nodes in non-SLN. Multivariate analysis revealed that lymphovascular invasion, type of SLN metastasis and SLN TTL (copies/muL) were independent predictors of positive non-SLNs. TTL cut-off value was 19,000 copies/muL, with an AUC of 0.838 with 72.7% sensitivity and 84.7% specificity to predict non-SLN metastasis.CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of positive non-SLNs in patients who showed a positive SLN correlates with lymphovascular invasion, type of SLN metastasis and SLN TTL (copies/muL). Our result revealed that the patients with a SLN TTL ≥19,000 copies/l continue to attract the recommendation to proceed with ALND. This cut-off value can then help clinicians to assess which patients would benefit from ALND.

TI  - Analysis of Content and Distribution of Chlorophyll-a on the Sea Surface through Data from Aqua/MODIS Satellite
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton are tiny creatures floating on water mass. Inside their cells, there is the pigment chlorophyll- a, a kind of substance used in photosynthesis. As a result, it is essential for the ecosystem of water sources because it is considered as the primary producer. This research aims to analyze the content and distribution of chlorophyll-a on the sea surface. It uses data from the Aqua/MODIS Satellite in a case study of the upper Gulf of Thailand in 2020. The SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) program analyzed the obtained data. The results revealed that the content and distribution of chlorophyll- a on the sea surface in the area of the upper Gulf of Thailand were based on seasons and the influence of monsoons. It was found that the content of chlorophyll-a was highest in the southwest monsoon period (May-October) and lowest in the northeast monsoon period (November-April). The content of chlorophyll-a was highest in October with a mean of 3.148 mg/m(3), followed by November, and it was lowest in February with a mean of 1.514 mg/m(3). Moreover, it was also found that, if the sea surface temperature was higher than 30 degrees C, phytoplankton exhibited proper growth and propagation. As a result, the content and distribution of chlorophyll-a were consistent with seasonal changes and weather variability.

TI  - Monitoring the 11 August 2017 storm in central Poland with satellite data and products
T2  - METEOROLOGY HYDROLOGY AND WATER MANAGEMENT-RESEARCH AND OPERATIONAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the evolution of the mesoscale convection system as seen on satellite images during all stages: pre-convection, initiation, and maturity. The evolution of any atmospheric phenomenon can be monitored effectively only when the data available have adequate temporal and spatial resolution. In case of convective storms the resolution should be minutes and kilometers. Therefore, data from the METEOSAT geostationary satellite, with 5-minute and 15-minute intervals were used operationally to monitor the storm of 11 August 2017; this was a most destructive storms, concentrated in several districts of the Pomeranian, Greater Poland, and Kuyavian-Pomeranian voivodeships. Analysis demonstrated that some alarming features, like cold rings or cold U/V shapes, can be visible on the single channel satellite images, without even referring to specific convective products. However, the nowcasting of the convective phenomena requires careful analysis of several dedicated products, including stability indices and water vapor content in the troposphere. It has been shown that with comprehensive analysis of the information provided by the different satellite images and satellite derived products, it is possible to draw conclusions about the severity of the observed storms as well as the probability of the occurrence of the extreme weather at the ground.

TI  - Greater loss and fragmentation of savannas than forests over the last three decades in Yunnan Province, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Yunnan Province, southwest China, has a monsoonal climate suitable for a mix of fire-driven savannas and fire-averse forests as alternate stable states, and has vast areas with savanna physiognomy. Presently, savannas are only formally recognised in the dry valleys of the region, and a no-fire policy has been enforced nationwide since the 1980s. Misidentification of savannas as forests may have contributed to their low protection level and fire-suppression may be contributing to vegetation change towards forest states through woody encroachment. Here, we present an analysis of vegetation and land-use change in Yunnan for years 1986, 1996, 2006, and 2016 by classifying Landsat imagery using a hybrid of unsupervised and supervised classification. We assessed how much savanna area had changed over the 3 decades (area loss, fragmentation), and of this how much was due to direct human intervention versus vegetation transition. We also assessed how climate (mean annual temperature, aridity), landscape accessibility (slope, distance to roads), and fire had altered transition rates. Our classification yielded accuracy values of 77.89%, 82.16%, 94.93%, and 86.84% for our four maps, respectively. In 1986, savannas had the greatest area of any vegetation type in Yunnan at 40.30%, whereas forest cover was 30.78%. Savanna coverage declined across the decades mainly due to a drop in open parkland savannas, while forest cover remained stable. Savannas experienced greater fragmentation than forests. Savannas suffered direct loss of coverage to human uses and to woody encroachment. Savannas in more humid environments switched to denser vegetation at a higher rate. Fire slowed the rate of conversion away from savanna states and promoted conversion towards them. We identified remaining savannas in Yunnan that can be considered when drafting future protected areas. Our results can inform more inclusive policy-making that considers Yunnan's forests and savannas as distinct vegetation types with different management needs.

AB  - The pre-Contact Maya peoples build roads (Sacbeob) to facilitate movement between and within cities and surroundings. Given the dense forest cover in the Lowland Maya region now known as Yucatan, ground surveys of sacbeob are time-consuming and challenging to perform. Remote sensing can be a good alternative as it offers the advantages of extensive regional coverage, zero disturbances to cultural resources, and an opportunity to acquire data in less accessible areas on a cost-effective basis. LiDAR technology is highly valuable to detect man-made structures, but this technology is costly and is time-consuming to acquire data over a large area. Satellite imagery presents an alternative for mapping large areas. Previous studies documented linear features that could represent sections of sacbeob between Calakmul and El Mirador using Landsat-5 TM green, red, and near-infrared images (Folan et al. 1995). This study used Landsat-7 and Landsat-8 optical images having more bands and radar imagery (Sentinel-1 C-VH&VV, and Alos-1 PalSAR L-HH&HV) to connect sacbeob mapped by Folan et al. (1995) between three ancient Maya cities (Calakmul, El Mirador, and Uxul). Our results suggest that radar images with the capacity to penetrate dense forest cover can contribute to the identification and documentation of ancient road systems. Such a study provides an ideal starting point for targeted ground verification.

T2  - POLARIZATION: MEASUREMENT, ANALYSIS, AND REMOTE SENSING XV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Polarization - Measurement, Analysis, and Remote Sensing XV
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Polarization imaging has been used extensively in applications related to atmospheric monitoring, remote sensing, and quality control. However, it has been used less extensively in agricultural applications, where color sensing - either red, green, and blue (RGB) imaging, multispectral, and/or hyperspectral cameras are more common. In this paper, we discuss our preliminary results related to the use of polarization imaging to quantify defoliation in peanut plants in response to leaf spot disease. A key metric for breeding resistant peanut varieties involves identifying the point at which defoliation occurs. Since defoliation is a geometrical property of the plant canopy, we investigated whether polarization imaging can provide a better-automated score when compared to conventional visual scoring. Initial results are presented, as well as a discussion of our drone-based platform and our experimental trials conducted during the 2021 North Carolina growing season.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The currently available tools and services as open and free cloud resources to process big satellite data opened up a new frontier of possibilities and applications including archeological research. These new research opportunities also pose several challenges to be faced, as, for example, the data processing and interpretation. This letter is about the assessment of different methods and data sources to support a visual interpretation of EO imagery. Multitemporal Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data sets have been processed to assess their capability in the detection of buried archeological remains related to some lost sections of the ancient Via Appia road (herein selected as case study). The very subtle and nonpermanent features linked to buried archeological remains can be captured using multitemporal (intra- and inter-year) satellite acquisitions, but this requires strong hardware infrastructures or cloud facilities, today also available as open and free tools as Google Earth Engine (GEE). In this study, a total of 2948 Sentinel 1 and 743 Sentinel 2 images were selected (from February 2017 to August 2020) and processed using GEE to enhance and unveil archeological features. Outputs obtained from both Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 have been successfully compared with in situ analysis and high-resolution Google Earth images.

TI  - Land Cover Classification of Complex Agroecosystems in the Non-Protected Highlands of the Galapagos Islands
T2  - UNC Dataverse
M3  - Data study
AB  - The humid highlands of the Galapagos are the islands most biologically productive regions and a key habitat for endemic animal and plant species. These areas are crucial for the regions food security and for the control of invasive plants, but little is known about the spatial distribution of its land cover. We generated a baseline high-resolution land cover map of the agricultural zones and their surrounding protected areas. We combined the high spatial resolution of PlanetScope images with the high spectral resolution of Sentinel-2 images in an object-based classification using a RandomForest algorithm. We used images collected with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) to verify and validate our classified map. Despite the astounding diversity and heterogeneity of the highland landscape, our classification yielded useful results (overall Kappa: 0.7, R2: 0.69) and revealed that across all four inhabited islands, invasive plants cover the largest fraction (28.5%) of the agricultural area, followed by pastures (22.3%), native vegetation (18.6%), food crops (18.3%), and mixed forest and pioneer plants (11.6%). Our results are consistent with historical trajectories of colonization and abandonment of the highlands. The produced dataset is designed to suit the needs of practitioners of both conservation and agriculture and aims to foster collaboration between the two areas.

T2  - Journal of Biodiversity Conservation and Bioresource Management
M3  - Article
AB  - The change of vegetation in Khagrachhari Sadar Upazila during 1991 to 2021 was investigated taking data in 10 years intervals. Satellite images of Landsat 4-5 TM (30 October 1991, 19 March 2001 and 11 February 2011) and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (6 February 2021) from USGS Earth Explorer have been extracted. Image classification, analyzing and visualizing the data was accomplished by ArcGIS 10.7.1 software and Microsoft excel. In 1991, vegetation coverage (Forest and agriculture) and non-vegetated area (water body, bare land) were 161.15 km2 (61.19%) and 99.17 km2 (38.09%), respectively. After 10 years (in 2001) vegetation coverage slightly increased (by 0.83%) resulting a little decrease in non -vegetated area. The area became 184.63 km2 (62.60%) and 97.28 km2 (37.40%), respectively for vegetated and non-vegetated coverage. However, since 2011 a decreasing trend for vegetation coverage was observed, 161.81 km2 (62.2%) in 2011 which decreased to 157.97 km2 (60.72%) in 2021. Consequently non-vegetated area increased from 98.34 km2 (37.80%) to 102.18 km2 (39.28%) in this period. The overall loss of 3.18 km2 of vegetation over the last 30 years was mainly due to rapid growth of population and encroachment of hilly area for settlement. This loss of vegetation coverage is affecting the ecological balance of the hilly areas of Bangladesh.

AB  - In this paper, we assess the estimation of bio-physical land parameters from time-series of interferometric SAR coherence supported by a physical model. The random-motion-over-ground model (RMoG) is revisited to partially capture the short- and long-term temporal variability of the coherence caused by motion of the scatterers and changes in their dielectric properties. The recently-published global Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence dataset is used to compare model predictions with observations and evaluate the need for additional model assumptions or ancillary data sets. Spaceborne lidar data acquired by GEDI are also considered to further constrain the parameter estimation. This work is particularly relevant to upcoming SAR missions such as NISAR and ROSE-L that will generate global and dense time-series of interferometric temporal coherence at L-band.

AB  - In the past few years, medium and high-resolution data became freely available for downloading. It provides great opportunity for researchers not to select between solving the task with high-resolution data on small territory or on global scale, but with low-resolution satellite images. Due to high spectral and spatial resolution of the data, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 are very popular sources of information. Nevertheless, in practice if we would like to receive final product in 10 m resolution we should use bands with 10 m resolution. Sentinel-2 has four such bands, but also has other bands, especially red-edge 20 m resolution bands that are useful for vegetation analysis and often are omitted due to lower resolution. Thus, in this study we propose methodology for enhancing resolution (super-resolution) of the existing low-resolution images to higher resolution images. The main idea is to use advanced methods of deep learning Generative Adversarial Networks ( GAN) and train it to increase the resolution for the satellite images. Experimental results for the Sentinel-2 data showed that this approach is efficient and could be used for creating high resolution products.

T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - A semantic analysis of inscriptions on T-shirts (slogans) as elements of everyday discourse is provided in the article. Attention is paid to slogans that convey meanings significant in youth communication. The scientific novelty of the presented work lies in the fact that for the first time the features of slogans placed on clothes are revealed, their content, pragmatic functions and lexical-semantic features, as well as the correlation of slogans with the linguistic personality of the owner of a T-shirt with an inscription are considered. The author revealed that the basic pragmatic !Unctions of slogans are self-presentation, appeal and shocking. Each of these functions has a number of sub-functions. Self-presentation is the leading pragmatic !Unction. It has been proved that slogans are important components of the modern socio-cultural environment, integral elements of the communication process, verbal markers of the peculiarities of a linguistic personality. The key features of the linguistic personality of a young man who implements communication through a slogan on clothes are openness to social contacts, demonstration of personal qualities, attitude towards others and towards society as a whole, social activity, dedication, unconventional worldview, innovative thinking.

AB  - Unsupervised and semi-supervised learning computer vision techniques have greatly improved in recent years on natural imagery. However, the efficacy of such methods on remote sensing data has not yet been extensively studied. A series of comparative experiments herein using SimCLR and equivalent ResNets on the DOTA and FAIR1M remote sensing datasets explores this topic. Results indicate that SimCLR outperforms its equivalent traditionally supervised ResNet on these data at 1% or 10% supervision - or where approximately 100 training samples or less are available per class- but traditional models excel with higher quantities of labeled data.

AB  - Overwintering success is an important determinant of arthropod populations that must be considered as climate change continues to influence the spatiotemporal population dynamics of agricultural pests. Using a long-term monitoring database and biologically relevant overwintering zones, we modeled the annual and seasonal population dynamics of a common pest, Helicoverpa zea (Boddie), based on three overwintering suitability zones throughout North America using four decades of soil temperatures: the southern range (able to persist through winter), transitional zone (uncertain overwintering survivorship), and northern limits (unable to survive winter). Our model indicates H. zea population dynamics are hierarchically structured with continental-level effects that are partitioned into three geographic zones. Seasonal populations were initially detected in the southern range, where they experienced multiple large population peaks. All three zones experienced a final peak between late July (southern range) and mid-August to mid-September (transitional zone and northern limits). The southern range expanded by 3% since 1981 and is projected to increase by twofold by 2099 but the areas of other zones are expected to decrease in the future. These changes suggest larger populations may persist at higher latitudes in the future due to reduced low-temperature lethal events during winter. Because H. zea is a highly migratory pest, predicting when populations accumulate in one region can inform synchronous or lagged population development in other regions. We show the value of combining long-term datasets, remotely sensed data, and laboratory findings to inform forecasting of insect pests.

AB  - Forests are important to people, wildlife and climate. Yet, not all forests are healthy throughout time. Unhealthy forests are providing fewer services and productions to people, harbouring less biodiversity and regulating less climate. Here, the preliminary findings are presented in a literature review on remote sensing measuring the changes in forest cover and the health of forest and of trees in Southeastern Europe including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Slovenia. The aim is to assess the publications that applied remote sensing data sources to investigate the changes in forest cover and forest health and tree health in the five Southeastern European countries by searching in Scopus and Google scholar. There is a higher number of studies applied to remote sensing data sources investigating forest cover change (92.4 percent) compared to forest health (6.7 percent) and tree health (0.8 percent) for five countries in Southeastern Europe. There was a disparity of remote sensing data source studies on forest cover change, forest health and tree health amongst five countries. Croatia and Slovenia lead by 68.9 percent and Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro by 31.1 percent of publications, according to Scopus and Google scholar. There were found no remote sensing data source studies on forest cover, forest health and tree health including all five countries altogether. A way to move forward is to increase cooperation between researchers, academic organisations and policy-makers amongst the five countries.

AB  - This article contains description of an improved tool for phase unwrapping, as developed and to be applied routinely within COMET LiCSAR system producing Sentinel-1 interferograms in 0.001 degrees resolution (WGS-84). We apply existing standard methods on routinely available data in a way to improve reliability of the standard phase unwrapping procedure and increase coverage of unwrapped pixels. The primary idea is to reduce high phase gradients, causing both decorrelation and zonal unwrapping errors, by extracting and unwrapping long-wave spatial signal (extracted by a combination of multilooking and Gaussian filtering) and signal related to atmosphere that can be modeled (e.g. using COMET GACOS data or by correlation of phase with a DEM). We show the effect of the improved approach is significant in standard time series processing (here using LiCSBAS).

TI  - Temperature-Soil Moisture Dryness Index for Remote Sensing of Surface Soil Moisture Assessment
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water availability and its temperature are fundamental factors in describing the characteristics of land surface properties. In this study, a new temperature-soil moisture dryness index (TMDI) to quantify surface soil moisture (SSM) is proposed. It is defined as a function of land surface temperature variation and its relationship to surface water availability. The spatial pattern of TMDI has been analyzed over two time points of dry and rainy seasons for the plain area of Tainan, Taiwan, using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) image acquired on January 20 and October 19, 2014. The effectiveness of TMDI in reflecting the SSM status was then evaluated by the results of the simulated evapotranspiration (ET) and verified by the near-surface air temperature (T-air) and humidity (RHair) measured by the ground-based weather stations. The results indicated that TMDI exhibited a significantly negative correlation with the simulated ET and positive correlation with in situ measured T-air from seven stations (r = -0.95 and -0.9 for simulated ET and r = 0.94 and 0.78 for T-air corresponding to January 20 and October 19, respectively). We further compared the performance of the TMDI with the existing remotely sensed dryness assessment methods, including temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. The advantages of the TMDI in reflecting SSM, especially in the nonvegetation area, are clearly demonstrated. It is concluded that the TMDI is a reliable indicator for determining the SSM status with a large degree of freedom for further applications since it does not require any other ground-based measurements.

TI  - Very High-Resolution Satellite-Derived Bathymetry and Habitat Mapping Using Pleiades-1 and ICESat-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and reliable bathymetric data are needed for a wide diversity of marine research and management applications. Satellite-derived bathymetry represents a time saving method to map large shallow waters of remote regions compared to the current costly in situ measurement techniques. This study aims to create very high-resolution (VHR) bathymetry and habitat mapping in Mayotte island waters (Indian Ocean) by fusing 0.5 m Pleiades-1 passive multispectral imagery and active ICESat-2 LiDAR bathymetry. ICESat-2 georeferenced photons were filtered to remove noise and corrected for water column refraction. The bathymetric point clouds were validated using the French naval hydrographic and oceanographic service Litto3D(R) dataset and then used to calibrate the multispectral image to produce a digital depth model (DDM). The latter enabled the creation of a digital albedo model used to classify benthic habitats. ICESat-2 provided bathymetry down to 15 m depth with a vertical accuracy of bathymetry estimates reaching 0.89 m. The benthic habitats map produced using the maximum likelihood supervised classification provided an overall accuracy of 96.62%. This study successfully produced a VHR DDM solely from satellite data. Digital models of higher accuracy were further discussed in the light of the recent and near-future launch of higher spectral and spatial resolution satellites.

AB  - Constellations of small satellites are able to achieve the coverage, revisit rate, and spatial resolution needed to generate high resolution global maps of flood waters. The PlanetScope constellation achieves daily coverage at 3-4 m resolution; however, the limited spectral channels available as well as radiometric challenges inherent to large constellations of small satellites create a challenge to accurate global flood mapping. Here, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN) which combines PlanetScope imagery with information about multidecadal water dynamics from the Global Surface Water dataset to create a globally applicable water segmentation model. We also compare this model to locally-trained Random Forest models, which are commonly used for flood mapping. The CNN achieves a mean intersection over union score of 58.1% +/- 9.84% across 7 biomes when evaluated on flooded areas outside of permanent water bodies, and 70.3% +/- 11.6% when evaluated on all water pixels.

T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the evaluative potential of the concept TRUTH in the Russian language picture of the world has been carried out. The results of the analysis of the use of the word true in the role of a qualitative adjective with evaluative semantics and the word truly in the role of a qualitative adverb with the semantics of the degree of manifestation of a property, feature or action / state are presented based on the materials of the Russian National Corpus and the authors' own Internet monitoring in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet. It is shown that in the total semantic content of the concept TRUTH, two semantic layers of its conceptual content in the modern Russian are realized: correspondence to reality; compliance with the norm in the world of people, the highest ideal. The following varieties of uses of the qualitative adjective true and the qualitative adverb truly as a secondary assessment based on the general meaning of "corresponding to the ideal in the world of norms and values of the speaker" were found: the meaning is "ideal, exemplary, perfect"; the meaning is "full, reached / brought to the maximum degree of manifestation of the entity named by the defined word" and the meaning of a strong degree of manifestation of something. It is concluded that the words true and truly embody the subjective moral and value ideas of native speakers about how it should be in the world of human relations, and not about "how it really is".

AB  - Fire is a common phenomenon in many forests and is considered an important ecological tool. Fire severity mapping presents an effective way to assess post-fire management intervention and is helpful in environmental and climate change research. The objective of this study was to determine the severity of a forest fire event that occurred from 24th to 27th October 2019 at Taibon Agordino using Sentinel-2A satellite images and creating a severity map suitable as a decision-making tool for post-fire management intervention. The Sentinel-2A satellite data was classified into the following five classes: Unburned, Low Severity, Moderate Severity, High Severity, and Shadow with the non-parametric Random Forest (RF) classifier, and the resulting classified image was validated using validation sites. The RF classifier was applied first to the ten original band reflectance of Sentinel-2. In a second step, additional variables were added to the classification, namely the digital elevation model (DEM), the slope, and five vegetation indices (i.e., Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Relative Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR), Differenced Bare Soil Index (dBSI), Global Environmental Monitoring Index (GEMI) and Burn Area Index (BAI)) The inclusion of vegetation indices and DEM-related variables increased the classification accuracy from 99.26% to 99.61% and the overall accuracy from 70.51% to 83.33%. In the classification with the ten original band reflectance, the variable of importance plot ranked the Red-Edge-3, Red, and SWIR 1 band reflectance as the top three most important input features, while for the classification with 17 variables, RdNBR, DEM and dNBR were the top three most important input features.

TI  - <p>Morphology and distribution of submerged palaeoshorelines: Insights from the North West Shelf of Australia </p>
T2  - EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS
M3  - Article
AB  - Palaeoshorelines and associated palaeo-coastal features are studied to reconstruct past sea level, climate, and depositional environments. Their identification typically depends on direct field observations and is therefore challenging in the marine environment, where the interpretation mostly relies on sparse geophysical data. This review presents, based on 118 published case studies, a summary of morphological evidence that can be used to identify submerged relict coastal features worldwide, using only geophysical data. Four coastal feature categories that can be used as palaeoshoreline indicators were identified: (1) beach ridges of wind and wave origin; (2) shoreface strata; (3) marine terraces; and (4) coral-reef terraces.& nbsp;In light of this proposed classification, an area of similar to 200,000 km(2) was investigated along the Rowley Shelf (North West Shelf, Australia), a carbonate-dominated platform, based on the integration of high-resolution bathymetry (i.e., seismic-derived bathymetry, satellite-derived bathymetry, multibeam echosounder bathymetry, spot depth soundings) and 2D reflection seismic lines. Relict features were discriminated from modern bedforms using five criteria: (1) stratigraphic position; (2) emersion features; (3) similarity with modern and published analogues; (4) integration of modern ocean conditions; and (5) evidence of early cementation. In total, over 500 submerged relict coastal features were identified, making this review the most comprehensive catalogue published to date.& nbsp;Relict features are concentrated over specific depths, referred to as modal sea-level depths (MSLDs), which correspond to depths where the relative sea level remained stable over long periods of time. Nine MSLDs are observed at 20, 35, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 105 and 125 m below sea level. Each MSLD is the result of the accumulation of coastal features through multiple glacial/ interglacial cycles. Most of the features may nevertheless be related to the last glacial sea-level fall and were likely formed between Marine Isotopes Stages (MIS) 5 and 2.& nbsp;The analysis of the submerged coastal features indicates that the overall shelf morphology is controlled by the distribution of these features, and that, while in a carbonate province, their formation is related to wind, tide, fluvial and wave processes. The higher concentration of relict fluvial-influenced features at shallower depths and of relict tide-influenced features at greater depths suggest that fluvial runoffs were limited during glacial periods. This, in turn, supports the hypothesis of a prevalent dry climate during glacial periods and in contrast, of a humid climate during interglacial periods. Finally, the study reveals that most modern coral reefs of the Rowley Shelf are growing on top of relict coastal features and that seabed ridges previously interpreted as drowned coral reefs are, in fact, likely to be relict coastal features formed through clastic processes.& nbsp;Results from this study will support the identification of submerged palaeoshorelines on continental shelves around the globe and highlight the influence of associated relict coastal features on shelf morphologies. Additionally, this study provides new insights on processes shaping carbonate provinces.

AB  - Forest canopy height is an indispensable vertical structure parameter that can be used for understanding forest biomass and carbon storage as well as for managing a sustainable forest ecosystem. Plot-based field surveys, such as the national forest inventory, have been conducted to provide estimates of the forest canopy height. However, the comprehensive nationwide field monitoring of forest canopy height has been limited by its cost, lack of spatial coverage, and the inaccessibility of some forested areas. These issues can be addressed by remote sensing technology, which has gained popularity as a means to obtain detailed 2- and 3-dimensional measurements of the structure of the canopy at multiple scales. Here, we reviewed both international and domestic studies that have used remote sensing technology approaches to estimate the forest canopy height. We categorized and examined previous approaches as: 1) LiDAR approach, 2) Stereo or SAR image-based point clouds approach, and 3) combination approach of remote sensing data. We also reviewed upscaling approaches of utilizing remote sensing data to generate a continuous map of canopy height across large areas. Finally, we provided suggestions for further advancement of the Korean forest canopy height estimation system through the use of various remote sensing technologies.

AB  - This study attempted to analyze the aspects and meanings of the succession and variation of the traditional worldview and Intermarriage with non-human motif accepted in the webtoon, focusing on the webtoon <The Tale of the Tiger Bridegroom>.The results of the study are as follows. First, it was possible to examine the spatio-temporal background of the webtoon and the fantasy of <The Tale of the Tiger Bridegroom>'s independent worldview. Second, the originality of the tiger and the character of 'Ji-beom', the tiger's bridegroom, were analyzed along with the motif of “Gijachiseong” in the webtoon. Third, by referring to the discussions of previous studies on intermarriage with non-human motif in classical narratives and webtoons, this study attempted to understand the succession and variation of the cross-exchange motifs in classic narratives reproduced in webtoons and their meanings. Fourth, along with the message of the webtoon <The Tale of the Tiger Bridegroom>, which is the pursuit of the value of coexistence between humans and non-humans, this study tried to examine the meaning of fantasy remediated in the webtoon.Through this, we were able to discover the infinite vitality of the classical narrative. In addition, it was possible to explore the perception of real problems reflected in the webtoon, the enjoyment class' desire for an alternative to solve the problem, and their expectations for a new narrative.

AB  - In order to understand an individual’s viewpoint problem in mental treatment, this study reviews the concept of ‘Worldview’ from philosophical counseling that emphasizes ‘thinking’ and the concept of ‘Internal Working Model’ from the attachment theory that considers ‘affect regulation’ as the core. Since humans give meaning to their lives through their own viewpoint on themselves and world, a philosophical counselor aims to help his/her clients interpret their worldview to ensure that they have the right viewpoint. On the other hand, in the attachment theory, which believes that attachment desire of which the key point is ‘affect regulation’ plays a vital role in an individual’s mental life, mental problems originate from pathological internal working models that distort and color reality in negative and unrealistic ways. So the counselor needs to provide his/her clients with an opportunity for an emotionally stable attachment experience so that their models reflect reality correctly and flexibly.Despite the contrasting positions of the two theories, each focusing on the importance of ‘thinking’ and ‘the affect regulation’, both theories stress out metacognition as a key element in their mental treatment equally because they deal with the problem of viewpoint that has two dialectical functions: ‘seeing something’ and ‘establishing a specific image’.

AB  - The present writer investigated interferences and overcoming in the communications of classical literature through the methodology of Hwajaeng-semiotics while dividing into synchronic and diachronic contact.Researchers should construct a worldview of the corresponding era. He generalizes inductively aspects in which people respond collectively to the absurdities of the world. He composes a dictionary of metaphor/metonymy and intersubjective reality.The researcher constructs a base and interprets literary works as a superstructure concerning this. However, he should synthesize the interpretation of the refractive text to sublate the fallacies of mechanical Marxism.The researcher understands the underlying philosophy of ideology faithfully. And he analyzes the dynamic relationship between the ruling class/the sovereign power/discipline power as the subject of doctrine and the ruled class as the object and criticizes the fabrication in which the ruled established an imaginary relationship with the real.The researcher must perform decoding well by reading the principle and system of encoding. He solves double codes to extract the complex meaning.To overcome the gap between oral culture and writing culture, the researcher should interpret literary works such as sijo, pan-sori, and folk songs on the premise that the text is a genre audience-oriented in the context of oral culture. He interprets it from the perspective of the audience, focusing on achieving aural incorporations between the sender and the receiver.The way to overcome the aesthetic gap between the elite and the ordinary people is to interpret alternately between the two habitus. We read it with metaphor, then replace it with a metonymy.In synchronic communication, the teacher constitutes the socio-cultural context of the era. He restores the context of the student’s life. Analog generations explain it according to the eye level of the digital. He guides students to feel the sensory image expressed in poetry or sentences and sympathize with the pain of the poetic speaker or character. The researchers read against the predominant view. And he acquires alterity from the perspective of a subaltern and rewrites it in the direction of criticizing and overcoming myths and ideologies of text or discourse.

AB  - The frequency of disasters is increasing due to global climate change, and unusual heavy rains and rainy seasons are occurring in Korea. Periodic monitoring and rapid detection are important because these weather conditions can lead to drought and flooding, causing secondary damage. Although research using optical images is continuously being conducted to determine the waterbody, there is a limitation in that it is difficult to detect due to the influence of clouds in order to detect floods that accompany heavy rain. Therefore, there is a need for research using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) that can be observed regardless of day or night in all weather. In this study, using Sentinel-1 SAR images that can be collected in near-real time as open data, the UNet model among deep learning algorithms that have recently been used in various fields was applied. In previous studies, waterbody detection studies using SAR images and deep learning algorithms are being conducted, but only a small number of studies have been conducted in Korea. In this study, to determine the applicability of deep learning of SAR images, UNet and the existing algorithm thresholding method were compared, and five indices and Sentinel-2 normalized difference water index (NDWI) were evaluated. As a result of evaluating the accuracy with intersect of union (IoU), it was confirmed that UNet has high accuracy with 0.894 for UNet and 0.699 for threshold method. Through this study, the applicability of deep learning-based SAR images was confirmed, and if high-resolution SAR images and deep learning algorithms are applied, it is expected that periodic and accurate waterbody change detection will be possible in Korea.

AB  - This study explores words and images in the bilingual picturebook Aekyung’s Dream (1988), a story about a Korean immigrant child’s lived experiences in the U.S. Framed within the theory of postcolonialism as resistance, this study investigates how written and visual representations can invite students to become aware of the voices of Korean immigrant children in the U.S. Findings show that a significant shift in narratives and written/visual representations takes place in the picturebook, finally illustrating the counter-narratives of Korean immigrants and communities. This shift illuminates the retrieval and recovery of their identities and voices that have been marginalized in the U.S. What is further significant in the findings is that these counter-narratives serve as the rewriting and redoing of the assimilationist and hegemonic discourse that permeates mainstream U.S. society. This is followed by discussions, which shed light on the power of reading the word and the world through the story of Aekyung’s Dream and, thereby, have important educational implications for language and culture educators, who guide students to enter into the lives of others and also uplift them into multi-layers of the worldview.

TI  - A Poetic Exploration of Fetishism as a Modern Poetry Research Methodology

T2  - The Review of Korean Cultural Studies
T2  - 한민족문화연구
M3  - research-article
AB  - This study would seek the possibility of applying fetishism as a modern poetry research methodology by examining its theoretical foundation. As is well known, fetishism means commodity fetishism from a Marxist perspective or has been considered a decadent sexual desire of being excessively obsessed with a part of the body or an object from a psychoanalytic perspective. Fetishism is a metonymic sign to meet the fundamental human deficiency, which is summarized as a mere reproduction or substitute of the essence. In literature studies, also, fetishism is mostly mentioned as a theoretical background that describes commodity capitalism or a perverted sexual desire. And yet, on the basis of this logic, awareness based on civilizational theory is working, which treats fetishism as a product of savage and barbarism. Originally, fetishism was a term by which the Europeans referred to that of indigenous peoples of West Africa, and after the 18th century, it has been used as a derogatory term meaning the crude and vulgar superstition of primitive people by Western anthropologists and religious scholars. On the other hand, according to the materialistic religious view of Ludwig Feuerbach who criticized logocentrism, primitive people’s fetishistic religion has materiality and usefulness. Primitive people can live as ‘beings in the world’ by worshipping an ‘emotional substance’ in the materialist worldview. Emile Durkheim noted that personal totems, as well as collective totems from primitive religions, contribute to the surrounding environment based on the ‘affect’ between humans and also things and the bond with the world as well. Like this, fetishism as ‘materialism of affect’ can be rediscovered as an aesthetic imagination that transcends the separation between humans and between humans and things caused by modernity. Based on this, this study would investigate and reveal that the aspects of fetishism in the works of Kim So-Wol, Kim Ki-Rim, and Yi-Sang are acting as a driving force that implodes the reality of modernity.

AB  - In this paper, I would like to reveal the unique aspect of the ‘Conscience’ section  of 『Phenomenology of Spirit』(hereinafter ‘Conscience’ section), which in the ethical dimension is different from the theory of conscience in 『Philosophy of Right』. In the latter, conscience was noted as a pre-step to prepare for the transition to 'ethical life' as the final figure of 'morality', whereas in the former, what kind of 'immanent' process of conscience is developed is dealt with. To clarify this, I first briefly review the “moral worldview” that forms the immediately preceding step before ‘Conscience’ section in order to understand the historical and systematic background of the inevitability of development of the conscience (2). Next, the aspect of the intrinsic dialectic of conscience in the ‘Conscience’ section and the three pairs of tensions driving it are dealt with (3). Then, I will show, through a full-scale analysis and reconstruction of the ‘Conscience’ section, how the conscience is transformed in a series of shape changes ('beautiful soul', 'conscience in action', 'evaluating consciousness', etc.) and in a progressively developed reciprocal relationsfrom (self-sufficient enjoyment to antagonistic reciprocity) (4). Finally, it is shown that the ethical grammar of the true community reached in this way is the relationship of mutual recognition itself. A true community of communication is not one-sided, but an open act of confession and forgiveness that is mutually symmetrical, and openness ready to mutually acknowledge the 'equality' in which all members claim universality but are tied to specificity. It is argued that the true community can only be constructed on this open mutual recognition (5)

AB  - As the number of UAS’s (Unmanned Aerial Systems) satellite data link systems which use same frequency band with commercial communications satellites, the interferences between two systems are increasing. On the other hand, due to the requirements on the size and the weight of UAS, the size of satellite antennas is decreasing and thus, the interferences to the UAS’s satellite data link from other systems become more severe.In the vicinity of the Korean peninsula, satellite broadcasting systems of neighboring countries are densely packed and thus interference analysis between UAS’s satellite links and other satellite systems should be preceded. In this paper, we analyze the interference between satellite broadcasting systems and satellite control (TC, Tele-Control) links of UAS and we propose a scheme to derive system parameters for the TC links of UAS.

AB  - This paper examines the case of how to read  The Brothers Karamazov  in the subject of Reading Classics and then introduces the feedback of the students.First of all, in this paper the original text and the digest version of  The Brothers Karamazov  were compared and examined. Following this, the reason for reading the original text itself was examined. Next, with the students who recognized the importance of the original text, the discussion about the possibility of various interpretations was considered by converting their passive reading behavior into an active one by using the internal and external context of the work. Finally, we introduced the activity of writing feedback, which can allow instructors to estimate to what degree their learners have accepted the process of their class.There are three things that can be confirmed through the analysis of this paper. First, the background knowledge of the novel, the author's personal information, and the text are not separate, but all are combined. This type of analysis can serve to promote creativity and critical thinking among the students. Second, students can discover the meaning of such classics from a different perspective than the existing commentary by writing an article which draws from their majors and applies it to the classics. Third, this study shows that the process starts with instilling doubts among the students about the theme of the text, which up until then everyone has taken for granted. The students then arrive at the author's worldview through the process of organically examining the text and the external context. This reasoning process can arouse the curiosity of the learner.

TI  - Evaluation of a Direct Reverse Transcription Loop-Mediated Isothermal Amplification Method without RNA Extraction (Direct RT-LAMP) for the Detection of Lymph Node Metastasis in Early Breast Cancer
T2  - CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Assessing lymph node metastasis, tumor-derived DNA, or tumor-derived RNA has previously been studied in place of immu- nohistochemical assay. Because a direct reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (direct RT-LAMP) has been previously developed in order to rapidly identify viruses in place of RNA extraction, our team hypothesized that a direct RT-LAMP assay can be employed as a substitute in order to detect tumor involvement of lymph nodes within breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods A total amount of 92 lymph nodes removed across 40 patients possessing breast cancer were collected at Kyungpook National University Chilgok Hospital between the months of November 2015 and February 2016. All samples were then evaluated and contrasted via both a direct RT-LAMP assay and routine histopathologic examination. Results The sensitivity and specificity of the direct RT-LAMP assay were 85.7% and 100%, respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 100% and 94.4%, respectively. Conclusion Direct RT-LAMP assay is capable of facilitating the detection of sentinel lymph node metastasis within breast cancer patients intraoperatively possessing an excellent sensitivity via a cost-effective and time-saving manner.

AB  - This thesis is a study on Soo-ah Bae’s Essayist’s Desk. It will first focus on the narrator’s essays on language, which is the most important part of the novel. And it will be revealed that this is pursuing a post-structuralist linguistics. And it will be revealed that this novel is a narrative that allegorizes such linguistics. Through this, we will be able to gain insight into the pessimistic worldview that this allegorical narrative implies.This thesis inherits the conclusion of previous studies that the “innumerable otherness that penetrates the subject from the outside,” rather than the internal otherness, embodies a postmodern narrativistic subjectivity rather than a modern one. However, this thesis tries to read the post-structuralist phase that deviates from the universal structure of structuralism rather than the post-modern phase in which the novel deconstructs the present of the modern subject. Through this, we will be able to look into the pessimistic worldview of the novel, which is implied by the structural “drawings” of the “post” linguistic signifiers. In the end, this thesis will provide a major clue to intertextually explore Bae Soo-ah’s style of “writing a novel” itself by analyzing Essayist’s Desk which most clearly reveals the author’s self-consciousness about the language of the novel.There are basically three main points that this thesis gives a special insight while re-reading Essayist’s Desk. The first is to explore the musical universal structure embodied by the character M. The second is to explore the complicity between the musical universal structure embodied by M and the national language embodied by Erich. The third is to gain insight into the universal linguistic structure embodied by ‘I’. By contrasting these structures, this thesis will eventually reveal that the “drawings” of the signifiers that make up the universal post-structural linguistics embody the meaning of the impermanence of the world. This will contribute to deepening the theory on the writer in the future by theoretically grounding Bae Soo-ah’s novel language and pessimistic worldview.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study performed 4-day numerical integration in 1-hour intervals using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for four major cases of heavy snowfall that occurred from 2020 to 2021. The model-predicted snow depth data were compared with the ground-observed snow depth and the satellite-observed snow cover data and then were statistically verified. The scalar verification results for ground data from the four cases showed a root-mean-square error of 2.55-16.67 cm and a correlation coefficient of 0.48-0.80, whereas the verification results with satellite data showed the correlation coefficients of 0.38-0.60. For categorical verification, using a threshold value of a snow depth exceeding 5 cm, the proportion correct was 90% or higher for ground observations of each case. In addition, in the satellite categorical verification, when the threshold value of the Snow Cover Fraction (SCF) exceeds 0.5, the proportion correct was 50% or more. These results are meaningful because the model snow depth verification methods were devised strategically for the first time using both the snow depth data of the mesoscale ground observation networks and ultra-high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite data currently available in Korea. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of a high-resolution numerical prediction model and its verification methodology for snowfalls in the Korean Peninsula, eventually leading to increased prediction accuracy and reduced snow damage.

M3  - research-article
AB  - In exploring the prominent late Joseon Confucian scholar, Nokmun Im Seongju (1711-1788), one unavoidably comes across the fact that the ‘sheng zhi wei sheng’ chapter in the Mencius had a decisive influence on Nokmun. In the debate over the sameness or difference between 'human nature' and ‘the nature of things,’ which was the hottest philosophical issue in the mid-to-late Joseon Dynasty, Nokmun originally agreed with the position of his teacher, Doam Lee Jae (1680-1746), that human nature and the natures of things are the same. The aforementioned chapter in the Mencius changed Nogmun’s mind. Given the general understanding of the chapter that Mencius try to emphasize the aspect of human nature distinct from the nature of things, Nogmun’s change of position in the Horak Debate can be easily understood.This paper aims to show that Nokmun's reading of the ‘sheng zhi wei sheng’ chapter did not merely bring about a shift from Nakron to Horon, but played a pivotal role in establishing the structure of Nokmun's monistic Neo-Confucianism. More precisely, I would like to say that Mencius's philosophy provide the basis for the development of Nokmun’s philosophy. The fact that a Confucian cannon such as the Mencius influence a Confucian scholar’s philosophical thinking may sound like tautology. However, seen from a different angle, it also means that Mencius's philosophy can be interpreted very closely to the ki-centered monistic philosophy advocated by Nokmun. Nokmun seems to have had the idea that the problem caused by the clash between the dualistic structure of Zhuxi’s philosophy and ‘monistic’ Chinese traditional worldview could be solved by returning to the monistic structure via the Mencian philosophy. This paper will examine how such an attempt appears to solve the problem of Horak Debate.

AB  - The monastery movement is a reflection of social chaos and the depravity of the church. It can be seen that contemporary Korean society demands the succession of the movement, which has already been developed in various forms. Looking at the the Korean Protestant Monastery, the following meanings can be drawn from the ethical and missionary aspects. First, it is worth paying attention to the aspect of the monastic movement, which is connected with public theology. From the perspective of the Korean Protestant Monastery Movement, since it has historically transformed churches and society, the significance of its existence can be highly evaluated in public theology. As Korean Protestantism has played an important role during the Enlightenment period, the Japanese colonial era, the Korean War, and the economic development process, the monastic movement has also participated as an part of Protestant church.Second, the monastic movement can be a typical model for realizing community ethics in contrast to individualism. Historically, monasteries have existed as Christian institutions that find expression in both very personal and communal - paradoxical - form. Community ethics in monastery movement is not separated from social issues and rather emphasizes various virtues and unique biblical narratives.Third, the monastic movement focuses on the formation of spirituality that James Smith and others call “the liturgy”. Spaces of the liturgy that actually affect many people have the ethical and theological characteristics  by being constructed on the worldview. Liturgical acts can be found in many areas around us, and the importance of monasteries  needs to be emphasized as a space for spiritual formation.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to conduct with the aim of examining the socio-cultural impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that swept the world around 2020, and examining the transformation of norms and social problems through this. To this end, the characteristics of changes in the socio-cultural norms of the 14th century European Black Death, a representative example of the pandemic, were derived, and based on this, the COVID-19 pandemic was analyzed. The Black Death, which cost a third of Europe's population in the 14th century, changed social norms based on existing religious authority and feudal power, leading to the transition to Enlightenment, which seeks to carve out the world with human values and human thoughts and efforts. The population decline and labor shortage also promoted commercialization and mechanization. Printing, which spread during this period, led to the popularization of knowledge, which raised the level of thinking and led to epochal scientific development, which became the foundation of the Industrial Revolution. The recent COVID-19 pandemic triggered changes in social norms like the Black Death. Changes to a rapidly spreading non-face-to-face society have spread the technological environment of metaverse, a mixture of virtual and reality. The characteristics of metaverse interacting online through avatars have changed the personality from the norm that individual identity should be composed and maintained in a single way to a free and open identity that exerts various potentials. In addition, memes that are friendly to those who have the same worldview as themselves on the metaverse worked in a way that weakened a sense of isolation in non-face-to-face situations. With the new social problems created by the newly constructed social norms, discussions were held on what there would be the conflict of leadership between the past and the new norms and unexpected new social problems.

AB  - Using multi-temporal KOMPSAT-3/3A high-resolution satellite images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the area around the Fukushima daiichi nuclear power plant was determined, and the pattern of vegetation changes was investigated. As well, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images were used. The NDVI products obtained from these three sensors were validated and compared with land cover and land use map of the same area for visual interpretation. The main results of this study showed that the NDVI in the mid-2010 was low within area-of-the interests in the vicinity of the nuclear power plant, but the vegetated area continued to expand until 2021. It can be interpreted as a result of a decrease in human activities. In particular, the map of differences between the mid-2010 and 2021 of highresolution images revealed detailed spatial features rather than those of the mid-resolution images. In disaster areas where access is restricted, such as the areas around the Fukushima nuclear power plant, and where it is difficult to collect field data, obtaining classification products with high accuracy using satellite images is challenging. It helps to analyze them using primary products such as vegetation indices exactly determined from the high-resolution satellite imagery.

AB  - This article aims to present some theoretical proposals and directions for re-establishing the environmental ecology philosophy of the philosophical and religious Daoism philosophy, through analysis of the current status and achievements of environmental eco-philosophy-related research in the modern Korean Daoism philosophy academic circles. In this context, domestic thesis related to environmental ecology of the philosophical Daoism philosophy will be examined from two aspects of change of worldview and establishment of environmental ethics, and related domestic thesis of the religious Daoism philosophy will be reviewed from two aspects of ecological ideology and environmental ethics. The research in the domestic academic community so far needs to supplement the following several points. Specifically, resetting the subject and scope of related research, establishing a unique environmental ecology theory in the Daoism through comparative analysis with environmental ecology discourses in other academic fields, securing the universality and versatility of the Daoism environmental ecology philosophy, and changing the worldview and modern interpretations of the Daoism for establishing environmental ethics. Based on the above contents, for the current interpretation and grafting of the Daoism philosophy to the environmental ecological problem, it is possible to synthesize each area of ​​the worldview, the relationship between humans and nature, and environmental ecology into an organic theoretical system. At this point, it is necessary to research methods and content settings.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface reflectance (LSR) is well known as an essential variable to understand land surface properties. The Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) be able to observe not only the ocean but also the land with the high temporal and spatial resolution thanks to its channel specification. In this study, we describe the land atmospheric correction algorithm and present the quality of results through comparison with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and in-situ data for GOCI-II. The GOCI LSR shows similar spatial distribution and quantity with MODIS LSR for both healthy and unhealthy vegetation cover. Our results agreed well with in-situ-based reference LSR with a high correlation coefficient (>0.9) and low root mean square error (<0.02) in all 8 GOCI channels. In addition, seasonal variation according to the solar zenith angle and phenological dynamics in time-series was well presented in both reference and GOCI LSR. As the results of uncertainty analysis, the estimated uncertainty in GOCI LSR shows a reasonable range (<0.04) even under a high solar zenith angle over 70 degrees. The proposed method in this study can be applied to GOCI-II and can provide continuous satellite-based LSR products having a high temporal and spatial resolution for analyzing land surface properties.

AB  - This study is aimed to examine tuberculosis appearing as ‘infectious disease’ in Bajin’s novels and the aspects of changes in romantic metaphors focusing on his novels, Collapse and Cold Night.Bajin adopted various infectious diseases as a subject matter throughout the entire period, and among them, tuberculosis appears most frequently, and it works as an important narrative strategy that leads the novel entirely. What is notable, however, is that although the narratives deal with tuberculosis commonly, there is big difference in the ways of development, for instance, the causes of tuberculosis, the processes of curing, recognition on infectious diseases, or the reverberation of death. This is associated with the gradual change of recognition on tuberculosis along with the development of medicine, but it is also related to Bajin changing ideologically from a romantic worldview to realism. Therefore, this research is intended to investigate how the metaphor of tuberculosis as an infectious disease goes through transformations in his novels targeting his first and last novels and ultimately explain the dynamics between romance and reality in Bajin’s novels which changed within literature of infectious disease.

AB  - The Movement Against the Cheonseongsan Tunnel Construction (from now on referred to as ‘the Movement’) in the early 2000s was an environmental movement that greatly influenced Korean society. Studies dealing with the Movement generally share that this Movement is the most significant environmental Movement in Korean society and the first Movement in which ecologism has emerged. The environmental movement, which began in the 1980s, changed its value orientation to "ecology" in the 1990s, and Korean religions actively participated in this turn. However, among the existing studies dealing with the Movement, few studies pay attention to this point and deal with this theme. This study focuses on the fact that practical solutions to overcome the ecological crisis have not been prepared even now, intensifying this crisis. Civilization transformation is still only an important issue, and discussions and movements related to environment have not led to real-life turns and civilization transforms. This study began with an interest in the delay in this transformation, the delay in problem-solving. It understands the Movement from the governance perspective, a form of coordination for solving social problems.And the Movement’s implications will be restored with an ecological movement. The Movement was the first attempt to fully realize ecological values as a life style and a worldview. However, as problem-solving was delegated to judicial judgment, the meaning of civilization transformation was ejected. In this situation, it was also excluded the possibility of cooperative governance with ecologism as the principal value. Then, only the social adjustment style based on government control and market profits remained. This study confirms that the Movement showed the possibility of cooperative governance based on religion and emphasizes that religion should play a role in coordinating members to cooperate and consult.

AB  - The ecological crisis is no longer a radical slogan of some extreme environmentalists. The analysis that the Earth has reached its acceptance limit as a residence of humankind is not a hasty prediction. There are movements and discourses to turn from a way of life that considers growth and development as the best, developing resources without restraint, and pursuing human needs to a sustainable way of life. And as one of the alternative civilization paradigms, the Buddhist worldview, especially the dependent origination worldview, is drawing attention. On one side of these expectations, there is also a question of whether Buddhism's worldview can drive the transformation of civilization into reality. For example, in terms of ecology, the everyday life of Buddhists are not very different from that of others. This study focuses on this phenomenon. Ecological discourse presupposes that religions will affect individual perceptions, then those affect personal attitudes and practices. However, religious doctrines affect individual perceptions, but perceptions do not immediately lead to attitudes and practices. In this study, the phenomenon was considered through the concept of 'conversion.' Unlike the interpretation of Dependent Origination in ecological discourse, there are various interpretations of that. In the Korean Buddhist culture that values individual enlightenment, various interpretations tend to be reduced to individual mind action in the conclusion. As such, it was confirmed that there is a disconnect in the real Buddhist community that prevents ecological conversion.

AB  - This thesis investigates the features of Modern women and their consciousness changes in Gasa, which is a long narrative song, and the significance of Gasa of the times. In the modern era, women were forced to put themselves in a situation where they had no choice but to obey the decisions of their husbands or in-laws regardless of their will.Three pieces of Gasa were selected among modern women’s works such as <Sigolsaeksiseoluntaryung>, a rural female narrator who received a divorce notice from her husband, <Wimosa>, leaving her hometown with her parents-in-law for Manchuria for national independence, and leaving her homeland with her husband who went to Japan to study, <Manhyangga> All the female narrators in the three works belong to the old generation. These women make their minds to keep their place in the social upheaval, longing for the independent life of women moving into a wider world and following their husband to a foreign country while missing their hometown in the first-person narration.Women’s magazines published in the 1930s and three novels featuring a female speaker as the protagonist was examined to explore modern women's features. Modern women are divided into new women and old-fashioned women. However, the women in the above three Gasa works were thinking the same as new women for education, This consciousness system was investigated from the perspective of enlightenment awareness of new women and old-fashioned women, changes in worldview, and perception of space. Those three Gasa works have great significance in the characteristics of revealing modern changes and expressing individual narratives rather than lyric literature that conveys information.

AB  - Generally speaking, nowadays, Herman Bavinck is well recognized as one of the best Reformed theologians because of his magnum opus Reformed Dogmas. Because his theology is vast and complicated, it is in the spotlight as an object of professional study, but tends to be ignored by general readers. But we must remember that Bavinck loved the church, and he was a theologian who did theology for the church. In this paper, we examined the characteristics of Bavinck as a theologian for the reformed church. I first provided background, followed by an analysis and overview of his 1883 inaugural address for a seminary professor. In his brief inaugural address, the 28-year-old Bavinck does a good job of describing the principle, object, and purposes of Reformed theology. Confronting the liberal, naturalistic worldview of the 19th century, Bavinck demonstrated the potential of theology as a Bible-centered, God-centered, and church-centered science(wetenschap).

AB  - This study identifies Kyu-won Oh's poem collection for children Car in the Tree as an aspect of late poetry, and examines the correlation between Arthur Rimbaud’s poetic theory and raw image.Oh once said that raw image, which "said everything without saying anything," would "hope to lead to Rimbaud’s poetic theory." In terms of linguistic methodology, Oh's raw image was an effort to reverse the center of poetry from metaphor to metonymy. This was the result of reflecting Oh's perception that the violence interpreting and distorting the human-centered world is revealed through a metaphorical worldview. The spirit of raw image created by Oh was that the meaning of the world will not be distorted, and the things can speak of themselves as they are through the changes in dynamics of metaphors and metonymy. Also, the poet wished that his own poetic theory would be read as a poetic attempt, such as Rimbaud's voyant, rather than as a linear or phenomenological perspective.As a result, in Oh's poetry, materiality and clairvoyance as well as observation and discovery, which are the characteristics of the raw image, are presented as prominent features. Furthermore, when considering Oh Kyu-won's poetry through the concept of "’I’ is ‘Another’" in Rimbaud, it was confirmed that the unique discovery of Oh, in which rearrangement and arrangement between objects discover the world, appeared in his poems.The correlation between the raw image and the Rimbaud poetic theory is having a great influence on Oh’s poems for children. It cannot be denied that Oh's poems for children have been alienated from the main trend of studying Oh's later works of poetry. This research is significant that it attempted to re-identify Oh’s poems and poetic theory in the perspective of poetic theory, as he desired, through reconsidering his work from a phenomenological perspective.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to examine the similarities between John Donne (1573∼1631), the 17th century British representative metaphysical poet, and Baruch Spinoza (1632∼1677), the 17th century Dutch philosopher, from the view point of a mind-body monism. This paper tries to trace the fact that these two people showed postmodern thought as they, unlike Rene Descartes (1596∼1650), escaped the Enlightenment worldview that dominated the western spiritual world centered on soul and reason. In Chapter 13 of her book Returning to John Donne (2015), “Donne, Milton, Spinoza, and Freedom of Faith: A Cross-Confessional Perspective,” Achsah Guibbory compares Donne and Milton (1608∼1674), and she compares John Locke (1632∼1704) and Spinoza from the religious point of view of tolerance. She says that while Donne and Spinoza have similar religious affiliations, Milton and Locke have similar ideas. Based on these arguments of Guibbory, this paper intends to examine the similarities between Donne and Spinoza. Guibbory approaches from a religious point of view, but unlike Guibbory, this paper attempts to approach the theme of unity of body and soul beyond the dualism of the two from an ontological point of view.

M3  - research-article
AB  - The dramatic increase in flood incidents as a significant threat to human life and property, environment, and infrastructure indicates the necessity of mapping spatial distribution of flood susceptible areas to reduce destructive effects of flooding. During the last decade, the integration of the geographic information system (GIS) with the remote sensing data provide efficient means to generate a more reliable and precise flood susceptibility map. The present study contains a review of 200 articles on the application of GIS-based methods in indicating flood vulnerable areas. The papers were reviewed in terms of influential variables, study area, and the number of articles published in the last 10 years. The review shows that the number of studies has increased since 2012. The total study areas covered 39 countries that were mostly located in Asia where the major developments and infrastructures have been constructed in the floodplains. The most common study areas was Iran (44 articles, 22%), followed by India (26 articles, 13%), China (26 articles, 11%), and Vietnam (15 articles, 7.5%). More than 90 variables were considered to map flood susceptible areas that the top 5 widely used flood conditioning factor are slope (98% of total articles), followed by elevation (92% of total articles), land use/land cover (79.5% of total articles), distance to the river (76.5% of total articles), and rainfall (73% of total articles). The review implies that many natural and anthropogenic factors affect flooding and the combination of both groups of factors is necessary to accurately detect and map flood-prone parts of the study area.

AB  - Background As content is focused on mobile, the demand for content that can be easily enjoyed anytime, anywhere has increased. Accordingly, a marketing strategy that can closely connect brands and consumers has become more important than ever. Recently, more companies and brands are creating characters and actively using them in marketing activities. Among various industries, the food industry is sensitive to marketing trends. Therefore, this study examines the universe marketing of food brands using brand characters that has emerged as a marketing trend.Methods This study summarized the previous research and theoretical background on the change of the marketing environment, universe marketing, and the brand character. As a framework for character analysis, two aspects are examined: a design component and a worldview component.Result Brands created a virtual universe around characters and used Instagram to continuously upload story-related posts. As a result of analyzing brand characters, the design elements had the use of character names, colors, and costume designs in common that could be reminiscent of the brand, and the expression methods were set as 2D characters similar to webtoon and age groups similar to Generation MZ. The worldview component was differentiated by using realistic, unexpected, fun, sympathetic, and communication as the core elements of the content.Conclusion Brand characters play a role in increasing brand affinity by expanding sympathy with consumers and increasing the number of followers through universe marketing. Character marketing aimed at Generation MZ is composed of elements that can differentiate it from other brands in a short and clear story that is new and interesting. The composition of the universe marketing contains reality, surprise, fun, empathy, and communication.

AB  - Agricultural reservoirs are essential structures for water supplies during dry period in the Korean peninsula, where water resources are temporally unequally distributed. For efficient water management, systematic and effective monitoring of medium-small reservoirs is required. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides a way for continuous monitoring of those, with its capability of all- weather observation. This study aims to evaluate the applicability of SAR in monitoring medium-small reservoirs using Sentinel-1 (10 m resolution) and Capella X-SAR (1 m resolution), at Chari (CR), Galjeon (GJ), Dwitgol (DG) reservoirs located in Ulsan, Korea. Water detected results applying Z fuzzy function- based threshold (Z-thresh) and Chan-vese (CV), an object detection-based segmentation algorithm, are quantitatively evaluated using UAV-detected water boundary (UWB). Accuracy metrics from Z-thresh were 0.87, 0.89, 0.77 (at CR, GJ, DG, respectively) using Sentinel-1 and 0.78, 0.72, 0.81 using Capella, and improvements were observed when CV was applied (Sentinel-1: 0.94, 0.89, 0.84, Capella: 0.92, 0.89, 0.93). Boundaries of the waterbody detected from Capella agreed relatively well with UWB; however, false- and un-detections occurred from speckle noises, due to its high resolution. When masked with optical sensor-based supplementary images, improvements up to 13% were observed. More effective water resource management is expected to be possible with continuous monitoring of available water quantity, when more accurate and precise SAR-based water detection technique is developed.

AB  - Manichaeism is a religion that originated in Mesopotamia around the third century AD. It was developed in the Persian Empire and spread widely in the East and the West. Mani, who founded Manichaeism, completed his own worldview and doctrine of Manichaeism by integration of various religious elements from Gnosticism in Mesopotamia, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Buddhism, etc. Meanwhile, Mani, as a master of painting, created icons and used them to spread the gospel.From a Chinese perspective, Manichaeism was a pagan religion, and unlike for Buddhism, was recognized only as a religion of barbarians in the Tang Dynasty. Uyghur Mani believers in Chang’an, the capital city, moved to Fujian after the oppression of Buddhism during the reign of Emperor Mujong at the end of the Tang dynasty. Mani believers formed Manichaean communities in Quanzhou in Fujian Province, Yunzhou in Zhejiang, and other places, and conducted secret religious activities, and left many religious paintings in the Song and Yuan dynasties. The paintings may be similar expressively to Buddhist paintings of the Song and Yuan era, but their subjects depict the doctrine and ideology at the time of the establishment of Manichaeism. This research primarily explores the paintings of the Virgin of the Light and Jesus of the Light as representative paintings of Manichaeism. From the examination of the paintings, it may be noted that in Manichaean paintings, the Virgin of the Light was the being who guides the souls who have escaped from their bodies to the seat of the judgment. Jesus was recognized as a spiritual being who is different from the historical Jesus, and was a being who liberates the light trapped in the body after death.

AB  - Manichaeism is a religion that originated in Mesopotamia around the third century AD. It was developed in the Persian Empire and spread widely in the East and the West. Mani, who founded Manichaeism, completed his own worldview and doctrine of Manichaeism by integration of various religious elements from Gnosticism in Mesopotamia, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, Buddhism, etc. Meanwhile, Mani, as a master of painting, created icons and used them to spread the gospel.From a Chinese perspective, Manichaeism was a pagan religion, and unlike for Buddhism, was recognized only as a religion of barbarians in the Tang Dynasty. Uyghur Mani believers in Chang’an, the capital city, moved to Fujian after the oppression of Buddhism during the reign of Emperor Mujong at the end of the Tang dynasty. Mani believers formed Manichaean communities in Quanzhou in Fujian Province, Yunzhou in Zhejiang, and other places, and conducted secret religious activities, and left many religious paintings in the Song and Yuan dynasties. The paintings may be similar expressively to Buddhist paintings of the Song and Yuan era, but their subjects depict the doctrine and ideology at the time of the establishment of Manichaeism. This research primarily explores the paintings of the Virgin of the Light and Jesus of the Light as representative paintings of Manichaeism. From the examination of the paintings, it may be noted that in Manichaean paintings, the Virgin of the Light was the being who guides the souls who have escaped from their bodies to the seat of the judgment. Jesus was recognized as a spiritual being who is different from the historical Jesus, and was a being who liberates the light trapped in the body after death.

AB  - As a crossover phenomenon in picturebooks, Gnosticism, which is horror literature for adults, began to emerge. The current study analyzed the worldview by applying Vanhoozer’s(2009) Theological cultural Hermeneutics to Hui-na Baek’s picturebook “Strange Mom,” and illuminated it as a Christian worldview.First, the world of the text itself, the analysis revealed that the family issues continued through book cover. The main character was an antagonist that subverted the protagonist, and manifested the notion of nihilism highlighting social problems by demonstrating that the wicked help the righteous. Second, the world behind the text, Hui-na Baek lost the copyright lawsuit, and pessimism was reflected in her work. She studied at CalArts, which followed a postmodernist trend, and she has created several Gnostic picture books. Third, the world ahead of the text, adults were comforted and children found the book either fun or terrifying, which shows that the readers of each group expressed opposite reactions. Hui-na Baek won the ALMA and, raised her profile, while ALMA’s award-winning writers reflected the postmodern paradigm.Finally, this literature contains a new-age worldview that advocates Gnosticism to replace the nihilistic world. It emphasizes the absolute necessity of analyzing the worldview of picture books as a means to recover Christianity.It also demonstrates that children’s literature can contain the Christian worldview, such as in Tolkien's fantasy theory. A good picturebook cultivates one’s mind to find grace, the gift of God. Although we are currently in the era of postmodernism to which culture the picturebook adheres, one should examine it through a worldview analysis, and this emphasizes the need for individuals to be a critic, a man of letters, and a believer that repents and recovers in the light of the Christian worldview of creation, depravity, and redemption.

AB  - Readers trust children's literature awards, which are awarded to excellent picture books. However, there is little information or research on the Astrid Lindgren Memorial Award (ALMA), which is acclaimed as the largest prize in children's literature. There is a need to discuss the influence that shakes the traditional values of cultural Marxism, which is emerging in the study of worldview of picture books, by applying it to ALMA-winning picture books. This is because the meaning of the readers' trust and that of subversion, which shakes traditional values, are opposite to each other.Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the worldview of ALMA-winning picture books and to investigate the influence of cultural Marxism.As a result, it elucidates Astrid Lindgren's life and the characteristics of works related to political and social movements. It also shows that the enactment purpose for the award-winning works contain the meaning of subversion that takes adult literature and puts children's rights in front of it. The winning works show a psychoanalytic sexual liberation worldview, a surrealist worldview, a humanistic worldview, an ecological worldview, a global postmodern worldview, a nihilistic worldview, and a gnostic worldview. They contain cultural Marxism and critical theory that has spread out from the Institute for Social and Cultural Studies at Frankfurt University.Therefore, educators of children’s literature should reflect on the worldviews that will affect children’s cognitive, emotional, and moral development.

As a research method, monographs and previous studies and data on the study of Han Young-suk-ryu Seungmu and Shinmyeongpuri were analyzed. The contents of the study are, first, that in the Seungmu of Han Yeongsuk-ryu, it has a narrative structure that elevates to ‘Yeombul-Taryeong-Gutgeori (Dangak)-Bukjangdan-Gutgeori’ and has a narrative of purging the new name. Second, ‘Shinmyungpuri’ contains the ‘Function of Purification to relieve repressed Emotions through Art’. Third, ‘immersion and improvisation’ and ‘liberation and purification of emotions’ were derived as the elements for solving the new name. It is hoped that this study will be helpful in studying the worldview of Shinmyeong inherent in our traditional dance.Key Words: Han Yeong-suk-ryu Seungmu, Shinmyeongpuri, Serenity and Simplicity, Liberation and Purification, Immersion and Improvisation

AB  - The study aims were to evaluate a machine-learning, algorithm-based, forest biomass-estimation model to estimate subnational forest biomass and to comparatively analyze REDD+ forest reference emission levels. Time-series Landsat satellite imagery and ESA Biomass Climate Change Initiative information were used to build a machine-learning- based biomass estimation model. The k-nearest neighbors algorithm (kNN), which is a non-parametric learning model, and the tree-based random forest (RF) model were applied to the machine-learning algorithm, and the estimated biomasses were compared with the forest reference emission levels (FREL) data, which was provided by the Paraguayan government.The root mean square error (RMSE), which was the optimum parameter of the kNN model, was 35.9, and the RMSE of the RF model was lower at 34.41, showing that the RF model was superior. As a result of separately using the FREL, kNN, and RF methods to set the reference emission levels, the gradient was set to approximately -33,000 tons, -253,000 tons, and -92,000 tons, respectively. These results showed that the machine learning-based estimation model was more suitable than the existing methods for setting reference emission levels.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper tried to examine the worldview of the Qumran community through the War Scroll (1QM), the most detailed war manual in the Jewish literature of the Second Temple Period. The War Scroll is an important document that presents the transition from the holy war ideology of the Old Testament to the apocalyptic eschatological concept of war. The War Scroll shows how the Qumran community perceived the world around them and what future they expected. The War Scroll appears to be a work that maximizes and visualizes the idea of YHWH's Day and the holy war in the Old Testament. This paper attempted to trace the worldview that the Qumran community intends to present through war by examining the characteristic elements in the War Scroll. In this paper, the 'apocalyptic eschatological worldview,’ 'dualistic worldview and War against the Kittim,’ and 'last judgment, apocalyptic war, and resurrection’ are presented separately for convenience of discussion. Still, they are inextricably linked with each other. The War Scroll maintains the frame of 'eschatological hope' in that it expects the time of imminent salvation. The apocalyptic texts of the Old Testament dream of a new earth, new heaven, and a new Jerusalem as the present order is radically changed due to God's supernatural intervention. This eschatological hope is also strongly expressed in the War Scroll. The War Scroll testifies to how the Qumran community viewed Rome for approximately 30 years, from 60 to 30 BCE. They expect an empire like the Kittim to be destroyed only through God's supernatural intervention. However, their expectations were never met shortly.

AB  - This researcher has considered Han Won-jin and Lee Gan’s theory of personality and their recognition on subjects and others. In the ideological background, this author has revealed that there exists the possibility of dualistic interpretation and a logical gap within the recognition of subjects and others found in Confucius-Mencius Confucianism or Chu-tzu’s Neo-Confucianism. Also, in the early and mid-18th century when Han Won-jin and Lee Gan worked actively, there were both political and social changes internally and externally, for instance, Qing’s growth as an East Asian hegemon, cultural influences, or the introduction of Western products of civilization and studies. This led to the collapse of existing values and worldviews, and it was the era of sprouting when a modern sense of self was formed. In this background, as the Theory of Debate over whether the Character of Humans and Animals is the Same or Different (人物性同異論) was not just academic arguments but a matter combined with both political and social backgrounds, this researcher has insisted that it is necessary to understand subjects and others by linking them with whether to comply with the existing conservative worldview or induce a new worldview.Compared to Lee Gan’s, Han Won-jin’s perception of subjects and others highly tends to emphasize distinction between humans and animals and humans’ superior sense of subjects. This was also directly associated with the advocacy of the differential ruling structure where distinction between Gunja, Soin, Yangban, and Sangmin (slaves) should be strictly observed. The ideology worked as this external view: ‘Moral people (Seongin, Gunja, Junghwa, and Sojunghwa) should at the forefront correct the wrong world dominated by animals (average people, petty people, and people from Qing, Japan, and the West).’ Moreover, this perspective was generally developed into Wijeongcheoksapa (衛正斥邪波) at the end of Joseon.On the other hand, the perception of subjects and others of the Nakron School centered on Lee Gan reveals more flexible recognition on equality and more opened perception on others compared to Han Won-jin’s. Therefore, as it was wary of Horon’s excessive discernment and affirmed humans’ moral subjectivity, it attempted to overcome the crisis in the order of feudal control with a relatively open social view and world view. For this flexible and equal view of others, the Bukhak School that advocated active exchanges with Qing could be born in some part of Nakron, and it could develop into the Enlightenment School that supported exchanges with the West and Japan.Within the perception of subjects and others ground on the theory of personality lasting for more than 200 years, Joseon was gradually finding its identity while undergoing value confusion. Han Won-jin and Lee Gan’s theory of personality was not just a meaningless empty talk in this sense but the first start of modern self-awareness to look at oneself objectively from the view of others while Giho Neo-Confucianism was elaborated and deepened logically. It is of great significance in this respect.

T2  - ANCIENT MESOAMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - During the early Colonial period, Native writers, working under the aegis of mendicant friars, composed Christian texts in the Nahuatl language as part of the Roman Catholic Church's efforts to indoctrinate the Indigenous population of New Spain. Yet these Native "ghost-writers" were far from passive participants in the translation of Christianity. Numerous studies since the 1980s have demonstrated how Native writers exerted influence on the presentation of Christianity, in effect "indigenizing" the message and allowing for the persistence of essential elements of the Mesoamerican worldview. This article focuses on descriptions of demons and sinners drawn from Nahuatl-Christian texts and argues that Native writers drew on an ancient Mesoamerican repertoire of imagery involving physical deformity and transgressive behavior (the "monster-clown complex"). In pre-contact times, such imagery was associated with specific figures, including Olmec dwarfs, Maya "fat men," and comic performers attached to the Mexica royal court. In each of these figures, both physical deformity and humor rendered them powerful, liminal beings often referred to as ritual clowns. By drawing upon this "monster-clown complex," Native writers transformed what were intended to be terrifying motivators of conversion into something very different: morally neutral, supernaturally powerful, and ultimately essential members of the Mesoamerican sacred realm.

AB  - Forest stand types maps is fundamental tools for sustainable forest management that needs to be regularly updated. This work aims at the use of satellite images time series and machine learning techniques to automate and improve the efficiency of forest stands maps production. A time series of "sentinel2MSI" satellite images has been classified using supervised classification using various machine learning (ML) algorithms whose effectiveness has been proven in several research studies. The produced stands map, when each type is defined according to conventional criteria, was assessed and gives satisfactory results with a high variability depending on the used classification algorithm. Temporal segmentation of the archive appears to be a feasible and a robust means of increasing information extraction from the Sentinel archive.

M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate pollution threatens the ecological environment, air quality, and public health. Therefore, it has become an increasing concern for the public and governments in recent decades. In this study, a full coverage PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 mu m) estimation strategy is proposed based on spatiotemporal machine learning approaches, including the convolutional neural network with long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) and random forest (RF). The RF estimates PM2.5 by considering the features of a single pixel, while the introduction of the CNN-LSTM (size of 7 X 7X4) assists in exploiting the spatiotemporal correlation of surrounding pixel features. Compared with linear models and empirical spatiotemporal weight methods, our CNN-LSTM+RF avoids the uncertainty and complexity owing to actual measurements of the surrounding sites. In addition, full coverage is achieved using both satellite data and reanalysis data. Results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination ( R-2) of the CNN-LSTM+RF were 12.790 mu g=m(3) and 0.910, respectively, in sample-based cross-validation (CV). From the perspective of the season, the best performance of the CNN-LSTM+RF was found in autumn ( R-2 of 0.915), and the lowest was in summer ( R-2 of 0.848). In the meantime, for the different regions of China, the CNN-LSTM+RF also showed stable performance. The proposed method can generate high-precision continuous PM2.5 distribution maps that provide beneficial support for improving environmental and public health, and provide a reference for using deeper networks.

TI  - MCANet: A Multidimensional Channel Attention Residual Neural Network for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the remote sensing image fusion field, fusion methods based on deep learning (DL) are the latest techniques in panchromatic sharpening (pansharpening). However, existing pansharpening methods based on neural networks cannot adequately inject the spatial feature information of panchromatic (PAN) images into fusion images, and they do not exploit the feature relationships between spatial locations, such as rows and columns of feature maps. To solve these problems, a multidimensional channel attention residual neural network (MCANet) is proposed in this article. To preserve the structural information in PAN images, a two-stream detail injection (TSDI) module is proposed, and the local skip connection operation is adopted to mine more spectral and structural information. A multidimensional channel attention (MCA) module is also designed to enable the network to learn the nonlinear mapping relationships between image spatial locations. In addition, a multiscale feature fusion (MSFF) module is designed to improve feature representation in the image fusion process, which is conducive to improving the pansharpening effect. The experimental results on the WorldView-2 (WV-2), GaoFen-2 (GF-2), and QuickBird (QB) datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both visually and quantitatively.

TI  - MHANet: A Multiscale Hierarchical Pansharpening Method With Adaptive Optimization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the powerful nonlinear modeling capability of convolutional neural networks (CNN) has led to an increasing number of researchers focusing on deep-learning-based pansharpening methods. However, due to the diversity of remote sensing image features and the limitations of the convolution operation, the existing methods are still inadequate in restoring the spatial details of complex remote sensing scenes. Therefore, in this article, we propose a simple and effective network for pansharpening methods. Specifically, in our hierarchical feature integration architecture, a multiscale grouping dilated block is designed to adequately capture fine-grained representations of multilevel scale features. At the same time, we propose a spatially self-attention block to adaptively improve the feature extraction process by establishing associations between features. The above blocks are connected in a hierarchical design, with selective reuse of features between layers and a good ability to explore new levels of features while reusing low-level features. Our experiments with the GaoFen-2 satellite dataset, WorldView-2 satellite dataset, and WorldView-3 satellite dataset show that our proposed method is highly competitive with the existing excellent methods in both objective indicator evaluation and subjective visual evaluation.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to make the fused multispectral images preserve the spectral information of the original Low-Resolution Multi-Spectral (LRMS) images as much as possible, and improve the spatial resolution effectively, a new pan-sharpening method based on multi-stream architecture and multi-scale is proposed. Firstly, This paper inputs the original MS image into the spectral feature extraction subnet to obtain its spectral features, and extracts the multi-directional gradient information and spatial structure information from the panchromatic images by the gradient operator and the convolution kernel. Then the extracted feature is added into the pyramid module with multi-stream fusion architecture for image reconstruction. The pyramid module is composed of multiple backbone networks, which can perform feature extraction under different spatial receptive fields, and can learn image information at multiple scales. Finally, a spatial spectrum prediction subnet is constructed to fuse the high-level features output by the pyramid module and the low-level features of the network front end to obtain multispectral images with high spatial resolution. Experiments on images obtained by WorldView-3 satellites show that the fusion images generated by the proposed method are superior to the most of advanced remote sensing image pan-sharpening methods in both subjective visual and objective evaluation indicators.

AB  - This study employed a data fusion method to extract the high-similarity time series feature index of a dataset through the integration of MS (Multi-Spectrum) and SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images. The farmlands are divided into small pieces that consider the different behaviors of farmers for their planting contents in Taiwan. Hence, the conventional image classification process cannot produce good outcomes. The crop phenological information will be a core factor to multi-period image data. Accordingly, the study intends to resolve the previous problem by using three different SPOT6 satellite images and nine Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture radar images, which were used to calculate features such as texture and indicator information, in 2019. Considering that a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) index (i) can integrate different image data sources, (ii) can integrate data of different lengths, and (iii) can generate information with time characteristics, this type of index can resolve certain classification problems with long-term crop classification and monitoring. More specifically, this study used the time series data analysis of DTW to produce "multi-scale time series feature similarity indicators". We used three approaches (Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Decision Tree) to classify paddy patches into two groups: (a) the first group did not apply a DTW index, and (b) the second group extracted conflict predicted data from (a) to apply a DTW index. The outcomes from the second group performed better than the first group in regard to overall accuracy (OA) and kappa. Among those classifiers, the Neural Network approach had the largest improvement of OA and kappa from 89.51, 0.66 to 92.63, 0.74, respectively. The rest of the two classifiers also showed progress. The best performance of classification results was obtained from the Decision Tree of 94.71, 0.81. Observing the outcomes, the interference effects of the image were resolved successfully by various image problems using the spectral image and radar image for paddy rice classification. The overall accuracy and kappa showed improvement, and the maximum kappa was enhanced by about 8%. The classification performance was improved by considering the DTW index.

AB  - In this paper, we refine a previously developed forest height inversion and mosaicking approach that fuses spaceborne repeat-pass L-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and limited lidar data that serve as training samples. In particular, with the availability of spaceborne lidar training samples from NASA's GEDI mission, the previous inversion approach has been adapted to use the sparsely distributed but extensive GEDI lidar data as local training dataset, so that the inverted height estimates are better tuned to match the local lidar data without making assumptions such as constant scene-wide mean behavior of temporal changes. The refined inversion approach is validated at the Howland Forest in Central Maine, US by using JAXA's ALOS/ALOS-2 InSAR data combined with NASA's GEDI lidar data, where the inverted height estimates are compared against NASA's LVIS lidar dataset that serve as ground truth. This refined inversion approach is a potential fusion scheme of the future spaceborne repeat-pass L-band InSAR and lidar missions (e.g. NASA's NISAR and GEDI, JAXA's ALOS-4 and MOLI, and China's LT-1 and TECIS-1).

TI  - Evaluation of a satellite drought indicator approach and its potential for agricultural drought prediction and crop loss assessment. The case of BEACON project
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT AND INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - BEACON is a market-led project that couples earth observation (EO) with weather intelligence to deliver a toolbox for timely, cost-efficient and actionable insights for the agricultural insurance (AgI) sector. This paper provides an approach based on MODIS NDVI anomaly (NDVIA), implemented in the operational workflow of BEACON that can be used by AgI companies to improve the prediction and crop loss assessment due to drought. The aim of the study was to demonstrate the feasibility of evaluating drought impact on wheat and barley crops at parcel level, exploiting the long historical MODIS NDVI records. Correlation analysis and machine learning were used to understand the relationship between a satellite-based drought indicator and (non-)damaged parcel yield data. The moderately strong correlation results highlight the complexity in determining the crop loss in the case of drought, by taking only into account the seasonal evolution of widely used satellite derived indices, such as NDVI/NDVIA.

TI  - Spreading and accumulation of river-borne sediments in the coastal ocean after the environmental disaster at the Doce River in Brazil
T2  - OCEAN AND COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is focused on the fate of a large volume of mine slurry discharged from the Doce River (DR) to the coastal ocean after the worst environmental disaster in Brazilian which occurred in November 2015. We used Eulerian (ROMS) and Lagrangian (STRiPE) numerical models, as well as satellite remote sensing data, to study the spreading and seafloor accumulation of fine river-borne sediments during the initial six months following the disaster. We show that the regions of intense sediment accumulation were determined by spreading patterns of the surface-advected DR plume. The river discharge rate governed the plume surface area, while its position depended on local wind forcing conditions. The spreading of sediments carried by the DR plume was dominated by southward transport caused by prevailing upwelling-favorable northeasterly winds during the study period. Under high discharge conditions, river-borne sediments were transported over 100 km southward from the DR mouth and reached the outer shelf. In contrast, sediments were arrested near the mouth during drought periods and remained on the inner shelf. As a result, fine river-borne sediments accumulated on the seafloor, mainly in the large shallow shelf area southward from the DR mouth. Conversely, only a small fraction of residue was deposited northward. Thus, the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) of Costa das Algas, located 40 km southward from the DR, potentially exhibited more susceptibility to sediment arrival. On the other hand, their influence on Abrolhos Marine National Park, located 200 km northeastward from the DR mouth, was presumably minimal.

TI  - Urban Canyon in the CBD of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil): Thermal Profile of Avenida Rio Branco during Summer
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to evaluate the thermal field of the central business district (CBD) of Rio de Janeiro during summer from land surface temperature (LST) and the thermal characteristics of the urban canopy layer (UCL) of the urban canyon in Avenida Rio Branco. In order to conduct this evaluation, two methods were employed: (1) TIRS Landsat-8 sensor for data selection and processing (latest generation, 2011-2020); (2) a field survey using nine sampling points-seven along two mobile transects, one fixed point, and one vertical measurement point, which required the use of an RPA (remotely piloted aircraft). Three categories of analysis were established for the field survey based on the prevailing synoptic situations: stability, instability, and post-instability. The CBD is characterized by extensive areas with surface heat islands, in which temperatures were higher than 38.9 degrees C; the areas with milder LSTs were Campo do Santana, Avenida Rio Branco, and one of the mixed-use zones (Praca Maua). With respect to Rio Branco Avenue, the LST niches of lowest elevation were derived through building shadowing; however, due to the nature of the data, the orbital data diverged from the observation data of the 10 field-study days. In situ data revealed that the characteristics urban morphology of Avenida Rio Branco, by contrast with the LST result, is susceptible to the formation of atmospheric heat islands, presenting heat islands of very strong magnitude (over 6.1 degrees C) in atmospheric stability, strong magnitude (4.1-6.0 degrees C) in atmospheric instability, and moderate magnitude (2.1-4.0 degrees C) in post-atmospheric instability. Despite the synoptic situation, thermal cores were concentrated at 1 p.m. The intersection between Avenida Rio Branco, Rua do Ouvidor, and Praca Maua stored most of the solar energy received during the day due to the greater sky obstruction caused by the verticalization. Finally, vertical analysis demonstrated the formation of a thermal inversion on the night of the highest mean air temperature (29.5 degrees C), probably due to the roughness and number of buildings in the urban canyon.

TI  - PARALINGUISTIC MEANS OF DESCRIBING THE BEHAVIOR OF A LYING CHARACTER (BASED ON THE MATERIAL OF GERMAN-LANGUAGE LITERATURE)
T2  - YAZYK I KULTURA-LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the non-verbal behavioral code of a lying character, identifies and characterizes its various types in the texts of German-language fiction. The introduction outlines the reasons for the interest of linguists in the study of the non-verbal behavior of the characters of a work of art in a situation of lies, actualizes the role of non-verbal means that demonstrate the character's inner world and condition the reader's perception. Methodological approaches are determined that allow analyzing the interaction of a lying character in the aspect of non-verbal semiotics. The purpose of the study is to describe the specifics of the linguistic representation of a non- verbal portrait of a lying character. In the main part, the concept of a "lying character" is substantiated, the evolution of a lying character in German-language fiction is studied, the main components of the model of non-verbal behavior of a lying character are established. A table showing the correlation of the non-verbal code with the type of the lying character (emotive/adaptive/ regulatory) in the work is presented. The material of the research is the literary works of German-speaking writers of the XX-XXI centuries. Verification of lexical nominations and subsequent correlation of non-verbal markers with the characteristics of the type of a lying character is carried out using the example of 100 dialogical fragments. A detailed analysis of non-verbal components with explication of kinesic, prosodic and ocular markers is presented. It has been demonstrated that the image of a lying character is one of the most common in artistic discourse. Decoding of the non-verbal behavioral code and portrait characteristics of a liar is possible only taking into account the factors of the historical and sociocultural continuum. In conclusion, it is noted that the lying character is the subject of emotional experience, whose non-verbal behavior in the situation of uttering a lie is manifested through certain linguistic and plot-compositional means of the author's narration. The choice of a non-verbal code (kinesic, prosodic, ocular) when describing the behavior of a lying character by the author is conditioned by the author's personal experience, his worldview and knowledge of the reader's interpretive activity. The emotive type of a lying character is explicated by the author through such non-verbal components as a raised tone of voice and play with the eyes. The manifestation of a message with a false connotation by an adaptive character type is accompanied by a low, even tone, which is a kind of compensation for the character's restraint in gestures and movements, as well as through ocular non-verbal markers. Ocular non-verbal markers are actualized by the author through adjectives that concretize and describe the look of the lying character. Visual modifications serve as an effective means of manipulation and achievement of the intended pragmatic goal for the adaptive type of lying character. The non-verbal behavior of the lying character of the regulatory type is noticeably reflected in the kinetic markers. This type of lying character encodes his emotions very successfully. The determining factor in the image of a regulatory type character is his "gestures" and "bodily modulations". The dialogue thread of literary heroes-deceivers is replete with kinetic gestures, used by them for self-defense and confirmation of "imaginary" truthfulness.The created model of non-verbal behavior of a lying character can be used in courses on literary studies, discursive pragmatics, language psychology, linguistic expertology and other interdisciplinary areas.

TI  - Enhanced Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval at High Spatial Resolution From the Integration of Satellite Observations and Soil Pedotransfer Functions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Trapezoidal configurations constituted by land surface temperature and fractional vegetation cover have been frequently used to estimate surface soil moisture (SSM). Determination of the SSM status over the trapezoidal dry and wet edges is required to decouple the volumetric SSM content from the trapezoid-derived M-0 because of the coupling of volumetric SSM content and soil texture (i.e., soil moisture availability, M-0). Currently, soil hydraulic characteristics generated from soil pedotransfer functions (PTFs) provide a preferred solution for describing the SSM status over trapezoidal dry and wet edges; however, most PTFs have been developed from laboratory-based soil measurements that have not been fully integrated into remote sensing models for SSM retrieval. This study investigated a practical calibration approach for PTF-derived soil hydraulic characteristics to enhance SSM retrieval using these trapezoidal configurations. Three years of high-resolution SSM measurements were estimated using trapezoidal configurations with Landsat-8 data over a semiarid network in Spain. For the uncalibrated trapezoid, fair accuracy with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.062 m(3)/m(3) and a bias of 0.040 m(3)/m(3) was achieved when compared with in situ measurements. Furthermore, a practical PTF-calibration approach with local measurements was proposed and subsequently integrated into the trapezoid to obtain SSM values. Our results indicated enhanced SSM estimates with an RMSE of 0.050 m(3)/m(3) and a bias of 0.012 m(3)/m(3) with the calibrated PTF. Finally, we found that the calibrated trapezoid can eliminate overestimation and underestimation when the SSM was lower or higher, respectively, which occurred frequently for optical SSM retrievals.

AB  - Aiming at the needs and difficulties of shallow bathymetry in sea areas lacking in-situ depth information, taking Dongdao Island of Xisha Islands as an example, the active-passive fusion bathymetry using ICESat-2 photon counting lidar and WorldView-2 optical remote sensing image based on GRU deep learning model is studied. First, tidal corrections are carried out separately for multi-track ICESat-2 data, and the depth data are obtained through signal point extraction and refraction correction. Then, taking the depth data as control points, the GRU deep learning model is applied to carry out water depth inversion in the study area. The experiments show that the MAE and MRE of the bathymetric inversion for the whole area are 1.1m and 17.3% respectively. Furthermore, the MAE and MRE are 1.3m and 19.3% in a local area without Lidar data. Active-passive fusion bathymetry based on GRU model can provide a new means for shallow water depth detection.

TI  - Comparison between oil spill images and look-alikes: an evaluation of SAR-derived observations of the 2019 oil spill incident along Brazilian waters
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Three SAR-derived observations of dark surface patches along the Northeastern Brazilian coastline by the end of 2019 were misreported in the Brazilian media as oil spill-related. Unfortunately, these observations were misled by false positives or lookalikes. Therefore, this paper aims to technically evaluate these look-alike classes by analyzing image attributes found to be helpful to the identification of ocean targets, including oil spills, rain cells, biofilms, and low wind conditions. We use image augmentation to extend our dataset size and create the probability density function curves. The processing includes image segmentation, optimal attribute extraction, and classification with random forest classifiers. Our results contrast with the open-source oil spill detection system and patch classifier methodology called "RIOSS." Analysis of the feature probability density functions based on optimal attributes is promising since we could capture most of the false positive targets in the three SAR-reported images in 2019. The only exception was the biofilm slick observed on October 28th, where the RIOSS mistakenly classified this organic patch as a low wind region with oil spots. This pitfall is acceptable at this project stage since we had only five biogenic film samples to train the algorithm.

TI  - The Icon Motif in "Standing , a Short Novel ('Povest')" by Archpriest Nikolai Agafonov
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the role of the icon motif in "Standing," a short novel ('povest') by Archpriest Nikolai Agafonov. The authors analyze the features of the work that allow to categorize it as Orthodox fiction: the spiritual evolution of the characters, the search for the Creator, the appeal to the Church, the moral crisis and overcoming this crisis. In addition, portrayal of the miracle is analyzed along with a wide range of reactions of the characters who witnessed the incident. The Kuibyshev miracle is considered in the historical, cultural and literary contexts: the characteristics of the era are investigated, a connection is established between "Standing" by Nikolai Agafonov and other works of art dedicated to this event. There is also an undeniable ideological and artistic similarity between the description of Zoya's standing in this work, and Byzantine and Old Russian legends about the punishment of an iconoclast or blasphemer by a miraculous icon. As a result of the study, the authors conclude that the icon motive in the work is closely related to the motives of physical and spiritual healing, the salvation of the human soul, and its connection with the Creator. A motivational prayer / standing complex emerges in the short novel ('povest'), and standing itself is viewed as a sincere, albeit wordless prayer addressed to God and capable of initiating a person's inner transformation. In this sense, the incident that happened to the girl is perceived not so much as a punishment for the sin of blasphemy, but primarily as a call of the Savior to repentance, addressed both to Zoya and to numerous witnesses of the incident. The figurative system of the short novel ('povest') includes characters who are ready to accept this call and embark on the path of spiritual evolution, as well as persons incapable of revising their own materialistic worldview.

TI  - Language Indices of Unity and Animosity
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Review
AB  - The results of the implementation of the scientific project "The Semantics of Unity and Animosity in Russian Lexis and Phraseology: Language System and Discourse" supported by the Russian Science Foundation are presented. It is based on the thesis that language acts as a way of indexing referents - realities and ideas about reality. The semantic-motivational approach to the study of the vocabulary and phraseology of unity and enmity confirms that the ways of conceptualizing reality are characterized by regular reproducibility. The study of the semantics of words, especially in the context of changes in the lexical composition of the Russian, one way or another affects not only linguistic, but also worldview issues. The examples show that a linguistic unit "alone" can serve as a cultural sign if it is highly specific for a historical era. The study of arrays of new words is recognized as informative for solving the applied problem of monitoring sociocultural transformations. It is reported that the executors of the project have prepared "A Dictionary of Actual Vocabulary of Unity and Animosity in the Russian at the Beginning of the 21st Century" (2021) and "1000 Words of Unity and Animosity at the Beginning of the 21st Century: An Ideographic Dictionary" (2022).

TI  - Is Routine Intraoperative Frozen Section Analysis of Sentinel Lymph Nodes Necessary in Every Early-Stage Breast Cancer?
T2  - BREAST CANCER-TARGETS AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Clinical application of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial results allows clinically node-negative breast cancer patients who meet criteria to avoid axillary dissection even when 1-2 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) are positive for metastatic disease. Intraoperative frozen section (iFS) analyses of SLNs were thought to reduce re-operation rates despite variable reported sensitivity and possibility of a false negative result. This study evaluated the rate of re-operations prevented by SLN iFS in a tertiary care hospital in Bangkok, Thailand, over a 6-year time-frame.Patients and Methods: From April 2016 to April 2022, 1284 sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) procedures were performed. Of these, 214 cases were breast-conserving surgery in accordance with the ACOSOG criteria with concomitant usage of iFS. Clinicopathological features of these cases were collected and analyzed. Re-operation rates prevented by the additional intervention were reported. Results: Only five additional operations were prevented with the usage of 214 iFS. The discordance rate between frozen and permanent sections in terms of presence of metastatic disease and number of total lymph nodes was around 15%. Tumor staging, node staging, Nottingham histologic grading and lymphovascular invasion are significant predictors of SLN metastasis.Conclusion: iFS results in a very low prevention rate for follow-up ALND in patients with preoperative clinically negative axillary nodes and is associated with a non-negligible discordance rate with permanent sections. Our study suggests iFS may be avoided in most cases of early-stage clinically and radiographically node-negative breast cancer patients. Doing so may reduce surgical costs and total operative time without a significant impact on the overall quality of treatment and standard of care.

TI  - STRUCTURAL, GEOPHYSICAL AND GEOCHEMICAL CRITERIA FOR EPITHERMAL HIGH-SULFIDATION GOLD MINERALIZATION ON THE EXAMPLE OF SVETLOE ORE FIELD (KHABAROVSKIY KRAY)
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE TOMSK POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY-GEO ASSETS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the research. Poor knowledge and economic attractiveness make the problem of forecasting and prospecting for epithermal high-sulfidation gold-silver deposits within the volcanogenic belts of the Russian Federation topical.The main goal of the work was to develop criteria for forecasting and prospecting for epithermal acid-sulfate gold mineralization within the Ulinsky trough of the Okhotsk-Chukotka volcanic belt.Methods: interpretation of space materials ASTER, Landsat ETM+, Sentinel and digital elevation model according to Shuttle radar topographic mission data, interpretation of airborne geophysical data of magnetometric and gamma-ray spectroscopic surveys with the construction of structural geological schemes; modeling of geochemical fields using multivariate statisticals methods based on lithochemical data, including rank correlation, factorial and cluster analysis.The following main conclusions: the Svetloe ore field has characteristics typical of epithermal deposits of acid-sulfate gold mineralization: it is located in a volcanic belt, confined to central-type volcanic apparatuses controlled by faults; gold mineralization is accompanied by advanced argillic and quartz altered rocks: secondary quartzites of zonal structure, were drawn. The characteristics of structural control and metasomatic zoning are well defined in interpretation of data from remote sensing, airborne magnetic surveys, and gamma ray spectrometry. Furthermore, the distribution of chemical elements in the secondary stray field makes it possible to establish a concentric zonal structure characteristic of hydrothermal gold deposits, with a spatiotemporal change in geochemical associations from the central zone of ore formation to the periphery at the local level of generalization: Au, Mo.Au, Ag, Pb.K, Na, Al.V, Zn, (Co, Ni, Cr, Mn, P). Moreover, within the mineralized zones, the following sequence of formation of geochemical associations is established (from the central part to the periphery): Au- Ag. Ag, Pb, Sb.As, Mo, Ba.Co, Cr, Mn, V, Zn, P.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF WETLAND DEGRADATION USING GEOSPATIAL TECHNIQUES IN LAKE BOYO, SOUTHERN ETHIOPIA
T2  - Uttar Pradesh Journal of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - Although wetlands occupy less than 6% of the earth's land area, they contribute a lot for ecosystem services than their small area implies. This study aims to model the wetland degradation of Boyo Lake using Geospatial techniques. This study uses Landsat 7 ETM for the year 2000 and 2010 while Landsat 8 OLI used for 2020. The imageries were extracted and geometrically corrected using boundary polygon data using Spatial Analyst Tool in ArcGIS 10.8. Supervised classification was performed using the Maximum Likelihood Classifier. A comparison of land cover statistics assisted in identifying the trend and rate of change at wetland over time. In 2000, water and wetland covered an area of 2743.9 ha (53.3%) and 1680.3 ha (32.7%) of the area, respectively. The analysis shows that water and wetland coverage declined to 1922.9 ha (37.4%) and 1309.4 ha (25.4%) while farmland have increased to 1765.23 ha (34.3%) in 2010. Subsequently, area coverage by water and wetland further declined to 1579.1 (30.7%) and 627.94 (12.21 %) respectively, in 2020. The area under wetland is threatened dramatically with increasing encroachment of farmland over the years. Protecting wetlands from degradation needs the multi-stakeholders involvement and policy enforcement.

AB  - We propose an approach for integrating social media data with physical data from satellites for the prediction of natural disasters. We show that this integration can improve accuracy in disaster management models, and propose a modular system for disaster instance and severity prediction using social media as a data source. The system is designed to be extensible to cover many disaster domains, social media platform streams, and machine learning methods. We additionally present a test case in the domain context of wildfires, using Twitter as a social data source and physical satellite data from the Global Fire Atlas. We show as a proof of concept for the system how this model can accurate predict wildfire attributes based on social media analysis, and also model social media sentiment dynamics over the course of the wildfire event. We outline how this system can be extended to cover wider disaster domains using different types of social media data as an input source, maximising the generalisability of the system.

TI  - Landsat 9 Operational Land Imager2 (OLI2) on-orbit results of new special characterizations
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Operational Land Imager2 (OLI2), is a visible to short-wave infrared pushbroom imaging radiometer. The OLI2 generates data in 9 spectral bands by sub-selecting the operational detectors within the focal plane array for each spectral band. This sub selection of detectors, also known as the operational flight detector-select-map, was determined pre-launch based on various radiometric performance characteristics. Due to new updates made in OLI2 it is possible to repeat similar extended radiometric characterization of all detectors on the focal plane while the system is on-orbit. This new characterization uses the OLI2 on-orbit calibration devices (Shutter and Stim lamp) observations while toggling the detector select maps from the operational setting to cycle through all possible detectors. Another special new ability for OLI2 was the addition of the stim-lamp non-linearity characterization collects. Both of these new abilities have been successfully executed on-orbit. In this paper and presentation, we present the results from these new characterization capabilities that extended the dynamic range of the non-linearity characterization as well as the on-orbit radiometric characteristics for the full set of focal plane detectors. Such new characterizations further enhance the information on the state of health and aging of the focal plane, as well as enable transfer of radiometric calibration from the operational detector-select to any other detector select. Overall these characterizations help to assure a robust high quality radiometric performance of OLI2 that should last far into the mission life time and beyond.

TI  - Retrieval of DTM under Complex Forest Stand Based on Spaceborne LiDAR Fusion Photon Correction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The new generation of satellite-borne laser radar Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data has been successfully used for ground information acquisition. However, when dealing with complex terrain and dense vegetation cover, the accuracy of the extracted understory Digital Terrain Model (DTM) is limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a photon correction data processing method based on ICESat-2 to improve the DTM inversion accuracy in complex terrain and high forest coverage areas. The correction value is first extracted based on the ALOS PALSAR DEM reference data to correct the cross-track photon data of ICESat-2. The slope filter threshold is then selected from the reference data, and the extracted possible ground photons are slope filtered to obtain accurate ground photons. Finally, the impacts of cross-track photon and slope filtering on fine ground extraction from the ICESat-2 data are discussed. The results show that the proposed photon correction and slope filtering algorithms help to improve the extraction accuracy of forest DTM in complex terrain areas. Compared with the forest DTM extracted without the photon correction and slope filtering methods, the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are reduced by 51.90~57.82% and 49.37~53.55%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that photon correction can improve the terrain inversion ability of ICESat-2, while providing a novel method for ground extraction based on ICESat-2 data. It provides a theoretical basis for the accurate inversion of canopy parameters for ICESat-2.

TI  - Mapping Winter Wheat with Optical and SAR Images Based on Google Earth Engine in Henan Province, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate acquisition of winter wheat acreage is crucial for food security. This study investigated the feasibility of extracting the spatial distribution map of winter wheat in Henan Province by using synthetic aperture radar (SAR, Sentinel-1A) and optical (Sentinel-2) images. Firstly, the SAR images were aggregated based on the growth period of winter wheat, and the optical images were aggregated based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS-NDVI) curve. Then, five spectral features, two polarization features, and four texture features were selected as feature variables. Finally, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform was employed to extract winter wheat acreage through the random forest (RF) algorithm. The results show that: (1) aggregated images based on the growth period of winter wheat and sensor characteristics can improve the mapping accuracy and efficiency; (2) the extraction accuracy of using only SAR images was improved with the accumulation of growth period. The extraction accuracy of using the SAR images in the full growth period reached 80.1%; and (3) the identification effect of integrated images was relatively good, which makes up for the shortcomings of SAR and optical images and improves the extraction accuracy of winter wheat.

TI  - Matching Vector Filtering Methods For Sea Ice Motion Detection Using SAR Imagery Feature Tracking
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Applying feature tracking techniques to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery generates high-resolution sea ice motion fields. However, the bad matching vectors still exist after the Nearest Neighbor Distance Ratio test and contaminate the derived motion fields, which need to be identified and filtered out. In this article, we propose two algorithms to eliminate such wrong matching vectors. The first employs the matching results derived by the maximum cross-correlation (MCC) method as the reference motion fields to evaluate such wrong matches. The second method employs the local spatial consistency presumption of sea ice motion fields. A Voronoi diagram is applied to slice the overlapping area of two SAR images into many fractions, and each fraction extends its size 50% outward to calculate the regional mean sea ice flow vector and standard deviation. Any vector within the fraction that exceeds 3 times the regional standard deviation will be recognized as an outlier and filtered out. Two methods are tested to two cases with strong rotation or irregular sea ice motion fields derived from Sentinel-1 imagery. The overall accuracy of our two methods is 93.9% and 98.7%, and they sacrifice 6.12% /1.22% of the correct vectors to filter out 100.0% / 94.12% of the wrong vectors for the MCC referenced filter and Voronoi fragmented filter, respectively.

TI  - LF-CNN: Deep Learning-Guided Small Sample Target Detection for Remote Sensing Classification
T2  - CMES-COMPUTER MODELING IN ENGINEERING & SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Target detection of small samples with a complex background is always difficult in the classification of remote sensing images. We propose a new small sample target detection method combining local features and a convolutional neural network (LF-CNN) with the aim of detecting small numbers of unevenly distributed ground object targets in remote sensing images. The k-nearest neighbor method is used to construct the local neighborhood of each point and the local neighborhoods of the features are extracted one by one from the convolution layer. All the local features are aggregated by maximum pooling to obtain global feature representation. The classification probability of each category is then calculated and classified using the scaled expected linear units function and the full connection layer. The experimental results show that the proposed LF-CNN method has a high accuracy of target detection and classification for hyperspectral imager remote sensing data under the condition of small samples. Despite drawbacks in both time and complexity, the proposed LF-CNN method can more effectively integrate the local features of ground object samples and improve the accuracy of target identification and detection in small samples of remote sensing images than traditional target detection methods.

AB  - The accurate extraction of residential area is of great significance to disaster assessment, urban management, and climate change research. Deep learning-based methods are limited by annotations acquisition and single data source. In this paper, a dual-branch encoder is proposed to extract the features of different inputs, and a multi-attention fusion module is proposed to effectively fuse dual-branch features. Furthermore, we propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture, called the dual-branch fusion network (DBNet). In addition, we propose a large-scale residential area extraction data set (ZRA) containing 43 Ziyuan-3 (ZY3) multi-spectral (MS) and multi-view (MV) images. Experiments on ZRA, our DBNet achieve state-of-the-art performance with a F1 score of 84.6% and an IoU of 73.3%.

TI  - STUDY ON THE SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS AND DRIVING MECHANISMS OF NATURAL SYSTEMS IN THE GANNAN PLATEAU BASED ON TIME-SERIES NDVI-A CASE STUDY OF LUQU COUNTY
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Landsat-NDVI data, this paper explores the spatiotemporal variation and future trends in the NDVI of grassland in Luqu County from 1990-2017 and analyzes the driving mechanisms of the process via trend analysis, the Hurst index, and partial correlation analysis. It is found that (1) the grassland NDVI in Luqu County fluctuated greatly from 1990 to 2017, and there were three time periods when the mean grassland NDVI decreased, from 1994 to 2000, from 2001 to 2007, and from 2015 to 2017, while from 2007 to 2015 the mean grassland NDVI in Luqu County slowly increased; (2) in Luqu County, the overall NDVI pattern of grassland shows the distribution characteristics of low in the central and southwestern regions and high in the northern and eastern regions, with the central low value area mainly located in the area of East Karshen Mountain south of Gaxiu Village of Gahai Township, the southwestern low value area mainly located in the border area with Maqu County, and the high value area located in the northern part of Luqu County and the Taohe River Basin in the east. Vegetation distribution becomes sparser as elevation increases. The mean NDVI value of grassland in the area above 3,800 meters above sea level gradually decreases; (3) the overall fractional vegetation cover of grassland in Luqu County shows an increasing trend, and the area distribution showing increasing trends, decreasing trends, and no significant changes accounts for 81.4%, 15.34%, and 3.26%, respectively. From the spatial distribution characteristics, the areas with significant decreases are mainly distributed around Gahai Lake, Luqu County, the scenic spot of Zecha Stone Forest, Gahai Township of National Highway 213, and the area around the transit section of Langmusi Township; (4) the reverse characteristics of grass vegetation change in Luqu County are stronger than the same-direction characteristics, and the areas with strong reverse characteristics are larger than the areas with strong same-direction characteristics. Therefore, in the future, the grassland NDVI in Luqu County will be under pressure of continuous deterioration; (5) precipitation and temperature are the main influencing factors of the grassland NDVI in Luqu County. The fluctuation in precipitation leads to the fluctuation in grassland coverage, and the increase in temperature has a negative impact on the grassland NDVI in Luqu County; (6) human activities have a two-way impact on the grassland NDVI in Luqu County. The growth in the number of local residents and foreign tourists, the expansion of builtup land, overgrazing, and industrial development have had a negative impact on the grassland NDVI. On the other hand, policy factors have played a positive role in the evolution of grassland coverage since 1990, especially a series of policies to promote grassland ecological protection and sustainable development. Cultivating grass for livestock, returning grazing to grass, ecological protection, herders' settlement, and ecological rewards and subsidies, have greatly improved the relationship between grassland residents and the grassland.

TI  - Identifying the Lineament Structure Cooperatively Using the Airborne Gravimetric, Magnetic, and Remote Sensing Data: A Case Study From the Pobei Area, NW China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of lineament structure plays a vital role in determining the metallogenic area and distribution of the geologic structure. Edge detection methods are mostly used to recognize the lineaments and define the geologic boundaries. Cooperatively using edge detection results of the gravity, magnetic, and remote sensing (RS) data to recognize lineaments would obtain more geologic information. In this article, new edge detectors of potential field derivatives are proposed to determine the sources' boundary, named second tilt derivative, the tilt of vertical derivative, and the normalized second vertical derivative, respectively. Presented approaches are characterized by producing zero amplitude over sources' edges and equalizing anomalies from different depths. Compared with original edge detection techniques, including other second derivative methods, synthetic examples reveal significant superiorities of suggested approaches in providing more accurate and sharper edges and are especially effective in distinguishing superimposed anomalies. The experiments also demonstrate that the normalization of the edge detectors will make images cleaner and geologic edges more easily captured. Applied to airborne gravimetric and magnetic data in the Pobei area (NW China), the proposed methods display more geologic details and lineaments. Canny, Sobel, and Prewitt operators are applied to extract the boundaries of the RS image. Lineaments picked by the three different types of data are combined collectively to get a comprehensive lineaments structure interpretation.

The results showed that it is feasible to estimate T-a,T-cloudy using CTT and CTH, especially for low and middle cloud conditions. Linear and neural network (NN)-based T-a,T-cloudy estimation models were constructed and validated using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) CTT, CTH, and GFS T-air for summer 2017 and 2018. The NN model performs better than the linear model, and GFS T-air can obviously improve the accuracy of T-a,T-cloudy estimation. The correlation coefficient (R), root-mean-square error (RMSE), and bias of the NN model with GFS T-air were 0.953, 1.950 degrees C, and -0.030 degrees C, respectively. The estimation model performed better under low and warm clouds than high and cold cloud conditions.

TI  - Quantifying the response of surface urban heat island to urbanization using the annual temperature cycle model
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island (UHI), driving by urbanization, plays an important role in urban sustainability under climate change. However, the quantification of UHI's response to urbanization is still challenging due to the lack of robust and continuous temperature and urbanization datasets and reliable quantification methods. This study proposed a framework to quantify the response of surface UHI (SUHI) to urban expansion using the annual temperate cycle model. We built a continuous annual SUHI series at the buffer level from 2003 to 2018 in the Jing-jn-ji region of China using MODIS land surface temperature and imperviousness derived from Landsat. We then investigated the spatiotemporal dynamic of SUHI under urban expansion and examined the underlying mechanism. Spatially, the largest SUHI interannual variations occurred in suburban areas compared to the urban center and rural areas. Temporally, the increase in SUHI under urban expansion was more significant in daytime compare to nighttime. We found that the seasonal variation of SUHI was largely affected by the seasonal variations of vegetation in rural areas and the interannual variation was mainly attributed to urban expansion in urban areas. Additionally, urban greening led to the decrease in summer daytime SHUT in central urban areas. These findings deepen the understanding of the long-term spatiotemporal dynamic of UHI and the quantitative relationship between UHI and urban expansion, providing a scientific basis for prediction and mitigation of UHI.

TI  - Adaptive Material Matching for Hyperspectral Imagery Destriping
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to instrument instability, slit contamination, and light interference, hyperspectral images often suffer from striping artifacts, which greatly impairs the data quality. Real hyperspectral data are usually characterized by a small amount of historical data, complex material distribution, insignificant periodicity of noise, and so on, which brings significant challenges for the destriping task. However, the assumptions made by traditional destriping methods are often inconsistent with these characteristics. To this end, we propose a novel destriping method based on adaptive material matching (MAM) without making explicit assumptions of hyperspectral data. Specifically, to identify pixels that belong to the same material, we propose a principal material analysis (PMA) to adaptively generate thresholds within each superpixel. The pixels are matched by thresholding their vertical gradients and leveraging both inner stripe gradient feature (ISGF) and neighbor-stripe geometry feature (NSGF). Correction pixels selected from the same material can then be used to calculate the offsets and gains of pixels to adjust adjacent columns. To further improve the stability of the destriping process, we generate a set of correction candidates for each column and select the optimal candidate by considering the prior distribution and destriping nonuniformity. The stripe noise within the whole image is finally removed by iteratively performing the correction between adjacent columns. We compare the proposed model against traditional and deep learning methods on both synthetic and real hyperspectral images. The promising results indicate that MAM can effectively remove the image stripes, retain original image information, and improve the nonuniformity.

AB  - Due to the influence of clouds and other factors on radiometers operating in the optical and infrared bands, satellite data of sea surface temperature (SST) usually has large areas missing. This will have a severe impact on its application. In this study, Data Interpolation Empirical Orthogonal Function (DINEOF) method was applied to reconstruct the missing values of SST in a region in Southeast Asia. The DINEOF was used to the 2019 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua L3 SST data, and its accuracy was assessed by comparing Argo data, satellite data, and reconstructed data. And Argo data was used to correct the reconstructed data. The corrected Std and RMSE were 0.3992 and 0.3951, respectively.

AB  - In the field of satellite-based microwave remote sensing, the classification of microwave observation data according to weather conditions is an important data preprocessing step in both dealing with the forward and inverse problems, which directly affects the application of observation data and the development of microwave remote sensing theory. This study designed to use the microwave radiative transfer model to classify the simulation accuracy of the observed data for the data classification preprocessing in the forward problem. And the corresponding clear-sky thresholds under clearsky conditions are established. The experimental results show that the clear-sky data selection method for microwave remote sensing data based on the radiative transfer model has higher classification accuracy than the classification method using third-party data sources, and the operation is easy and promising for the operational meteorological application.

AB  - FY-3D MERSI carries a medium-resolution imaging spectrometer, the second-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite Feng Yun III D. At present, the fire monitoring algorithm of FY-3D MERSI mainly adopts the threshold method, the contextual method and the temporal phase method, and the above methods face greater difficulties in small fire point identification, in addition, it is easy to generate a large number of pseudo-fire point pixels. In this paper, the method of FY-3D MERSI is improved, and the multi-temporal method is proposed to determine the fire points by calculating the multi-temporal temperature difference, which effectively reduces the fire point identification problem caused by spatial heterogeneity. The problem of pseudo-fire point identification due to spatial heterogeneity is effectively reduced. In this paper, six study areas were selected globally for testing. The results show that the fire point identification accuracy of the improved fire point detection algorithm is significantly improved.

TI  - Thin Cloud Removal Fusing Full Spectral and Spatial Features for Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral remote sensing images are widely used for monitoring the globe. Although thin clouds can affect all optical bands, the influences of thin clouds differ with band wavelength. When processing multispectral bands at different resolutions, many methods only remove thin clouds in visible/near-infrared bands or rescale multiresolution bands to the same resolution and then process them together. The former cannot make full use of multispectral information, and in the latter, the rescaling process will introduce noise. In this article, a deep-learning-based thin cloud removal method that fuses full spectral and spatial features in original Sentinel-2 bands is proposed, named CR4S2. A multi-input and output architecture is designed for better fusing information in all bands and reconstructing the background at original resolutions. In addition, two parallel downsampling residual blocks are designed to transfer features extracted from different depths to the bottom of the network. Experiments were conducted on a new globally distributed Sentinel-2 thin cloud removal dataset called WHUS2-CRv. The results show that the best averaged peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index measurement, normalized root-mean-square error, and spectral angle mapper of the proposed method over 12 bands in all 20 testing images were 39.55, 0.9443, 0.0245, and 2.5676 degrees, respectively. Compared with baseline methods, the proposed CR4S2 method can better restore not only the spatial features but also spectral features. This indicates that the proposed method is very promising for removing thin clouds in multispectral remote sensing images at different resolutions.

TI  - A Lightweight Deep Learning-Based Cloud Detection Method for Sentinel-2A Imagery Fusing Multiscale Spectral and Spatial Features
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are a very important factor in the availability of optical remote sensing images. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based cloud detection methods have surpassed classical methods based on rules and physical models of clouds. However, most of these deep models are very large, which limits their applicability and explainability, while other models do not make use of the full spectral information in multispectral images, such as Sentinel-2. In this article, we propose a lightweight network for cloud detection, fusing multiscale spectral and spatial features (CD-FM3SFs) and tailored for processing all spectral bands in Sentinel-2A images. The proposed method consists of an encoder and a decoder. In the encoder, three input branches are designed to handle spectral bands at their native resolution and extract multiscale spectral features. Three novel components are designed: a mixed depthwise separable convolution (MDSC) and a shared and dilated residual block (SDRB) to extract multiscale spatial features, and a concatenation and sum (CS) operation to fuse multiscale spectral and spatial features with little calculation and no additional parameters. The decoder of CD-FM3SF outputs three cloud masks at the same resolution as input bands to enhance the supervision information of small, middle, and large clouds. To validate the performance of the proposed method, we manually labeled 36 Sentinel-2A scenes evenly distributed over mainland China. The experiment results demonstrate that CD-FM3SF outperforms traditional cloud detection methods and state-of-the-art DL-based methods in both accuracy and speed.

AB  - The point source target (PST) can provide high object and image positioning accuracy and is expected to play an important role in the precise geometric processing of optical remote sensing sensors in the future. This paper proposes a method for intelligently recognizing PST image control points (ICPs) from satellite imagery, which can improve the intelligent level of geometric processing of optical remote sensing sensors. Two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), Faster R-CNN and CenterNet are selected to complete the recognition task. Due to the lack of training data, a large number of simulated samples are generated considering the PST image characteristics. The simulated and real PST ICPs are then used to test the trained DCNNs. The two DCNNs complete the recognition task on the simulated dataset successfully. The Recall and Precision values of the two DCNNs are close to 100%. The performance of the two DCNNs on real PST ICPs is worse than that on the simulated data, but the recognition task is also well completed when the quality of PST ICPs is good. The Recall values of both models are above 95%, and the Precision values are close to 100%. Experiment results also show that the performance of CenterNet is better than Faster R-CNN and the image quality has a great impact on the recognition performance.

AB  - Snow on sea ice is a sensitive indicator of climate change and is considered a key reason for amplified warming in the Arctic. The passive microwave remote sensing is an important method for Snow Depth (SD) observation. Therefore, understanding the influence of SD on observed brightness temperature (TB) is necessary for SD retrieval using microwave radiometer. Taking the FengYun-3D/Microwave Radiation Imager (FY3D/MWRI) as an example, this paper simulates the influence of SD on observed TBs from different channels using the MicroWave MODel (MWMOD) in the Arctic. Several conditions are considered for both first year ice (FYI) and multi-year ice (MYI), including various sea ice concentrations and water vapor contents in the atmosphere. The correlation between SD and TB is also briefly analyzed. It provides a theoretical reference for the retrieval of SD using microwave radiometer.

AB  - We propose a novel remote sensing image registration method based on the deep learning regression network. Different from the traditional methods of feature extraction and feature matching, we pair the image blocks from sensed and reference images, and then directly learn the displacement parameters of the four corners of the sensed image block relative to the reference image. In addition, we develop the dual deep learning network with weight sharing to fully extract the registration pair image features. The proposed method is tested on different period Landsat-7 and WorldView-3 images and compared with scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), fast and rotated brief (ORB), and other deep learning methods. The proposed method outperforms all the comparing methods.

TI  - InSAR Phase Unwrapping by Deep Learning Based on Gradient Information Fusion
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase unwrapping (PhU) is an important step in interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology. At present, difficulties are encountered when using deep learning to solve the PhU problem because the fringe density of the actual interferogram varies, resulting in an imbalanced class of semantic segmentation. Deep learning cannot completely use gradient information, and it is difficult to address a large number of residues. In this letter, a PhU semantic segmentation model based on gradient information fusion and improved PhaseNet network is proposed to solve the problem of imbalanced classification and error propagation. 21 613 pairs of phase samples are constructed by using simulated and real Sentinel-1 InSAR Data. The experimental results show that the average classification accuracy of the method can reach 97%, and the mean square error is only 0.97. The average processing speed of 256 x 256 slices is only 0.5 s. Compared with the traditional methods and other deep learning methods, this method solves the problem of classification imbalance, and the use of fusion gradient information improves the efficiency of the algorithm as well as reduces the burden of network classification and the error propagation, showing increased robustness in the case of many residues and high fringe density.

AB  - Large ships such as aircraft carriers, frigates, and cruisers are main threats to national security, so all-day ships detection has great martial value. After a ship passed through the sea, a ship wake can be thousands of meters in length and last for a long time. The geographical location and motion parameters of the ship target can be estimated by analyzing the wake. In some remote sensing images, the wake is more visible than the hull. However, the wake does not always exist when the ship is anchored in port, so the hull detection is applied in a wider range of scenarios. This paper summarizes state-of-the-art detection methods for hull and wake, and analyzes the existing problems and the future work by researching literature works. At present, the infrared characteristics of ship are mostly studied based on simulation model, and the wake detection model is established based on simulation image, which lacks the real on-orbit infrared remote sensing data verification. Based on the images of SDGSAT-1 satellite multispectral imager (MII) and thermal imaging spectrometer (TIS), the characteristics of the wakes in visible light and thermal infrared (TIR) bands are analyzed and studied. We aim to provide support for ship monitoring throughout the day based on infrared remote sensing images.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Image generation by the conditional generative adversarial network (CGAN) can provide rich samples for supervised classification tasks. However, the unstable gradient updating problem makes it difficult to be used for image generation, especially for the high-resolution SAR image. In this letter, an improved residual condition generation network is proposed to enhance the quality of generated images and classification accuracy for hard negative examples. First, a residual convolutional-based block is built to clear the detail texture of different types of targets. Then, the gradient penalty and Wasserstein loss are used as discriminators to improve the similarity between real samples and the intra diversity of a generated images. We test the proposed method on generation and classification of three kinds of commercial ships using C-band 3-m Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR images. Experimental results show that our method can generate high-quality ship samples and achieve good classification accuracy.

TI  - Airborne SAR Radiometric Calibration Based on Improved Sliding Window Integral Method
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - To verify the performance of the high-resolution fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor carried by the Xinzhou 60 remote-sensing aircraft, we used corner reflectors to calibrate the acquired data. The target mechanism in high-resolution SAR images is more complex than it is in low-resolution SAR images, the impact of the point target pointing error on the calibration results is more obvious, and the target echo signal of high-resolution images is more easily affected by speckle noise; thus, more accurate extraction of the point target position and the response energy is required. To solve this problem, this paper introduces image context information and proposes a method to precisely determine the integration region of the corner reflector using sliding windows based on the integral method. The validation indicates that the fully polarimetric SAR sensor on the Xinzhou 60 remote-sensing aircraft can accurately reflect the radiometric characteristics of the ground features and that the integral method can obtain more stable results than the peak method. The sliding window allows the position of the point target to be determined more accurately, and the response energy extracted from the image via the integral method is closer to the theoretical value, which means that the high-resolution SAR system can achieve a higher radiometric calibration accuracy. Additionally, cross-validation reveals that the airborne SAR images have similar quality levels to Sentinel-1A and Gaofen-3 images.

The selective, non-invasive, and real-time diagnosis of metastatic status in SLNs is becoming essential.Methods: Here, we design two lanthanide-doped nanoparticles as a pair of NIR-II ratiometric fluorescence probes, one of which is conjugated with tumor-targeting moiety, while the other is conjugated with PEG as an internal reference. The NIR-II ratiometric fluorescence signal (I1060 nm/I1525 nm) from two well-separated channels were used to identify the tumor-draining SLNs. The precise navigation surgery of metastatic SLNs was performed and we further evaluated their surgery outcomes.Results: The NIR-II ratiometric fluorescence facilitates an ideal fluorescence-guided surgery with only resection of tumor-positive SLNs, thereby avoiding unnecessary removal of the normal SLNs. In addition, our system has a time-saving operation procedure and can be performed under the operation light without altering the appearance of surgical settings. Conclusion: The present study enables non-invasive and real-time detection metastatic status in SLNs with high sensitivity and selectivity. Our investigations will provide a new direction for SLN biopsy and substantially improve cancer surgery outcomes.

TI  - Crop Mapping in the Sanjiang Plain Using an Improved Object-Oriented Method Based on Google Earth Engine and Combined Growth Period Attributes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the scale of rural land transfer has gradually expanded, and the phenomenon of non-grain-oriented cultivated land has emerged. Obtaining crop planting information is of the utmost importance to guaranteeing national food security; however, the acquisition of the spatial distribution of crops in large-scale areas often has the disadvantages of excessive calculation and low accuracy. Therefore, the IO-Growth method, which takes the growth stage every 10 days as the index and combines the spectral features of crops to refine the effective interval of conventional wavebands for object-oriented classification, was proposed. The results were as follows: (1) the IO-Growth method obtained classification results with an overall accuracy and F1 score of 0.92, and both values increased by 6.98% compared to the method applied without growth stages; (2) the IO-Growth method reduced 288 features to only 5 features, namely Sentinel-2: Red Edge1, normalized difference vegetation index, Red, short-wave infrared2, and Aerosols, on the 261st to 270th days, which greatly improved the utilization rate of the wavebands; (3) the rise of geographic data processing platforms makes it simple to complete computations with massive data in a short time. The results showed that the IO-Growth method is suitable for large-scale vegetation mapping.

TI  - Automated Extraction of Lake Water Bodies in Complex Geographical Environments by Fusing Sentinel-1/2 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes are an important component of global water resources. Lake water bodies extraction based on satellite remote sensing mainly utilizes optical or radar data. However, due to the influence of water quality, ground features with low reflectivity, and smooth surface features, it is still challenging to accurately extract water bodies in complex geographic environments. In this work, we proposed a lake water bodies extraction method by fusing Sentinel-1/2 data. Firstly, the proposed method analyzed the difference of the spectral polarization features between water and non-water in complex geographical environment. Then, the spectral polarization and water index were fused to multidimensional features by feature stacking. Finally, support vector machines are used to classify. Six typical lakes (including urban, mountains, and polluted and clean lakes) in China were used to verify the mapping accuracy. The results showed that extracting lake water bodies by fusing Sentinel-1/2 data had a better performance than using optical or radar data solely, all types of lakes achieved better extraction results, the overall accuracy of lake water extraction is improved by 3%, and the error of commission and omission is controlled within 6%. Comparative experiments indicate that combine radar polarization information with spectral information is helpful to improve the accuracy of different types of lakes extraction in complex geographical environment.

AB  - Urban agglomeration is the strongest driving force of national economic development. The formation and development of urban agglomeration is an important feature of modern urbanization process, and it is of great significance to study its spatial expansion and development process for regional sustainable development. Based on the DMSP/OLS nighttime light remote sensing data from 2000 to 2010, this paper uses threshold method to extract the urban built-up area of the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration. The expansion characteristics of urban built-up area in Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration are analysed from three aspects: expansion area, expansion intensity and expansion type. The results show that the urban agglomeration in The Yangtze River Delta is experienced a rapid urban built-up area expansion process during the decade. The proportion of urban built-up area increased from 9.95% to 15.46%, the average nighttime light intensity increased from 10.18 to 23.43, and the type of urban built-up area expansion was filling type.

TI  - Application of the Combined Feature Tracking and Maximum Cross-Correlation Algorithm to the Extraction of Sea Ice Motion Data From GF-3 Imagery
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, an algorithm combining feature tracking and maximum cross-correlation (FT-MCC) for the extraction of sea ice motion (SIM) vectors were applied to Gaofen-3 (GF-3) imagery, filling the gap of SIM extraction using GF-3 imagery. The locally consistent flow field filtering method is proposed to replace the filtering method based on the correlation coefficient threshold in FT-MCC to improve filtering effectiveness of SIM results extracted by FT-MCC. A comparison of the probability density distributions (PDDs) of the correlation coefficients of SIM vectors extracted by FT-MCC from images with different resolutions revealed high reliability for SIM vectors extracted for images with an 80 m spatial resolution. A comparison of the PDDs of the correlation coefficients of SIM vectors obtained from images with different polarization modes showed more reliable SIM vectors were extracted from vertical transmit horizontal receive (VH) polarization images than from corresponding vertical transmit vertical receive (VV) polarization images. The SIM vectors extracted from GF-3 images by two methods (FT(A-KAZE)-MCC and FT(ORB)-MCC) derived from the FT-MCC algorithm were highly consistent in terms of accuracy and reliability. SIM vectors extracted manually and from Sentinel-1 images were used as reference data to verify the SIM results extracted from GF-3 images, for which the uncertainties in the magnitude and direction of the extracted SIM vectors were found to be 0.119 cm/s-0.287 cm/s (103 m/d-248 m/d) and 4.119 degrees-5.930 degrees, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat storage flux, is one of the main drivers of the nocturnal urban heat island effect. However, the complex 3-D building structure makes observations and simulations of difficult. This study observes the 3-D surface radiant temperature of a building in Beijing, China. The element surface temperature method (ESTM) and the half-order (HO) method are compared for simulation using observations. The impact of building structure on and urban heat island intensity (UHII) are also studied. Results show the following. First, s simulated by ESTM and HO are nearly the same for walls. However, the HO method only needs one-layer exterior surface temperature, which has great potential for regional simulation by satellite remote sensing data. Second, during the daytime, s of each facet are significantly different from each other. The maximum observed difference of is up to 452 W/m(2) between the roof and north wall in May 2019. Third, complete is calculated by each facet and area fraction. The relationships between UHII and both 2-D(roof) and 3-D is positively correlated with nocturnal UHII, and 3-D corresponds more closely to UHII with a larger Spearmanx2019;s coefficient This study presents the effect of building structure on heat flux and could provide an insight for future and urban heat island (UHI) studies.

TI  - Characterizing Ancient Channel of the Yellow River From Spaceborne SAR: Case Study of Chinese Gaofen-3 Satellite
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The lower reaches of the ancient Yellow River (AYR) migrated very frequently, like a loong swinging its tail on the land of China. As the origin of Chinese civilization, AYR provided natural conditions for the people to thrive. However, the sediment carried by AYR still has a negative impact on local agricultural production. This letter, based on Gaofen-3, extracted scattering characteristics of archeological anomalies, detecting part of AYR during Song and Jin Dynasties, which was confirmed with field investigations. Then, an adaptive irregular convolution kernel U-Net (AICK-U-Net) was proposed to reconstruct the channel of AYR, based on the images obtained by the different polarization decomposition methods in October, and the precision and recall reached 96.21% and 94.45%, respectively. Finally, two decision-level methods were proposed to optimize the reconstruction results, improving the precision and recall to 96.39% and 97.36%, respectively. In summary, Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR), with the application of polarization decomposition and neural network, provides new insights for detecting archeological anomalies and reconstructing archaeolandscapes.

TI  - Simultaneous Screening and Detection of RFI From Massive SAR Images: A Case Study on European Sentinel-1
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, the spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system transmits a great deal of data to the ground processing station and generates massive images daily, only a tiny fraction of which contains radio frequency interference (RFI). However, most of the existing RFI detection methods are based on the prior conditions in which the known image contains interference. In fact, it is difficult to learn whether SAR images contain RFIs without prescreening, so it is of great significance to the rapid and real-time screening and detection of RFI in SAR images. This article proposes a method to screen and detect RFI from massive SAR images simultaneously. 1) We construct an approximate RFI-free background image by using the preprocessed time-series SAR images acquired in the past. 2) We generate difference images based on the image change detection method and analyze them by using an adaptive threshold, then calculate the entropy of all difference images to complete the preliminary screening of the RFI-containing). According to the preliminary results, we remove the RFI-containing parts; after reconstructing the background, we repeat step 2 with the images to be detected and obtain the final screening and detection results. Massive experimental results based on Sentinel-1 images validate the performance of the proposed method.

TI  - Observation and Mitigation of Mutual RFI Between SAR Satellites: A Case Study Between Chinese GaoFen-3 and European Sentinel-1A
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing, radio frequency interference (RFI) has been recognized as a challenging issue, which can significantly degrade the image quality, including amplitude, phase, geometry, and so on. Most of the RFI sources are direct waves transmitted from the ground. Recently, a new form of RFI, namely, the mutual RFI (MRFI), which is a kind of scatter-wave RFI originating from the nearby ground area simultaneously illuminated by different SAR satellites, has been reported. In this article, the signatures of MRFI are characterized, and an example case study between Chinese GaoFen-3 (GF-3) and European Sentinel-1A (S-1A) is analyzed. In order to remove the artifacts caused by MRFI on SAR images, a novel RFI detector based on spectrum energy cancellation (SEC), which has the capability of detecting MRFI, is developed. Two methods, i.e., the traditional notch filtering method and an improved eigen-subspace projection (ESP) method proposed in this article, are employed to mitigate MRFI. The former method has robust mitigation performance with a fast processing speed, whereas the latter has an improved mitigation accuracy and lower sidelobes for strong scatterers. The methods are designed for cases in which the MRFI has a different radar center frequency than the useful signal, and some of the data are free from MRFI. The conditions required for the proper use of the approach are discussed. In contrast to the conventional mitigating methods performed on the raw data domain, the proposed approach begins with the focused single-look complex (SLC) SAR data. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated on several GF-3 SLC SAR images, which were contaminated by MRFI from the S-1A.

TI  - Pulse RFI Mitigation in Synthetic Aperture Radar Data via a Three-Step Approach: Location, Notch, and Recovery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In complex electromagnetic environments, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is severely affected by radio frequency interference (RFI) from other systems, such as ground-based radar, cellular networks, and global positioning systems, and this interference cannot be neglected. Pulse RFI (PRFI), a common form of RFI, can hinder SAR signal processing and image interpretation to varying degrees. The time-domain notch filtering method designed for mitigating PRFI can locate and mitigate the evident PRFI covered in SAR echo data, but it is helpless against PRFI hidden in a strong echo signal. In this article, a three-step approach is proposed to tackle the PRFI problem. In the proposed approach, the first step is to detect and locate PRFI; this is based on eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) and the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The second step is to notch PRFI, and this is based on a time-domain notch filter. The third step is to recover the notched signal using a novel matrix completion strategy, which integrates with a robust low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) technique-i.e.,the singular value thresholding (SVT) algorithm-and a well-known Lagrange interpolation technique. Experimental results via simulated SAR data, Sentinel-1 level-0 raw data, and L-band airborne SAR raw data demonstrate the performance of the proposed approach.

M3  - Article
AB  - SNAP-6 DInSAR analysis of Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired during a 2-month time frame when no significant uplift/subsidence events occurred provides the first known baseline DInSAR data for the Charleston, South Carolina, area. DInSAR measurements during a 72-day time frame had substantial bias throughout the region, with variability a strong function of the level of vegetation present. Specifically, results for (a) urban-built areas show low variability (<0.27 cm) with a bias/offset ranging from -25 to 16 cm, (b) nearby Francis Marion National Forest (FMNF) shows much high variability (1.67 to 10.52 cm) with bias/offset from -44 to 22 cm, and (c) mixed urban-forest and other vegetated areas in the region have variability (1.5 to 2.5 cm) and bias/offset (-15 cm to 15 cm) that fall between these ranges. Taken together, the satellite-based measurements indicate the need for integration of available local GPS and DInSAR measurements, as well as placement of additional persistent scatterer sites in the outlying regions.

AB  - Sun glint, the specular reflection of beam from the rough water surface, is a severe confounding factor of cloud detection in open water, the existence of sun glint can interfere with the reflectance leading to the inaccurate cloud mask and the restrictions of satellite observations. In this paper, the statistical sea surface specular Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) model is implemented to correct the sun glint contamination. The model is applied to the visible channel data of HY-1C/COCTS L1B products. The result is validated against the MODIS imagery without sun glint and is shown to be in good consistency.

TI  - Classifying Forest Types over a Mountainous Area in Southwest China with Landsat Data Composites and Multiple Environmental Factors
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information about forest type and distribution is critical for many scientific applications. It is possible to make a forest type map from the satellite data in a cost effective way. However, forest type mapping over a large and mountainous geographic area is still challenging, due to complex forest type compositions, spectral similarity among various forest types, poor quality images with clouds or cloud shadows and difficulties in managing and processing large amount data. Based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform, a method of forest types mapping using Landsat-8 OLI imagery and multiple environmental factors was developed and tested within Yunnan Province (about 390,000 km(2)) of China. The proposed approach employed a pixel-based seasonal image compositing method to produce two types of seasonal composite images, i.e., four 7-spectral-band composite images and four 5-VI-band composite images associated in spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Then, single-season feature bands and multi-seasonal feature bands were combined with the feature bands of topography, temperature, and precipitation, respectively, and resulting in 17 feature combinations. Finally, using a random forest (RF) classifier, 17 feature combinations were separately experimented to classify the forest type over the study area. The study area was firstly classified into the forest and the non-forest, and then the forest was sub-classified into five forest types (evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous needleleaf forest, evergreen broadleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, and mixed forest). The results showed that the pixel-based multi-seasonal median composite can produce a cloud-free image for the entire region and is suitable for forest type mapping. Compared with a single-season composite, a multi-seasonal composite can distinguish different forest types more effectively. The environmental factors also improve the accuracy of forest type mapping. With the ground survey samples as reference values, the classification performance of 17 feature combinations was compared, and the optimal feature combination was found out. For the optimal feature combination, its overall accuracy of the forest/non-forest cover map and the forest type map reached 97.57% (Kappa = 0.950) and 70.30% (Kappa = 0.628), respectively. The proposed approach has demonstrated strong potential of high classification accuracy and convenient calculation when mapping forest types over a national or global scale, and its product of 30 m resolution forest type map is capable of contributing to forest resource management.

AB  - Near real-time satellite-derived flood maps are invaluable to river forecasters and decision-makers for disaster monitoring and relief efforts. Combining utilization of the LEO (low earth orbiting) and GEO (geostationary) satellite imagery shows great advantages in flood mapping. With the support from NOAA/NASA JPSS (Joint Polar Satellite System) Program and GOES-R program, the flood mapping system has been developed to derive flood maps from Suomi-NPP (Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership) & NOAA-20/VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) imagery, GOES-16&17/ABI (Advanced Baseline Imager) imagery, and Himawari-8/AHI imagery. These flood maps are generated on a routine base at Space Science and Engineering Center at University of Wisconsin-Madison and have been applied in flood operations. Initial feedback from river forecasters on the product accuracy and performance has been largely positive. Evaluation efforts including visual inspection and quantitative validation using Landsat-8/OLI and Sentinel-2 imagery, and aerial photos have demonstrated steady performance of these products, which indicates a high feasibility of these flood maps to be produced at the product level.

TI  - Estimation of the All-Wave All-Sky Land Surface Daily Net Radiation at Mid-Low Latitudes from MODIS Data Based on ERA5 Constraints

M3  - Article
AB  - The surface all-wave net radiation (R-n) plays an important role in the energy and water cycles, and most studies of R-n estimations have been conducted using satellite data. As one of the most commonly used satellite data sets, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have not been widely used for radiation calculations at mid-low latitudes because of its very low revisit frequency. To improve the daily R-n estimation at mid-low latitudes with MODIS data, four models, including three models built with random forest (RF) and different temporal expansion models and one model built with the look-up-table (LUT) method, are used based on comprehensive in situ radiation measurements collected from 340 globally distributed sites, MODIS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data, and the fifth generation of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5) data from 2000 to 2017. After validation against the in situ measurements, it was found that the RF model based on the constraint of the daily R-n from ERA5 (an RF-based model with ERA5) performed the best among the four proposed models, with an overall validated root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 21.83 Wm(-2), R-2 of 0.89, and a bias of 0.2 Wm(-2). It also had the best accuracy compared to four existing products (Global LAnd Surface Satellite Data (GLASS), Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System Edition 4A (CERES4A), ERA5, and FLUXCOM_RS) across various land cover types and different elevation zones. Further analyses illustrated the effectiveness of the model by introducing the daily R-n from ERA5 into a "black box" RF-based model for R-n estimation at the daily scale, which is used as a physical constraint when the available satellite observations are too limited to provide sufficient information (i.e., when the overpass time is less than twice per day) or the sky is overcast. Overall, the newly-proposed RF-based model with ERA5 in this study shows satisfactory performance and has strong potential to be used for long-term accurate daily R-n global mapping at finer spatial resolutions (e.g., 1 km) at mid-low latitudes.

M3  - Article
AB  - As an important maritime hub, Bohai Sea Bay provides great convenience for shipping and suffers from sea ice disasters of different severity every winter, which greatly affects the socio-economic and development of the region. Therefore, this paper uses FY-4A (a weather satellite) data to study sea ice in the Bohai Sea. After processing the data for land removal and cloud detection, it combines multi-channel threshold method and adaptive threshold algorithm to realize the recognition of Bohai Sea ice under clear sky conditions. The random forests classification algorithm is introduced in sea ice identification, which can achieve a certain effect of sea ice classification recognition under cloud cover. Under non-clear sky conditions, the results of Bohai Sea ice identification based on random forests have been improved, and the algorithm can effectively identify Bohai Sea Ice and can improve the accuracy of sea ice identification, which lays a foundation for the accuracy and stability of sea ice identification. It realizes sea ice identification in the Bohai Sea and provides data support and algorithm support for marine climate forecasting related departments.

TI  - Spectral Reconstruction Network From Multispectral Images to Hyperspectral Images: A Multitemporal Case
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral (HS) satellite data have been widely applied in many fields due to its numerous bands. Along with the advantages of high spectral resolution, HS satellite data are still limited by some disadvantages of high acquisition cost, low revisiting capability, and low spatial resolution. Compared with HS satellites, multispectral (MS) satellites have a large number, large width, strong coverage, and high spatial resolution. Therefore, MS data can be used as the input to the spectral reconstruction (SR) to obtain HS data with high temporal resolution. Better HS data can be obtained by spectral reconstructing with these continuous multitemporal data than with single-temporal data. A multitemporal spectral reconstruction network (MTSRN) is proposed in this article, which is used to reconstruct HS images from multitemporal MS images. The proposed MTSRN comprises multiple single-temporal spectral reconstruction networks (STSRN) for extracting temporal features and a multitemporal fusion network (MTFN). The parallel component alternative (PA) post-processing method enhances the physical plausibility of reconstructed HS data. To demonstrate performance of the proposed method in aspects of multitemporal reconstruction, experiments are conducted on four multitemporal HS and MS satellite datasets. The experimental results prove that the proposed MTSRN obtains better SR results compared with the SR method based on single-temporal information.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on AOPC - Optical Sensing, Imaging, and Display Technology

AB  - Man-made target detection in the natural background is the core problem of high-resolution optical remote sensing image interpretation, and it is an important application direction in the target recognition, situation awareness, and other fields. This paper proposes a man-made target detection method based on red-edge spectral information in the natural background. In this method, the red-edge spectrum information of vegetation is used to suppress background interference and narrow the search area in large remote sensing images, to improve the probability of target detection. The automatic extraction model of man-made targets is trained by the public dataset COD10K and self-constructed remote sensing dataset, and detection experiments are carried out by using the multispectral images from the WorldView-3 satellite and the Sentinel-2 A/B satellites. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has high detection accuracy and fast detection speed for the green runway, green buildings, and another man-made targets in the forest or grassland. Compared with the traditional man-made target detection algorithm, this method is more suitable for the rapid search of large area remote sensing images.

TI  - An Enhanced Geographically and Temporally Weighted Neural Network for Remote Sensing Estimation of Surface Ozone
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface ozone (O-3) pollution is a severe environmental problem that endangers human health. It is necessary to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution O-3 data to provide support for pollution monitoring and prevention. For this purpose, this study makes comprehensive use of remote sensing data, reanalysis data, and ground station observations and develops an enhanced geographically and temporally weighted neural network (EGTWNN) model to acquire high spatial and temporal resolutions of O-3 data. The EGTWNN model is nested by two neural networks (NNs). The first NN automatically learns the spatiotemporal proximity relationship to obtain spatiotemporal weights for the samples, and the spatiotemporal weights are then inputted into the second NN to conduct weighted modeling of the relationship between O-3 and influencing variables. The contribution of the proposed model is that the first NN replaces the traditional empirical weighting method and represents the spatiotemporal proximity relationship more accurately to improve estimation accuracy. Results indicate that the crossvalidation R-2 and the root mean square error (RMSE) of EGTWNN are 0.81 and 21.24 mu g/m(3), respectively, which are increased by 0.02 and decreased by similar to 1 mu g/m(3) relative to those of the traditional empirical weighting method-based geographically and temporally weighted NN model. The results also show that, compared with the geographically and temporally weighted regression model, the proposed model achieves superior performance. In addition, the spatiotemporal weights obtained by the first NN of EGTWNN are highly consistent with those obtained by the traditional empirical weighting method, indicating that the results of NNs are highly interpretable.

TI  - Graph-Feature-Enhanced Selective Assignment Network for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Data Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rich spectral and spatial information, the combination of hyperspectral and multispectral images (MSIs) has been widely used for Earth observation, such as wetland classification. However, mining of meaningful features and effective fusion of multisource remote sensing data are still urgent problems to be solved. In this article, graph-feature-enhanced selective assignment network (GSANet) is proposed. On the one hand, a graph feature extraction module (GFEM) is designed to extract topological structure information and combine with the rich spectral-spatial information. In particular, the features obtained by convolution are first mapped to the graph feature space, and the graph convolution operation is used to achieve propagation between nodes for preserving topological structure information. Moreover, to reduce the difference of graph features resulting from the mapping function and better explore the complementary properties of multisource data, a novel graph fusion strategy-graph dependence fusion is designed. A transition graph is generated to enhance the association and interaction between different graph features, so as to avoid the information loss caused by simple fusion operation. On the other hand, a selective feature assignment module (SFAM) is developed to adaptively assign weights to different discriminative features. SFAM assigns weights to different features to selectively emphasize informative features and suppress less useful ones. Extensive experiments are conducted on two multisource remote sensing datasets, and the improvement of at least 1.27% and 0.98% compared to other state-of-the-art work demonstrates the superiority of the proposed GSANet.

TI  - A Pseudo-Siamese Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Satellite Image Fusion
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to technology and cost limitations, it is challenging to obtain high temporal and spatial resolution images from a single satellite spectrometer, which significantly limits the specific application of such remote sensing images in earth science. To solve the problem that the existing algorithms cannot effectively balance the spatial detail preservation and spectral change reconstruction, a pseudo-Siamese deep convolutional neural network (PDCNN) for spatiotemporal fusion is proposed in this article. The method proposes a pseudo-Siamese network framework model for fusion. This framework has two independent and equal feature extraction streams, but the weights are not shared. The two feature extraction streams process the image information at the previous and later moments and reconstruct the fine image of the corresponding time to fully extract the image information at different times. In the feature extraction stream, the multiscale mechanism and dilated convolution of flexible perception are designed, which can flexibly obtain feature image information and improve the model reconstruction accuracy. In addition, an attention mechanism is introduced to improve the weight of the crucial information for the remote sensing images. Adding a residual connection enhances the reuse of the initial feature information in shallow networks and reduces the loss of feature information in deep networks. Finally, the fine images obtained from the two feature extraction streams are weighted and fused to obtain the final predicted image. The subjective and objective results demonstrate that the PDCNN can effectively reconstruct the fusion image with higher quality.

AB  - Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is an important part of the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems. The technical advantages and huge potential of remote sensing technology in NPP estimation make it a hot spot in the research field. The vigorous development of many remote sensing fusion algorithms provides fine-resolution remote sensing data support for high-precision NPP dynamic monitoring. In recent years, the expansion of urban areas and climate change have had a great impact on the NPP of vegetation. In accordance with the requirements of large-scale and high-temporal-spatial resolution productivity assessment of urban area, we chose the northern Jiangsu area as the research area and uses three remote sensing data spatiotemporal fusion methods, STARFM, ESTARFM, and STDFA to blend Landsat and MODIS data. Three methods are compared in aspects of NDVI reconstruction ability in large-scale, highly heterogeneous regional application scenarios, the accuracy of NPP estimation through CASA model, and the ability of fine spatial description. The results of the study show that STDFA gets the highest correlation coefficient between its NDVI reconstruction results and MODIS products, which is 0.82. Correlation coefficient of STARFM and ESTARFM are 0.77 and 0.75, respectively. The STARFM is significantly lower in the NPP estimation results among the three methods, meanwhile STDFA performs best in our test site.

TI  - UNet Combined With Attention Mechanism Method for Extracting Flood Submerged Range
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite has been widely applied in real-time flood monitoring as that they are not affected by extreme weather conditions. However, there is no automatic method to quickly and accurately extract flood areas with SAR satellite images. In this article, a UNet combined with the attention mechanism (UNet-CBAM) method has been proposed for extracting flood submerged areas, and both Longgan Lake and Dahuchi in Poyang Lake Basin are selected as the test sites. Based on the polarization characteristics of two Sentinel-1A data of Poyang Lake, both UNet and UNet-CBAM extraction methods are utilized to extract the flood areas, respectively. Compared with traditional SAR image water extraction methods, simulation results demonstrate that UNet can obtain more satisfactory results in recall, precision, and F-1 parameter, hut it has no capability to guarantee continuity in edges and small bodies of water. Moreover, our proposed UNet-CBAM method can further improve recall, precision, and F-1-parameter, respectively. Specifically, when compared with UNet, its recall is increased by 0.8% and 1.2% while F-1-parameter is improved by 0.6% and 0.8%, respectively, in the two test sites.

TI  - Cloud Detection and Classification Algorithms for Himawari-8 Imager Measurements Based on Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A deep-learning-based cloud detection and classification algorithm for advanced Himawari imager (AHI) measurements from the geostationary satellite Himawari-8 has been developed. It is found that a combination of observed radiances and simulated clear-sky radiances can substantially improve cloud phase discrimination, especially for optically thin clouds. Therefore, cloud detection, cloud phase classification, and multilayer cloud detection are obtained simultaneously from multispectral observed radiances and simulated clear-sky radiances using deep neural networks (DNNs). Two DNN models are established for all-day and daytime-only applications, respectively, using active Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) merged cloud products from 2016 as reference labels. The independent dataset from 2017 is used to validate the DNN models. It is shown that both the DNN models outperform the official Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and AHI products in cloud detection and phase discrimination, and the enhancement is more significant over land than over water surface. For multilayer cloud detection, the probability of detecting multilayer clouds reaches similar to 60% for the all-day model and is increased to similar to 70% for the daytime model, which is substantially better than MODIS and AHI products. In practical cases, multilayer cloud detection by DNN models is more consistent with CPR/CALIOP than two official products. In addition, the DNN models have superior capability in detecting the optically thin cirrus, which is omitted by MODIS and AHI products. Specifically, the cases also demonstrate that the DNN models can provide effective mixed-phase cloud identification. This deep-learning-based algorithm has the potential for measurements from other similar instruments.

TI  - Precipitation and Anthropogenic Activities Jointly Green the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic activities are widely considered the main factors affecting vegetation growth. However, their relative contributions are under debate. Within the non-climatic impact, detailed human activities, particularly government policy adjustments, are less investigated. In this study, we develop a fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) extraction method based on MODIS-EVI satellite data to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of vegetation and its attributions in the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC). The average FVC has improved, with a general increase of 0.02/10a from 2000 to 2020. We construct a driving factor identification system for FVC change, based on partial and multiple correlation coefficients, and we divide the driving forces of FVC changes into seven climate-driven types and one non-climate-driven type. The results reveal that FVC changes caused by climatic factors account for 28.2% of CMREC. The most prominent greening (19.5%) is precipitation-driven, and is extensively distributed in Khentii Aimag, Mongolia; southeast Inner Mongolia; west Jilin Province; and southwest Heilongjiang Province, China. Moreover, we quantify the relative contribution of climatic and non-climatic factors to significant FVC change using the first-difference multivariate regression method. The results indicate that the effects of non-climatic factors on vegetation change outweigh those of climatic factors in most areas. According to the land cover change and regional policy adjustment, anthropogenic activities such as afforestation, reclamation, and planting structure adjustment explain most vegetation improvement in the Northeast Plain; eastern Inner Mongolia; and the Hetao Irrigation District, China. Meanwhile, both vegetation improvement and degradation disperse concurrently in the Mongolian and Russian parts of CMREC, where climate change and anthropogenic activities positively and negatively affect vegetation change, respectively. Despite the greening in most CMREC, it must be noted that human-induced greening is unsustainable to some degree. The overdevelopment of black soil area and sandy land, adverse effects of afforestation projects, and natural hazards related to weather and climate extremes altogether threaten the local ecological security in the long run. Therefore, governments should develop new desertification countermeasures in accordance with the laws of nature, and enhance international cooperation to guarantee the ecological safety of CMREC.

AB  - The aim of this study was to provide a scientific basis for the effective protection of landscape resources by analysing landscape pattern dynamic change. Based on Landsat remote sensing image sources from three periods in the Dongting Lake area, combined with natural and human influences, the landscape patterns in the Dongting Lake area were analysed. In the past 28 years, the area and quantity of landscape patches in the study area changed significantly: the area ratio of paddy fields, dry land, woodland, open woodland, grassland and water area decreased, while the area ratio of shrubbery, other woodland, construction land and other land increased. Landscape fragmentation and heterogeneity in the study area were high, and landscape patterns had a trend of decentralized development. In addition to the construction land, the shape of patches of other land types did not change significantly and showed a trend of increasing and then decreasing. The landscape pattern structure in the study area had a trend of fragmentation, which indicates ecological vulnerability, but the plaque shape was simple and normal, and ecological recoverability was shown.

TI  - Remote sensing monitoring of ecological changes in Lake Yueliang wetland and its response to inundation frequency in Western Songnen Plain during 1994-2018
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland in the semiarid inland is a special ecosystem, as its hydrological pulse over seasonal and inter-annual time scales strongly affects the wetland structure and ecological function. Over the past 20 years, the Lake Yueliang wetland is undergoing a degradation caused by natural and human impacts. The paper focuses on how to detect the annual and interannual changes at a large scale and the objective is to understand the impact of inundation range and frequency on inland wetland. Based on Landsat TM/OLI imagery data (30 m) from 1994 to 2018, firstly, we calculated interannual information of water body and inundation frequency to extract the inundation area of Lake Yueliang. Secondly, the remote sensing ecological indexes (MNDWI, NDVI and NDSI) were extract for monitoring the ecological change in the study area. Finally, the observation period was divided into three stand and years ( 1995, 2006 and 2016), and further graded and evaluated the ecological changes included the annual change and the interannual change were further graded and evaluated. The results showed that the flooded areas of the Lake Yueliang mainly distributed in the northern and western lake. Meanwhile, the fluctuation frequency of inundation in the northern part is more significant than other parts. From 1994 to 2018, the main ecological changes is characterized by the expansion of water body and the decreased marsh. In this case, the ecological changes were characterized by the increase of the water index (MNDWI) cumulant and the decline of the vegetation index ( NDVI) cumulant. The flooding frequency of the lake affected the vegetation productivity in flooded area, and the flooding fluctuation with the low frequency was a critical factor to increase the vegetation accumulation in the study area. Therefore, for the wetland ecological restoration and management, maintaining the existing lake area and restoring the swamps on the northern and western lake are the keys.

TI  - Saline-Sodic Soil EC Retrieval Based on Box-Cox Transformation and Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Electrical conductivity (EC) is an important index of soil salinity level and an essential factor in judging whether improvement can be made and assessing the improvement, if any. However, saline soils of different types show different spectral characteristic bands, which affects the retrieval precision to a certain extent. To tackle this issue, we present a novel way of modeling. Specifically, we compare the correlation of sensitive bands, multiplication of sensitive bands, and spectral indexes with EC data to determine the optimal input parameters, and take the EC data after Box-Cox transformation as the output. We then try out several machine-learning algorithms to establish retrieval models for soil EC. Validation results show that the model precision increases by 3.23-85.71% after EC data transformation and machine learning models produce 29.41-86.67% higher precision than the linear regression model. Finally, using the optimal model, we retrieve pixel-level (10 m x 10 m) EC for the soil in our study areas. This provides necessary data support for working out soil desalinization initiatives and evaluating the effectiveness of such initiatives.

TI  - GCPs Extraction With Geometric Texture Pattern for Thermal Infrared Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate ground control pointsx2019; (GCPs) extraction is extremely essential to support the on-orbit geometric calibration and registrations of multitemporal and multispectral remote sensing images (RSIs). However, compared with other images, the thermal infrared (TIR) images responding to the targetsx2019; temperature usually present low spatial resolution, poor contrast, and different mapping intensity, which make it difficult to get enough precision matches in the corresponding image pairs for GCPsx2019; extraction. Furthermore, with more attention to the gradient properties surrounding the interest points, the conventional feature-based algorithms generally neglect the plenty of geometric textural features of RSIs. Here, in this letter, we propose an accurate geometric-texture-based GCPsx2019; extraction approach for TIR RSIs. The novel textural log-polar pattern and the double constrained matching rules comprising the matching bits and differences are combined to guarantee the ultimate GCPsx2019; accuracy. The experimental results evaluated on TIR RSIs of Landsat 8 and GLS2000 show that the absolute matching errors of the proposed method in sample and line directions can be 0.50 and 0.47 pixels, which improve a lot in terms of three state-of-the-art methods.

AB  - Landsat data are the important sources for the inversion of land surface temperature (LST) with high spatial resolution. As an important parameter of LST inversion, the land surface emissivity (LSE) of Landsat TIR channels is usually inverted by the semi-empirical method, which has certain limitations. With the launch of Landsat 9, the requirement for LSE became more urgent. Therefore, this paper proposed a new retrieval method to estimate LSE with high spatial resolution for Landsat. Reflectance of Landsat VNIR-SWIR channels were used for the LSE inversion by Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT) machine learning method. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the estimated results, the LSEs were compared with those estimated by NDVI threshold method and the field measurement data. The results showed the LSEs estimated by GBRT model were consistent with the measured data. So it demonstrated that this method was feasible to estimated LSE for Landsat.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatial-temporal Evolution and Driving Factors of Rural Residential Areas in Metropolitan Fringe : A Case Study of Tianjin
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Excavate thoroughly and fully the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics and influencing factors of rural settlements in metropolis fringe is of great practical significance for the spatial optimization of rural settlements, economical promotion and intensive use of land resources during the urbanization process. Based on Landsat TM remote sensing, the land use information of 450 rural settlements in Tianjin in 1980, 2000 and 2019 were obtained by using ArcGIS software. The spatial overlap analysis, kernel density analysis and structural equation model were used to reveal the spatial and temporal evolution and influencing factors of rural settlements in the past 40 years. The results show that the number of rural settlements decreased from 426 in 1980 to 127 in 2019. There were 355 unchanged villages from 1980 to 2000, while there were 322 decreasing villages and 81 unchanged villages from 2000 to 2019. The spatial distribution of rural settlements showed the characteristics of agglomeration. However, the estimated core density of rural settlements gradually decreased from 1980 to 2019, which showed fewer high-density areas and almost no rural settlements near the central urban area. Regional economy and household behavior have direct impact on the change of rural settlements, while family endowment and government policy indirectly promoted the change of rural settlements through economic development.

TI  - COMPARISON OF INVERSION METHODS FOR MAIZE CANOPY TIME-SERIES LAI BASED ON SUPREME RECONSTRUCTED IMAGES
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASABE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate time-series crop leaf area index (LAI) monitoring can provide data support for field management and early yield estimation. The Sentinel-2 satellite has a high spatial, temporal, and spectral resolution, and its unique three red-edge bands provide an ideal data source for LAI estimation. However, the inconsistent spatial resolution of different bands hinders the application potential of Sentinel-2 images. In view of this problem, we focused on mining more infor-mation provided by the high spatial resolution bands of Sentinel-2 images using the Super-Resolution for Multispectral Multiresolution Estimation (SupReME) algorithm. Furthermore, The SNAP (Sentinel Application Platform) biophysical processor and the PROSAIL radiation transfer model coupled with Random Forest (RF) model were applied to estimate time-series LAI of maize canopy at 10 m spatial resolution, and the Leaf Area Index Wireless Sensor Network (LAINet) measurements were used for accuracy verification. Finally, the effectiveness of images reconstructed by SupReME and the two inversion methods for time-series LAI estimation were evaluated. The results showed that: (1) the Sentinel-2 images reconstructed by SupReME can improve spatial characteristics while maintaining spectral invariance, and they were more advantageous for LAI estimation than the original images; (2) The SNAP biophysical processor suits a quick large-scale estimation with robustness, while the PROSAIL coupled RF model achieved a higher coefficient of determination (R2) and a lower root mean square error (RMSE) (R2 increased by more than 0.1, RMSE decreased by more than 0.33) for time -series LAI estimation in this specific study area; (3) both inversion methods showed apparent underestimation at the late growth stage. This study verifies the feasibility of obtaining high spatial resolution images using a super-resolution algo-rithm for LAI inversion and provides the effect of two commonly used inversion methods for time-series LAI estimation at 10 m resolution.

AB  - This study presents a radiative transfer process and machine learning combined method to estimate the crown foliage fuel load (FFL), an important factor influencing the characteristics of crown fires. To this end, the GeoSail, SAIL and PROSPECT radiative transfer models (RTMs) were firstly coupled together to simulate the near realistic scenario of a two-layered forest structure. For the backward inversion process, the coupled RTMs were linked to the machine learning models of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to train this model and then derive the FFL estimates from the Landsat products. The performance of retrieved FFL was validated and compared with the traditional look-up table (LUT) method. Results showed that the MLP performed better than LUT, revealing the reasonable skill of the combination of RTMs and machine learning modeling in deriving the FFL from remote sensing data and putting the insight into wildfire danger assessment from space.

TI  - SAR Image Classification Using CNN Embeddings and Metric Learning
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The method proposed in this letter for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image classification has two main stages. In the first stage, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained for normal SAR image classification task. After training, the sample features can be obtained by extracting the output of middle layer in the forward propagation process of CNN. In the second stage, an end-to-end metric network is trained to measure the relations between sample features. The method proposed in this letter is tested with some of the larger targets in OpenSARShip data set which is collected from Sentinel-1 satellite, and it is also tested with the MSTAR data set which is created by the U.S. Air Force Laboratory. The experimental results show that our method can get a higher recognition accuracy than normal CNN structure.

AB  - S-band spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems were relatively rare since most launched missions worked in L-, C- or X-bands. An S-band spaceborne SAR should have a better interferometric coherence and penetration capability compared to a C-band spaceborne SAR, which is not fully known. In this paper, we analyze the interferometric coherence based on NovaSAR-1 data in a case in Peth, Australia. Typical regions of interest (ROIs) were selected and the performance was compared to C-band Sentinel-1 data. The results show that S-band spaceborne SARs have better penetration towards shallow and sparse vegetation regions and higher temporal coherence than C-band systems.

TI  - Moving Vehicle Detection Based on RPCA Using Multisquint Spaceborne SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this letter, a moving vehicle detection method is proposed based on spaceborne synthetic aperture radar images, generated by antenna azimuth steering with different azimuth angles and time lags. First, the multisquint geometry and sequential image model are established, and the variation from stationary scatters over sequence is addressed, which interferes the indication of moving signals significantly. Then, the robust principal component analysis (RPCA) is employed in the image domain as the predetection step. Next, with some spatial filters and thresholding estimators, the moving target signature is exploited to further discriminate the residual false detection. Finally, the proposed method is verified by both simulated and real images based on TerraSAR-X data. Results reveal that the clutter suppression can be effectively achieved.

TI  - A NOISE PROOF STRATEGY FOR SPATIO-TEMPORAL FUSION OF REMOTE SENSING IMAGERY

AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion is a feasible way to generating the synthetic remote sensing data with high spatial resolution and high temporal resolution simultaneously by blending the fine and coarse resolution satellite images. To date, dozens of spatio-temporal fusion approaches have been developed. A basic rule of these approaches is the bands of coarse and fine images must be corresponding, which means the quality of fused images depends on that of both fine and coarse images. In the literature, the MODIS images are the most wildly used coarse images in spatio-temporal fusion. However, the MODIS images may suffer from serious stripe noises in the short-wave infrared-1 and short-wave infrared-2 bands, which will lead to undesired results of spatio-temporal fusion. To address this problem, we develop a noise proof strategy in this paper, which takes advantage of the spectral correlation of base fine image to remove the stripe noises of the base MODIS image, then the spatial correlation of base MODIS image is exploited to restore the MODIS image of the predicted time. Finally, the reconstructed MODIS images are fused with the base fine image to predict the missing fine images. The strategy is tested via real Landsat and MODIS images, and the experimental result demonstrates it is not only effective in removing the stripe noises of MDOIS short-wave infrared-1 and short-wave infrared-2 bands, but also able to improve the fusion accuracy.

TI  - Fusing Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance Data via Pixel-Wise Local Normalization
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Medium spatial resolution surface reflectance image series from the combination of Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Imager observations have great importance to the land surface monitoring tasks, for which great efforts have been paid for blending the two data. However, most of the efforts focus on the image series with spatial resolution of 30 m, which cannot meet the data demand of some applications. Therefore, it is necessary to fuse Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images to provide 10-m image series. Currently, there are three means to achieve that, including the area-to-point regression kriging fusion approach (ATPRK), spatiotemporal fusion methods, and deep-learning-based fusion models. However, the ATPRK and spatiotemporal fusion methods suffer from the limited fusion performance, while the deep-learning-based fusion models are hardware dependent, i.e., requiring the graphics processing units, which may not be satisfied sometimes. To address these issues, in this article, we develop a new pixel-wise local normalization-based fusion method (LN-FM) for fusing Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images. The newly proposed LN-FM is compared to the ATPRK and three representative spatiotemporal fusion methods in experiments, which use imagery collected from both a rural area and an urban area. The experimental results demonstrate that the newly developed LN-FM exhibits excellent qualitative and quantitative performance, as well as remarkable spatial, spectral, and pixel distribution fidelity. Furthermore, this approach is fast, which may improve its applicability

TI  - Pansharpening-Based Spatio-Temporal Fusion for Predicting Intense Surface Changes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion is a feasible way to provide synthetic satellite images with high spatial and high temporal resolution simultaneously. Due to its practicability, spatio-temporal fusion has gotten increasing attention, for which many spatio-temporal fusion approaches have been developed. Most spatio-temporal fusion methods follow the "base fine image guided" (BFIG) fusion mode, resulting in the fact that their fusion results are similar to the base fine images. Therefore, these methods can perform well in areas with limited surface changes due to high similarity between the base and the predicted fine images. However, they might not be applicable in areas with intense surface changes. In this article, we develop a pansharpening-based spatio-temporal fusion model (PSTFM) by introducing the pansharpening fusion mode, which is "coarse image guided" (CIG), into spatio-temporal fusion. PSTFM first trains a pansharpening convolutional neural network (CNN), which then fuses the coarse images and reconstructed panchromatic (Pan) images of the predicted time to recover the missing fine images. The newly proposed PSTFM is compared with three representative BFIG spatio-temporal fusion methods on two Landsat-Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets, both of which contain intense surface changes. After that, the experimental results are analyzed and discussed in detail. The experiments and the analysis demonstrate that the newly proposed PSTFM has remarkably qualitative and quantitative performance in predicting the intense surface changes while it is mediocre in areas with low surface change intensity.

TI  - Estimation of Vegetation Carbon Source/Sink and Analysis of Its Influencing Factors in Hulun Lake Basin from 2013 to 2020
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial carbon cycle is an important component for researches on climate change and global carbon cycle. Net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is an essential indicator to quantitatively describe the carbon source/sink capacity of vegetated ecosystems. The grassland ecosystem is an important part of the global terrestrial ecosystem, and the Hulun Lake Basin is a multi-ecosystem area dominated by grassland ecosystem and mixed with farmland, forest and wetland ecosystems. The spatiotemporal variations and drivers of its carbon source/sink are of great significance in the study of ecological environmental protection and restoration as well as the local climate change in this region. Based on Landsat 8 OLI high-resolution satellite remote sensing images, ERA5 climate reanalysis data and land cover data, the spatiotemporal patterns of carbon sinks of different vegetation types in the Hulun Lake basin from 2013 to 2020 and their differences in response to climate factors were estimated using a light use efficiency model and a soil respiration model. The results show that since 2013, the Hulun Lake Basin has been functioning as a carbon sink, while the carbon sequestration capacity decreased, with 58. 29% of the regional vegetation NEP showing a decreasing trend and 36. 77% of the regional vegetation NEP showing a weak increasing trend. The regional monthly average NEP showed inter-annual variation characteristics of firstly decreasing and then increasing, with a variation range of 8. 41-16. 44 g . m(2) . mo(-1), In the watershed, the grassland ecosystem had the highest total carbon sink, about 37 Tg . mo(-1), and the farmland NEP was mostly affected by temperature, and the forest ecosystem was influenced by the combination of temperature, precipitation, and radiation. The grassland ecosystem is concurrently affected by temperature and precipitation, while the wetland NEP is not significantly correlated with climate factors.

TI  - Subpixel Change Detection Based on Improved Abundance Values for Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To achieve land cover change detection (LCCD) with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions from remote sensing images, subpixel mapping-based approaches have been widely studied in recent years. The fine spatial but coarse temporal resolution image and the coarse spatial but fine temporal image are used to accomplish LCCD by combining their advantages. However, the performance of subpixel mapping is easily affected by the accuracy of spectral unmixing, thereby reducing the reliability of LCCD. In this article, a novel subpixel change detection scheme based on improved abundance values is proposed to tackle the aforementioned problem, in which the spatial distribution of fine spatial resolution image is borrowed to promote the accuracy of spectral unmixing. First, the coarse spatial resolution image is used to generate the original abundance image by the spectral unmixing method. Second, the spatial distribution information of the fine spatial resolution image is incorporated into the original abundance image to obtain improved abundance values. Third, the fine spatial resolution subpixel map can be generated by the subpixel mapping method using the improved abundance values. At last, the fine resolution change map can be obtained by comparing the subpixel map with the fine spatial resolution image. Experiments are conducted on a simulated dataset based on Landsat-7 images and two real datasets based on Landsat-8 and MODIS images. The results of the real datasets showed that the proposed method can effectively improve the performance of LCCD with an overall accuracy of approximately 1.26% and 0.79% to the existing methods.

TI  - A Stereoscopic Approach for Cloud Base Height Assessment Over an Optical Ground Station
T2  - FREE-SPACE LASER COMMUNICATIONS XXXIV
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Free-Space Laser Communications XXXIV at SPIE LASE Conference
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Telecommunication and remote sensing data exchanged between Earth and space has increased dramatically in recent years. Radio frequencies, the medium used for several decades has shown to reach its capacity. Free space optical communications, achieved with laser transmitter devices, is an alternative with better transmission rate and increased security. However, a major drawback of this technology is that laser signal cannot cross through thick clouds, which imply to set up a network of optical ground stations with handover management strategies based on Cloud Optical Depth (COD) observation and Cloud Motion forecasts. Ground-based long-wave infrared observations from a sky imager can be used to estimate COD. However, as a low thin cloud may have similar thermal signature than a high thick cloud, additional Cloud Base Height (CBH) measurement is needed to retrieve accurate COD in any weather situation [1]. The CCSDS currently recommends to use a ceilometer for this purpose [2]. Here, we explore an alternative approach, retrieving CBH directly from a pair of thermal sky imagers and stereoscopic methods. Our CBH retrievals have been compared with the measurement of a reference ceilometer. The results showed a good agreement for a continuous period of acquisition over several days, with a Root Mean Squared Error of 15%. In addition, stereoscopy offers a wider field of view and thus, may increase the forecasting horizon and accuracy, compared to a sky imager+ceilometer configuration [3] [4] [5]. We believe this approach is promising for the cloud monitoring of Optical Ground Stations and should be further investigated.

TI  - Characterization and Correction of Intersensor Calibration Convolution Errors Between S-NPP OMPS Nadir Mapper and Metop-B GOME-2
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces a method to correct intersensor calibration convolution errors that occur in the convolution of spectral response functions (SRFs) between narrow-band and broad-band instruments. By using the intersensor calibration analysis between Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite (OMPS) Nadir Mapper (NM) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) as an example, the root cause of convolution errors in the intersensor calibration is addressed through direct comparison of OMPS NM SRF and convolved OMPS SRF with GOME-2 SRF. The results reveal that distorted SRF of the narrow-band instrument is the major cause, which appears for GOME-2 at a wide range of channels. The convolution errors in reflectance, which were ignored in previous studies, can be greater than 2% for wavelength shorter than 320 nm and similar to 0.5% for wavelengths between 320 and 330 nm. This study thus presents a hybrid convolution error correction method that consists of theoretical approximation of the convolution errors and empirical estimates of residuals due to the deviation of the theoretical approximation from the actual convolution errors. According to the validation through simulation, after applying convolution error correction, the mean convolution errors are less than 0.02%, while the root mean square errors are reduced from more than 0.5% to less than 0.1%. In addition, the correction method is applied to the intersensor calibration radiometric bias assessment between the Meteorological Operational satellite-B (Metop-B) GOME-2 and the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) OMPS NM. The averaged intersensor calibration reflectance differences are decreased by more than 16% after convolution error correction.

TI  - An Entropy-Weighted Network for Polar Sea Ice Open Lead Detection From Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice leads in the Arctic Ocean and Antarctic Ocean are of great significance to polar ecology, climate change, and ship navigation. While rule-based remote-sensing classification methods, such as the threshold method, have been widely used for surveying and mapping polar sea ice leads, they have difficulty in overcoming the problems of noise and poor generalization. In this article, we presented an automated, deep learning sea ice open lead detection network in low wind speed conditions, entropy-weighted network (EW-Net). In EW-Net, a dense block was introduced into a U-Net baseline network to strengthen feature propagation, and an entropy sampling structure was designed to improve the pertinence of the network to leads and alleviate the influence of noise. Furthermore, an entropy-weighted feature fusion block was designed to better restore features. EW-Net was trained on the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset in order to obtain lead maps of different polar regions from Sentinel-1 images. The results showed that the proposed EW-Net model was more effective and more generalizable for polar sea ice lead detection than the threshold method and the deep learning methods U-Net and DeepLab V3 Plus, with an overall accuracy (OA) exceeding 0.97. In addition, EW-Net showed advantages in terms of outstanding generalization from cross-sensor image monitoring of leads. The method proposed in this article could be beneficial for providing accurate maps of polar sea ice leads in open water and contribute to further research on polar science.

TI  - Land cover classification from very high spatial resolution images via multiscale object-driven CNNs and automatic annotation
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very high spatial resolution (VHR) images are accessible for land-cover classification. Because of the complex information and deep features associated with increased spatial resolution, it is difficult to find an effective method for improving the classification accuracy of finer-resolution remote sensing images. We propose a scheme for sample selection and sample autoannotation to establish a new labeled benchmark using vector maps. In addition, a suitable multiscale object-driven convolutional neural networks (multi-OCNNs) were developed for the new benchmark. We trained multi-OCNNs to capture the deep and contextual information contained in samples of the VM-RSI benchmark to predict the land cover categories from target region images with no labels. Furthermore, an object-driven voting strategy applied in multi-OCNNs provides clear boundary information of ground objects and less noise in CNN predictions. Experiments on multisource VHR images, including SPOT-6, Gaofen-2, and ALOS satellite images, show that the proposed approach outperforms other object-based algorithms by achieving good performance results, verifying its feasibility, and effectiveness for land cover classification.

AB  - Shape model is a typical method of using long-time satellite and ground observation phenological data to inverse the growth trajectory curve of specific vegetation index, and fitting the index curve of observation area with this trajectory curve, to obtain the crop phenological period. This method can effectively avoid the interference of local abnormal observations. The traditional shape model method only uses the daily average temperature to reflect the accumulated growing degree days of crops, and it is difficult to accurately quantify the contribution of temperature factors to crop growth. Therefore, this paper proposes a shape model based on continuous accumulated growing degree days to extract the phenological period. In this paper, taking the extraction of early rice phenology as an example, four key phenological periods, such as tillering, heading, and flowering, were calculated by using MODIS daily products and the observed temperature data on the ground. The results show that the phenological accuracy extracted by continuous accumulated growing degree days was better than the daily average temperature.

AB  - The construction of the metro system alleviates the traffic congestion caused by urban expansion. However, at the same time, improper construction and operation activities would cause ground deformation that might lead to the urban hazards of ground cracks, building tilting, and ground collapse. Such ground deformation along the metro system can be generally measured by the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique owning to the advantages of wide ground coverage and high accuracy of measurements. In this study, a general survey of the ground stability along the Shenzhen metro system has been carried out with the PS-InSAR technique using the 119 Sentinel-1A images from March 2017 to March 2021. The results show that, during the observation period, the ground deformation rate along the Shenzhen metro system is ranged from -26.2 mm/year to 9.3 mm/year. The deformation is mainly due to the consolidation of the reclamation land, construction activities of new metro lines, and geological changes.

TI  - Motif of Death in Ukrainian-Canadian Poetry
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of the research is to study the originality of interpretation of death in the lyrics of Ukrainian diaspora in Canada in the context of the opposition "foreign land - motherland", based on its existential development in philosophical anthropology and culture of the last two centuries. Its implementation presupposes, first of all, analysis of the forms of development and disclosure of the death motif by figurative and artistic means. Theoretical basis. The author uses the well-founded tradition of interpreting the death motif in philosophical literature of the last centuries, i.e. non-classical and modern philosophical thought. Originality. The present study is an attempt at systematization of the notions of death in Ukrainian poetry in Canada in the second half of the 20th century. It is based on the study of artistic texts and the worldview of Ukrainian emigrants. Appeal to the fiction of the Ukrainian Diaspora allows illustrating the originality of philosophical understanding of death in the context of the national culture. Conclusions. Reference to Ukrainian-Canadian poetry allows expanding the space of philosophical understanding of death in the form of figurative fiction. Concretizing the character of their interpretation of the motif of death, it is necessary to focus attention on its two basic forms of manifestation: existential, associated with living abroad, and sacrificial death for the benefit of the homeland. Thus, the motif of death occupies a significant place in the lyrics of representatives of the Ukrainian diaspora. The concept of human death is closely connected with the concept of life, which is concretized through their meaningful comprehension. This is a matter of interpretation of despair and loneliness motifs, as well as the illumination of the images of a foreign land, which is one of the features of emigrant literature in general.

AB  - Remote Sensing data and techniques play a great role in quarry and mining activity monitoring: UAVs, aerials and terrestrials LiDAR and optical sensors are widely used in quarry management in evaluating extraction phases and compliancy to working stages. Environmental management of large quarry areas requires not only precise 3D data to assess yearly volume changes, but also availability of datasets useful in monitoring compliancy to natural soil consumption previsions and water/extraction waste management rules issued by public authorities.Integration of both remotely sensed and environmental information systems' data is required to define waste production indicators related to extraction activities. A novel set of indicators over Carrara extractive basin has been proposed by integrating surface and volume changes over the years with production and waste management data: the proposed indicators have been evaluated over all active quarry located in Carrara extraction basin.The indicators, integrated in a Decision Support System (DSS), can be used to classify all quarries by environmental management performances' scores, thus allowing planning of in-situ controls related to water and marble quarry/cutting waste (MQW/MCW) management according to risk management quantitative criteria.Prototyping time-varying data on dynamic maps and 3D navigation interfaces have been proposed to support environmental controls' planners in yearly extraction waste production and land cover changes monitoring.

AB  - Environmental and landscape planning of large quarry areas require precise 3D data to assess yearly volume changes. While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are widely used in single quarry 3D monitoring, large extractive areas like Carrara industrial basin require a different approach to detect yearly volume and surface changes, based on both airborne and spaceborne data.LiDAR airborne sensors allow precise terrain models' acquisition, thus requiring fairly complex planning and testing processes for each flight: high resolution satellite data are less expensive and can be acquired quickly (<1 month), allowing digital surface models (DSMs) extraction with stereo processing pipelines.A relatively recent acquisition mode offered by Airbus for the Pleiades constellation, the tri-stereo acquisition one, has been successfully used in DSM generation in dense urban areas, thus suggesting similar results even in quarry areas characterized by complex morphology.A pair of Pleiades archive images and a new tri-stereo acquisition have been granted by European Space Agency (ESA) under acceptance of a project proposal: CNES s2p Stereo Pipeline and NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline have been used in processing each image set over four sample sites (three quarries and a long-dated waste disposal site).While tri-stereo-derived digital surface models shows good agreement with LiDAR-based ones, usage of archived satellite images not natively acquired as stereo pair but with suitable B/H ratio cannot allow precise image matching due to terrain modification between the two acquisitions, thus limiting DSM reconstruction to unchanged areas.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Planning for marine ecosystems management demands spatially explicit information about structural and functional components, in a tradeoff between including the most taxa and keeping it functional. Sentinel, umbrella, and surrogate taxa are strategic for developing indexes that account for other associated species and contribute to a sustainable administration of our seas. Marine turtles feature the former species descriptions, and the knowledge on their ecology contributes to design conservation and restoration strategies in regions they occupy, such as the Gulf of Mexico. Several administrative tools exist to govern marine territories for biodiversity conservation, and assessing how these tools interact with the ecological vulnerability of endangered species is crucial for improving public policies. We assessed the spatial interactions among ecological sensitivity, vulnerability, and the potential impacts on four marine turtle species in the southern Gulf of Mexico and northwestern Caribbean Sea with territorial management tools (natural protected areas, marine priority sites, and ecoregions). A small percentage of the most vulnerable areas is inside natural protected areas, while marine priority sites include a higher percentage. We identified spatial covering gaps that need to be addressed to ensure the conservation and recovery of these endangered species in the Gulf of Mexico and proposed key regions for maximizing territorial conservation.

AB  - Multi-frequency SAR scenes were evaluated for classification purposes of successional forest stages in Eastern Amazon. Advanced Land-Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data, RADARSAT-2 (C-Band), and TERRASAR-X (X-Band) data were used independently and combined in a dual SAR system approach. An image of the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) onboard the EO-1 was used as an additional ground reference and input dataset in the classification scheme. The backscattering intensity, polarimetric features, interferometric coherence, and texture attributes were considered as input data into the random forest (RF) classification algorithm. L-band data alone performed better than C- and X- bands alone but overall accuracies remained low. The addition of polarimetric features and texture at any frequency increase classification accuracies when compared to backscattering data alone. The best combination of two SAR systems were found when considering L-band with either C- or X- band. L-band also performed best when combined with optical data indicating a high potential to provide spatial information about successional forest stages.

AB  - We present a new algorithm for retrieving fire temperature and radiative power with the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands of high resolution satellite sensors. At the SWIR bands, solar input is usually large in comparison to the thermal emission from fires. We overcome this challenge by modeling the unknown ground reflectance with a few basis functions constructed from a spectral library. The algorithm is evaluated using a synthetic dataset generated by forward modeling of the solar reflectance and thermal emission from fires, including the atmospheric effects. The retrieved fire temperature and fire radiative power show high correlation with the actual values.

T2  - HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study analyzed the effects of computerization of medical information systems and a hospital payment scheme on medical care outcomes. Specifically, we examined the effects of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and a diagnosis procedure combination/per-diem payment scheme (DPC/PDPS) on the average length of hospital stay (ALOS). Methods: Post-intervention changes in the monthly AI,OS were measured using an interrupted time-series analysis. Results: The level changes observed in the monthly ALOS immediately post-DPC/PDPS were -1.942 (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.856 to -1.028), -1.885 (95% CI, -3.176 to -0.593), -1.581 (95% CI, -3.081 to -0.082) and -2.461 (95% CI, -3.817 to 1.105) days in all ages, <50, 50-64, and >= 65 years, respectively. During the post-DPC/PDPS period, trends of 0.107 (95% CI, 0.069 to 0.144), 0.048 (95% CI, -0.006 to 0.101), 0.183 (95% CI, 0.122 to 0.245) and 0.110 (95% CI, 0.054 to 0.167) days/month, respectively, were observed. During the post-EMR period, trends of -0.053 (95% CI, -0.080 to -0.027), -0.093 (95% CI, -0.135 to -0.052), and -0.049 (95% CI, -0.087 to -0.012) days/month were seen for all ages, 50-64 and >= 65 years, respectively. Conclusions: The increasing post-DPC/PDPS trends offset the decline in ALOS observed immediately post-DPC/PDPS, and the observed ALOS was longer than the counterfactual at the end of the DPC/PDPS study periods. Conversely, due to the downward trend seen after EMR introduction, the actual ALOS at the end of the EMR study period was shorter than the counterfactual, suggesting that EMRs might be more effective than the DPC/PDPS in sustainably reducing the LOS.

TI  - Maritime Dialogue Culture: Enabling Cultural Self-Awareness
T2  - LOGOS-VILNIUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the aspects of enabling cultural self-awareness to provide reasonable prerequisites for developing a culture of dialogue in the maritime sector. Cultural self-awareness at the scientific level is possible through ontological, anthropological, and axiological studies of human existence. To foster a culture of dialogue with another individual, who is different, it is first worth getting to know oneself and giving meaning to one's conscious communication with another individual, as if with "oneself in another individual". A culture of dialogue in the maritime industry can be created by considering the individual as a subject. The traditional victim syndrome does not allow a person with an atheistic worldview to recognize others as being different from a point of view of religious culture, which is especially dear to them. However, knowledge of the science of the nation's history would provide a basis for a certain kind of tolerance. In recognition of their national self-identity as a cultural identity comprising of different nationalities and religions, future and current professionals are subject to natural mental conditions that are necessary to foster a culture of dialogue in the maritime sector.

T2  - CHUL HAK SA SANG - Journal of Philosophical Ideas
T2  - 철학사상
M3  - research-article
AB  - This research aims to examine one characteristic of the view of life-and-death in Yegi(禮記) from the ritual point of view of Thanatology’, which has become in academia recently. Through this, I examine the fundamental worldview and the view of Confucianism on life-and-death and ultimately seek the possibility that this could contribute to our current attitude toward life. In fact, Confucianism’s view on life-and-death, and its wisdom have many implications of modern people’s attitude toward life-and-death. In particular, the basic characteristic of Confucianism’s view of life-and-death is that it consistently insists on the identity and unity of life-and-death from the perspective that life and death are correspondingly with each other. These perspectives and views of Confucianism on life-and-death provide useful clues to critically consider the problems of modern biopsychology and economic index-centered well-being and well-dying craze.The view of life-and-death in Yegi(禮記) was formed, based on the tradition of ‘Bo-bon-ban-si(報本反始)’ of the Eun(殷) Dynasty, ‘Cheon-myeon-mi-sang(天命靡常)’ of the Zhou(周) Dynasty, ‘Go- jong-myoung(考終命)’ of Seo-Gyoung(書經), Cheon-myoung-gwan(天命觀) of Confucius, and the Ye-ron(禮論) of Sunja(荀子). They commonly present the virtues of filial piety in relation to the establishment of the right view of life-and-death, and the background for the nobleman to pursue it as a lifelong task has a premise for the consciousness of worries over the troubled(憂患意 識) world handed down from Pre-Confucianism and ideological clues on filial piety.In particular, transforming the concept of filial piety actively, Yegi(禮記). newly established the content and scope of life-and death which belonged to the recipient of filial piety into the value of life of subject of filial piety and its meaning. Based on this change in the notion of filial piety, the existing ancestral rites and mourning ceremony enrich the value and significance of life that are the cultivation of virtue and completion of human relations. Accordingly, the value and significance of death are also differentiated into the modes of termination and death. This time, termination means the begging and ending of a voluntary and active life centered on the morality and humanity expressed in the character of a Gunja(君子). Therefore, it can be said that the ‘Bo-bon-ban-si(報本反始)’ of filial piety in ancestral rites and mourning ceremony penetrating the human view of life from traditional rites for the gods of heaven and earth, ancestors, and ghosts in terms of practical context.The characteristics of this view of life-and-death in Yegi(禮記), make those of us who have suffered loss and death, think about how we should live a life more humane, In particular, in the modern society where death is forbidden, even the feeling of mourning is rejected and distorted. In modern situation where consciousness is gradually replaced with material, and pathological emotions appear everywhere, the healing methods and procedures for how to restore humanity are described in Yegi(禮記).

AB  - It has been pointed out that the anthropocentric worldview of Christianity is culpable for the ecological crisis. Diverse biblical and theological responses have been made to address ecological issues, one of which is the development of ecological hermeneutics. In this article, after giving an overview of the emergence of ecological readings of the Bible, I apply the hermeneutics, which is formulated by the Earth Bible Project, to the book of Zephaniah. I approach the text with suspicion (of anthropocentric bias), identification (with Earth) and an effort to retrieve the voice of Earth from the text. I measure the text against the ecojustice principles proposed by the Earth Bible Project. My reading of the Day of Yahweh as doomsday, which is the main message of the prophetic book, reveals its anthropocentric bias. Earth and Earth community become innocent victims of human-caused calamity. Apostasy and injustices on the part of the human bring divine wrath upon the whole creation, resulting in a reversal of creation. Prophetic justice does not include Earth and Earth community in the underprivileged (orphans, widows and sojourners) who are traditionally patronized by God. This picture of total destruction runs the risk of devaluing this world’s intrinsic worth. Moreover, the prophet’s descriptions and imagery of desolation of the neighboring countries after divine judgment epitomize anthropocentric pragmatism. Such an imagery may promote and legitimize the abuse of Earth and the destruction of the life-web of Earth community. I suggest that readers’ awareness of anthropocentrism embedded in biblical texts and their interpretations contributes to a better appreciation of Earth and a reformulation of more just relationship with Earth.

M3  - Case Reports
AB  - A 47-year-old female presented to the emergency department with new episodes of hematemesis. She had a background of unresectable T4b+N1+M0 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast CT thoracic aorta diagnosed a ruptured mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysm of the descending aorta, forming a life threating aorto-esophageal fistula secondary to neoplasm. Due to the high risk of fatal haemorrhage, she underwent successful emergency thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR). Mycotic aortic pseudoaneurysms are a rare and often fatal complication of esophageal carcinomas. They represent a small subsection of aorto-esophageal fistulas. Early diagnosis with cross sectional imaging and vascular control of the sentinel bleed is essential for survival. TEVAR may be used as a bridge to palliative treatment in the case of unresectable esophageal carcinoma.

TI  - Satellite-Derived AerosolCloud Relationships Under Anthropogenic Polluted Conditions of Arabian Sea
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Uncertainty associated with estimating the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on clouds is hindering accurate projections of future climate. Here, we evaluate the effect of aerosols on clouds under anthropogenic polluted conditions and relatively maritime conditions, over the Arabian Sea (AS), under the influence of the same large-scale meteorology and spatiotemporal domains. The relationship between diurnal mean cloud macrophysical properties, namely, cloud fraction (CF) and cloud top temperature (CTT) from geostationary satellite (INSAT-3D), and aerosol properties, from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), is examined for the winter months of 2018. During winter, trade winds transport large quantities of continental aerosols over to the AS, where the semipermanent field of stratocumulus cloud layers exists. We observed distinctively different cloud macrophysical properties over polluted conditions compared to maritime conditions. The strengths of aerosol & x2013;cloud interaction on CF and CTT are, respectively, 0.3 and & x2212;0.02 for polluted conditions and are 0.1 and & x2212;0.005, respectively, for maritime conditions, with an increase in the aerosol index from 0.0 to 0.6. Absorbing aerosol radiative effects at elevated layers over polluted conditions majorly drive the observed changes in cloud properties. Further analysis of Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) profiles illustrates the bimodal structure of cloud occurrence over polluted conditions. Elevated absorbing aerosol layers above stratus clouds enhance low-level cloud cover. Besides, warming due to elevated absorbing aerosols reduces intermingled cumulus cloud layers and, at the same time, enhances the development of growing cloud layers above elevated pollution layers. The observed changes in cloud macrophysical properties in relation to the mutual position of aerosol and cloud layers suggest a more complicated cloud regime-dependent process over this region.

AB  - Kim Jung-Geon (1889-1933), one of the Korean independence activists during the period of Japanese colonial rule in Korea, developed a social reform theory with his own ideology called “Wonjong (元宗)”. Wonjong was his compilation of philosophical ideologies of all ages and countries, mainly consisting of two thoughts: Geukwon (極元) and Daegonghwa Muguk (大共和無國, anarchic- republicanism) - the former refers to his cosmological worldview, and the latter is a social reform ideology. In particular, the concept of “Muguk (無國, no country)” has a key role in his ideology and is closely related to a conception of the ideal society in Taoism. In this context, we herein reviewed on distinguishable features of his “Muguk-ism (anarchism)” from the Taoism and thus obtained the following conclusions.First, the thought of Kim Jung-Geon took clear inspiration from Zhuangzi. Second, instead of merely accepting or referring to Taoist thought, he sharply criticized inherent fatalistic and passive attitudes in Taoism and built up active and practical ideology by himself. Third, as he developed the social reform ideology to save the people against the Japanese invasion in the late Joseon Dynasty, he rejected Wuwei (無為, inaction), the core concept of Taoism, but accepted Yuwei (有爲, action) to promote social reform in the real world. He did not remain as a hermit or view the world in the ideological context of Taoist philosophy; he defected to Manchuria and lead the resistance movements to achieve his ideal society and to free Korea from the Japanese military and political rule.It is concluded that Kim Jung-Geon is a very rare and creative thinker across East Asia at the time, who critically made a compilation of philosophical ideologies of all ages and countries in critical viewing and applied to the real world to establish a practical methodology. His Taoism-based social reform ideology was not limited to the Japanese rule; it is sufficiently convincing even today in light of views that point out the crisis of civilization and the need for new social reform theory in this highly industrialized modern society. Furthermore, the further studies are also needed on his position in the history of Korean Philosophy as a philosopher at the beginning of the introduction of Western philosophy.

AB  - In Korea, Yut board petroglyphs are scattered across rocky hills xnrhdlfin coastal areas. In this study, we have proved that these petroglyphs could not be used for board games, i.e. Yut nori.We suggested that the petroglyphs served as lunar clocks, indicating the time of day by the shape and position of the moon in the night sky. Additionally, we suggested that the petroglyphs appear to have played the role of a calendar displaying a monthly cycle while indicating dates of high water and low water; in other words, these petroglyphs were a clock or calendar in pre-agricultural fishing society where they functioned as a kind of astronomical instrument. We inferred that it would serve as the standard for defining the life cycle according to the four directions (east, west, north and south) and four seasons (spring, summer, autumn, and winter ) by applying the four quadrants of the Yut board petroglyphs to space and time.We postulate that these petroglyphs are evidence of an ancient Korean peninsula civilization that had an impact on the American continent, and formed the basis for a moon-centered culture traversing Korean cosmology, worldview, and lifestyle.

CP  - 26th International Conference Information Visualisation (IV)
CL  - Vienna, AUSTRIA
AB  - Visual interpretation of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images plays an important role in remote sensing mainly because SAR images enable consistent monitoring in any lighting, weather, and cloud-cover conditions. An important application of SAR visualization is water detection. We introduce a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) Encoder to detect water in Sentinel-1 SAR images. Our FCN Encoder identifies water by the intensity of each pixel and also learns the spatial information of neighborhood pixels. We apply our method on standard benchmarks and real-world SAR images. The results are assessed both visually and from the point of view of classification accuracy. Compared with other classifiers, our FCN Encoder is more accurate. From visual inspection of the Seattle water detection result, the FCN Encoder produces a very clear (smooth) output. The results show that the FCN Encoder, trained with a harder dataset and hyperparameter optimization, improves significantly its generalization performance. In a real-world application, for the prediction phase, the FCN Encoder is about 40 times faster than a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with sliding window.

TI  - Discharge Estimation With Improved Methods Using MODIS Data in Greenland: An Application in the Watson River
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greenland's river discharge has important implications for the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) mass balance, global sea-level rise, and climate change. However, the long-term and continuous in situ discharge data for Greenland are scarce. The water extent is an important proxy to estimate discharge using remote sensing, but previous studies on estimating the discharge in Greenland required the in situ reflectance data to construct the water extent and suffered from inefficient processing. Here, we derived the water extent solely from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer daily reflectance product on the google earth engine cloud platform. To improve the accuracy and efficiency, we optimized the strategies for water extent estimation and the optimal gauge pixel selection. Our improved method was applied to the Watson River. The runoff data from the regional climate model RACMO2 were employed to compare with the estimated results. Our results provide the daily discharge of the Watson River from 2002 to 2021, covering the period when field observations are unavailable. The correlation coefficient (R) and the fractional root-mean-square error (fRMSE) between the daily estimated discharge and the in situ discharge are 0.69 and 0.73, respectively, whereas the R and fRMSE are 0.85 and 0.53 at a monthly timescale, respectively. The comparisons between our results and the RACMO2 runoff data suggest that the RACMO2 may generally underestimate the annual ice sheet melt runoff but overestimates the monthly runoff in July by 30% on average. The proposed method is highly automated and efficient, and has the potential to be applied in other rivers with field measurements to provide continuous and long-term discharge observations. It contributes to a better understanding of the response of the GrIS to climate change

TI  - Quantifying the Spatiotemporal Variation of Evapotranspiration of Different Land Cover Types and the Contribution of Its Associated Factors in the Xiliao River Plain
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a vital constituent of the hydrologic cycle. Researching changes in ET is necessary for understanding variability in the hydrologic cycle. Although some studies have clarified the changes and influencing factors of ET on a regional or global scale, these variables are still unclear for different land cover types due to the range of possible water evaporation mechanisms and conditions. In this study, we first investigated spatiotemporal trends of ET in different land cover types in the Xiliao River Plain from 2000 to 2019. The correlation between meteorological, NDVI, groundwater depth, and topographic factors and ET was compared through spatial superposition analysis. We then applied the ridge regression model to calculate the contribution rate of each influencing factor to ET for different land cover types. The results revealed that ET in the Xiliao River Plain has shown a continuously increasing trend, most significantly in cropland (CRO). The correlation between ET and influencing factors differed considerably for different land cover types, even showing an opposite result between regions with and without vegetation. Only precipitation (PRCP) and NDVI had a positive impact on ET in all land cover types. In addition, we found that vegetation can deepen the limited depth of land absorbing groundwater, and the influence of topographic conditions may be mainly reflected in the water condition difference caused by surface runoff. The ridge regression model eliminates multicollinearity among influencing factors; R-2 in all land cover types was over 0.6, indicating that it could be used to effectively quantify the contribution of various influencing factors to ET. According to the results of our model calculations, NDVI had the greatest impact on ET in grass (GRA), cropland (CRO), paddy (PAD), forest (FOR), and swamp (SWA), while PRCP was the main influencing factor in bare land (BAR) and sand (SAN). These findings imply that we should apply targeted measures for water resources management in different land cover types. This study emphasizes the importance of comprehensively considering differences among various hydrologic cycles according to land cover type in order to assess the contributions of influencing factors to ET.

AB  - We reported a function design for a novel power-generation corner reflector. Built mainly by solar panels, the solar corner reflector (SCR) is designed firstly to be served as a permanent scatter point on the ground required for time series SAR interferometric processing, and secondly as a power generator and storage for attached sensors for use. Based on the results derived from the on-site experiment, clear backscatter pixels were observed from Sentinel-1 SAR image and data were stored completely in local sensor in day and night time. Since the capability of the prototype SCR was confirmed, it was expected to be of great benefit to support an interpretation of ground displacement together with InSAR analysis.

Against the background of engineering certification, we designed the ideological and political content of a course and integrated it into the teaching goal of the introduction to artificial intelligence (AI) course, considering its orientation in the training of computer science and technology. Then, we designed different integration methods to incorporate ideological content into regular teaching. Finally, we constructed assessment methods using outcome-based education (OBE) theory. We hope that through the study of this course, we can guide students to establish a correct outlook on life and values, as well as a worldview, and to become powerful successors to builders in the new era.

TI  - Quantification of Alpine Grassland Fractional Vegetation Cover Retrieval Uncertainty Based on Multiscale Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) retrieval results of high spatial resolution satellite remote sensing images are usually upscaled as training and validation data (FVCUIH) for low spatial resolution satellite remote sensing images. However, few studies have focused on the impact of the spatial scale conversion on the evaluation of FVC retrieval accuracy. In this study, we first investigated the influence of spatial scale conversion on FVC retrieval accuracy based on FVC measured by unmanned aerial vehicle (FVCUAV) at three scales (Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat-8 OLI, and MODIS). Then, the NDVI threshold method is proposed to further analyze the uncertainty caused by the underlying surface heterogeneity. The results showed that the use of FVCUIH as training and validation data in the process of spatial scale conversion led to overestimation of FVC accuracy, and its influence on FVC retrieval cannot be ignored. In addition, the uncertainty of the underlying surface heterogeneity at the measured sites increased the uncertainty of the FVC retrieval, while these results could be optimized by detecting the underlying surface heterogeneity. Our results suggested that both spatial scale conversion and underlying surface heterogeneity would cause the inaccurate FVC retrieval, while the latter could be optimized by detecting the underlying surface heterogeneity. This study provided a reference for the improvement of multiscale FVC retrieval accuracy based on single-scale FVC-measured data.

TI  - An optimized remote sensing recognition approach for straw burning in Henan Province, China
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - In the paper, Henan Province with prevalent straw burning was taken as the study case. Aimed at remote sensing recognition of the straw burning fire points in a large-scale area with complex terrain and climate conditions, an optimized recognition strategy of straw burning was proposed based on the MOD021KM data. In our new recognition strategy, the threshold determination method was optimised by systematic statistical analysis of spectral features. Then the non-straw burning fire points were eliminated by extracting the agricultural land from MCD12Q1 image. Thus, the true straw-burning fire points were determined. The results showed that the recognition accuracy of straw burning fire points was effectively improved by optimized threshold determination method.

TI  - Combining CALIPSO and AERONET Data to Classify Aerosols Globally
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Angstrom exponent (AE) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) obtained from the aerosol robotic network (AERONET) and volume depolarization ratio (VDR) obtained from the cloud-aerosol Lidar with orthogonal polarization (CALIOP) from March 2018 to February 2019 were used in our study. Data used in this study are direct observation, avoiding the limitations and uncertainties from the inversion process, and providing accurate information about the aerosol properties. Both instruments were within colocation criteria of a 40-km radius and +/- 2 h were defined as coincident cases. Six aerosol types were differentiated using the threshold method based on the AE, AOD, and VDR data. Discussion of the aerosol classification yielded the following results: 1) clean marine aerosols were the most abundant and widely distributed aerosols, followed by other types of aerosol (33.2%), polluted dust aerosols (26.8%), natural dust aerosols (2.3%), biomass burning aerosols (1.8%), and clean continental aerosols (1.1%); 2) clean marine aerosols were mainly distributed in North America and Europe, and polluted dust aerosols frequently appeared on the edges or downwind of deserts; and 3) the aerosols controlled by natural conditions (e.g., natural dust aerosols) were sensitive to seasonal variations, whereas those controlled by anthropogenic activities (e.g., polluted dust aerosols) were not. This study provides a new method for the collaborative observation of aerosol types with ground-based and satellite data. It is rare to provide annual global distribution of aerosol types and their seasonal variations; these results provide a reference for understanding the global aerosol distribution status.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - The rapid urbanization process over metropolitan cities often came with the dramatic urban land transformation of different natural land cover types into urban impervious surfaces (UIS) or UIS back to natural land covers. However, most UIS mapping studies usually focus on inter-year variation, suggesting that the urbanization process is irreversible. The rapid intra-year urban reconstruction and urban renewal are under-explored. This study develops a new algorithm for intra-year urban renewal using all available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Time series SAR and optical data are utilized for intra-year UIS change detection, i.e., to detect the changes from UIS to other land cover types. Results showed that the urban renewal process occurred within the metropolitan area, i.e., UIS changed into the bare land or vegetation. The overall accuracy and kappa of urban renewal change detection are 72.79% and 0.4599, respectively.

TI  - Change Type Recognition for SAR Images Using Statistical Bidirectional LSTM Network With Few Labeled Samples
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images has garnered significant research interest. However, to date, only the change area can be obtained, which seriously restricts further development of SAR image applications. To solve this problem, this letter proposes a change type recognition method for SAR images based on a statistical bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The proposed method can obtain the changed area and identify the land type change between pairs of SAR images. Considering the statistical characteristics and sample number of SAR images, change detection and type recognition are realized in a unified framework. First, feature extraction is performed through the statistical features of the original SAR image and difference image (DI). Then, a bidirectional LSTM network is used to identify the change types and obtain the change detection results under the small sample deep learning network. On two sets of medium-to-low resolution SAR image data and one set of GaoFen-3 high-resolution real SAR image data, our method produced high-quality results under small sample conditions.

TI  - Swallowing the Black Pill: Involuntary Celibates' (Incels) Anti-Feminism within Digital Society
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR CRIME JUSTICE AND SOCIAL DEMOCRACY
M3  - Article
AB  - Involuntary celibates (incels) are part of the online 'manosphere' and have been widely discussed in contemporary media in recent years due to their involvement in several offline mass murders. This article presents empirical data that specifically map aspects of the incel worldview: the 'black pill'. Analysis of online discussion forums demonstrates how incels believe society is ordered through a hetero-patriarchal racial hierarchy and justify their sexlessness through beliefs rooted in biological determinism and victimisation by women and feminism. It is argued that the black pill is a disciplinary device that aids in building a digital counter-public that engenders a collective incel identity. Further, the article argues that the black pill produces a form of 'stochastic terrorism' in which users interpret its spectrum of beliefs to enact harms from online gender-based hate speech through terrorist violence in the offline world. As a point of departure, the article argues that incel counter-publics transcend the false distinctions between online and offline; both 'worlds' contribute to the (re)production of incel anti-feminism and misogyny.

TI  - Comparison of Marine Gravity Measurements from Shipborne and Satellite Altimetry in the Arctic Ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the influence of sea ice on shipborne gravity measurements and the accuracy of the satellite-altimetry-derived gravity field in the Arctic Ocean, we compared shipborne gravity measurements with those obtained from satellite altimetric gravity measurements. The influence of sea ice on the shipborne gravity measurements was mainly concentrated in the 0-6 km wavelength range, and the standard deviation of the noise amplitudes was 2.62 mGal. Compared to ice-free regions, the accuracies in the region with floating ice were reduced by 13% for DTU21 and 6% for SV31. Due to the influence of sea ice, satellite altimetric gravity data lose significant information in the 9-12 km wavelength range. The coherence curve of the shipborne gravity with bathymetry was nearly the same as that of the satellite altimetric gravity. The satellite data contain nearly all of the significant information that is present in the shipborne data. The differences between the shipborne and satellite gravity data are small and can be used to study the crustal structure of the Arctic.

AB  - This article contends that Emma Donoghue's Room (2010) generates its transnational effects through its manner of narrating elements of the carceral situation which its central characters, Ma and Jack, survive. Situating Room within Donoghue's practice as a writer of historical fiction, the article studies the sources she drew on when writing her novel, the spaces the characters inhabit and the things that surround them, as well as the language used by the narrator Jack. It argues that, by focalising this narrative of coercive confinement through the worldview of a five-year-old child, Donoghue creates a text that is transnationally mobile in its approach to language, space and things.

TI  - Geopositioning Improvement of ZY-3 Satellite Imagery Integrating GF-7 Laser Altimetry Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Improving the accuracy of block adjustment with few or no ground control points (GCPs) is one of the core issues for satellite imagery high-precision mapping. The GaoFen-7 (GF-7) satellite laser altimeter system is the first Chinese formal spaceborne laser altimeter system, which is equipped with laser footprint cameras for the first time. Given the very high height accuracy and high planimetric accuracy of the instrument, this letter proposed an adjustment method of ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite imagery by integrating GF-7 laser altimetry data. The laser control points (LCPs) were automatically extracted according to the registration of the footprint images and stereo images. Furthermore, the combined adjustment was performed with the LCPs as the vertical control and horizontal constraint. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated by using 417 stereo scenes of ZY-3 images and 954 LCPs, covering an area of 158 000 km(2) in Shandong, China. The results demonstrated that, only by using all LCPs as the vertical control, the root mean square error (RMSE) of elevation can be significantly improved from the original 8.82 to 1.40 m. Moreover, the planimetric RMSE decreased from the original 15.31 to 3.58 m with residual randomness when 45 LCPs were used as the horizontal constraint. Our method provides an alternative solution for satellite imagery geopositioning improvement without GCPs.

AB  - A bridge detection method in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image based on water network construction using the graph model of Markov tree is proposed in this paper. First, branches of the water network are extracted by segmenting the sea and land using region-based level set segmentation method. All water branches are then connected by establishing the probabilistic graph model of Markov tree. Finally, the bridge bodies are recognized by merging the two contours of the adjacent branch pairs, which are represented by the edge of the Markov tree. Polarimetric SAR data acquired by RADARSAT-2 covered in Singapore is used for testing. Experimental results show that the method improves detection rate and false alarm compared to a traditional method.

TI  - An Unsupervised Port Detection Method in Polarimetric SAR Images Based on Three-Component Decomposition and Multi-Scale Thresholding Segmentation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is difficult to detect ports in polarimetric SAR images due to the complicated components, morphology, and coastal environment. This paper proposes an unsupervised port detection method by extracting the water of the port based on three-component decomposition and multi-scale thresholding segmentation. Firstly, the polarimetric characteristics of the port water are analyzed using modified three-component decomposition. Secondly, the volume scattering power and the power ratio of the double-bounce scattering power to the volume scattering power (PRDV) are used to extract the port water. Water and land are first separated by a global thresholding segmentation of the volume scattering power, in which the sampling region used for the threshold calculation is automatically selected by a proposed homogeneity measure. The interference water regions in the ports are then separated from the water by segmenting the PRDV using the multi-scale thresholding segmentation method. The regions of interest (ROIs) of the ports are then extracted by determining the connected interference water regions with a large area. Finally, ports are recognized by examining the area ratio of strong scattering pixels to the land in the extracted ROIs. Seven single quad-polarization SAR images acquired by RADARSAT-2 covering the coasts of Dalian, Zhanjiang, Fujian, Tianjin, Lingshui, and Boao in China and Berkeley in America are used to test the proposed method. The experimental results show that all ports are correctly and quickly detected. The false alarm rates are zero, the intersection of union section (IoU) indexes between the detected port and the ground truth can reach 75%, and the average processing time can be less than 100 s.

T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and timely evaluation of ecological environment change is of great significance to the sustainable development of the region. Owing to climate change and more anthropological intervention, ecological environment is deteriorating in the Yellow River Delta High-Efficiency Ecological Economic Zone (YRDHEEZ). To evaluate ecological environment change of the YRDHEEZ, a comprehensive evaluation index (CEI) was built in this investigation, which integrated vegetation cover (VC), land surface temperature (LST) and fine particulate matter ( PM2.5) concentration. The experimental results demonstrated that significant regional differences existed in the ecological environment of the YRDHEEZ from 2000 to 2018. The ecological environmental changes in most districts and counties are complex and diverse. More specifically, regions with improvement, moderate improvement and the unchanged ecological environment accounted for more than 70 % of the study area, which suggested that the ecological environment has improved. In order to further verify the validity of the CEI, a field survey was performed, and it found that the result of field survey corresponded with the CEI evaluation, which demonstrated the potential of multi-source remote sensing data to quickly monitor the change of ecological environment quality in the YRDHEEZ.

TI  - High-Spatial-Resolution Nighttime Light Dataset Acquisition Based on Volunteered Passenger Aircraft Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed nighttime light (NTL) data provides an opportunity to observe human economic activities at night. However, existing NTL remote sensing data does not sufficiently reflect human activities at a fine resolution. In this study, we obtain a set of NTL data comprising volunteered passenger aircraft nighttime remote sensing (VPAN-RS) imagery by adopting a passenger plane as the remote sensing platform and using low-cost portable photography equipment as sensors. This method demonstrates the advantages of VPAN-RS data in high spatial resolution, frequent revisits, and low cost, which can supplement existing NTL data. The dataset acquired in this study covers 16 cities in China and one city in Japan, with a spatial resolution up to meter level. The data acquisition method and processing workflow are introduced in this article. Quality assessment shows that the reprojection error of the dataset falls within the range from 5-10 pixels, and the geometric error can be within 15 m. Via a comparison to reference data derived from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor of the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (NPP) polar-orbiting satellite, we found that the VPAN-RS data provides more details of city lighting. Additionally, the radiance of the VPAN-RS data suitably fits that of monthly composite NPP/VIIRS data. We further outline an application example of VPAN-RS nighttime imagery, examine the unique challenges associated with VPAN-RS data with a focus on the influence of the image acquisition method on the data quality, and provide an outlook for the future of VPAN-RS data. We conclude that VPAN-RS NTL images are an effective data source for nighttime earth observations and have the potential for various applications.

In order to reasonably protect the lake resources and prevent the harm of algal blooms, it is necessary to predict the outbreak of algal blooms. Taking the typical eutrophic Lake Chaohu as the study area, this study constructed a method to predict the probability of algal blooms based on the satellite-derived water column-integrated algal biomass and meteorological factors. Based on MODIS/Aqua data, this study firstly retrieved the algal bloom distributions and water column-integrated algal biomass on different dates during 2003-2019. Then, we calculated the algal blooms area in the West Chaohu, Middle Chaohu and East Chaohu, identified the dates of algal blooms or non-algal blooms, and matched the corresponding satellite-derived water column-integrated algal biomass and meteorological factors data. Finally, we screened out the key factors affecting the formation of algal blooms including algal biomass, air temperature and vapor pressure, and constructed Logistic models for predicting daily algal blooms probability in different lake zones of Lake Chaohu. We found the monthly average algal biomass in different zones were almost the same in Lake Chaohu, but the proportion of days with algal blooms was high in the west and low in the east. The accuracy of the model was 90%, 85% and 89.5% for West Chaohu, Middle Chaohu and East Chaohu, respectively, and the model was also applicable to the prediction of algal bloom in winter-spring and summer-autumn seasons in 2020. Algal blooms in lakes are the results of algal proliferation along with certain meteorological conditions, so the algal bloom probability prediction method based on remote sensing algal biomass and meteorological data is scientific and reasonable, and can be applied to other eutrophic lakes such as Lake Taihu.

M3  - Article
AB  - Extraction of agricultural parcels from high-resolution satellite imagery is an important task in precision agriculture. Here, we present a semi-automatic approach for agricultural parcel detection that achieves high accuracy and efficiency. Unlike the techniques presented in previous literatures, this method is pixel based, and it exploits the properties of a spectral angle mapper (SAM) to develop customized operators to accurately derive the parcels. The main steps of the method are sample selection, textural analysis, spectral homogenization, SAM, thresholding, and region growth. We have systematically evaluated the algorithm proposed on a variety of images from Gaofen-1 wide field of view (GF-1 WFV), Resource 1-02C (ZY1-02C), and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) to aerial image; the accuracies are 99.09% of GF-1 WFV, 84.42% of ZY1-02C, 96.51% and 92.18% of GF-2, and close to 100% of aerial image; these results demonstrated its accuracy and robustness.

TI  - Quantifying the Representativeness Errors Caused by Scale Transformation of Remote Sensing Data in Stochastic Ensemble Data Assimilation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Representativeness error caused by scale transformation (REST) is an intrinsic property of data assimilation, as assimilating new observations likely involves the fusion of multisource and multiscale data. Earlier studies focused on specific cases and failed to obtain a general concept. This study attempts to achieve a further understanding of REST in both theory and practice. Based on scale-related definitions and formulations, the statistical RESTs of observation errors and analysis errors are deduced in stochastic ensemble data assimilation. Experiments based on ensemble Kalman filter are conducted to validate the interpretability of the proposed formulations. A synthetic experiment uses the stochastic Lorenz model as the forecasting operator, and a real-world experiment employs a simple biosphere model as the forecasting operator and uses a series of mixed ground-based and remote sensing soil moisture observations. The results confirm that REST should be proportional to the scale difference when assimilating direct observations and both system states and observations are homogeneous processes. Due to the nonlinearity in modeling, assimilation, and scale transformation, increasing RESTs are found if the scale of the observation is much larger than that of the state space, or multiscale observations are added into the assimilation system. Quantifying REST improves the understanding of uncertainty in data assimilation, but further studies on REST are required in both theory and practice, for example, REST correlates with other errors in forcing, parameters, and models, and introduces an observation operator to assimilate indirect observations.

TI  - Environment Monitoring of Shanghai Nanhui Intertidal Zone With Dual-Polarimetric SAR Data Based on Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can provide low-cost, frequent environment monitoring for dynamic intertidal zones. The critical problem is to realize pixel-level classification of SAR images of the intertidal zones with excellent and robust performance. Recently, deep learning, in particular deep convolutional neural networks, has provided us with promising solutions to this problem. Based on a sophisticated deep learning-based pixel-level classification model U-2-Net, we propose an MB-U-2-ACNet model suitable for intertidal zone land cover classification using dual-polarimetric SAR data integrated with environmental information, such as wind speed and tide level information. The MB-U-2-ACNet model has a multibranch nested U-shaped encoding-decoding structure. We extract and fuse features from multiple data sources, including satellite remote sensing and environmental information, by establishing the multibranch structure. Furthermore, we propose an asymmetric convolution residual U-block for each encoding-decoding stage to improve the model's feature extraction ability. Moreover, the model with attention mechanisms better distinguishes the importance of features from the channel's perspectives and spatial dimensions. We construct a dataset with 106 Sentinel-1 SAR images from 2016 to 2020 for environmental monitoring in the intertidal zone of Shanghai Nanhui. On the dataset, the proposed model reaches the overall classification accuracy of 96.40% and the mean intersection over union score of 0.8307. The experiments show the advantages of the proposed model compared with the benchmarking models due to better feature extraction and multisource information fusion. In addition, the contributions of every added substructure are analyzed systematically.

TI  - Passive Spectrum Measurement of HCHO in Chongqing Area Based on MAX-DOAS
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Formaldehyde (HCHO) greatly influences the human body, climate, and environment and is also an important intermediate product of the atmospheric photochemical reaction. As an important industrial area in Southwest China, Chongqing is the municipality with the largest population and the largest area in China. The backward energy structure and environmental protection facilities and the special terrain and climate characteristics, lead to serious air pollution. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the variation of formaldehyde concentration in Chongqing. In December 2018, a ground multi-axis differential absorption spectroscopy monitoring system MAX-DOAS) was built in Phoenix Building, Jiangbei District, Chongqing, China. Combined with the spectral processing software QDOAS, the differential slant column concentration (DSCD) of formaldehyde is retrieved by nonlinear least square fitting algorithm, and the atmospheric quality factor (AMF) is obtained by geometric approximation method. Then the slant column concentration (SCD) of formaldehyde is converted into the column concentration (VCD). The analysis showed that the daily and weekly average changes of formaldehyde were similar. The minimum and maximum average concentrations of formaldehyde VCD were 0. 982 x 10(16 )and 9. 221 x 10(16) molule . cm(-2), respectively. The average daily variation is obvious, higher in the morning and evening and the lowest at noon. It can be seen from the average weekly variation of formaldehyde VCD that the basic trend is consistent with the average daily variation. However, there was no obvious weekend effect and no obvious weekly cycle. Compared with the ground-based MAX-DOAS data and the TROPOMI observation of the satellite product (ozone monitoring instrument), the consistency between the two is good, and the correlation coefficient is 0. 84. However, the value of TROPOMI was 21. 5% lower than that of MAX-DOAS. The results show that the ground-based MAX-DOAS can provide an effective means for the real-time and rapid monitoring of urban regional pollution gases such as HCHO and the research and analysis of the change law, and can also effectively verify the satellite data sources.

TI  - Typical Landscape Tree Species Recognition Based on RedEdge-MX: Suitability Analysis of Two Texture Extraction Forms under Random Forest Supervision
T2  - POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The window size of texture feature extraction has a significant impact on the accuracy of tree species classification. The forms of all texture features share an optimal extraction window, and different types of texture features use their independent optimal extraction windows, which is conducive to tree species classification. In this study, we used a RedEdge-MX image as the data source and a random forest to determine two forms of the best texture extraction windows and construct their own best texture feature set. Then, we combined the best texture feature sets with spectral bands and the digital surface model (DSM) to analyze the difference between the two best texture extraction forms in tree species classification. The results show that the classification accuracy of the best texture feature set was significantly different between the two extraction forms. The overall accuracy of the first extraction form was 79.6365% and that of the second extraction form was 81.8915%. When they are combined with a spectral band and the DSM, the classification accuracy of the latter was higher than that of the former (between 0.4295% and 2.2248%). Hence, in the classification of tree species, the construction of the best texture feature set should be determined by the best extraction window for each feature type.

TI  - Object-Based Multigrained Cascade Forest Method for Wetland Classification Using Sentinel-2 and Radarsat-2 Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of advanced and efficient methods for mapping and monitoring wetland regions is essential for wetland resources conservation, management, and sustainable development. Although remote sensing technology has been widely used for detecting wetlands information, it remains a challenge for wetlands classification due to the extremely complex spatial patterns and fuzzy boundaries. This study aims to implement a comprehensive and effective classification scheme for wetland land covers. To achieve this goal, a novel object-based multigrained cascade forest (OGCF) method with multisensor data (including Sentinel-2 and Radarsat-2 remote sensing imagery) was proposed to classify the wetlands and their adjacent land cover classes in the wetland National Natural Reserve. Moreover, a hybrid selection method (ReliefF-RF) was proposed to optimize the feature set in which the spectral and polarimetric decomposition features are contained. We obtained six spectral features from visible and shortwave infrared bands and 10 polarimetric decomposition features from the H/A/Alpha, Pauli, and Krogager decomposition methods. The experimental results showed that the OGCF method with multisource features for land cover classification in wetland regions achieved the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 88.20% and 0.86, respectively, which outperformed the support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest (RF), and deep neural network (DNN). The accuracy of the wetland classes ranged from 75.00% to 97.53%. The proposed OGCF method exhibits a good application potential for wetland land cover classification. The classification scheme in this study will make a positive contribution to wetland inventory and monitoring and be able to provide technical support for protecting and developing natural resources.

TI  - Evaluation of Ocean Color Atmospheric Correction Methods for Sentinel-3 OLCI Using Global Automatic <i>In Situ</i> Observations
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) on Sentinel-3 is one of the most advanced ocean color satellite sensors for aquatic environment monitoring. However, limited studies have been focused on a comprehensive assessment of atmospheric correction (AC) methods for OLCI. In an attempt to fill the gap, this study evaluated seven different AC methods for OLCI using global automatic in situ observations from Aerosol Robotic Network-Ocean Color (AERONET-OC). Results showed that the POLYnomial-based algorithm applied to MERIS (POLYMER) had the best performance for bands with wavelength <= 443 nm, and the SeaDAS method based on 779 and 865 nm was the best for longer spectral bands; however, SeaDAS (SeaWiFS Data Analysis System) processing algorithm based on 779 and 1020 nm, as well as 865 and 1020 nm, obtained degraded AC performance; Case 2 Regional CoastColor (C2RCC) also produced large uncertainties; Baseline AC (BAC) method might be better than SeaDAS method; and simple subtraction method was the worst except for turbid waters. POLYMER and C2RCC underestimated high remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) at red and green bands; SeaDAS method based on 779 and 865 nm held an advantage for clear waters over the other two band combinations, while their difference turned small for turbid waters. AC uncertainties generally impacted the performance of chlorophyll retrievals. POLYMER outperformed other methods for chlorophyll retrieval. This study provides a good reference for selecting a suitable AC method for aquatic environment monitoring with Sentinel-3 OLCI.

TI  - A New Method for Direct Measurement of Polarization Characteristics of Water-Leaving Radiation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The polarization characteristics of water-leaving radiation, which contain rich information on oceanic constituents, have often been neglected. Due to the lack of suitable instruments and practical difficulties in removing strong contamination by polarized skylight, direct measurement of the polarization of water-leaving radiation remains a challenge. In this study, we designed an above-water instrument (named POLWR) to directly measure the polarization of water-leaving radiation and examined its field application in Qiandao Lake, China. Results showed that the Stokes components of water-leaving radiance (L-w) measured by POLWR were consistent with the radiative transfer (RT) simulations, with a determination coefficient (R-2) and mean relative error of 0.67 and 18.86%, respectively. The Qiandao Lake results revealed that the degree of polarization (DOP) of L-w varied from 0.05 to 0.5 within the 412-865-nm range. Moreover, a good relationship between the polarized remote sensing reflectance (R-rsp), and DOP and chlorophyll-a (C-hla) concentration was found at 368 nm in this productive lake, indicating great potential for the inversion of oceanic constituents from polarization signals. With its small size and direct measurement ability, the POLWR instrument should be widely applicable and could help improve our understanding of the polarization characteristics of water-leaving radiation and the underwater light field.

TI  - Evolution Assessment of Mining Subsidence Characteristics Using SBAS and PS Interferometry in Sanshandao Gold Mine, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground subsidence is a common geological phenomenon occurring in mining areas. As an important Chinese gold mine, Sanshandao Gold Mine has a mining history of 25 years, with remarkable ground subsidence deformation. Mining development, life security, property security and ecological protection all require comprehension of the ground subsidence characteristics and evolution in the mining area. In this study, the mining subsidence phenomenon of the Sanshandao Gold Mine was investigated and analyzed based on Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) and small baseline subset (SBAS). The SAR (synthetic aperture radar) images covering the study area were acquired by the Sentinel-1A satellite between 2018 and 2021; 54 images (between 22 February 2018 and 25 May 2021) were processed using the PSI technique and 24 images (between 11 April 2018 and 12 July 2021) were processed using the SBAS technique. In addition, GACOS (generic atmospheric correction online service) data were adopted to eliminate the atmospheric error in both kinds of data processing. The interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) results showed a basically consistent subsidence area and a similar subsidence pattern. Both InSAR results indicated that the maximum LOS (line of sight) subsidence velocity is about 49 mm/year. The main subsidence zone is situated in the main mining area, extending in the northwest and southeast directions. According to the subsidence displacement of several representative sites in the mining area, we found that the PSI result has a higher subsidence displacement value compared to the SBAS result. Mining activities were accompanied by ground subsidence in the mining area: the ground subsidence phenomenon is exacerbated by the increasing mining quantity. Temporally, the mining subsidence lags behind the increase in mining quantity by about three months. In summary, the mining area has varying degrees of ground subsidence, monitored by two reliable time-series InSAR techniques. Further study of the subsidence mechanism is necessary to forecast ground subsidence and instruct mining activities.

TI  - Ultrahigh-Resolution (250 m) Regional Surface PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Derived First From MODIS Measurements
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth from different satellite sensors are widely used to estimate surface PM2.5 concentrations. However, these products generally have coarse resolutions, limiting the ability to evaluate PM2.5 concentrations in urban regions where the human activities are relatively high. This study first develops an ensemble machine learning approach to produce PM2.5 concentrations with an extremely high spatial resolution of 250 m, based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) measurements of top-of-atmosphere reflectance and related meteorological variables. The Yangtze River Delta region, with one of the highest levels of PM2.5 pollution in China, is the study region chosen. The model shows a very high and stable performance with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.90, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 12.0 mu g/m(3), a mean prediction error (MPE) of 7.8 mu g/m(3), and a mean relative prediction error (RPE) 16.9% for sample-based cross validation. The model can accurately capture the distribution patterns and magnitudes of PM2.5 concentrations over the study region for seasonal mean, daily variations, and different levels of air pollution. The very high resolution of the model has the advantage of capturing the uneven spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations at small spatial scales and identifying small areas with very high PM2.5 concentrations, offering a possible approach for locating the sources of PM2.5 emissions. In general, the model developed here estimates very well PM2.5 concentrations at a very high spatial resolution, providing detailed information, useful for air-pollution-related studies, as well as pollution monitoring and evaluation by governments, especially in urban and urban-center areas.

TI  - The efficacy of <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-rituximab as a tracer for sentinel lymph node biopsy in cutaneous melanoma patients
T2  - ANNALS OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The sentinel lymph node (SLN) status is a vital prognostic factor for malignant melanoma (MM) patients. There is increasing evidence that a radioactive agent, rather than its combination with blue dye, is sufficient for a SLN biopsy (SLNB). Thus, we discussed the efficacy of Tc-99m-rituximab as a tracer in MM patients.Methods: A total of 502 consecutive patients with MM who underwent SLNB were enrolled in this study. All participants were peritumorally injected with Tc-99m-rituximab before imaging, and scanned with singlephoton emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) to detect the number and location of the SLN. A gamma detection probe was employed to detect radioactive SLNs in operation. Follow up was conducted to observe whether nodal or distant recurrence occurred.Results: The SLNs were successfully imaged via SPECT-CT and harvested from all 502 participants. No drainage tube was indwelled and 32 (6.3%) participants experienced the following complications: seroma (n=26, 5.2%), wound infections or lymphangitis (n=6, 1.2%), sensory nerve injuries (n= 4, 0.8%). There were 380 patients who were diagnosed as SLN-negative and 122 (24.2%) were SLN-positive. A total of 85 SLN-positive patients received complete lymph node dissection, and 28 (32.9%) had additional positive lymph nodes. During a median follow-up of 24 months, 28 participants were found to have a false negative (FN) SLN. The FN rate was 18.7%. A higher T stage was a predictive factor for FN [odds ratio (OR) 1.77; P<0.05]. There was no significant difference in the positive or FN rate between the acral and cutaneous groups.Conclusions: The radiopharmaceutical Tc-99m-rituximab could be employed as a simple and safe tracer in acral and cutaneous melanoma SLN biopsies.

TI  - SI-SA GAN: A Generative Adversarial Network Combined With Spatial Information and Self-Attention for Removing Thin Cloud in Optical Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - In agricultural remote sensing monitoring, climate often affects the quality of optical remote sensing image data acquisition. The acquired satellite imagery results usually contain cloud information, leading to a lack of ground data information. Unlike thick clouds, the semi-transparent nature of thin clouds prevents thin clouds from completely obscuring the ground scene. In order to remove thin clouds in the cultivated land and restore the actual ground information as much as possible, we proposed a cloud removal method of spatial information fusion self-attention generative adversarial network (SI-SA GAN) based on multi-directional perceptual attention and self-attention mechanism. The proposed method identifies and focuses on cloud regions using spatial attention, channel attention, and self-attention mechanism, which can enhance image information. The modules of the discriminator utilize residual networks and self-attention non-local neural networks to guide image information output. The generative adversarial network (GAN) is applied to remove clouds and restore the corresponding irregular occlusion area according to the depth characteristics of the input information. A gradient penalty is applied to improve the robustness of the generative network. In this paper, we compared the evaluation indexes of other advanced models. The qualitative and quantitative results of Sentinel-2A and public RICE datasets confirmed that the proposed method could enhance image quality effectively after cloud removal. The model has excellent thin cloud removal performance with small-scale training data.

TI  - Development of a 250-m Downscaled Land Surface Temperature Data Set and Its Application to Improving Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration Over Large Landscapes in Northern China
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) is critical for retrieving terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET); however, its availability is limited by low spatial resolution and inclement weather conditions. This study develops a spatio-temporal regression strategy that can downscale 1-km Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product to 250-m resolution and simultaneously gap-fill the missing values. The proposed methodology synergistically uses random forest (RF) model and geographically weighted regression, which are, respectively, available for demonstrating the nonlinear correlation between LST and explanatory variables and for calibrating the RF-derived residuals. The study is conducted across a region of similar to 1.49 million square kilometers in northern China. The coupled model creates a 250-m spatial resolution LST product with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.32 and 1.87 K when compared with field observations and reference Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LST, respectively. Meanwhile, it minimizes the constraint of LST availability due to inclement weather conditions with RMSE of 2.69 and 2.31 K relative to field observations and reference images, respectively. The results further reveal that remote-sensing-derived ET using the 250-m downscaled LST data is fairly accurate with the relative errors of 6%-9% as evaluated with flux measurements. The 250-m modeled ET retrievals exhibit a more intense hydrological response to the water use conditions compared with the 1-km remotely sensed ETs and Noah land surface model ETs. This study may benefit land surface hydrology research and water resource management.

AB  - This paper develops a novel deep learning-based model for quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE). In this model, the multi-channel microwave Brightness Temperature (TBV and TBH) and Polarization Difference (PD = TBV - TBH) from the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) aboard the FY-3D satellite are used as predictor variables for QPE. An observational database built from the Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) is employed as reference to train the deep learning model. In order to assess the model performance, an independent test dataset is used, and the results show that the model is computationally efficient and the derived QPE is highly consistent with IMERG product. The encouraging results also indicate that PD can enhance the precipitation estimation performance compared to using the TB only.

AB  - The microwave humidity and temperature sounder (MWHTS) carried by FY-3D meteorological satellite is used to observe the vertical distribution of global atmospheric humidity, water vapor content, rainfall and other space meteorological data all day and all-weather, which plays an important role in atmospheric detection. In this paper, based on Tensorflow deep learning framework, using FY-3D satellite MWHTS data, we established precipitation inversion system from the perspective of neural network and random forest, and verified it with GPM rainfall product. The results show that both random forest (RFR) and neural network (MLP) model are feasible in precipitation inversion, The MSE is 1.76 and 1.84 respectively and the R2 is 0.79 and 0.78 respectively over ocean area. As the representative of ensemble learning, random forest has higher robustness and generalization ability. At the same time, it also displays that observation data of FY-3D MWHTS can show high application value in precipitation inversion.

TI  - Precipitation Retrieval From Fengyun-3D MWHTS and MWRI Data Using Deep Learning
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, two multitask deep learning models, multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are constructed to detect precipitation flags and retrieve precipitation rates simultaneously over the Northwest Pacific area. The retrieval results are verified by integrated multisatellite retrievals for GPM. Compared with using a single payload, the results show the retrieval advantages of incorporating two microwave spaceborne payloads (microwave humidity and temperature sounder and microwave radiation imager). In addition, each separated task in multitasking deep learning models can outperform the single-task models. The MAE values of MLP and CNN are decreased by 0.05 and 0.04 mm/h, respectively. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to extend the application of these models, which demands extracting the features learned from a certain area to other areas characterized by different precipitation features. A flexible network framework is developed with two transfer learning (TL) methods (freeze and fine-tuning) to tackle this problem. The pretrained models (MLP and CNN) are trained from the Northwest Pacific area, whereas the transferred models are applied to the Northeast Pacific area. The encouraging results show that the performance of the TL model using the fine-tune method has exceeded that of the comparison model without TL, which is trained by four times more data. The main advantage of using TL is the time reduction and efficiency improvements.

TI  - Object Detection in Large-Scale Remote Sensing Images With a Distributed Deep Learning Framework
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the accumulation and storage of remote sensing images in various satellite data centers, the rapid detection of objects of interest from large-scale remote sensing images is a current research focus and application requirement. Although some cutting-edge object detection algorithms in remote sensing images perform well in terms of accuracy, their inference speed is slow and requires high hardware requirements that are not suitable for real-time object detection in large-scale remote sensing images. To address this issue, we propose a fast inference framework for object detection in large-scale remote sensing images. On the one hand, we introduce alpha-IoU Loss on the YWCSL model to implement adaptive weighted loss and gradient, which achieves 64.62% and 79.54% mAP on DIOR-R and DOTA test sets, respectively. More importantly, the inference speed of the YWCSL model reaches 60.74 FPS on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080Ti, which is 2.87 times faster than the current state-of-the-art one-stage detector S(2)A-Net. On the other hand, we build a distributed inference framework to enable fast inference on large-scale remote sensing images. Specifically, we save the images on HDFS for distributed storage and deploy the YWCSL model to the Spark cluster. When using 5 nodes, the speedup of the cluster reaches 9.54, which is 90.80% higher than the theoretical linear speedup (5.00). Our distributed inference framework for large-scale remote sensing images significantly reduces the dependence of object detection on expensive hardware resources, which has important research significance for the wide application of object detection in remote sensing images.

TI  - Arctic Sea Ice Classification Based on CFOSAT SWIM Data at Multiple Small Incidence Angles
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice type is the key parameter of Arctic sea ice monitoring. Microwave remote sensors with medium incidence and normal incidence modes are the primary detection methods for sea ice types. The Surface Wave Investigation and Monitoring instrument (SWIM) on the China-France Oceanography Satellite (CFOSAT) is a new type of sensor with a small incidence angle detection mode that is different from traditional remote sensors. The method of sea ice detection using SWIM data is also under development. The research reported here concerns ice classification using SWIM data in the Arctic from October 2019 to April 2020. Six waveform features are extracted from the SWIM echo data at small incidence angles, then the distinguishing capabilities of a single feature are analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance. The classifiers of the k-nearest neighbor and support vector machine are established and chosen based on single features. Moreover, sea ice classification based on multi-feature combinations is carried out using the chosen KNN classifier, and optimal combinations are developed. Compared with sea ice charts, the overall accuracy is up to 81% using the optimal classifier and a multi-feature combination at 2 degrees. The results reveal that SWIM data can be used to classify sea water and sea ice types. Moreover, the optimal multi-feature combinations with the KNN method are applied to sea ice classification in the local regions. The classification results are analyzed using Sentinel-1 SAR images. In general, it is concluded that these multifeature combinations with the KNN method are effective in sea ice classification using SWIM data. Our work confirms the potential of sea ice classification based on the new SWIM sensor, and highlight the new sea ice monitoring technology and application of remote sensing at small incidence angles.

TI  - Hybrid Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network for Detecting Landscape Pattern Evolution From Long-Term Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The remote sensing time series change detection algorithm based on the pixel or single landscape patch ignores the change analysis of spatial structure information. Inspired by graph convolutional network (GCN) modeling, a set of landscapes (nodes) and their relationships (edges) are proposed. In this study, a parallel strategy in spatial-GCN and progressive strategy in temporal-GCN, called the hybrid GCN model network as a holistic framework, was proposed to accurately capture both spatial and temporal variations in landscape patterns based on yearly Landsat time series. A superpatch (i.e., fixed patch class surrounded by a one-hop neighbor patch) was selected as the input of the GCN network. First, a spatial-GCN model with three parallel graph convolutional layers was adopted to classify landscape pattern types. Three dominant categories of landscape patterns over the past three decades have been identified. Second, four landscape metrics in superpatches were proposed for the quantitative characterization of changes in landscape patterns. Finally, a temporal-GCN model with two progressive graph convolutional layers was used to detect six types of patch changes, which were applied to continuously detect the landscape pattern evolution processes. Regardless of the spatial-GCN and temporal-GCN, they provided satisfactory performance using the training and validation sets with overall accuracy >92% and Kappa coefficient >0.90, and loss values converging to 0.049 and 0.128, respectively, based on NLLLoss function until 500 epochs. It is believed that the hybrid GCN model has great potential for mining possible implicit spatiotemporal relationships and future evolution of landscape patterns.

TI  - Temporal effects of climate factors on vegetation growth on the Qingzang Plateau, China
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims The relationships between temporal changes in vegetation growth and climate change tend to be asymmetric. Considering the temporal effects of climate factors on vegetation growth can provide important scientific basis for accurately understanding vegetation-climate relationships and predicting the dynamic responses of vegetation to global climate change.Methods Based on the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), climate, and vegetation type data, this study investigated the temporal effects of climate factors on vegetation growth and the dominant factors influencing vegetation growth on the Qingzang Plateau through establishing four temporal effects equations between climate and vegetation NDVI.Important findings Among the four temporal effects, models considering both time lag and accumulation effects had the highest explanation degree (47%). Compared with model without considering temporal effect, the explanation power of the time lag and accumulation effects on vegetation would increase by 4%-18%. Vegetation dynamics on more than 43% of the Qingzang Plateau was dominated by the combined effects of time lag and accumulation, followed by the area only affected by time accumulation or lag effects, and the area without time effect. The partial correlation coefficient between NDVI and precipitation (0.25 +/- 0.56) was overall higher than it between NDVI and temperature (0.08 +/- 0.6). The areas dominated by the precipitation were mainly distributed on the northeast and southwest of the Qingzang Plateau with an area ratio of 40.1%, whereas the areas dominated by temperature were largely distributed on the center and southeast of the Qingzang Plateau with an area ratio of 29.7%. These research results can provide basic judgments for the relationships between vegetation growth and climate on the Qingzang Plateau.

TI  - Thermal Hydraulic Disaggregation of SMAP Soil Moisture Over the Continental United States
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A thermal hydraulic disaggregation of soil moisture (THySM) algorithm was implemented to downscale NASA's soil moisture active passive (SMAP) enhanced soil moisture (SM) product to 1 km over the continental United States (CONUS). This algorithm was developed by combining thermal inertia theory with a soil hydraulic-based approach that considers fine-scale SM spatial distribution driven by both heat fluxes and hydraulic conductivity in soils. Relative soil wetness values were estimated using land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index for the thermal inertia model and using soil properties for the hydraulic model. The relative soil wetness values at 1 km from both models were then combined by using weighting functions whereby the spatial distribution of SM was governed more by thermal fluxes during times of strong heat transport and infiltration during moisture abundant soil conditions. THySM values were evaluated using in situ SM measurements from SMAP Core Validation Sites (CVS), the US Department of Agriculture Soil Climate Analysis Network, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Climate Reference Network over CONUS. THySM shows higher accuracy than the SMAP / Sentinel-1 (SPL2SMAP_S) 1 km SM product when compared to in situ measurements. The accuracy of THySM is 0.048 m(3)/m(3) based on unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), outperforming SPL2SMAP_S by 0.01-0.02 m(3)/m(3). The ubRMSE of THySM 1 km SM over the SMAP grassland/rangeland-dominated CVS sites is better than 0.04 m(3)/m(3), which meets the SMAP mission SM accuracy requirement applied at 9 and 36 km.

AB  - This paper proposes an ASynchronous Autoregressive Prediction (ASAP) method for satellite anomaly detection. We empirically observe that a single classification model can hardly detect unknown anomalous situations and neglect the Markov nature of temporal satellite data. To address this, we adopt an autoregressive model to deal with the prediction of unknown anomaly for satellite data. We further propose a non-uniform temporal encoding method for asynchronous data and a median filtering method for more accurate detection. To reduce the effect of outliers, we employ an adaptive threshold selection method to achieve a more robust classification boundary. Experiments on real satellite data demonstrate that the proposed ASAP method outperforms the baseline classification method by 55.79%.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, an effectively variational pansharpening method with spectral gradient fidelity and spatial Hessian hyper-Laplacian sparsity constraints (PSGFSHHS) was proposed to fuse the low resolution multispectral (LRMS) and panchromatic (Pan) images to the high resolution multispectral (HRMS) image. First, the spectral feature correlation prior between LRMS and HRMS was modeled by the spectral gradient fidelity constraint. Second, the spatial correlation prior between Pan and HRMS was particularly modeled by the spatial Hessian hyper-Laplacian sparsity constraint from the statistical perspective, which clearly held strong novelty for pansharpening recently by the spatial Hessian hyper-Laplacian sparsity modeling. Third, by combining the spectral gradient fidelity constraint and the spatial Hessian hyper-Laplacian sparsity constraint, the PSGFSHHS model was formed and the alternating direction method of multipliers method was utilized for optimization. Finally, the experimental fusion examples clearly illustrated the effectiveness and capability of PSGFSHHS.

TI  - STUDY ON SNOW COVER CHANGE BASED ON THE FUSION OF SENTINEL-2 AND MODIS IMAGES

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - Snow cover is one of the features that change rapidly on the surface, and remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolution is an important means to monitor the dynamic changes of snow. However, due to the limitation of satellite conditions, it is difficult to acquire remote sensing images with both high temporal and spatial resolution at the same time. The classical Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) breaks through the limitations of a single sensor and effectively brings into play the complementary advantages of different observation platforms. In this paper, we take the Babao River Basin within the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau as the study area to investigate the effect of fusion of Sentinel-2 and MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) based on the ESTARFM and analyze the fusion-supplemented snow accumulation period data. The results show that the fusion effect of Sentinel-2 and MODIS is good in terms of visual and multiple quantitative indicators. The snow accumulation area of the fused image is also close to the real image. By fusing to supplement the missing Sentinel-2 data, a variation map of snow NDSI (Normalized Difference Snow Index) in the study area was obtained. It was found that the snowfall process in the watershed appeared first in the surrounding uplands and then in the flat areas, and the maximum rate of snow cover area change was 116.17 km(2). Therefore, the spatiotemporal data fusion of Sentinel-2 and MODIS based on ESTARFM algorithm can provide reliable satellite remote sensing data with a higher spatiotemporal resolution for snow accumulation change monitoring.

TI  - PSTAF-GAN: Progressive Spatio-Temporal Attention Fusion Method Based on Generative Adversarial Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion aims to integrate multisource remote sensing images with complementary high spatial and temporal resolutions, so as to obtain time-series high spatial resolution fused images. Currently, deep learning (DL)-based spatio-temporal fusion methods have received broad attention. However, on one hand, most of the existing DL-based methods train the model in a band-by-band manner, ignoring the correlations among bands. On the other hand, the general coarse spatio-temporal changes in low spatial resolution images (e.g., MODIS) calculated at the pixel domain cannot completely cover the fine spatio-temporal changes in high spatial resolution images (e.g., Landsat), due to complex surface features and the general large spatial resolution ratio between fine and coarse images. Besides, the existing DL-based spatio-temporal fusion methods are insufficient in exploring multiscale information by only stacking convolutional kernels with different sizes. To alleviate the above challenges, we propose a progressive spatio-temporal attention fusion model in a multiband training manner based on generative adversarial network (PSTAF-GAN). Specifically, we design a flexible multiscale feature extraction architecture to extract multiscale feature hierarchies. Then, spatio-temporal changes are calculated on the feature domain in different feature hierarchies. Besides, a spatio-temporal attention fusion architecture is proposed to fuse the spatio-temporal changes and ground details in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can explore multiscale information more sufficient and gradually recover the target image. The results of quantitative and qualitative experiments on two publicly available benchmark datasets show that the proposed PSTAF-GAN can achieve the best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Fusing Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 Data for River Water Mapping Using Multidimensional Weighted Fusion Method
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - River water extent is critical for understanding river discharge or its hydrological conditions. Although numerous methods have been proposed to map river water from either optical or synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remotely sensed images, uncertainties still exist broadly. In this study, we developed an image fusion method that integrates Landsat-8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 images simultaneously for river water mapping with two major steps. Firstly, a posterior probability support vector machine (SVM) model was adopted to generate water probability maps from each individual image; and second, a multidimensional weighted fusion method (MDWFM) was developed to fuse these probability maps. Four reaches with different characteristics were selected as case study sites. High-resolution aerial images were acquired and used as the reference to evaluate our results. We found that the fusion process not only improves the quality of river water mapping but also excludes the cloud interference. The fused river water maps become more reliable after the conflicts from difference images being solved by the proposed MDWFM method that contains a proportional conflict redistribution rule. The weighted root mean square difference was reduced to 0.066, and the area under the ROC curve reached up to 0.984. The critical success index (CSI), kappa coefficient (KC), and F-measure reached up to 0.810, 0.836, and 0.895, respectively. These stable and accurate river extent mapping results obtained through fusing multiple images with high spatial resolution (SR) (10 m) and short revisit interval (0.4-4.4 days) are of great significance for enriching the data and methodology of hydrological studies.

AB  - Forest height is a key parameter of forest spatial structure, which is useful for forest management and ecosystem modelling. High resolution stereo images of satellite can be used to reconstruct the surface of ground objects. The objective of this study is to estimate the coniferous forest height combining stereo images of Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite and digital terrain model (DTM) extracted from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR). The study site is characterized by boreal coniferous forest located in the northern China. The dense point cloud from stereo images was normalized by subtracting the LiDAR DTM. The forest height was estimated by linear regression between the extracted features of normalized point cloud and the field measurements of stand height. The results shown that the values of estimated height were high correlated with the height percentile of 50% (R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 2.34m). The stereo images of GF-7 satellite have the great potential for regional forest monitoring.

TI  - Estimation and Spatiotemporal Variation Analysis of Net Primary Productivity in the Upper Luanhe River Basin in China From 2001 to 2017 Combining With a Downscaling Method
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Luanhe River Basin is a significant ecological barrier guarding the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region in China. Quantitative measures of vegetation productivity can be used to assess ecosystem carbon sequestration capacity and monitor regional ecological environmental health. Although several vegetation productivity products have been generated, poor spatiotemporal resolution limits their application in ecosystem service assessment. In this article, vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) from 2000 to 2017 with a resolution of 30 m in the upper Luanhe River Basin was generated based on a data fusion model and the multisource data synergized quantitative (MuSyQ) NPP model. Then, the variation trend of NPP and its climate controls were analyzed. Compared with forest NPP observation data, we derived an R-2 of 0.68 and the root-mean-square error of 81.70 gC(.)m(-2.)yr(-1). Annual NPP had a fluctuating increasing trend from 2001 to 2017, with values ranging between 3.43 and 5.00 TgC(.)yr(-1), with an annual increase trend of 0.04 TgC(.)yr(-1). Precipitation was significantly correlated with NPP in the upper part of the Luanhe River basin, which is an important reason for the interannual variation of NPP. Grassland had a stronger correlation to precipitation than forest because it is more sensitive to precipitation. The area where the temperature is significantly correlated with annual NPP only accounts for 2% of the study area, indicating that temperature has a weak influence on NPP. Furthermore, human activities, such as forest management, fertilization, and irrigation, can change the trend of annual NPP.

TI  - The Challenge of Surface Type Changes Over the Aral Sea for Satellite Remote Sensing of Precipitation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent false signals of precipitation in satellite passive microwave retrievals over the Aral Sea have been identified as being caused by an outdated surface database. The database includes the surface type, elevation, and the percentage of the primary surface type in each grid. It was also found that the grid resolution of 1/6 degree (similar to 18 km at the equator) of the outdated surface datawas too coarse to process global precipitation measurement mission microwave imager data, which have a field of view resolution of 31.68 km(2) for channels at 89, 166.5, and 183.31 GHz). In this article, we generated a new surface database at a resolution of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees (similar to 5.6 km at the equator). Using the new surface data, the false precipitation problem above is addressed. At the same time, the retrieval accuracy for other parameters such as total precipitable water over the Aral sea is significantly improved as well. The resolution of the database is suitable for most microwave and infrared sounding measurements of atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles as well as precipitation. By comparing this new surface data against the outdated surface data, we also see the loss of permanent ice in Antarctica and a dramatic reduction of water surface over the Aral sea. Using a 40-year record of remote sensing data, we can observe the steady decrease in size of the Aral sea, as a result of regional water use policies and natural climate change.

TI  - Super-Resolution of GF-1 Multispectral Wide Field of View Images via a Very Deep Residual Coordinate Attention Network
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - GF-1 multispectral wide field of view (WFV) images, with a spatial resolution of 16 m, have been widely used in Earth monitoring. However, the spatial details provided by WFV images are not sufficient for many applications. Thus, this letter proposes a novel WFV image super-resolution (SR) algorithm called Gaofen residual coordinate attention network (GFRCAN) based on a very deep residual coordinate attention network. To form a very deep network, the residual-in-residual (RIR) structure consisting of several residual groups (RGs) with long skip connections is used. Meanwhile, the residual coordinate attention block (RCOAB) and adaptive multiscale spatial attention module (AMSA) are incorporated to focus on the high-frequency information and multiscale features adaptive weighted fusion. Besides, the spectral and spatial details of SR images are improved by incorporating peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index (SSIM) into the loss function. Both subjective and objective evaluation results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Radiometric Principle-Based Radiometric Normalization Method for SAR Images Mosaic
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiometric normalization (RN) minimizes the radiometric inconsistencies between images in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) mosaic images. However, the radiometric principle of SAR has not been fully considered by the existing methods. To this issue, a radiometric-principle-based RN (RPRN) method is proposed. First, image areas with consistent coverage areas in object space and approximate rough ground surface between images are extracted as adjustment candidates based on the imaging principle. Then, considering the radiometric characteristic of SAR image, all the images are taken as a whole to solve the radiometric adjustment model, which transfers RN into the least-square optimization. Finally, a global quantization strategy is used to ensure radiometric consistency during orthorectification and mosaicking. The experimental results of Gaofen-3 SAR images demonstrate that the proposed method has the best performance and can effectively and stably eliminate the radiometric differences between images.

AB  - In this paper, deep learning methods are applied to predict positive cases reported in Wuhan and four states in USA. Recurrent neural network based on long-short term memory (LSTM) and its variants including bidirectional LSTM, stacked LSTM and traditional SEIR model are applied on Wuhan dataset to compare and select the best model in task of predicting positive cases. The results reveal that our models based on LSTM significantly perform better than traditional SEIR model. Besides, since bidirectional LSTM can learn information from history and future, it achieves the highest prediction accuracy. Then we use bidirectional LSTM to make prediction on another USA dataset, which contains more recent data. The bidirectional LSTM shows its power and accuracy on this data, which demonstrates its effectiveness on predicting COVID-19 positive cases once again. The model we proposed alos provide some insight into the research of epidemics and the understanding of the spread of the COVID-19.

AB  - ZY-1 02D satellite is an important satellite in China space infrastructure planning. The Land Satellite Remote Sensing Application Center of the Ministry of Natural Resources of the People's Republic of China (LASAC) undertook the construction of the satellite hyperspectral data processing system and produced surface reflectance products. Reflectance is the basis of hyperspectral remote sensing data application, which is directly related to the efficiency and quality of hyperspectral application. At present, there is no comprehensive and in-depth study on the accuracy evaluation of the atmospheric correction reflectance of ZY1 - 02D satellite hyperspectral data. In view of this problem, Accuracy Verification of LASAC products using accuracy, precision, uncertainty, spectral curve correlation and spectral angle chord four indicators based on surface reflectance produced by AERONET ground measured data. The results show that the average values of accuracy, precision, uncertainty of LASAC products are 3.2 %, 2.02 % and 4.13 %, respectively. The spectral curve correlation and spectral chord angle are 0.998 and 0.979, respectively. The research result can provide technical reference for the processing and application of ZY1 - 02D hyperspectral image surface reflectance products.

AB  - Globalized surface coverage, environmental monitoring and other earth system science and high-quality global surface coverage monitoring applications urgently need basic hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance data to support. Spectral reflectance is the core data product of hyperspectral satellite remote sensing data, which is directly related to the application efficiency and quality of hyperspectral satellite. Due to the differences in spectral range, resolution width, central wavelength and other factors between multispectral and hyperspectral remote sensing images, the fusion processing of hyperspectral and multispectral remote sensing images is extremely difficult. In this study, the idea of normalization of physical parameters is adopted. Based on the remote sensing data of multi-source satellites such as GF5, GF1WFV and ZY3, the physical parameters of GF series satellites are fused to improve the spatial resolution of hyperspectral remote sensing images while the physical parameters of surface parameters are maintained. According to the fusion quality evaluation results of noise, information entropy, clarity, spectral angle cosine, correlation coefficient and root mean square error, the fusion results are consistent with the original numerical performance. The noise level, information entropy and clarity index of GF5 and ZY3 fusion are better. The spectral angle cosine, correlation coefficient and root mean square error index of GF5 and GF1 fusion are better. This study provides a new way and method for high-precision and quantitative processing of hyperspectral remote sensing data.

AB  - Multiple satellite data can provide rich information for time series leaf area index (LAI) inversion. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has been widely applied to capture long time dependencies from sequential data and solve the problem of vanishing (or exploding) gradients. It's feasible to retrieve time series LAI based on the LSTM algorithm. In this study, an LSTM model was built based on MODIS reflectance and a fused LAI from three satellite LAI products, including GLASS, MODIS and GEOV2 LAI. Then, time series LAI was obtained from the LSTM model coupled with reflectance data. Finally, the retrieval results were validated against fine resolution LAI reference maps and compared with the three LAI products. The accuracy of the proposed LSTMfusion LAI was best (R-2=0.85, RMSE=0.69) among all the LAI estimations. In addition, the comparison among the temporal profiles of LSTMfusion LAI and the three global LAI products illustrated that the proposed model was able to efficiently generate time series LAI, which was more continuous and smoother than MODIS and VIIRS LAI.

TI  - Bi-LSTM Model for Time Series Leaf Area Index Estimation Using Multiple Satellite Products
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series leaf area index (LAI) is essential to studying vegetation dynamics and climate changes. The LAI at current status can be regarded as the accumulative consequence of the counterpart at prior times. Although the deep learning (DL) algorithm, long short-term memory (LSTM), can capture long-time dependencies from sequential satellite data for time series LAI estimation, it only uses the information at prior statuses and neglects the backward propagation of current vegetation change information. Thus, the LSTM-based LAI quality might be limited. In this letter, the bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) approach was proposed to integrate the information of multiple satellite products from both the past and future for temporal LAI retrieval. The fused values from Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS), moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), and visible infrared imaging radiometer (VIIRS) LAI products, as well as MODIS reflectance in 2014-2015, serve as the output response and input for the Bi-LSTM training. Then, we compared the Bi-LSTM predictions with the counterparts from the LSTM, the fused LAI, and three products using independent validation datasets in 2016. Results illustrated that our proposed Bi-LSTM method achieved better performance with higher accuracy (R-2 = 0.84 and RMSE = 0.76) when compared to the LSTM estimation (R-2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 0.82) and LAI products (R-2 < 0.68 and RMSE > 1). Furthermore, our proposed method provided smoother and more continuous temporal profiles of LAI than other retrieval approaches.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice motion is an essential parameter when determining sea ice deformation, regional advection, and the outflow of ice from the Arctic Ocean. The Robeson Channel, which is located between Ellesmere Island and northwest Greenland, is a narrow but crucial channel for ice outflow. Only three Eulerian sea ice motion products derived from ocean/sea ice reanalysis are available: GLORYS12V1, PSY4V3, and TOPAZ4. In this study, we used Lagrangian ice motion in the Robeson Channel derived from Sentinel-1 images to assess GLORYS12V1, PSY4V3, and TOPAZ4. The influence of the presence of ice arches, and wind and tidal forcing on the accuracies of the reanalysis products was also investigated. The results show that the PSY4V3 product performs the best as it underestimates the motion the least, whereas TOPAZ4 grossly underestimates the motion. This is particularly true in regimes of free drift after the formation of the northern arch. In areas with slow ice motion or grounded ice floes, the GLORYS12V1 and TOPAZ4 products offer a better estimation. The spatial distribution of the deviation between the products and ice floe drift is also presented and shows a better agreement in the Robeson Channel compared to the packed ice regime north of the Robeson Channel.

AB  - Net primary productivity (NPP) is an important factor to judge the quality of ecosystem and carbon sink, and reflects the production capacity and ecological process of plant community, which is of great significance for regulating global carbon balance and enhancing ecological services. Based on MODIS satellite remote sensing data and improved CASA model, the dynamic changes of forest vegetation NPP in Yichun and the main affecting factors such as temperature, precipitation, and human activities were analyzed by using MOD17A3HGF NPP annual data and meteorological data from 2000 to 2019. The results showed that, from 2000 to 2019, the average NPP of forests in Yichun was 477.76 g C.m(-2).a(-1), and the NPP was mainly in the range of 400-500 g C.m(-2).a(-1), accounting for 83.30% of the total in Yichun, showing the distribution characteristics of partly high in the north and south, average in the middle, and lowest in Jiayin and Tieli Plain. The deciduous broad-leaved forest in Yichun had the highest contribution to the area with high NPP value, followed by evergreen coniferous forest. The main NPP value of coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest was at the average level of NPP in Yichun, while the area of deciduous coniferous forest and evergreen deciduous forest was relatively small. From 2000 to 2019, the interannual NPP of forests in Yichun showed a fluctuation but overall increasing trend, among which the extremely significant

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multilook approaches have been applied in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR), for improving the density and regularity of persistent scatterers reconstructed from multipass SAR images in both rural and urban regions. Multilook operations assume that all scatterers in a given neighborhood are similar in height, thereby providing additional data for recovering the position and reflectivity of a single scatterer, so that a higher signal-to-noise ratio can be achieved. This is equivalent to assuming that scatterers belonging to a local neighborhood of range-azimuth cells are located on horizontal planes. The present article generalizes this approach by adopting the so-called local plane (LP) model for TomoSAR imaging in urban areas, accounting for local variations in the height of scatterers that are not negligible. Furthermore, an LP-generalized likelihood ratio test (LP-GLRT) algorithm is developed to implement the previous idea. Compared with the multilook generalized likelihood ratio test algorithm, LP-GLRT shows better performance in the case of urban structures and terrains in experiments based on both simulated data and TerraSAR-X images.

TI  - A Dual-Domain Super-Resolution Image Fusion Method With SIRV and GALCA Model for PolSAR and Panchromatic Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral/multispectral and panchromatic of optical remote sensing images are commonly used for multisensor image fusion, which has been applied in various applications of Earth observation. However, the utilization of optical remote sensing data suffers from the limitation of bad weather and cloud contamination. To address aforementioned issue and enhance spatial details of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image, a novel dual-domain super-resolution image fusion method is proposed by combining improved spherically invariant random vector (ISIRV) model with generalized adaptive linear combination approximation (GALCA) technology in this study. The proposed method decomposes the task of image fusion into polarimetric and texture domain fusion by integrating polarimetric components of PolSAR image and texture detail component of panchromatic image, which can significantly improve spatial resolutions of the PolSAR image while preserving polarimetric information. The data fusion experiment is implemented with three data sets including panchromatic images of Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Gaofen-2 (GF-2) and the quad-pol SAR data of Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and Radarsat-2. Results show that the proposed dual-domain image fusion method provides a better performance compared with state-of-the-art multisensor fusion methods (BT, PCA, GS, indusion, and PRACS) regarding qualitative and quantitative evaluations. In addition, results of image fusion are applied to image classification over agricultural and urban areas of China, which shows that classification accuracy is significantly improved when compared with the result using only the original image.

TI  - Inversion of soil moisture and its feedback on ecological restoration in arid and semi-arid areas of northwest China
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in regulating the global water cycle, especially in arid areas, and is one of the main indicators of ecological environmental health. Although traditional methods can accurately measure SM at a single sample site, they are limited in large-scale and dynamic SM monitoring. Therefore, we used the Landsat images as the data source and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) to build the adjusted SAVI (aSAVI) index by modifying the soil adjustment parameterL and introducing the short-wave infrared band. According to the theory of temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and feature space, we introduced a model, combined the measured SM data (Minqin Basin, China) through a comparative analysis of four vegetation indices (NDVI, SAVI, MSAVI, aSAVI) determine the optimal model. Taking the Minqin Basin as the study area, the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of SM in three sub-regions (the entire study area, irrigated region, and periphery of the irrigated regions) were quantitatively analyzed and compared in four different periods: pre-Comprehensive Treatment Program of the Shiyang River Basin (pre-CTSRB) (2000-2005), CTSRB I (2006-2010), CTSRB II (2011-2016), and CTSRB-end (2017-2021) to evaluate the ecological restoration effects of treatment programs from the SM perspective. The results showed that: 1) SM values derived from TVDI inversion and the aSAVI were more accurate, and the model sensitivity decreased with soil depth; 2) the mean value of SM fluctuated across the four periods but decreased slightly over the entire time series. The spatial variations of the SM were characterized by a "descending then ascending" trend. Soil moisture increased in 21.35 % of areas at 0.00-0.10 m in the past 22 years, and 59.66 % at 0.10-0.20 m. There was a negative correlation between the mean variation trend of SM and the percentage of area where SM fell in different periods; 3) the treatment program positively affected the ecological restoration of the Minqin Basin from the SM perspective. The area where SM increased was larger than that of decreasing SM, especially in 0.10-0.20 m soil layer. The increase can promote growth and confer resistance to desertification.

TI  - One-Step High-Quality NDVI Time-Series Reconstruction by Joint Modeling of Gradual Vegetation Change and Negatively Biased Atmospheric Contamination
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) can reflect the plant life cycle of growth and senescence and has become a widely used tool for many applications related to phenology, ecology, and environment. However, unwanted disturbance from cloud, snow, and other atmospheric effects greatly lowers the NDVI quality and hinders its further application. In this article, differing from the previous research attempting to approach the upper NDVI envelope by local adjustment or threshold-related iteration, a novel one-step global variational reconstruction (OGVR) method for NDVI time series is proposed via joint modeling of the gradual vegetation change and negatively biased atmospheric contamination. Two versions of the proposed method are designed for processing NDVI data with or without auxiliary flag information. Long-term and global-scale Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) global inventory monitoring and modeling system (GIMMS) data were applied in simulated and real-data experiments to verify the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method can successfully estimate the natural vegetation change from seriously contaminated NDVI time series and can conquer the problem of continuous low-value gaps. The qualitative and quantitative comparisons with five other widely used methods indicate that the proposed method has significant advantages in terms of both effectiveness and stability.

AB  - Detection of convective initiation (CI) is an important step of early warning of strong convective weather. This study proposes a machine learning approach for CI detection using 18 interesting fields extracted from weather radar, Himawari8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), and the variational Doppler radar analysis system (VDRAS). The collected features are used to train the machine learning model for CI detection. Therein, the support vector machine (SVM) is used to identify the CI and non-CI. It is concluded that a better result can be achieved by using multiple-source data compared to using satellite data only. The atmospheric boundary layer thermal dynamic information retrieved by VDRAS is proved to be useful for CI detection.

TI  - Grounding Event of Iceberg D28 and Its Interactions with Seabed Topography
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Iceberg D28, a giant tabular iceberg that calved from Amery Ice Shelf in September 2019, grounded off Kemp Coast, East Antarctica, from August to September of 2020. The motion of the iceberg is characterized herein by time-series images captured by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) on Sentinel-1 and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) boarded on Terra from 6 August to 15 September 2020. The thickness of iceberg D28 was estimated by utilizing data from altimeters on Cryosat-2, Sentinel-3, and ICESat-2. By using the iceberg draft and grounding point locations inferred from its motion, the maximum water depths at grounding points were determined, varying from 221.72 +/- 21.77 m to 269.42 +/- 25.66 m. The largest disagreements in seabed elevation inferred from the grounded iceberg and terrain models from the Bedmap2 and BedMachine datasets were over 570 m and 350 m, respectively, indicating a more complicated submarine topography in the study area than that presented by the existing seabed terrain models. Wind and sea water velocities from reanalysis products imply that the driving force from sea water is a more dominant factor than the wind in propelling iceberg D28 during its grounding, which is consistent with previous findings on iceberg dynamics.

TI  - Temporal Shape-Based Fusion Method to Generate Continuous Vegetation Index at Fine Spatial Resolution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a temporal shape-based fusion method (TSFM) using a spatially and temporally moving window is proposed to incorporate the time lag of fine- and coarse-resolution observations and to fully utilize target fine-resolution pixels and similar coarse-resolution pixels in the process. This method provides high-accuracy fused images with Pearson's r of similar to 0.95, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of similar to 0.04, and a bias of similar to 0.01 for commonly used fine spatial resolution satellites, including Landsat 7 and 8, Sentinel 2, and Gaofen 1, over different heterogeneous regions, such as urban, mountain, forest, and savanna regions. The fused fine-resolution enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series using different fine spatial resolution satellite data as input are all highly correlated with the PhenoCam-monitored green chromatic coordinate (GCC), with no temporal lag. Compared with the commonly used data fusion method, this method provides equivalent and slightly higher accuracy because both neighboring similar pixels and the annual temporal variation are fully considered. This TSFM does not require each input fine-resolution image to be cloud-free; therefore, it can be used at a large spatial scale without further preprocessing and generates continuous datasets over a long-time range with only one input preparation process. The factors that could affect the method accuracy are the cloud detection accuracy of fine-resolution data and the temporal continuity of the coarse-resolution data. The method may also be used to produce spatially and temporally continuous surface reflectance and other surface reflectance-derived indices.

AB  - With the continuous evolution of 5G technology, the integration of satellite communication network into global 5G network has been put on the agenda. LEO Satellite Constellation with its advantages of low delay and global coverage can form an effective supplement to the ground 5G mobile communication system, and provide infrastructure support for various services based on broadband access and Internet of things. It is an important direction of future communication development, and also a hot spot. However, with the development of study on 5G NTN (Non-Terrestrial Networks) network, due to the characteristics of high-speed mobile satellites and dynamic topology changes of LEO constellation, the problem of network integration between LEO constellation and 5G ground system becomes more and more prominent. According to the network characteristics of LEO constellation, the key technologies of network architecture, inter satellite routing and mobility management of LEO constellation based on 5G are studied in this paper, which can provide guidance for the networking design and engineering practice of LEO constellation networking based on 5G.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Sidelobe suppression is a challenging but crucial issue for SAR image quality enhancement. Inspired by the blind image restoration method based on the approximate greatest common divisor (AGCD) in natural images, a novel SAR sidelobe suppression method is proposed in this paper. Sidelobe suppression is interpreted as image deconvolution with a known PSF. Another SAR image with different PSF is generated by injecting the phase error at first. Then the PSF estimation is introduced into SAR, which is realized by solving the AGCD of two noised polynomials associated with two SAR images. Finally, the sidelobe suppression reduces to the solution of the inverse problem. Experiments on a TerraSAR-X SAR image show that improved results are qualitatively realized in sidelobe suppression and detail preservation in comparison with two existing algorithms.

TI  - A Classification-Based, Semianalytical Approach for Estimating Water Clarity From a Hyperspectral Sensor Onboard the ZY1-02D Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity (Z(sd)) is a widely used quality indicator that can be estimated from remote sensing imagery. China's newest generation advanced hyperspectral imager (AHSI) onboard the ZY1-02D satellite is expected to enable accurate water clarity retrieval for inland waters, since AHSI can provide abundant band choices, while its 30-m spatial resolution is advantageous for monitoring small inland water bodies. In this study, to retrieve Z(sd) from the ZY1-02D imagery for inland waters with varying turbidities, we propose a classification-based, semianalytical method, in which the red/ blue band ratio is employed to distinguish clear to moderately turbid water and highly turbid waters. Two quasi-analytical algorithms (QAAs), QAA(v5) and QAA(m14), are used to estimate the total absorption coefficient [a(lambda)] and the backscattering coefficient [b(b)(lambda)] for clear to moderately turbid water and highly turbid waters, respectively. The estimated a(lambda) and b(b)(lambda) are utilized to obtain the diffuse attenuation coefficient K-d, followed by the Z(sd) calculations. Compared with 70 matchups of in situ measured Z(sd) values (0-6.5 m), the ZY1-02D image-derived Z(sd) achieved an R-2 of 0.98, with an average unbiased relative error and root mean square error of 29.1% and 0.52 m, respectively. In addition, the proposed method can yield Z(sd) with higher accuracies than that of optimized empirical models. Therefore, the ZY1-02D AHSI imagery can retrieve reliable Z(sd) for both clear (>3 m) and turbid waters (0-3.0 m), thereby serving as a useful satellite data source for monitoring the water clarity of large-scale inland water bodies.

TI  - A Novel Impervious Surface Extraction Method Based on Automatically Generating Training Samples From Multisource Remote Sensing Products: A Case Study of Wuhan City, China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces caused by rapid urbanization affect the environment and increase the disaster risk. Currently, most articles have extracted impervious surfaces by manual participation for training samples with medium-and-high spatial resolution remote sensing images. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new method for improving the efficiency of training sample acquisition and the accuracy of impervious surface extraction. In this article, a novel impervious surface extraction method is proposed based on automatically generating training samples from multisource remote sensing products. First, the preliminary sample area was constructed through the overlay analysis of the classification consistency area of three remote sensing products and homogeneous area detection based on Sentinel-2 images. Second, four spectral indices and digital surface model (DSM) elevation data were used for sample selection, and the pixels were further purified by variance purification calculation. Finally, by sample migration and random forest model training, impervious surfaces were extracted for other years with limited data. Wuhan city in China was selected as the study area due to a large number of interior objects for impervious surfaces. Sentinel-2 images from 2018 to 2020, three 30 m-resolution products, and DSM data in 2018 were used. The proposed method's extraction accuracies of impervious surfaces for Wuhan in 2018, 2019, and 2020 are 94.02%, 94.45%, and 93.87%, respectively. Additionally, with the resolution improved up to 10 m, the method is more conducive to distinguishing the boundary between impervious surfaces and pervious surfaces.

AB  - Satellites provide a unique opportunity to study the surface expression of mesoscale eddies due to their better spatiotemporal coverage compared to in situ observing systems. However, the three-dimensional structures of mesoscale eddies are still unclear due to the low spatial and temporal resolution of in-situ data. To better understand the vertical structure of mesoscale eddies, deep learning (DL) based mesoscale eddy subsurface temperature inversion model is developed in this study. Combined with the measured data and satellite sea surface data (sea surface height, sea surface temperature), the DL-based model was used to develop the inversion model of the subsurface temperature of mesoscale eddies. The DL-based model can accurately retrieve the subsurface temperature within eddies from the remote sensing data, solves the sparse targeted observations on mesoscale eddies, and help to fully reveal the characteristics variations of three-dimensional structure within mesoscale eddies.

AB  - Mesoscale eddies are circular flowing currents that can retain and transport salt, heat, and nutrients all around the ocean. Mesoscale eddies can be classified as anticyclonic and cyclonic eddies, which are usually called cold eddies and warm eddies according to the sea surface temperature anomaly within eddies, respectively. However, with the development of oceanic remote sensing technology, abnormal mesoscale eddies, that is, cold anticyclonic eddies and warm cyclonic eddies, are found in many ocean areas. Studying abnormal mesoscale eddies involves various ocean parameters data. However, it is difficult for traditional data mining methods to extract the target features from the massive multi-source remote sensing data rapidly and accurately. Deep learning has advantages in feature learning and sophisticated relationship modeling, which brings opportunities for intelligent analysis and mining of ocean remote sensing big data. Based on the multi-source remote sensing database and the deep learning method, the paper detects abnormal mesoscale eddies in the Kuroshio Extension during 1993-2015. The implementation of this study provides technical support and a theoretical basis for deepening the scientific cognition of ocean mesoscale eddies and optimizing the accuracy of ocean models.

TI  - A General Relative Radiometric Correction Method for Vignetting and Chromatic Aberration of Multiple CCDs: Take the Chinese Series of Gaofen Satellite Level-0 Images for Example
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The relative radiometric correction for Level-0 images captured by spaceborne push-broom imaging system faces the problems of vignetting, chromatic aberration, brightness saturation difference, misalignment, and so on. This article proposed a general relative radiometric correction method, which was applied to Gaofen series satellite Level-0 images. In the course of vignetting calibration, the proposed method based on the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) did not use side-slither data and the DNMAX truncation method can solve brightness saturation difference. During chromatic aberration calibration, the subpixel-based phase correlation algorithm was first used to register adjacent CCDs, and then, the proposed global optimization method was adapted to calibrate multiple CCDs. The fixed calibration parameters for vignetting and chromatic aberration calculated by ridge regression and Newton's method can be directly applied to correct other orbital Level-0 images. To verify the robustness and universality, Level-0 images of GF-1B, GF-1C, GF-1D, and GF-2 satellites were chosen for experiments, and the results were better than the existing methods. In addition, some official Level-1 products of GF-1B and GF-1C, covering particularly dark or bright surfaces (e.g., snow, sea, and cloud), were used to compare with the calibrated images of the proposed method. Results showed that relative radiometric correction by applying the independently estimated calibration parameters in this work achieved satisfactory results without the defects existing in official Level-1 products. Finally, results of relative radiometric correction of 30 orbital Level-0 images around the world further strengthened the conclusion that the estimated calibration parameters can be reused in other regions or seasons.

TI  - NL-MMSE: A Hybrid Phase Optimization Method in Multimaster Interferogram Stack for DS-InSAR Applications
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When the distributed scatterer interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DS-InSAR) technology is used for surface deformation monitoring, the accuracy strongly depends on the quality of phase optimization. Especially, in the low-coherence region, how to conveniently and effectively improve the quality of phase optimization has been a hot and difficult research topic in recent years. This article proposes a hybrid phase optimization method for the DS-InSAR technology, which chooses either nonlocal (NL) or minimum mean square error (MMSE) method for each pixel according to the distribution of statistically homogeneous pixel in two windows of different sizes. This hybrid method (NL-MMSE) is not limited by the number of interferogram and is not influenced by multimaster images. The NL-MMSE method was applied to the deformation monitoring in the Jinsha River basin, Tibet, China, using 28 Sentinel-1A SAR images acquired between February and December 2020. Compared with the NL and MMSE methods, the NL-MMSE method provides better phase quality of the interferogram stack and is able to extract more temporal coherence points for subsequent deformation inversion. The deformation monitoring results showed there are three obvious large-scale landslide deformation and dozens of small-scale deformation in the study area. It is demonstrated that the NL-MMSE method based on DS-InSAR technology can accurately monitor the detailed deformation characteristics of the low-coherence surface, and can be applied and promoted as an effective means of identifying and monitoring geological hazards.

TI  - Mapping the Complex Crop Rotation Systems in Southern China Considering Cropping Intensity, Crop Diversity, and Their Seasonal Dynamics
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop rotation increases crop yield, improves soil health, and reduces plant disease. Mapping crop rotation is difficult because crop data from a single time point do not sufficiently represent the dynamics of a system. Studies have tried to map crop rotation by sequentially combining crop maps. However, this produced a large number of meaningless crop sequences, hindering the assessment of rotational benefits at regional scales. Here, we propose a crop rotation classification scheme that integrates temporal information into static crop maps and develop an innovative approach to map crop rotation. We chose a typical multiple cropping region in southern China. Given that the landscape is characterized by high crop diversity (e.g., food crops, cash crops, and permanent crops) and variable cropping intensity, our classification scheme first defines three main rotation systems, i.e., paddy, vegetable, and orchard systems, and then further divides the systems into nine subsystems according to their seasonal dynamics. Finally, we apply time series of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images to identify the systems by a hierarchical rule-based method. The map of crop rotation systems in 2020 had producer, user, and overall accuracies of 81%, 79%, and 81%, respectively. The results indicate that integrating temporal information into the classification scheme is vital to representing complex rotation systems and that remotely sensed temporal dynamics of crops are useful to characterize these systems. It also shows that crop rotation can be mapped directly rather than aggregating multiple crop layers, thus providing a new perspective for mapping and understanding crop rotation systems.

TI  - Moving Ship Optimal Association for Maritime Surveillance: Fusing AIS and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, a variety of different sources can be combined together to measure and monitor maritime human activities. Reliable data fusion techniques are essential to associate the targets from different systems for maritime surveillance. In particular, the fusion of data from Sentinel-2 satellites and the automatic identification system (AIS) has attracted wide attention due to their public availability and complementarity. However, most traditional methods for target association are not suitable for this particular case, due to the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data. In this study, we first construct two new datasets for the detection of moving ships and their wakes based on Sentinel-2 images. Combined with the detection results obtained by the you only look once (YOLOv5) model, the position and course information of the detected ships are first extracted. After carefully analyzing the time lag phenomenon of Sentinel-2 data, we develop a new domain adaptation-based method for target association based on the fusion of Sentinel-2 and AIS data, called moving ship optimal association (MSOA). Different from standard domain adaptation methods only for representation alignment, the proposed MSOA is able to align representation, time, and position simultaneously. A case study is provided in which the newly proposed method is tested over the Port of Long Beach, USA. Experimental results demonstrate that both moving ships and wakes are well detected. Specifically, our newly proposed MSOA exhibits more accurate and robust performance when compared to traditional methods, and the detected ships without corresponding AIS tracks can also be detected by our MSOA. Moreover, the real sensing time and time lag of Sentinel-2 data are deduced with high accuracy. Overall, it can be concluded that our MSOA provides a new perspective for accurate target association based on heterogeneous data fusion.

TI  - Comparison of Crop Evapotranspiration and Water Productivity of Typical Delta Irrigation Areas in Aral Sea Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity of agricultural activities and the characteristics of water consumption affect the hydrological processes of inland river basins in Central Asia. The crop water requirements and water productivity are different between the Amu Darya and Syr Darya river basins due to the different water resource development and utilization policies of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, which have resulted in more severe agricultural water consumption of the Amu Darya delta than the Syr Darya delta, and the differences in the surface runoff are injected into the Aral Sea. To reveal the difference in water resource dissipation, water productivity, and its influencing factors between the two basins, this study selected the irrigation areas of Amu Darya delta (IAAD) and Syr Darya delta (IASD) as typical examples; the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was retrieved by using the modified surface energy balance algorithm for land model (SEBAL) based on high spatial resolution Landsat images from 2000 to 2020. Land use and cover change (LUCC) and streamflow data were obtained to analyze the reasons for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of regional ETa. The water productivity of typical crops in two irrigation areas was compared and combined with statistical data. The results indicate that: (1) the ETa simulated by the SEBAL model matched the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) calculated by the Penman-Monteith method and ground-measured data well, with all the correlation coefficients higher than 0.7. (2) In IAAD, the average ETa was 1150 mm, and the ETa had shown a decreasing trend; for the IASD, the average ETa was 800 mm. The ETa showed an increasing trend with low stability due to a large amount of developable cultivated land. The change of cultivated land dominated the spatio-temporal characteristics of ETa in the two irrigation areas (3). Combined with high spatial resolution ETa inversion results, the water productivity of cotton and rice in IAAD was significantly lower than in IASD, and wheat was not significantly different, but all were far lower than the international average. This study can provide useful information for agricultural water management in the Aral Sea region.

TI  - Jiang Guangci as a Translator of Russian Literature into Chinese
T2  - NAUCHNYI DIALOG
M3  - Article
AB  - The translation activity of the founder of revolutionary Chinese literature, Jiang Guangci, is considered. The novelty of the study is due to the fact that the translations of Russian and Soviet literature by Jiang Guangci are almost not studied in scientific circles. The relevance of the study is due to the importance of building and strengthening Chinese-Russian cultural ties, including in the field of translation of fiction, in which Jiang Guangci was successful in the 20s of the XX century. It has been established that Jiang Guangci's translations corresponded to his revolutionary ideals, which he embodied in his original works. It is noted that Jiang Guangci's worldview determined his choice of Russian and Soviet works embodying revolutionary ideals for translation. It is shown that his translations received wide support from young people due not only to the content, but also to the simple, understandable language of presentation. The participation of Jiang Guangci in the literary discussion about the translation strategy is presented. Due to his good knowledge of the Russian, he made translations from the original, and not from Japanese translations of Russian works. The authors come to the conclusion that the translation activity of Jiang Guangci has not been sufficiently studied and has prospects for study.

TI  - NDVI - alpha diversity relationship in tropical montane cloud forest of Ecuador
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In tropical forest the biodiversity is in a constant threat, some species are listed in the IUCN as vulnerable, endangered or threatened with extinction. Thus, a fast method for biodiversity determination or monitoring can contribute to its conservation. Remote sensing has demonstrated to be a powerful tool, and together with the vegetation indexes, can determine the vegetation state of forest. Recently researches have correlated the normalized differentiated vegetation index (NDVI) with species richness, structure and biodiversity of forests obtaining successful results.This study, conducted in a Tropical Montane Cloud Forest (TMCF) of Ecuador, aims to correlate NDVI with alpha diversity estimators to understand its relationships. NDVI of Landsat OLI 8 Level 1 images in five months was determined. We considered a scene as valid in case of cloud coverage in the areas of interest below 25%. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections, with flaash tool, and the delimitation of the study site (ROI) were developed in ENVI 5.3 program. NDVI was calculated with ENVI 5.3 program (histograms allowed the determination of mean, maximum and minimum NDVI), and with ArcGIS 10.3 (for classification index). In field, species richness, Chao1, Shannon index, Simpson index, and biomass of three plots were quantified for trees with D13H >= 10 cm. Then, we calculate Pearson coefficient to correlate and disentangle the effects of altitude, diversity, richness, biomass and N DV I. A positive relationship was observed between Mean NDVI and Chao1 (p < 0.10) and Mean NDVI - richness (p < 0.05). In conclusion, NDVI can be considered useful to estimate richness and biodiversity and even to detect ecotone as was the case in this research. The application of this methodology could allow biodiversity assessment and monitoring in real time and low cost, which contributes in forest conservation programs.

TI  - Glacier area changes at Maipo volcano (Central Andes), a morphometric approach: 4 decades of satellite records
T2  - ANDEAN GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Current climatic conditions in Central Andes (CA) (31-36 degrees S) have triggered the reduction of glacier area. Although CA are geographically circumscribed to an area under the same macroclimatic domain, their rugged topography creates several topoclimates as response to the effects of elevation, slope and aspect (morphometric factors). This study explores the impact of morphometric factors on the evolution of the glacial surface located above of Maipo volcano (34 degrees 09'50" S; 69 degrees 49'53" W). Through the use of 11 LANDSAT images (MSS, TM and OLI), the spatiotemporal evolution of the glacier area was reconstructed (period 1976-2020). On this period, glacier area was reduced by 6 +/- 0.5 km(2) (-0.14 +/- 0.01 km(2)a(-1)), equal to 63% of 1976 glacial area (9.6 +/- 0.5 km(2)). Fifty percent of the reduction occurred between 3,900 and 4,400 m elevation, with absolute losses towards lower elevations. In addition, it was detected that for every 100 m of ascent the relative area loss rate decreased 0.1 %a(-1) (R-2=0.81; p-value<0.05). Also, it was observed that south's glacial surface (SE and SW too) concentrated between two and three times more surface area than the rest. There, the greatest loss glacier's area took place (1.3 km(2)), although in relative terms it represented 55% of the initial area (0.9%a(-1)). On the contrary, north slope's glacial surface was disappeared. Glacial area's change as an elevation function showed the largest differences against glacial area's total change, suggesting the difficulty of assuming mean elevations as descriptors of glacial change, especially at elevations higher than 4,700 m. The reduction of uncovered glaciers located on the steep slopes of the Maipo volcano has led to an increase in debris on the remaining glacier surface and the expansion of covered glaciers.

TI  - Extracting Glacier Calving Fronts by Deep Learning: The Benefit of Multispectral, Topographic, and Textural Input Features
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate parameterization of glacier calving is essential for understanding glacier dynamics and constraining ice-sheet models. The increasing availability and quality of remote sensing imagery open the prospect of a continuous and precise mapping of relevant parameters, such as calving front locations. However, it also calls for automated and scalable analysis strategies. Deep neural networks provide powerful tools for processing large quantities of remote sensing data. In this contribution, we assess the benefit of diverse input data for calving front extraction. In particular, we focus on Landsat-8 imagery supplementing single-band inputs with multispectral data, topography, and textural information. We assess the benefit of these three datasets using a dropped-variable approach. The associated reference dataset comprises 728 manually delineated calving front positions of 23 Greenland and two Antarctic outlet glaciers from 2013 to 2021. Resulting feature importance emphasizes both the potential integrating additional input information as well as the significance of their thoughtful selection. We advocate utilizing multispectral features as their integration leads generally to more accurate predictions compared with conventional single-band inputs. This is especially prevalent for challenging ice melange and illumination conditions. In contrast, the application of both textural and topographic inputs cannot be recommended without reservation, since they may lead to model overfitting. The results of this assessment are not only relevant for advancing automated calving front extraction but also for a wider range of glaciology-related land surface classification tasks using deep neural networks.

AB  - In this paper, we tend to address the challenge of land use and land cover classification exploitation Sentinel-2 satellite pictures. The Sentinel-2 satellite pictures are overtly and freely accessible provided within the Earth observation program, Copernicus. Here, we tend to take into account EuroSAT dataset that's supported Sentinel-2 satellite pictures with 13 spectral bands and consists of ten categories within a total of 27,000 tagged and geo-referenced pictures. The presented model will facilitate the effective classification of land use and land cover. In this paper, we will be presenting the classification using different Machine Learning models like Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support vector machine, Gradient booster using Ensemble classifiers which will be implemented using ensemble classifier. Later, we tend to aim to compare the results of deep learning and machine learning models supported the metrics like accuracy. Finally, the most effective model which will be applied to perform land use and land cover classification was identified and presented to support the new researchers in this field.

TI  - Can Moral Values be Formed without Influencing the Development of an Individual's Worldview?
T2  - PHILOSOPHY AND COSMOLOGY-FILOSOFIYA I KOSMOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study considers the implementation of one of the top trends in modern society development - defending the role of morality in society and the value paradigm, the centre of which is increased attention to the formation of the value-semantic sphere of personality, which influences their worldview formation. Scientific research focuses on the moral values formation of the growing individual from the perspective of their worldview development, revealed by interaction with the world, specifically in interpersonal relationships and directly with themselves. The essence and features of the moral values formation, in the context of interconnections and interdependence of components in the structure of an individual, are substantiated using the methods of analysis and synthesis, abstraction and concretization through the study of the scientific heritage of foreign and Ukrainian scientists. The article specifies moral values as a mechanism of human social behaviour that performs several functions in their life (normative, regulatory, control) and affects the worldview and the formation of a personal worldview.Based on the generalization of the presented scientific array fundings, the author's concept of moral values formation in the worldview of the individual is modelled, it is presented as a diagram of the interdependence of three chain lines: 1) social morality - self-awareness - worldview; 2) values - world perception; 3) moral values - individuals worldview. The algorithm for the studied phenomenon of an individual is seen in the moral education providing, which ensures the moral values formation in the structure of moral self-awareness and the development of the worldview of a growing personality The individual's worldview is determined by several factors: the system of moral knowledge and beliefs formed resulting from the acceptance of the acknowledged in society moral values that become personal; accumulated moral experience and striving for moral self-improvement. The findings outlined the issues of further scientific research, which will involve clarifying the state of students' moral development in the educational process and the levels of their moral values formation as well.

TI  - Monistic Interpretation of Experience in A. Bogdanov's Positivism
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to intellectual heritage of Alexander A. Bogdanov and focuses on the philosophy of empiriomonism, a common thread running through all his work. The relevance of his way of understanding the world lies in the fact that the monistic understanding of experience is linked to the activity approach. Defending the position of positivism as a "scientific" philosophy, Bogdanov tried to substantiate the dynamics of the social process on the Marxist platform. But this led him to break with his colleagues in the revolutionary movement and to excommunication from revolutionary activity, because his innovative thoughts comparable only to the transition from Newtonian mechanics to quantum physics, were not understood. From Bogdanov's point of view, any dogmatization leads to the transformation of a scientific concept into a religious doctrine, which orthodoxly consolidates its tenets/postulates. He develops these ideas in the book "General Organizational Science". Tektology, in his opinion, already went beyond the framework of philosophy and was not just a science, but also a methodology of knowledge, as well as a style of scientific thinking, which science was striving to master, initially without realizing it. As shown in the article, his approach turned out to be quite consistent with today's worldview based on the principles of quantum mechanics and the idea of the interdependence of the object and the researcher.

TI  - Research on Inversion of Water Conservation Capacity of Forest Litter in Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon Based on Spectral Features
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water conservation is an important part of the ecosystem service function. As a complex ecosystem, forests have different contributions to water conservation. The forest litter plays an important role in the water conservation function, for it directly covers the ground surface. Remote sensing and hyperspectral technology provide a solution for the long-distance detection of water conservation in planar areas. Especially in plateau areas, remote sensing is the most effective way to obtain surface information. In this paper, the hyperspectral data of main tree species were measured by ASD spectrometer in the Grand Canyon research area of Yarlung Zangbo. The litter samples were obtained by sampling on the plot and the water holding capacity of the samples was calculated. Use leaf spectrum information to construct vegetation index related to litter water conservation capacity, then establish multiple regression model of vegetation index and effective retention capacity, and invert the water conservation capacity distribution of main tree species in the Grand Canyon based on Sentinel-2 images. In the end, the accuracy of the inversion model is evaluated based on the verification points. The results showed that : (1) The reflectance of Quercusaqui folioides was the highest, the lowest was the Picea Linzhi, and the total reflectance trend of the three species was similar; (2) The effective interception amount of litter is sorted from large to small as follows: Picea Linzhi (48. 36 t . ha (1))> Quercusaqui folioides (39. 24 t . ha (1))> Pinus densata (32. 32 t . ha (1)). Picea Linzhi leaves are easy to decompose and store, Quercusaqui folioides' leathery leaves and Pinus densata's oily leaves are not conducive to decomposition. Therefore, the litter of Picea Linzhi has the highest effective interception amount. (3) Through the Person correlation coefficient analysis and the multiple linear regression model, it is found that the higher the wax parameters and attenuation degree of leaves, the weaker the water conservation capacity of litter; the better the vegetation growth trend, the higher the pigment and the water content of leaves, the stronger the water conservation capacity. (4) The results of the accuracy evaluation of the inversion model of the water conservation capacity of litter are good. R-2 of the test points of Pinus densata, Picea Linzhi and Quercusaqui folioides is 0. 943, 0. 815 and 0. 812, and RMSE is 1. 597, 2. 270 and 1. 953. It shows that the model can be used for the prediction and distribution of the water conservation capacity of forest litter in Grand Canyon.

TI  - An Unambiguous Imaging Method of Moving Target for Maritime Scenes With Spaceborne High-Resolution and Wide-Swath SAR
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In azimuth multichannel high-resolution and wide-swath (AMC-HRWS) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system, undersampling of azimuth signal results in the failure of the single-channel echo imaging, so the echoes of all the channels should be reconstructed to obtain the unambiguous SAR image. Many methods have been proposed to reconstruct the stationary scene echoes. However, moving targets (MTs) will cause false targets in the reconstructed SAR image, which has a great influence on SAR image interpretation and moving target detection, especially in maritime scenes. Hence, we propose an unambiguous imaging method of the moving target for maritime scenes with AMC-HRWS SAR. First, azimuth deramp processing is introduced to obtain coarse-focused moving targets, and then their echoes can be extracted from the sea clutter. Based on the extracted data, a radial velocity estimation method is proposed, which is high efficiency and does not require redundant channels. In addition, based on the estimated radial velocity and the characteristics of the coarse-focused signal, a novel signal reconstruction method of moving target is presented. The reconstruction performance of this method is not affected by channel imbalance, and false targets can be removed even if there is radial velocity error. Besides, the effectiveness of this scheme is verified by the simulation data and GaoFen-3 SAR real data. The estimated radial velocities of ships are verified by automatic identification system (AIS) information. The imaging results show that false targets are effectively suppressed, and moving targets are located in correct positions.

TI  - Co-Cross-Polarization Coherence Over the Sea Surface From Sentinel-1 SAR Data: Perspectives for Mission Calibration and Wind Field Retrieval
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been used for years to estimate high-resolution surface wind field from the ocean surface backscattered signal. Current SAR platforms have one single fixed antenna, and traditional inversion/retrieval schemes rely on one copolarized channel, leading to an unconstrained optimization problem for providing independent estimates of wind speed and direction. For routine application, this is generally solved with <italic>a priori</italic> information from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model, inducing severe limitations for rapidly evolving meteorological systems where discrepancies can be significant between model and measurements. In this study, we investigate the benefit of having two simultaneous acquisitions with phase-preserving information in copolarization and cross polarization provided by Sentinel-1 (S-1). A comprehensive analysis of the co-cross-polarization coherence (CCPC) is performed to adequately estimate and calibrate CCPC values from S-1 interferometric wide (IW) mode images acquired over the ocean. A new polarimetric calibration (PolCAL) methodology based on least-squares (LS) criterion and direct matrix inversion is proposed yielding crosstalk estimates. We document CCPC odd symmetry with respect to relative wind direction for light to medium wind speeds (up to 14 m/s) and incidence angle from 30x00B0; to 45x00B0;. The azimuthal modulation is found to increase with both wind speed and incidence angle. An analytical model C-band polarimetric geophysical model function (CPGMF) is provided. The synergy of the CCPC with other radar parameters, such as backscattering coefficients or Doppler, to further constrain the inversion scheme is assessed, opening new perspectives for SAR-based wind field retrieval independent of any NWP model information.

TI  - Morphometric, morphological and sedimentary characterization of eroded alluvial fans: a new glance upon the slope deposits of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents morphological, morphometric and sedimentary data of inactive alluvial fans sitting on the medium and high slopes of the Quadrilatero Ferrifero, deriving from the high regions adjacent to the main fluvial valleys. In the survey of morphometric and morphological data, in addition to using topographic maps and images from Google Earth, images from the Sentinel-2 satellite, MSI sensor, in the bands 2, 3, 4 and 8 of 10m spatial resolution were used. These images were obtained based on Javascript programming in the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. During field work it was possible to raise facies profiles and interpret the sedimentary processes as well as the paleoenvironmental context in which the alluvial fans were generated. These are deposits with advanced erosion processes caused by human occupation and, mostly, by the high incision of drainage courses that occurred in the Holocene. The dismantling of the deposits reflected in the asymmetry of the alluvial fans, countering, therefore, the traditional semi-conical shapes of this features in arid and semiarid regions of the globe. The alluvial fans studied were generated by high energy unconfined processes, mainly by flows of pseudoplastic debris. By comparing the available ages for the investigated fans, obtained through optically stimulated luminescence, to the paleoclimatic data available for the southeastern Brazilian region, it was possible to conclude that the dated facies were filled in a dry paleoclimate.

TI  - Monitoring of Construction Activity by Change Detection on SAR Time Series Using Coherent Scatterers
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a novel synthetic aperture radar (SAR) change detection method for the monitoring of man-made objects (MMOs) is presented. Rather than looking for changes in SAR amplitude or the loss of coherence, changes are detected by the appearance and disappearance of the strong point scatterers present in MMOs and often denoted as coherent scatterers (CSs). This enables the detection of changes involving MMOs while ignoring changes to natural targets such as vegetation. These CSs are detected in each image and compared coherently across an image pair or a time series. When using a time series, the proposed method can categorize the changes according to their temporal behavior. An object-based change analysis step for identifying changes significantly larger than individual CSs is also introduced. The proposed approach is applied for the monitoring of construction activity using a time series of 49 TerraSAR-X images of the city of Munich.

TI  - Elvira Lacaci's children's literature: values of progress in a conservative context
T2  - OGIGIA-REVISTA ELECTRONICA DE ESTUDIOS HISPANICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The children's literature of Elvira Lacaci (1918-1997), a writer from Ferrol, Spain, includes poetry and short stories. She developed it in the historical context of the Spanish post-war period, and it shows an oscillation between conservative approaches and the influx of advanced ideas related particularly to the incipient environmentalism, the opposition to racism and the denouncement of animal suffering. This study explores these concerns, adopting a methodology derived from literary criticism to analyse the texts, with emphasis on the poems. It also offers the worldview of a writer who was highly representative of her time - she was the first woman to win the Adonais Poetry Prize - and whose books for children were widely distributed. In the same way, his article attempts to rescue the children's poetic facet due to its suitability for reading in the present and its application to the field of education.

TI  - Potential of Multiway PLS (N-PLS) Regression Method to Analyse Time-Series of Multispectral Images: A Case Study in Agriculture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent literature reflects the substantial progress in combining spatial, temporal and spectral capacities for remote sensing applications. As a result, new issues are arising, such as the need for methodologies that can process simultaneously the different dimensions of satellite information. This paper presents PLS regression extended to three-way data in order to integrate multiwavelengths as variables measured at several dates (time-series) and locations with Sentinel-2 at a regional scale. Considering that the multi-collinearity problem is present in remote sensing time-series to estimate one response variable and that the dataset is multidimensional, a multiway partial least squares (N-PLS) regression approach may be relevant to relate image information to ground variables of interest. N-PLS is an extension of the ordinary PLS regression algorithm where the bilinear model of predictors is replaced by a multilinear model. This paper presents a case study within the context of agriculture, conducted on a time-series of Sentinel-2 images covering regional scale scenes of southern France impacted by the heat wave episode that occurred on 28 June 2019. The model has been developed based on available heat wave impact data for 107 vineyard blocks in the Languedoc-Roussillon region and multispectral time-series predictor data for the period May to August 2019. The results validated the effectiveness of the proposed N-PLS method in estimating yield loss from spectral and temporal attributes. The performance of the model was evaluated by the R-2 obtained on the prediction set (0.661), and the root mean square of error (RMSE), which was 10.7%. Limitations of the approach when dealing with time-series of large-scale images which represent a source of challenges are discussed; however, the N-PLS regression seems to be a suitable choice for analysing complex multispectral imagery data with different spectral domains and with a clear temporal evolution, such as an extreme weather event.

TI  - The schism in postnonclassical rationality
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - Ontological, epistemological, socio-practical, and ethical aspects demonstrate the impossibility of the coexistence of the complex idea of human dimensionality with the complex idea of nonlinearity in the "hard core" of postnonclassical research programs. The idea of human dimensionality, which necessarily has a real paradigmatic status in postnonclassical science, seriously limits the worldview ideas of nonlinearity in favor of linear concepts. The claim of the worldview of nonlinearity to paradigmatic status in postnonclassics leads to the loss of compatibility of this idea with the idea of human dimensionality, which demonstrates the groundlessness of this claim. In the ontological aspect, the human being is seen as a result and a condition for the continuation of a linear world process. The epistemological aspect notes the insufficiency of any reductionist cognitive strategy to ensure the unity of human knowledge, and states the immaturity of the current state of social synergetics. In the socio-practical aspect, the project as the main type of linear activity, which occupies a central place in human culture, is opposed to the game as the main type of non-linear activity. At the same time, the anti-project nature of reliance on nonlinear processes is noted. In the ethical aspect, the incompatibility of postnonclassical rationality with ethical relativism, naturally arising from the claim of the idea of nonlinearity to paradigmatic status, is considered. Present in the "hard core" of the postnonclassical research programs the complex idea of human dimensionality can be protected by different elements of the "protective belt": on the one hand, either by the emphasis on the study of linear processes or by the emphasis on the study of nonlinear processes (using a "soft," non-paradigmatic variant of the idea of nonlinearity); on the other hand, either by means of synergetics, or by means of concrete-universal dialectics.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, when satellite data volumes grow rapidly and exceed petabyte values and their quality provides reliable analysis of long-term time series, traditional data handling methods assuming local storage and processing may be impossible to implement for small or distributed research teams. Thus, new methods based on modern web technologies providing access to very large distributed data archives are gaining increasing importance. Furthermore, these new data handling solutions should provide not just access but also analysis and processing features, similar to desktop solutions. This paper describes the VEGA-Science web GIS-an open-access novel tool for satellite data processing and analysis. The overview of its architecture and basic technical components is given, but most attention is paid to examples of actual system application for various applied and research tasks. In addition, an overview of projects using the system is given to illustrate its versatility and further development directions are considered.

TI  - For or Against Transhumanism? Attitudes and Predictors of Transhumanist Theory and Practice Among Students of the City of Zagreb
T2  - NOVA PRISUTNOST
M3  - Article
AB  - Transhumanism characterizes the understanding of human nature as dynamic and flexible and therefore receptive to various improvements within techno-scientific system. In this paper, transhumanism is empirically researched through attitudes and predictors among students of the city of Zagreb (N=218). Although most respondents were not transhumanist, some of them affirmed its characteristic conceptions of the human body and consciousness, expressing openness to various bodily improvements. The most important predictor of student acceptance of transhumanism was religiosity with the acceptance of new technologies and worldview, which is why transhumanism was profiled as a secular, technological and liberal phenomenon. The contribution of this paper is in actualizing a topic on which there are not many empirical insights in Croatian society by mapping the lifestyle of supporters and opponents of transhumanism not only on a theoretical but also practical level, thus moving from science fiction to everyday life and indicating a modest, yet present, student inclination to the perspective of the transhumanism whose social implications have yet to be addressed.

TI  - Remote Sensing and Machine Learning Modeling to Support the Identification of Sugarcane Crops
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main concerns of agricultural financing institutions is to make sure the loans they grant are used for the stated objective when the loan was requested. Specifically, when Banco Agrario de Colombia grants loans for crop farmers, it schedules verification visits to the cultivation sites to check if the crop stipulated in the loan agreement exists and assess its health. These visits are challenging to make due to the number of visits over vast areas that they need to schedule, lack of trained personnel, and difficulty of access. This article proposes a software tool, based on a machine learning model for processing free satellite imagery, to support the bank's identification of non-compliant crops with the investment plan before making field visits, minimizing the loss of investment by focusing on those areas to prioritize the visits. Sugarcane along the department of Boyaca, Colombia was chosen as the case of study. Free access satellite imagery through the Colombian Data Cube (CDCol) was used and machine learning models were applied on them to classify the land and predict the presence of the crop, a Random Forest model achieved an overall F1-score of 91% using Landsat-8 imagery and a K-nearest Neighbors model achieved an overall F1-score of 98% using Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - Dual-Branch Network for Cloud and Cloud Shadow Segmentation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud and cloud shadow segmentation is one of the most important issues in remote sensing image processing. Most of the remote sensing images are very complicated. In this work, a dual-branch model composed of transformer and convolution network is proposed to extract semantic and spatial detail information of the image, respectively, to solve the problems of false detection and missed detection. To improve the model's feature extraction, a mutual guidance module (MGM) is introduced, so that the transformer branch and the convolution branch can guide each other for feature mining. Finally, in view of the problem of rough segmentation boundary, this work uses different features extracted by the transformer branch and the convolution branch for decoding and repairs the rough segmentation boundary in the decoding part to make the segmentation boundary clearer. Experimental results on the Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 data, the public dataset high-resolution cloud cover validation dataset created by researchers at Wuhan University (HRC_WHU), and the public dataset Spatial Procedures for Automated Removal of Cloud and Shadow (SPARCS) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and its superiority to the existing state-of-the-art cloud and cloud shadow segmentation approaches.

AB  - In the past two decades, the deterioration of air quality around the world has attracted increasing attention. Research of air pollution based on aerosol optical depth (AOD) is particularly significant. In this article, temporal and spatial changes of global aerosol optical depth from 2000 to 2019 are studied based on MODIS AOD product data, in order to reveal the change pattern of global air pollution in the past two decades. As a result of the study, the overall global AOD has been on an upward trend over the period 2000-2019. Changes in AOD during the year have obvious seasonality, in order of which is spring> summer> autumn > winter. Central Africa, South Asia and East Asia have the highest AOD, and therefore the air pollution in these areas is the most serious, however AOD in these areas is generally on the decline.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Evolution Characteristics and Driving Mechanism of Rocky Desertification in Karst Area of Eastern Yunnan
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - As one of the most prominent problems in the interweaving of social economy and ecological environment in the karst area of southwest China, rocky desertification has been a hot and difficult topic in the academic circles for a long time. How to scientifically understand the temporal and spatial evolution of karst rocky desertification and its driving mechanism is the primary premise and key to karst rocky desertification control. Taking Landsat TM/OLI remote sensing images from 1987 to 2020 as the main data source, combined with remote sensing, GIS technology and geographical detector method, the spatial-temporal dynamic evolution characteristics of rocky desertification in Qujing City of Yunnan Province in the past 30 years were analyzed, and the driving mechanism of rocky desertification evolution was quantitatively explored. The results show that: (1) During 1987-2020, the area proportions of potential, mild, moderate, severe and extreme heavy rocky desertification in Qujing City decreased from 8.56%, 9.71%, 4.85%, 0.98% and 0.35% to 8.35%, 9.29%, 4.32%, 0.79% and 0.29%, respectively. Among them, the area proportion of potential, mild and moderate rocky desertification fluctuated, and the annual change rates were 0.16%, -0.22% and -0.19%, respectively. The average annual change rates of severe and extreme rocky desertification were -0.56% and -0.32%, respectively; (2) Rocky desertification in Qujing City is large in area and wide in distribution. mainly distributed in the peak cluster depressions, hills, dry-hot valleys and the inter-county boundary regions. The overall pattern of rocky desertification is severe in the southeast, mild in the middle and northwest. (3) The main single factors affecting the development and evolution of rocky desertification in Qujing City were the gross agricultural output value (0.281) and the cultivated land area (0.233). Interactive detector further reveals that the slope n cultivated land area (q=0.465) > cultivated land area n total population (q=0.374) > cultivated land area n population density (q=0.302) > average annual precipitation n slope (0.283) > cultivated land area n distance from settlements (q=0.278), the interaction effects of driving factors on rocky desertification evolution is greater than that of the influence of single factor effect, showing the karst rocky desertification of Qujing City is the result of the interaction of multiple driving factors.Y

TI  - A Novel Unmixing-Based Hypersharpening Method via Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hypersharpening (namely, hyperspectral (HS) and multispectral (MS) image fusion) aims at enhancing the spatial resolution of HS image via an auxiliary higher resolution MS image. Currently, numerous hypersharpening methods are proposed successively, among which the unmixing-based approaches have been widely researched and demonstrated their effectiveness in the spectral fidelity aspect. However, existing unmixing-based fusion methods substantially employ mathematical techniques to solve the spectral mixture model, without taking full advantage of the collaborative spatialx2013;spectral information that is usually helpful for abundance estimation improvement. To overcome this drawback, in this article, a novel unmixing-based HS and MS image fusion method, via a convolutional neural network (CNN), is proposed to promote spectral fidelity. The main idea of this work is to use CNN to fully explore the spatial information and the spectral information of both HS and MS images simultaneously, thereby enhancing the accuracy of estimating the abundance maps. Experiments on four simulated and real remote sensing data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is beneficial to the spectral fidelity of the fused images compared with some state-of-the-art algorithms. Meanwhile, it is also easy to implement and has a certain advantage in running time.

TI  - Automatic RFI Identification for Sentinel-1 Based on Siamese-Type Deep CNN Using Repeat-Pass Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the start of the Sentinel-1 (S-1) mission, numerous cases of severe image degradation caused by radio frequency interference (RFI) have been reported, which puts forward an urgent need for RFI identification and mitigation. In this article, an automatic RFI identification method is proposed based on a Siamese-type deep convolutional neural network (Siam-CNN-RIM). The Siam-CNN-RIM can be served as a preprocessing step before RFI mitigation to identify whether an S-1 image is RFI-contaminated or not. Different from traditional RFI identification networks which only use a single image as input, an additional image in the repeat-pass time series is also fed into the input of Siam-CNN-RIM as a reference. Both the input images correspond to the same illuminated area and pass through the same convolutional layer followed by an energy function such that the different features caused by RFI can be extracted and the background terrain features can be ignored. This is beneficial for distinguishing the real RFI signatures and the similar terrain signatures that may cause false positives and thus improving the RFI identification performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method is robust in different scenarios and can achieve more than 97% RFI identification accuracy, even for the open-set task where the test scenarios are not included in the training set.

TI  - Method for monitoring environmental flows with high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring environmental flows is crucial to maintaining the function and stability of river and lake ecosystems. However, current methods for monitoring environmental flows are expensive and ground based, and the accuracy of the results needs to be verified to evaluate the environmental flows. This evaluation is hampered by the problem of data shortages, such as hydrological and ecological data. In this study, a method for monitoring environmental flows is proposed using multisource high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data. A case study in the Yongding River Basin demonstrates that the method is feasible for monitoring the environmental flows of rivers in semiarid and arid areas. The results show that the environmental flows and months with large water discharges and shortages in the three control sections of the Yongding River Basin were different. Moreover, the downstream river width rarely met the environmental water demand, achieving this only for one period from 2017 to 2019 according to the three typical types of years (an average water year, a dry year, and an extremely dry year). This method and the results have applications in planning environmental flows and could improve the comprehensive management of the ecological environment in river basins.

TI  - Terrestrial Water Storage Changes over the Last 20 Years in the Amazon Basin
T2  - SENSORS AND MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Basin is the world's largest flowing basin and plays an important role in the global hydrological cycle. We combined 20 years of Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), Swarm, and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) satellite data to investigate variations of the terrestrial water storage (TWS) from April 2002 to December 2021. We also analyzed the effects of precipitation, surface temperature, and evapotranspiration on TWS changes. Compared with different methods of processing GRACE data, we found that the combined filtering method of P4M6 + Gaussian 300 km in GRACE/GRACE-FO data provided the most accurate results. The long-term trend of TWS was an increase of approximately 0.23 +/- 0.11 cm/a in the Amazon Basin, and the central and eastern regions had the highest increase rate, whereas the southeastern region showed a decreasing trend. In the last 20 years, maximum TM variations occurred in April and minimum TWS variations occurred in October. In spring, the TWS in the Amazon Basin changes considerably from north to south (increasing in the north and decreasing in the south), opposite to that in winter. In the Amazon Basin, precipitation and surface temperature are the important factors affecting the TWS changes, unlike evapotranspiration. In October 2020, the anomalous decreases in TWS changes correlate with insufficient precipitation and rising surface temperatures, which results in a drought.

TI  - Binary and Fractional MODIS Snow Cover Mapping Boosted by Machine Learning and Big Landsat Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is promising to improve Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover mapping by training effective machine learning models. However, considering the strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity of snow cover, the representativeness of training samples becomes a critical issue to ensure the model effectiveness over large areas and long terms. To deal with this issue, we propose the m-day dynamic training strategy. The core of this strategy is to divide a long-term snow cover mapping task into multiple short-term tasks with consecutive m days (m is greater or equal to the number of days that higher resolution remote sensing images used as equivalent ground references cover the study area once). It can ensure the spatial representativeness of training samples by utilizing all available equivalent ground references data, and reduce the issue caused by snow cover changing over time. We apply this strategy to random forest (RF) for both binary snow cover mapping (BSC) and fractional snow cover mapping (FSC) using Landsat-8 data as equivalent ground reference and validate its effect on the Tibetan Plateau. Results show that this strategy achieves higher accuracies than other training strategies, with F1 of 0.9596 for BSC mapping, R and mean square error (MSE) of 0.9037 and 0.0260 for FSC mapping, respectively. In addition, spatiotemporal analysis of results further demonstrates that this strategy holds advantages for snow cover mapping in areas of complex terrain and in periods when snow cover changes rapidly. In conclusion, this strategy can effectively ensure the representativeness of training samples generated from Landsat-8 data and thus improve MODIS snow cover mapping through machine learning.

TI  - Automatic Detection and Correction of Random Telegraph Signal Artifacts in Earth Observation Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite optical and infrared images can be degraded by a piecewise-constant random artifact called random telegraph signal (RTS), which is caused by unstable semiconductor defects in the photodetector. In this letter, we aim at proposing new techniques to detect and correct such artifacts in the specific context of push-broom detectors, where some columns exhibit RTS that superimposes with the landscape. Our detector is based on a nonparametric statistical test that compares the distribution of each column to its neighbors. Concerning the RTS correction, we first propose a signal processing method that estimates the levels and jumps of the RTS. Then, we propose another method inspired by variational image destriping, which directly estimates the RTS through the use of total variation (TV). Experiments-on Pleiades images with synthetic RTS and on a real SPOT-5 image-show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

AB  - The mapping of environmental information based on remote sensing requires a workflow that involves image processing, model training usually based on machine learning, as well as model application and validation. Remote sensing data processing capabilities are nowadays simplified by cloud computing platforms. State of the art machine learning methods for spatial data which involve a reduction of spatial overfitting, handling of extrapolation situations and a spatially explicit error assessment, however, are currently mostly implemented in local computation frameworks. Here we present a workflow that combines the improved processing capabilities of the cloud computation platform openEO with state-of-the-art machine learning model development in R. OpenEO is used for standardized imagery acquisition and preprocessing to provide predictors for model training. To reduce overfitting, predictors which are meaningful for the mapping are identified via spatial variable selection as implemented in R packages. The mapping accuracy is assessed via spatial cross-validation and predictions are limited to the 'Area of Applicability' of the model. The workflow is designed to enhance and assess the spatial transferability of machine learning models which is demonstrated by a case study of a landcover classification based on Sentinel-2 imagery.

TI  - LWCDnet: A Lightweight Network for Efficient Cloud Detection in Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection is the task of detecting cloud areas in remote sensing images (RSIs), and it has attracted extensive research interest. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proposed and achieved great performance for cloud detection. However, due to the satellite's limitation in storage and memory, existing DL approaches, which suffer from extensive computation and large model size, are almost impossible to be deployed on satellites. To fill this gap, we target at studying effective and efficient cloud detection solutions that are suitable for satellites. In this article, we develop a lightweight autoencoder-based cloud detection method, namely, lightweight encoder-decoder cloud detection network (LWCDnet). In the encoder part, the designed novel lightweight dual-branch block (LWDBB) in the backbone extracts spatial and contextual information concurrently. Moreover, a lightweight feature pyramid module (LWFPM) is proposed to capture high-level multiscale contextual information. In the decoder part, the lightweight feature fusion module (LWFFM) compensates for the missing spatial and detail information from the encoder to the high-level feature maps. We evaluate the proposed method on two public datasets: LandSat8 and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LWCDnet achieves comparable accuracy as the state-of-the-art cloud detection methods and lightweight semantic segmentation algorithms. In the meantime, LWCDnet has much less computation burden with smaller model size.

TI  - Assessment of the Contribution of Polarimetric Persistent Scatterer Interferometry on Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of Sentinel-1 data are widely used for monitoring displacements of the Earth surface using persistent scatterer interferometry. By default over land, Sentinel-1 images include two polarimetric channels: 1) VV and 2) VH. However, most works in this application exploit only the VV channel, whereas the VH channel is discarded for its lower amplitude. Thanks to the development of polarimetric persistent scatterer interferometry methods, one can integrate multipolarization channels into a single optimal one. Previous studies proved that the number and spatial density of measurement points is increased. In this work, we explore the reason why the VH channel increases the number of measurement points when using the amplitude dispersion (D-A) as selection criterion. Results obtained over three geographical locations show that the VH channel helps in two ways. In the first place, the mean amplitude is increased for targets which have higher amplitude in VH channel, usually associated with rotated elements in the scene. In second place, and more importantly, the amplitude dispersion is decreased over many areas for which the VV channel exhibits fluctuations and peaks. Thanks to the insensitivity of the VH channel to these scene changes, it provides additional measurement points which are reliable despite their low amplitude. The increment of measurement points not only extends the spatial density and enables the detection of active deformation areas not found in the VV results but also provides more accurate results than only using the VV channel, thanks to the increased density of points, which helps the deformation estimation.

TI  - Dedicated satellite remote sensing combined with global navigation satellite system data used to remotely measure the status of land desertification
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Desert use and its management play a significant role in the conservation of land resources. The premise of developing and using deserts based on local conditions includes managing the physical characteristics of sandy desert land. We explore the various achievements of remote sensing of bare soil moisture and, specifically, employ two methods involving the remote sensing of surface physical characteristics, dynamic measurements, and Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) sensing by satellite. Some observation parameters of the Earth's surface emissivity are summarized, which were attained through remote observations. In addition, the bright temperature inversion model on the soil temperature, moisture content, and texture, and the GNSS-R soil moisture sensor and inversion model were analyzed. The influence of horizontal polarization of the surface roughness on the results of dedicated satellite measurement of emissivity was also analyzed. Further, a sensing separation model of soil moisture particle size for GNSS-R was derived. Soil moisture is related to soil reflectivity. The soil particle size determines soil porosity, which is directly related to the evaporation rate of water and affects the surface temperature, thereby affecting soil emissivity. We determined that a level of complementarity exists between the enhancement of emissivity and attenuation of reflectivity by roughness as well as between the emissivity of dedicated satellite measurement line polarization and the reflectivity of GNSS-R measurement with circular polarization. Based on this complementarity, a method of GNSS-R and dedicated satellite collaborative measurement of soil texture using satellite data is proposed. The experimental results show that the two methods are sensitive to the soil moisture content, but the sensitivity to the mixed components of sandy soil is very poor. Both the sensitivity of GNSS-R sensing to sand particle size and sand surface temperature are better than those of dedicated satellite sensing.

AB  - The frequent occurrence of forest fires in North America has caused severe perturbations to the local carbon cycles, making it critical to accurately simulate and detect the process of carbon emission from the forest after fires for environment sustainability. This paper proposed to take ecosystem respiration (Re), an essential but less noticed indicator, to estimate the ecosystem carbon flux. With flux site data and the corresponding MODIS data, we carried out a series of regression analyses by Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model, Decision Tree Regression (DTR) model and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model to estimate Re in the cases of six forest ecosystems which are in the fire recovery period. Meanwhile, the annual dynamic simulation and correlation analysis were conducted between Re and related environmental factors. The results show that obvious seasonal dynamic exists in Re, and temperature is the main control factor of forest ecosystem respiration. These models perform consistently well,especially the GBR model (R-2=0.74; RMSE=1.0; MAE=0.78).It indicates the great potential of using remote sensing data to invert ecosystem respiration and provides a new insight to estimate the spatial and temporal patterns of Re at a regional scale.

AB  - Rapid and accurate extraction of water body information is fundamental to disaster assessment. However, in SAR images, shadows often appear similar to the water regions, so the commonly threshold-based water detection methods easily confuse them. The purpose of this paper is to use Sentinel-1 polarimetric SAR data to find a simpler and more effective method to identify shadow areas out of water bodies. Considering a strong dependence on intensity of Wishart classifier, the weak backscattered regions on the SAR images will be categorized into the same class. We firstly use H / (alpha) over bar Wishart to roughly classify the PolSAR data to obtain a relatively complete experimental study area. Then, we further discriminate the shadow regions from the study area based on the difference of the entropy between the water body regions and the surrounding environment. The experimental results based on Sentinel-1 measured data prove the effectiveness of this method.

AB  - At present, the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is one of the few remote sensing methods that can realize rapid allday and all-weather mapping in difficult areas of surveying and mapping, and has unique advantages incomparable with traditional optical remote sensing technology. And SAR polarimetric scattering mechanism provides important theoretical basis for surface radar target recognition. The paper adopts the P-band polarization data acquired by Chinese Academy of Surveying and Mapping SAR system (CASMSAR) as well as the C-band polarization data from Radarsat-2 and use the Freeman-Durden decomposition method to analyze and compare the difference of six typical terrain targets' scattering characteristics of different band SAR images. Results are as follows : (1) the volume scattering values of vegetation at different height are relatively high in C-band SAR image, which can be distinguished from non-vegetation, but the scattering characteristics between vegetations are confusing. (2) For P-band SAR image, there is a great difference in the volume scattering characteristics between vegetations at different height, while little difference in the odd scattering characteristics among bare soil, water area, and burnt wheat fields. (3) The volume scattering characteristics of vegetations at high height are obvious in P-band SAR image, while those at low height are obvious in C-band SAR image.

TI  - Density Estimates as Representations of Agricultural Fields for Remote Sensing-Based Monitoring of Tillage and Vegetation Cover
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - We consider the use of remote sensing for large-scale monitoring of agricultural land use, focusing on classification of tillage and vegetation cover for individual field parcels across large spatial areas. From the perspective of remote sensing and modelling, field parcels are challenging as objects of interest due to highly varying shape and size but relatively uniform pixel content and texture. To model such areas we need representations that can be reliably estimated already for small parcels and that are invariant to the size of the parcel. We propose representing the parcels using density estimates of remote imaging pixels and provide a computational pipeline that combines the representation with arbitrary supervised learning algorithms, while allowing easy integration of multiple imaging sources. We demonstrate the method in the task of the automatic monitoring of autumn tillage method and vegetation cover of Finnish crop fields, based on the integrated analysis of intensity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarity bands of the Sentinel-1 satellite and spectral indices calculated from Sentinel-2 multispectral image data. We use a collection of 127,757 field parcels monitored in April 2018 and annotated to six tillage method and vegetation cover classes, reaching 70% classification accuracy for test parcels when using both SAR and multispectral data. Besides this task, the method could also directly be applied for other agricultural monitoring tasks, such as crop yield prediction.

M3  - Article
AB  - In Japan, tick-borne viruses such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus have been identified in humans, animals, and ticks. In addition, novel tick-borne viruses have been isolated from ticks in Japan. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of TBEV and novel viruses, particularly Tofla virus (TFLV), Kabuto Mountain virus (KAMV), and Muko virus (MUV) in wild boar in Nagasaki, Japan. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and neutralization tests were performed to detect antibodies against each virus. Wild boar serum tested positive for antibodies against KAMV, TFLV, and TBEV, but not MUV. This study revealed the seroprevalence of newly identified tick-borne viruses and TBEV in animals residing in the Nagasaki area. The seroprevalence of these viruses in sentinel animals may inform policies aimed at preventing tick-borne virus disease outbreaks.

AB  - Based on the relevant parameters and engineering geological conditions of pipe jacking construction of Hangzhou water intake upward moving project (phase I), the influence of explosion impact of buried oil storage tank in gas station on pipe jacking structure is numerically simulated based on finite element method. According to the conversion formula of TNT equivalent method, the gasoline explosion is converted into the corresponding TNT equivalent explosion for analysis, and the explosion shock wave over-pressure is 0.485 MPa by using empirical formula. The simulation results show that the maximum principal stress of the western pipeline decreases gradually from the near explosion source to the far end due to the explosion shock of the oil tank, but the influence of the explosion shock on the shear strain of the pipeline is not obvious. The axial force Fy, shear force Fx and Fz of the pipeline change periodically along the axis of the pipeline, and the plane bending moment Mx of the yz of the pipeline fluctuates greatly, and the fluctuation range is +/- 40KN center dot m. The maximum vibration velocity of the water pipeline caused by the oil tank explosion is about 6.54 cm / s, the maximum principal strain is 225x10(-6), and the maximum principal stress is 47.43 MPa, which is far less than the allowable value of the corresponding pipeline. When the oil tank explodes unexpectedly, the water pipeline will not be damaged, but when there are construction personnel working in the water pipeline, most of the personnel will die or the internal organs will be seriously damaged.

AB  - It is still a challenge to get relatively accurate wind speed under extreme wind conditions. In this study, thirteen RADARSAT-2 (RS-2) ScanSAR wide mode dual-polarization data were selected to establish a new hurricane wind speed model. Combined with European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) data and Stepped-Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) data, the wind speed retrieval model, which has been corrected by an incidence angle function, was proposed through strip segmentation. Compared with the ECWMF wind speed below 22 m/s, the bias of 2.056 m/s RMSE and 1.579 m/s were obtained. Compared with the SFMR measured wind speed above 22 m/s, the RMSE was 3.229 m/s and the bias was 2.489 m/s. Compared with Shen model and Horstmann model, the accuracy of wind velocity inversion is improved to a certain extent, especially under high wind speed conditions.

TI  - ESP-LRSMD: A Two-Step Detector for Ship Detection Using SLC SAR Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), an active microwave remote sensing equipment, can provide all-day, all-weather, and high-resolution images for Earth observation. Ship monitoring using SAR is significant to fishery application, marine transportation, maritime security, and so on. Most traditional SAR ship detection methods use the amplitude information of the SAR imagery and employ the constant false alarm rate (CFAR), deep learning, and other technologies to detect the ship targets. However, in addition to the amplitude image, the SAR single-look complex (SLC) data can also be utilized for ship detection since its complex-valued information is beneficial to characterize the ship's feature in the transforming domains. In this article, the strong scattering feature of ships in the image domain and low-rank feature in the transforming domain is studied, and on this basis, a two-step detector is proposed to detect ship targets in SAR SLC image. The first step is to identify the presence of ships, which is based on the eigen-subspace projection (ESP) technology to detect the occurrences of the ship targets in azimuth cells of the SAR data. The second step is to locate the position of ships, which is based on the low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition (LRSMD) to obtain the instantaneous frequency information of the ship targets in the time-frequency domain. Finally, the ship targets can be located in a line-by-line manner in the azimuth direction. Experimental results via European Sentinel-1A and Chinese Gaofen-3 single-pol SAR SLC data demonstrate the performance of the proposed detector.

TI  - Did the Greeks have a worldview? A comparative study of worldview?s genealogy
T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA I KONFLIKTOLOGIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper scrutinizes a classic passage from Heidegger, in which he argues that Weltanschauung is predominantly a Modern concept and that there was nothing similar in Antiquity. Using a comparative method, I try to demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct a kind of genealogy of the concept of worldview and to show clues as to its phenomena in Hellenic culture and philosophy and in Early Modern thought. Being not just a linguistic phenomenon, worldview could be analyzed as a metaconcept, articulated in non-Modern contexts and recognized as a "worldview" in terms of Modern philosophy. Considering the ancient Greek notion of ai rho epsilon sigma ic, I show its principle aspects in the sense of "philosophical school". I hold that it is possible to parallel it with the term Weltanschauung, coined in the German philosophical tradition and possessing its own epistemological features. To prove my argument, I refer to the ideas of Ancient Greek and Hellenic thinkers as well as the most eminent supporters and critics of the concept of Weltanschauung in Modern (primarily German) philosophies. In Conclusions I summarize the main traits I consider commensurate with those of ai rho epsilon sigma ic, which are: 1. Emergence in "turning points" of pivotal historical periods; 2. Articulation of the idea of wholeness and coherence of the Universe (the World); 3. One's free-will choice to support a concrete doctrine or point of view to the Universe in connection with its comprehension and one's moral principles.

M3  - Article
AB  - The subject of the study incorporates the problems and prospects of remote sensing of the Earth, an analysis of the effectiveness of the international legal framework in this area is given in the article.General and special methods of legal analysis were used.The main results of the research include the proof that from a technical point of view, the definition and concept of remote sensing do not cause disagreement among professionals, but it was not possible to achieve consensus on the international legal status of remote sensing. It is not in the main sources of international space law. The Principles of Remote Sensing of 1986 are imperfect and outdated in many respects, although they remain the only universal international document regulating remote sensing, and have not been challenged for more than 30 years. A balance has been established between the interests of states on the main controversial issues, such as the relationship between freedom of space monitoring, state sovereignty and access to remote sensing data.The results are practically significant, as they can serve as the basis for new normative legal acts at the international level, in the long term it is important to further expand cooperation in the field of remote sensing within the UN and other international organizations, conclude regional and bilateral agreements and develop national legislation.The conclusion of the study is that the formation of the legal framework for remote sensing occurs by integrating the norms of "soft laws" into national laws, fixing them in international treaties and, as a consequence, the emergence of norms of customary law and norms of international law.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing data products are widely used in many applications and science domains ranging from agriculture and emergency management to Earth and environmental sciences. Researchers have developed sophisticated and computationally intensive models for processing and analyzing such data with varying spatiotemporal resolutions from multiple sources. However, the computational intensity and expertise in using advanced cyberinfrastructure have held back the scalability and reproducibility of such models. To tackle this challenge, this research employs the CyberGIS-Compute middleware to achieve scalable and reproducible remote sensing data fusion across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions by harnessing advanced cyberinfrastructure. CyberGISCompute is a cyberGIS middleware framework for conducting computationally intensive geospatial analytics with advanced cyberinfrastructure resources such as those provisioned by XSEDE. Our case study achieved remote sensing data fusion at high spatial and temporal resolutions based on integrating CyberGIS-Compute with a cutting-edge deep learning model. This integrated approach also demonstrates how to achieve computational reproducibility of scalable remote sensing data fusion.

TI  - An integrated cyberGIS and machine learning framework for fine-scale prediction of Urban Heat Island using satellite remote sensing and urban sensor network data.
T2  - Urban informatics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Due to climate change and rapid urbanization, Urban Heat Island (UHI), featuring significantly higher temperature in metropolitan areas than surrounding areas, has caused negative impacts on urban communities. Temporal granularity is often limited in UHI studies based on satellite remote sensing data that typically has multi-day frequency coverage of a particular urban area. This low temporal frequency has restricted the development of models for predicting UHI. To resolve this limitation, this study has developed a cyber-based geographicinformation science and systems (cyberGIS)framework encompassing multiple machine learning models for predicting UHI with high-frequency urban sensor network data combined with remote sensing data focused on Chicago, Illinois, from 2018 to 2020. Enabled by rapid advances in urban sensor network technologies and high-performance computing, this framework is designed to predict UHI in Chicago with fine spatiotemporal granularity based on environmental data collected with the Array of Things (AoT) urban sensor network and Landsat-8 remote sensing imagery. Our computational experiments revealed that a random forest regression (RFR) model outperforms other models with the prediction accuracy of 0.45 degree Celsius in 2020 and 0.8 degree Celsius in 2018 and 2019 with mean absolute error as the evaluation metric. Humidity, distance to geographic center, and PM2.5 concentration are identified as important factors contributing to the model performance. Furthermore, we estimate UHI in Chicago with 10-min temporal frequency and 1-km spatial resolution on the hottest day in 2018. It is demonstrated that the RFR model can accurately predict UHI at fine spatiotemporal scales with high-frequency urban sensor network data integrated with satellite remote sensing data.

AB  - As a typical representative of the next generation SAR mission, the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) provides three C-band SAR satellites with shorter revisit time and broader spatial coverage, which will be widely used in various earth observation applications including sea ice sensing. The Sentinel-1 mission comprises two C-band SAR satellites with dual-polarized imaging capability, providing open and free data from the European Space Agency (ESA). Sea ice classification results of the two C-band SAR missions with a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network: Normalizer-Free ResNet (NFNet) are compared in this paper. HH, HV and cross-polarization ratio are extracted from the overlapping area of dual-polarized RCM and Sentinel-1 images acquired on similar dates. The sea ice classification results shows that RCM Medium Resolution 50m mode performs better than Sentinel-1 EW GRD Medium Resolution mode for the data used in this study.

TI  - A Meta-Analysis of Sea Ice Monitoring Using Spaceborne Polarimetric SAR: Advances in the Last Decade
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice profoundly influences ocean circulation, the polar environment, biology, climate, and commercial activities. The rapidly changing sea ice environment and increased human activities in polar regions drive the demand for sea ice monitoring. Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely adopted for sea ice sensing due to its all-weather, high spatial resolution, and day-and-night imaging capabilities. Previous reviews have addressed sea ice sensing based on various applications and sensors. However, no meta-analysis has been performed to specifically explore spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing. Therefore, this study aims to provide a meta-analysis of spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing by investigating 182 articles published in the last decade. Sea ice sensing applications for retrieving four key geophysical parameters (sea ice types, concentration, thickness, and motion) as well as SAR scattering characteristics analysis for sea ice are included. The review database was created with 15 fields including quantitative and qualitative perspectives, such as SAR frequency, polarization mode, methodology, evaluation metrics, etc. This meta-analysis aims to provide comparisons among different techniques and identify current challenges to determine effective methods for sea ice sensing. Overall, a snapshot of spaceborne polarimetric SAR-data-based sea ice sensing is presented through the meta-analysis, which could benefit researchers for future studies to advance this field.

AB  - Carbon losses have enormous impacts on ecosystem and indicative meaning for ecological stability, which are, therefore, necessary to be evaluated. In recent years, with the increasingly number of people settling in Amazon basin, large areas of tropical forests have been exploited, which took the mainly responsible for local deforestation.Carbon losses are hardly to be evaluated directly but can be inferred from the relationship between potential carbon and forest structures referring to previous studies. Remote sensing-based methods are widely used because of the obvious advantages of, such as the repeatability of data collection, high correlations between spectral bands and vegetation parameters etc. However, the selection of the spatial resolution of data is a critical issue that should be taken into consideration for it influences the performance of image texture thereby the discrimination of land covers, especial in complex forest stand structure. The approach for image feature extraction used in the study is explained.Based on the available datasets, this study aims to estimate the potential carbon losses across selected plot in Nova Vida Ranch, Rondonia, Brazil between 1989 and 2001. The results showed that carbon potentials decreased at least 1.1*108 (Kg C) during the 12 years, which would affect all the climate, wildlife habitats and biodiversity. The study suggested that it is significantly important to reduce the uncertainties that are caused by saturation in some of the tropic areas. To pursue this, the research on the integration of optical and radar data is worth to experiment in further study.

TI  - SAR Interference Suppression Algorithm Based on Low-Rank and Sparse Matrix Decomposition in Time-Frequency Domain
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Radio frequency electromagnetic interference is a relatively common phenomenon, especially for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems working in P- or L-band. Compared with the suppression of narrowband interference, that of wideband interference, particularly of those whose signal parameters have frequently changing property, is still a sophisticated problem. In this letter, a suppression algorithm for interference with wideband and complicated parameters is proposed, based on low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition (LRSMD) in time-frequency domain (TFD) of the signal. The proposed algorithm begins with transforming the SAR signal into TFD. After that, LRSMD based on bilateral random projection (BRP) is applied to decompose the time-frequency spectrum matrix into three parts, a low-rank matrix standing for interference, a sparse matrix standing for SAR signal, and a noise matrix. Finally, inversely transform the sparse matrix into the time domain to obtain SAR signal without interference. The proposed algorithm is applied to a single look complex (SLC) SAR data of Sentinel-1 to validate its effect and efficiency.

M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to the collisions of morals in stories by the Russian emigrant writer Boris Shiryayev (1889-1959), specifically Sheep's Puddle and Kudeyar's Oak. They are dedicated to the life of the people in those territories which were occupied by the Nazis. The purpose of this work is to clarify the conflict between Christian morality, patriotism and the totalitarian state. The key plot lines of both works are related to painful aspects of history: collaborationism, the partisan movement, the underground Soviet and anti-Bolshevik organisations. Shiryayev's works illustrate how the confrontation among people split by the Revolution resulted in a civil war that unfolded within the World War itself. Various aspects of Shiryayev's artistic worldview are also investigated. The article shows the points of coincidence and deviation between his "Russian Christianity" and the Gospel doctrine. The motive of "holy revenge" and its connection with the folk legend of Kudeyar is also considered.

TI  - End-to-End Method With Transformer for 3-D Detection of Oil Tank From Single SAR Image
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, deep learning has been successfully applied in the field of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image object detection. However, unlike ships and tanks targets, the oil tank targets in SAR image are usually dense and compact with more overlaps and discrete scattering centers, which greatly increases the difficulty of extracting location and structural parameters. Most of the existing methods transfer the methods suitable for natural image to the SAR image field, without considering the unique characteristics of SAR image. Therefore, in this article, we propose an improved model based on the end-to-end transformer network, which is the first model introducing transformer network to 3-D detection of oil tank targets from single SAR image. We input the incidence angle into the transformer model as a priori token. Then, we propose a feature description operator (FDO) based on the scattering centers that are used as an aid to improve the precision of predictions. In addition, we also propose a cylinder IOU as a more suitable evaluation metric for 3-D detection of oil tank. Finally, we evaluate our model on an SAR image dataset that contains SAR images from RADARSAT-2, TerraSAR-X, and GF-3 with different incidence angles. Our experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves the AP of 77.6% compared with 60.8% of baseline, which proves the effectiveness of the introduction of observation conditions, cylinder IOU loss (CI Loss), and the FDO based on the scattering centers in our model and is appealing for 3-D detection of oil tank.

TI  - Machine Learning Based Long-Term Water Quality in the Turbid Pearl River Estuary, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended solid (TSS) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) are critical indicators of water quality. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Aqua satellite provides a critical tool to map TSS and Chl-a on a daily basis. However, robust algorithms are required to retrieve TSS and Chl-a from MODIS/Aqua images in the turbid Pearl River Estuary (PRE). Here, a new artificial neural network algorithm was developed to estimate TSS and Chl-a in the PRE using a large amount of in situ measurements spanning more than a decade. Cross-validation showed that the ANN-based algorithm presented good performance with R(2)s of 0.73 and 0.66 for TSS and Chl-a, respectively. The ANN-based algorithm outperformed existing empirical and semi-analytical algorithms. By implementing the proposed algorithm to MODIS/Aqua images, TSS and Chl-a from August 2002 to July 2020 over the PRE were obtained. The results show that TSS decreased from northwest to southeast in all seasons while peaked in winter and summer. Chl-a peaked in summer and the high Chl-a patch transferred from the upper reach to the lower reach of the PRE with the increase of river discharge. TSS decreased at an annual rate of similar to 0.13 mg L-1 while Chl-a increased at an annual rate of similar to 0.05 mg m(-3) in the last 18 years. Our findings suggest that machine learning provides a practical approach to estimate TSS and Chl-a in turbid estuaries via MODIS/Aqua images and the approach developed in this study can be applied to other turbid waters with similar optical properties.

CL  - Shanghai, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - With the development of the remote sensing technology, the availability of satellite images has been dramatically increased with high quantity and quality. Diverse information can be obtained from these multiple imaging sources. For example, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery measures physical properties of the observed scene in all-weather and full-time situation and follows a range-based imaging geometry, while optical imagery measures chemical characteristics of the scene and follows a perspective imaging geometry and needs both daylight and a cloudless sky. These multisource remote sensing images, once fused together, provide a more comprehensive interpretation of remote sensing scenes. Recent advances in Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown great promise in translating imagery between modalities, as well in the generation of high resolution and realistic imagery. In this paper, a GAN architecture is used to solve the task of fusing SAR and optical remote sensing imagery. The network learns the mapping between input and output image, and learns a loss function to train this mapping. Specifically, the generated network is divided into two parts, encoding and decoding. The fused image including SAR intensity and texture information is generated by the generator. Other details of the optical image are added to the fusion image gradually by the discriminator. The structural similarity loss function of GAN is to make the training of GAN model more accurate on the whole structure. Experiments on Sentinel- 1and Sentinel-2 imagery confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) is an important factor affecting runoff and sediment yield of watershed. Dongjiang River is the main source of drink water for Hong Kong and cities in the Pearl River Delta Area, which experienced a rapid urbanization and blooming economy growth. Studying the land use changes using time series remote sensing and their influences on runoff and sediment yield in watershed-scale can provide valuable information for the formulation of land use plans in Dongjiang Watershed. This study constructed a SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model of the Dongjiang River basin and analyzed the LULC changes from 2001 to 2012 using MODIS land use data products (MCD12Q1). The influence of LULC changes on the runoff and sediment yield in the Dongjiang basin was analyzed by simulating the runoff and sediment yield under different LULC scenarios. Our results show that the main types of land use in the Dongjiang River basin were evergreen woodland, grassland and agricultural land from 2001 to 2012, accounting for more than 80% of the total area of the basin. During the period of study, the evergreen forest land increased by 14.46%, while grassland, agricultural land and mixed forest decreased by 4.78%, 4.54% and 3.97%, respectively. These changes led to an increase of 0.22mm in the average monthly runoff in the basin, which reached by 2.39mm in flood season (April-September). At the same time range, the average monthly sediment yield decreased by 0.79 t/ha with a more significant decreasing by 6.29 t/ha in flood season (From April to September). Our results indicate that long term conversions of grassland, agricultural land and mixed forest to evergreen woodland in watershed will lead to the increasing runoff and decrease of sediments of river, which is important for catchment-scale resource planning and environmental management.

TI  - Developing a Land Continuous Variable Estimator to Generate Daily Land Products From Landsat Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Generating spatially and temporally consistent biophysical products at the global scale from Landsat data for monitoring and assessing surface change dynamics remains a challenge. This article presents an inversion framework called Land continuous Variable Estimator (LoVE)-Landsat for estimating a group of spatiotemporal continuous land surface variables with daily temporal resolution from Landsat 5, 7, and 8 top-of-atmosphere (TOA) data. LoVE-Landsat adopts a data assimilation approach originally developed for coarse-resolution satellite data, such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). Major improvements to the approach include constructing empirical dynamic equations based on MODIS retrievals and other ancillary information, developing an artificial neural networks (ANN)-based emulator of the coupled radiative transfer (RT) model of atmosphere and land surface (vegetation, soil, and snow) as the observation operator, and designing a hybrid four-dimensional variational (4DVar) and ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation algorithm. The approach starts with generating the initial cloud-free regularly distributed (every 16 days) time series of Landsat data. The 4DVar is then used to assimilate clear-sky snow-free Landsat TOA observations over one year into the empirical dynamic evolution models of the land surface variables (e.g., leaf area index-LAI). The EnKF is then used to further adjust the state vector at the actual Landsat acquisition times. After determining a core set of variables (e.g., LAI), other variables, such as broadband albedo, emissivity, and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR), are calculated by the coupled RT model. Several experimental cases are presented to demonstrate that the proposed LoVE-Landsat framework is effective to estimate daily land surface variables.

AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) plays a key role in various land surface processes. Limited to the balance between the spatial resolution and revisit interval, it is difficult to obtain the high spatiotemporal resolution LST via satellite remote sensing. Downscaling is an economical approach to achieve it, and it has been relatively mature associated with a large number of land surface parameters. However, it still needs to address issues such as the physical meaning of the downscaling method. This study implemented a practical LST downscaling method that combined the spatial and temporal information to obtain a higher spatial resolution LST over an oasis in the Heihe River basin. The downscaled 500-m and 250-m LST shows more details, especially the boundary between the oasis and the desert. The validation against in-situ LST also shows that the downscaled LST has similar accuracy and precision with the original MODIS LST, with a RMSE of 1.78 K and 1.70 K at daytime, 1.36 K and 1.40 K at nighttime, for 500-m and 250-m, respectively.

TI  - An In-Flight Radiometric Calibration Method Considering Adjacency Effects for High-Resolution Optical Sensors Over Artificial Targets
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When using a field calibration site to perform in-orbit radiometric calibration of a space-borne remote sensor, the measured signal by the sensor may contain radiation from adjacent pixels, due to scattering in the Earth's atmosphere and the sensor viewing characteristics. If this is not accounted for in the modeling, the accuracy of the radiometric calibration will be reduced. Nonuniformities of the ground target are more significant for the calibration of high-resolution sensors. In addition, if the brightness contrast of neighboring targets is not small, the impact of the adjacency effects will be more significant. It is important to quantitatively analyze and estimate the influence of this kind of adjacency effects, to reduce the uncertainty of in-orbit radiometric calibration. To evaluate the adjacency effects caused by atmospheric multiple scattering, this article constructed a local atmospheric point spread function model using long time-series satellite-ground synchronous observation data and developed an adjacency effects simulation method, which considers background reflectance spectral information. Tests on Sentinel-2A and Worldview-3 imagery overpassing the Baotou calibration and validation site (Baotou C&V site) (China) indicate that the proposed modeling method can effectively account for the influence of the adjacency effects in vicarious calibration. Uncertainties of relevant parameters and their contributions to the calibration result were also analyzed, and uncertainty assessment results show that the vicarious radiometric calibration scheme considering adjacency effects correction can bring about a total uncertainty less than 7%.

AB  - High-precision cloud detection for remote sensing image is of great significance for applications in agriculture, environment, meteorology and other fields. Cloud detection in bright surface environments and thin clouds identification have always been a challenge in cloud detection research. Aiming at this problem, a cloud detection method for remote sensing images based on difference features and semantic segmentation network is proposed in this paper. Cloudy and cloudless images of the same area are used to obtain difference features, and cloudless images are used as the surface reference. The multi-band cloud detection network based on U-network (U-net) fully learns the difference feature between clouds and the surface, and combines the feature information of the shallow and deep layers to accurately identify the cloud and the surface. Experiments were conducted on the Landsat 8 validation dataset. The results show that the proposed method achieves good performance. It improves the detection accuracy and reduces the misclassification over the bright surface underlying compared with the method based on top of atmosphere reflectance (TOA).

TI  - Hyperspectral Image Classification Based on Capsule Network
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The conventional convolutional neural network performs not well enough in the ground objects classification because of its insufficient ability in maintaining sensitive spectral information and characterizing the covariance of spatial structure, resulting from the narrow sensitive frequency band and complex spatial structure with diversity of hyperspectral remote sensing data which caused more serious phenomena of "same material, different spectra" and "different material, same spectra". Therefore, an improved capsule network is proposed and introduced into hyperspectral image target recognition. A convolution structure combining shallow features and multi-scale depth features is put forward to reduce the phenomena of "different material, same spectra" firstly, and then the diversity of the spatial structure is expressed by the capsule vector and sub-capsule division in channel wise, so that the averaging effect of the convolution process is weakened in the spectral domain and the spatial domain to reduce the phenomena of "same material, different spectra". By comparing the experimental results on the hyperspectral data sets such as Indian Pines, Salinas, Tea Tree and Xiongan, the capsule network shows strong spatial structure expression ability, flexible deep and shallow feature fusion ability in multi-scale, and its accuracy in target recognition is better than that of conventional convolutional neural networks, so it is suitable for the recognition of complex targets in hyperspectral images.

AB  - This work proposes a Multi-Stage Fusion Network (MSFNet) for semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remote sensing data by exploiting a multi-stage transformer architecture. The proposed MSFNet fuses information of different scales and modalities using a multi-stage scheme based on cross-attention mechanism. More specifically, the proposed MSFNet is composed of two Multi-Level Transformers (ML-Trans), one Crossmodal Fusion Transformer (CFTrans) and one Global-Context Augmented Transformer (GCATrans). DMLTrans and CFTrans are designed to fuse features in different levels in each modality and high-level crossmodal abstract features, respectively, whereas GCATrans enhances the fusion feature of the main modal. Capitalizing on MSFNet, this work demonstrates the fusion of red-green-blue (RGB) remote sensing images and digital surface model (DSM) data. Extensive experiments on large-scale fine-resolution remote sensing data sets, namely the ISPRS Vaihingen, confirm the excellent performance of the proposed architecture as compared to conventional multimodal methods.

M3  - Article
AB  - Driven by the rapid development of Earth observation sensors, semantic segmentation using multimodal fusion of remote sensing data has drawn substantial research attention in recent years. However, existing multimodal fusion methods based on convolutional neural networks cannot capture long-range dependencies across multiscale feature maps of remote sensing data in different modalities. To circumvent this problem, this work proposes a crossmodal multiscale fusion network (CMFNet) by exploiting the transformer architecture. In contrast to the conventional early, late, or hybrid fusion networks, the proposed CMFNet fuses information of different modalities at multiple scales using the cross-attention mechanism. More specifically, the CMFNet utilizes a novel cross-modal attention architecture to fuse multiscale convolutional feature maps of optical remote sensing images and digital surface model data through a crossmodal multiscale transformer (CMTrans) and a multiscale context augmented transformer (MCATrans). The CMTrans can effectively model long-range dependencies across multiscale feature maps derived from multimodal data, while the MCATrans can learn discriminative integrated representations for semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on two large-scale fine-resolution remote sensing datasets, namely ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam, confirm the excellent performance of the proposed CMFNet as compared to other multimodal fusion methods.

TI  - Oil Spill Detection Based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Using Polarimetric Scattering Information From Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill accidents can cause severe ecological disasters; hence, the timely and effective detection of oil spills on the marine surface is of great significance. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is very suitable for large-scale oil spill monitoring. As a more advanced form of SAR, polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) can provide more scattering information of land objects, which can help to improve the accuracy of oil spill detection. However, the current studies of oil spill detection by SAR data have mainly focused on using SAR intensity or amplitude information, and the phase information and other polarimetric information have not been fully utilized. To solve this problem, using Sentinel-1 dual-polarimetric images as the data source, this article presents an intelligent oil spill detection architecture based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), in which both the amplitude information and phase information are utilized. Furthermore, to improve the feature discrimination capability, the Cloude polarimetric decomposition parameters are also integrated into the proposed model. The results show that the improved DeepLabv3+ model, which takes ResNet-101 as the backbone network and group normalization (GN) as the normalization layer, can achieve superior performance than those traditional methods. Moreover, the model is better able to capture the fine details of oil spill instances and can achieve fine-scale segmentation.

TI  - An Improved MODIS NIR PWV Retrieval Algorithm Based on an Artificial Neural Network Considering the Land-Cover Types
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating precipitable water vapor (PWV) with high accuracy and spatial resolution is important in many disciplines. Water vapor absorption and non-absorption channels can be observed in the near-infrared (NIR) ray of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), which can be used to retrieve PWV. However, traditional algorithms overestimate the NIR PWV in North America. This study proposes a novel NIR retrieval algorithm based on machine learning that considers land-cover types to estimate high-accuracy PWV. To do this, nonlinear models between MODIS NIR transmittance, based on the two-and three-channel ratio, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) PWV, recorded by the SuomiNet GNSS network, are established using a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). Verification shows that the root mean square error (RMSE)/standard deviation (STD)/bias of the two-channel ratio PWV is 1.29/1.29/0.02 mm, respectively, and the improvements of RMSE and STD are 66.32% and 37.98%, respectively. The RMSE/STD/bias values of the three-channel ratio PWV are 1.29/1.29/0.02 mm, respectively, and the improvements in RMSE and STD are 68.67% and 42.31%, respectively. In addition, the surface verification of the proposed method in six land-cover types shows that both the two-and three-channel ratio methods can yield satisfactory PWV estimates. Compared with the MODIS PWV products, the proposed method yields remarkable progress.

TI  - Balancing Colors of Nonoverlapping Mosaicking Images With Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing images of different moments or sensors can be stitched together to produce a new image under uniform geographic coordinate systems, where the overlapping areas were needed for color harmony. In this letter, a reference-based mosaicking method is proposed for images either with or without overlapping areas. The new method introduces a low-resolution image for spectral reference that spans all the mosaicking scope. A generative adversarial network is harnessed for color harmony, which transfers all the mosaicking images to the time of the reference image for further stitch with the graph cut and pyramid gradient methods. The proposed method is compared with three color harmony methods or tools by mosaicking the red, green, and blue bands of Landsat-8 images with MODIS as the reference. The digital evaluations demonstrate that the new method outweighs other methods regarding radiometric and spectral fidelity.

TI  - Landsat Snow-Free Surface Albedo Estimation Over Sloping Terrain: Algorithm Development and Evaluation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo plays a key role in global climate modeling as a factor controlling the energy budget. Satellite observations were utilized to estimate surface albedo at global and regional scales with good precision over flat areas. However, because topography greatly complicates radiative transfer (RT) processes, estimating the albedo of rugged terrain with satellite data remains a challenge. In addition, albedo definitions over sloping terrain differ from that for flat areas. They include horizontal/horizontal sloped surface albedo (HHSA) and inclined/inclined sloped surface albedo (IISA). Methods for retrieving HHSA and IISA in mountains have not been well-explored. Here, we retrieved HHSA and IISA on sloping terrain from Landsat 8 using a direct estimation algorithm. We simulated a dataset of Landsat top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance and surface albedo with discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model, for variable atmospheric, vegetation, soil, and topography properties. Then, we used artificial neural networks (ANNs) to derive an empirical relationship between TOA reflectance and surface albedo. The accuracy of our method was verified with in situ measurements: root mean squared error (RMSE) and bias equal to 0.029 and -0.010 for HHSA, and 0.023 and -0.001 for IISA, respectively. Several albedo results (HHSA, IISA, values without topographic consideration) were evaluated and compared. HHSA was found similar to albedo without topographic consideration, but IISA, considered as the "true albedo" for sloping terrain, showed large difference from them. This study demonstrated the feasibility of surface albedo estimation from Landsat TOA reflectance directly in rugged terrains and advanced our understanding of energy budget in mountains.

TI  - Estimation of Cotton Leaf Area Index (LAI) Based on Spectral Transformation and Vegetation Index
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been increasingly applied to crop growth monitoring due to their advantages, such as their rapid and repetitive capture ability, high resolution, and low cost. LAI is an important parameter for evaluating crop canopy structure and growth without damage. Accurate monitoring of cotton LAI has guiding significance for nutritional diagnosis and the accurate fertilization of cotton. This study aimed to obtain hyperspectral images of the cotton canopy using a UAV carrying a hyperspectral sensor and to extract effective information to achieve cotton LAI monitoring. In this study, cotton field experiments with different nitrogen application levels and canopy spectral images of cotton at different growth stages were obtained using a UAV carrying hyperspectral sensors. Hyperspectral reflectance can directly reflect the characteristics of vegetation, and vegetation indices (VIs) can quantitatively describe the growth status of plants through the difference between vegetation in different band ranges and soil backgrounds. In this study, canopy spectral reflectance was extracted in order to reduce noise interference, separate overlapping samples, and highlight spectral features to perform spectral transformation; characteristic band screening was carried out; and VIs were constructed using a correlation coefficient matrix. Combined with canopy spectral reflectance and VIs, multiple stepwise regression (MSR) and extreme learning machine (ELM) were used to construct an LAI monitoring model of cotton during the whole growth period. The results show that, after spectral noise reduction, the bands screened by the successive projections algorithm (SPA) are too concentrated, while the sensitive bands screened by the shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) are evenly distributed. Secondly, the calculation of VIs after spectral noise reduction can improve the correlation between vegetation indices and LAI. The DVI (540,525) correlation was the largest after standard normal variable transformation (SNV) pretreatment, with a correlation coefficient of -0.7591. Thirdly, cotton LAI monitoring can be realized only based on spectral reflectance or VIs, and the ELM model constructed by calculating vegetation indices after SNV transformation had the best effect, with verification set R-2 = 0.7408, RMSE = 1.5231, and rRMSE = 24.33%, Lastly, the ELM model based on SNV-SFLA-SNV-VIs had the best performance, with validation set R-2 = 0.9066, RMSE = 0.9590, and rRMSE = 15.72%. The study results show that the UAV equipped with a hyperspectral sensor has broad prospects in the detection of crop growth index, and it can provide a theoretical basis for precise cotton field management and variable fertilization.

TI  - Study on Spatial and Temporal Changes of Vegetation Coverage in Gannan Prefecture Based on Different Geo-morphological Zones and Their Influencing Factors
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture is situated at the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau, in the transition area between the first and second terraces, with complex and variable landfonn types and very pronounced differences in vegetation coverage. Based on MODIS EVI data from 2000 to 2018, the spatial and temporal trends of the change of vegetation coverage in different geomorphological zones of Gannan Prefecture and their influencing factors were studied and the results show that : (1) Based on temporal changes, the enhanced vegetation index ( EVI) growth trends of the northwestern mountain plateau zones, the eastern mountainous hilly zones, and the southern Mindie Valley zones in Gannan Prefecture between 2000 and 2018 were 0. 000 8, 0. 001 1, and 0. 000 9 a(-1), respectively. ( 2 ) Based on spatial changes, the fractional vegetation coverage ( FVC ) of Gannan Prefecture demonstrated a decreasing spatial distribution from southwest to northeast. The mountainous area in the northwest was dominated by high coverage, the mountainous and hilly area in the east was dominated by medium coverage, and the Mindie Valley area in the south showed the alternate distribution of low coverage and high coverage. (3) In Gannan, the proportion of EVI improvement (approximately 54%) is greater than the proportion of degradation ( about 37%). The majority of degraded EVI areas are located in the north- western mountain plateau of Maqu and Luqu and the southern valleys of Diebu. The majority of EVI improvement areas are located in the eastern mountainous and hilly terrain. (4) The EVI influencing factors in various geomorphological zones of Gannan Prefecture are different. In this regard, human activity factors and natural environmental factors are the primary determinants of EVI in the northwestern mountain plateau zones, whereas natural environmental factors are the primary determinants of EVI in the eastern mountainous hilly zones and the southern Mindie valley zones.

AB  - Snow cover is one of the most active elements of the cryosphere and plays an important role in the surface radiation budget and water balance. Optical satellite remote sensing has become an important tool for snow identification and monitoring. The Sentinel-2 A/B satellite has become an important data source for snow cover extraction because of its high radiation resolution, which reduces the problem of snow/ice saturation in remote sensing observations. The normalized differential snow cover index (NDSI) and the snow cover index considering the forest cover area (NDFSI) are important methods for snow cover extraction, but due to the strong spatial heterogeneity and fast change speed of snow cover in mountainous areas, using the classical fixed threshold method to extract snow cover will result in a large omission error. In this paper, a dynamic threshold method is constructed by synthesizing the effects of the type of snow cover period, aspect and snow underlying land coverage type on the snow cover NDSI/NDFSI. Compared with the high-resolution GF-2 snow map results, the dynamic threshold method has higher accuracy in extracting snow cover, and the overall classification accuracy, omission error, commission error and Kappa coefficient are 97.70%, 0.20%, 11.17% and 0.93 respectively. The dynamic threshold method is used to extract snow cover in a snow cover period in the Babao River Basin. The snow cover rate in the basin fluctuates greatly with time, and the spatial distribution of snow cover is uneven, with more snow cover in mountainous areas and rapid changes in snow cover in river valleys.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bohai Sea ice creates obstacles for maritime navigation and offshore activities. A better understanding of ice conditions is valuable for sea-ice management. The evolution of 67 years of seasonal ice thickness in a coastal region (Yingkou) in the Northeast Bohai Sea was simulated by using a snow/ice thermodynamic model, using local weather-station data. The model was first validated by using seasonal ice observations from field campaigns and a coastal radar (the season of 2017/2018). The model simulated seasonal ice evolution well, particularly ice growth. We found that the winter seasonal mean air temperature in Yingkou increased by 0.33 degrees C/decade slightly higher than air temperature increase (0.27 degrees C/decade) around Bohai Sea. The decreasing wind-speed trend (0.05 m/s perdecade) was a lot weaker than that averaged (0.3 m/s per decade) between the early 1970s and 2010s around the entire Bohai Sea. The multi-decadal ice-mass balance revealed decreasing trends of the maximum and average ice thickness of 2.6 and 0.8 cm/decade, respectively. The length of the ice season was shortened by 3.7 days/decade, and ice breakup dates were advanced by 2.3 days/decade. All trends were statistically significant. The modeled seasonal maximum ice thickness is highly correlated (0.83, p < 0.001) with the Bohai Sea Ice Index (BoSI) used to quantify the severity of the Bohai Sea ice condition. The freezing-up date, however, showed a large interannual variation without a clear trend. The simulations indicated that Bohai ice thickness has grown continuously thinner since 1951/1952. The time to reach 0.15 m level ice was delayed from 3 January to 21 January, and the ending time advanced from 6 March to 19 February. There was a significant weakening of ice conditions in the 1990s, followed by some recovery in 2000s. The relationship between large-scale climate indices and ice condition suggested that the AO and NAO are strongly correlated with interannual changes in sea-ice thickness in the Yingkou region.

TI  - Challenges and Prospects to Time Series Burst Overlap Interferometry (BOI): Some Insights From a New BOI Algorithm Test Over the Chaman Fault
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - How to obtain millimeter-scale along-track deformations using phase measurements is still a pending question for interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) community. Although burst overlap interferometry (BOI) technique makes this question seem tractable, most applications of BOI still focus on extracting centimeter-scale deformations for coseismic cases. To further improve measurement accuracy, here we propose a new time series BOI algorithm toward maximizing the performance of BOI and obtaining as high accuracy of the along-track deformations as possible. This algorithm has three major steps. The first step is to enhance BOI phase signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) using our newly proposed phase estimator. In the second step, we apply a strain model-based method to further suppress the phase noise and rescue more data points. In the third step, a misregistration correction procedure which considers plate motion is applied to mitigate BOI time series bias. We tested our proposed algorithm over the Chaman fault. Although the derived millimeter-scale deformations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, experimental results show that decorrelation and ionospheric disturbance are still two great challenges of BOI techniques.

TI  - A New Spatiotemporal InSAR Tropospheric Noise Filtering: An Interseismic Case Study Over Central San Andreas Fault
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time-series SAR interferometry (TS-InSAR) has been widely used to map the millimeter-scale interseismic displacements. Tropospheric noise is still a key error source that hinders further improvement of such measurement. In this article, a new spatiotemporal TS-InSAR tropospheric noise filtering is proposed to approach higher accuracy measurements. We first construct a 2-D arc network for all the data points, and based on that a temporal high-pass and spatial low-pass filtering is applied to estimate the tropospheric noise for all the points. To better filter out long-wavelength interseismic displacements in temporal high-pass filtering, we construct four-candidate time-series models to model the displacement histories for each arc. To avoid overfitting, the F hypothesis test is applied to select the most suitable model for all arcs. Notably, instead of the commonly used Delaunay network, the all-pairs-shortest-path algorithm in the graph theory is employed to reconstruct all arcs and to improve the applicability of the time-series model. Comprehensive tests using synthetic data and Sentinel-1 data covering Central San Andreas Fault (CSAF) creep section validate our tropospheric noise removal approach in measuring the interseismic velocity across the fault.

TI  - Time Series Phase Unwrapping Based on Graph Theory and Compressed Sensing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time Series SAR interferometry (InSAR) (TS-InSAR) has been widely applied to monitor the crustal deformation with centimeter- to millimeter-level accuracy. Phase unwrapping (PU) errors have proven to be one of the main sources of bias that hinder achieving such high accuracy. In this article, a new time series PU approach is developed to improve the unwrapping accuracy. The rationale behind the proposed method is to first improve the sparse unwrapping by mitigating the phase gradients in a 2-D network and then correcting the unwrapping errors in time, based on the triplet phase closure. Rather than the commonly used Delaunay network, we employ the all-pairs-shortest-path (APSP) algorithm from graph theory to maximize the temporal coherence of all edges and to approach the phase continuity assumption in the 2-D spatial domain. Next, we formulate the PU error correction in the 1-D temporal domain as compressed sensing (CS) problem, according to the sparsity of the remaining phase ambiguity cycles. We finally estimate phase ambiguity cycles by means of integer linear programming (ILP). The comprehensive comparisons using synthetic and real Sentinel-1 data covering Lost Hills, California, confirm the validity of the proposed 2-D x002B; 1-D unwrapping approach and its superior performance compared to previous methods.

TI  - Go Extra Miles: An Additional Error Correction Procedure Aimed to Further Improve Phase Unwrapping Accuracy and Reduce Creep Model Uncertainty
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) phase unwrapping error is a major limiting factor on the InSAR-derived tectonic deformation velocity. This is particularly the case when atmospheric turbulence, large deformation gradient and strong phase noise exist. To address limitations of existing phase unwrapping error correction methods, here we present a new algorithm that integrates decorrelation phase correction, triplet phase closure (TPC) test and integer linear programming (ILP) to overcome this limit. The rationale behind is that we mitigate the phase inconsistency using decorrelation correction and then detect the phase unwrapping error magnitude using TPC. Next we borrow the ILP from Compressed Sensing that converts the phase unwrapping error correction to a sparse signal recovery problem. We demonstrated the validity of our method by using synthetic data and 5-year Sentinel-1 real data covering the Central San Andreas Fault creeping section, where exists obvious tectonic deformation, strong atmospheric disturbance and decorrelated scatterers, and the inverted long-term creep model constrained by InSAR velocity after correction shows a lower uncertainty than that constrained by the uncorrected one.

TI  - FY4QPE-MSA: An All-Day Near-Real-Time Quantitative Precipitation Estimation Framework Based on Multispectral Analysis From AGRI Onboard Chinese FY-4 Series Satellites
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and near-real-time rain information at fine scales is critical for forecasting local weather and floods. Traditional classical infrared (IR) cloud-top brightness temperature data alone do not contain sufficient precipitation-related information, and the introduction of visible (VIS) observations limits their applications to daytime. Methods for the efficient and comprehensive utilization of multichannel IR observations for accurately retrieving all-day near-real-time rain rates with consistent high quality warrant further exploration. In this study, we propose an all-day near-real-time quantitative precipitation estimation framework based on multispectral analysis (MSA) from the Advanced Geosynchronous Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard Chinese FY-4 series satellites; the proposed framework is called FY4QPE-MSA. Multiple IR bands are comprehensively and efficiently considered by adopting the principal component analysis technique to reduce the dimensionality to a few independent features while preserving most of the variations. The main conclusions include, but are not limited to, the following aspects: 1) the MSA from IR channels provides valuable information that facilitates the more accurate delineations of the precipitation occurrences; 2) FY4AQPE-MSA outperforms FY4AQPE-Offical [similar to 20% gain in the Pearson correlation coefficient (CC), similar to 25% gain in the root mean square error (RMSE), and similar to 15% gain in the critical success index (CSI)], FY4AQPE-Single (similar to 10% gain in CC, similar to 15% gain in RMSE, and similar to 15% gain in CSI), and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using artificial neural network-cloud classification system (PERSIANN-CCS) (similar to 30% gain in CC, similar to 20% gain in RMSE, and similar to 25% gain in CSI); and 3) compared with the international IR-based baseline precipitation product, i.e., PERSIANN-CCS, FY4AQPE-MSA demonstrates no spatial gaps over the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the results of this study suggest that the proposed general framework is promising and applicable for Chinese FY-4 series satellites in generating all-day near-real-time rain-rate information.

TI  - Robust Multisensor Prediction of Drought-Induced Yield Anomalies of Soybeans in Argentina
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - A multisensor method for the prediction of drought-induced agricultural impact is put forth in this letter. The input data considered include MODIS NDVI and land surface temperature (LST), ESA-CCI Soil Moisture, and CHIRPS rain data, which are processed at the department level in a large and sparsely monitored cropland in Argentina. As ground truth, we have used department-scale crop losses estimated by an annual agricultural census. In particular, the period under consideration (2001-2019) includes five severe drought events where soybean production in the area was considerably affected. The proposed method is based on Lasso regression of the corresponding rank values of the satellite data to the relative yield anomalies. Importantly, the proposed methodology is robust to extreme drought events. In addition, an associated early warning classification method results in an overall accuracy no worse than 70% up to one month before the harvest, and 62% two months before the harvest. The proposed methodology offers a valuable method for the prediction of agricultural drought impact and should be especially valuable in sparsely monitored regions of the world.

TI  - Ethics in Muslim Writing and Research Methodology: The Case Ibn Khaldun's Scholarly Writing
T2  - JOURNAL OF AL-TAMADDUN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the concept and practice of scholarly writing among Muslim scholars, with a special reference to 'Abdul Rahman Ibn Khaldun (d.1406). The research draws on a textual analysis of Ibn Khaldun's Muqaddimah and other early Muslim works regarding the craft of writing while addressing the broader, wider context of writing ethicality and its influence on social consciousness. This study discusses the worldview and ethics of writing, concepts, and terminologies, sources and objectives, investigation, and styles of presentation according. This research demonstrates that Ibn Khaldun's writing methodology and style continue to stand as a prime example for scholarship in the social sciences and that his spiritual beliefs and value system served to further enhance the originality and rigor of his writing and conceptual schemes. Further research across a larger body of Muslim literature will bring about interesting insights on the relationship between spirituality and research writing, as well as the historical contribution of Muslim authors to the advancement of universal knowledge.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Despite the current short temporal coverage of high spatial resolution SM maps estimated from Synthetic Aperture Radars such as Sentinel-1 (S1), their evaluation is important in the context of the ESA CCI as potential future high resolution (HR) SM long time series, and also as benchmarking references for HR SM data sets that could be obtained by downscaling coarser resolution sensors. In this context, 1 km HR SM maps obtained making a synergistic use of S1 and Sentinel 2 (or Sentinel 3) using the (SMP)-M-2 algorithm were compared to the HR SM data sets from the Copernicus Global Land Service produced from S1 data over three regions in Europe and one in Tunisia. In addition, the (SMP)-M-2 maps were also compared to the SMAP+S1 downscaled product in those regions and in two additional ones in North America and Australia. The HR SM maps show an overall good agreement for croplands and herbaceous land covers while showing significant differences for other land cover classes. All the 1 km SM maps data sets, in addition to coarse scale SMAP, SMOS and CCI data, were evaluated against in-situ measurements. The results show that the HR products are in good agreement but they show a lower correlation with respect to in-situ data than the coarse resolution products.

TI  - Toward the Removal of Model Dependency in Soil Moisture Climate Data Records by Using an <i>L</i>-Band Scaling Reference
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building climate data records of soil moisture (SM) requires computing long time series by merging retrievals from sensors on-board different satellites, which implies to perform a bias correction or resealing on the original time series. Due to their long time span and high temporal frequency, model data could be used as a common reference for the resealing. However, avoiding model dependence in observational climate data records is needed for some applications. In this article, the possibility of using as reference remote sensing data from one of the L-band sensors specifically designed to measure SM is discussed. Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 SM time series were resealed by matching their cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) to those of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) NOAH model time series. The CDF computation was investigated as a function of the time series length, finding significant differences from four to nine years. Replacing temporal by spatial variance does not allow us to compute better CDFs from short time series. The resealed time series show a high correlation (R > 0.8) to the original ones and a low bias with respect to the reference (<0.03 m(3). m(-3)). The time series resealed using several SMOS or SMAP datasets were also evaluated against in situ measurements and show performances similar to or slightly better than those resealed using the model GLDAS. The impact of random errors and gaps of the observational data into the resealing was evaluated. These results show that it is actually possible to use L-band data as reference to rescale time series from other sensors to build long time series of SM.

AB  - Originating from the fields of philosophy and history, the term historicism is often used by architectural historians. Aiming to contribute to the theoretical framework for the analysis of architectural historicism, the paper first explores the meaning of the concept in its native field of philosophy of history. The paper is aligned with the recent scholarship which interprets historicism as a worldview and deduces three historicist principles - principles of holism, individuality, and development. This paper argues that an historicist outlook marked wider creative achievements of an epoch, and that architecture of the period approximately ranging from the 1750s to the 1950s did not evade its influence. Finally, the paper illustrates the three principles in the idea of building for the age which haunted architects of the Western civilisation for almost two centuries.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: In view of the importance of Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) in agricultural management, a study was conducted to develop a digital SOC map using remotely sensed spectral indices. The present study was conducted on the Tawdeehiya Farms, located in the central region of Saudi Arabia between Al-Kharj and Haradh cities.Methodology: Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2A) satellite images were used for the characterization of SOC stocks in the topsoil layer (0-10 cm) of the experimental fields. Soil samples were randomly collected from six (50 ha each) agricultural fields and analyzed in the laboratory for SOC (SOCA) following Walkley and Black method. While, vegetation indices (VI), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), NDVIRedEdge, Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Bare Soil Index (BSI), and Reduced Simple Ratio (RSR) were computed and subsequently used for the development of SOC prediction models.Results: Univariate linear regression technique was employed for the recognition of a suitable band/VI for SOC (SOCP) mapping. The SWIR-1 band of both L8 (R-2 = 0.86) and S2A (R2 = 0.77) data was promising for predicting SOC with 16% (S2A) and 18% (L8) of BIAS.Interpretation: The NDVI and BSI (for L8 data) and BSI and RSR (for S2A data) were found most suitable VI in the prediction of SOC. The R-2 values of linear regression models were 0.68 (BSI) and 0.78 (RSR), indicating that nearly 68% and 78% of the SOC could be predicted through L8 and S2A datasets, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land-use and land-cover (LULC) are important environmental properties of the Earth's surface. Satellite platforms and state-of-the-art algorithms enable the mapping of large areas, but they still need to be improved. This study aimed to compare free- and open-access images from radar and optical sensors, using the Google Earth Engine (TM) (GEE) for supervised classification of LULC for five municipalities in Roraima State, Brazil. Sentinel-1 (S1) scenes were used along with Landsat 8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) ones, resulting in five classification approaches S1 (SD), L8 (ODL), S2 (ODS), S1+L8 (SODL), and S1+S2 (SODS), with an auxiliary ALOS World 3D dataset (DEM approximate to 30m). Accuracy was assessed by an error matrix. The SD approach was significantly different (P <= 0.01) from the others using a mean F1-score of 0.80. ODL and ODS had barely perceptible differences (P <= 0.1), showing F1-scores of 0.95 and 0.92, respectively. When comparing ODL (F1=0.95) and SODL (F1=0.95) no difference was found (P > 0.1). However, by comparing ODS (F1=0.92) and SODS (F1=0.94), there was a significant classification improvement (P <= 0.05). In short, the approaches SODL and SODS had the best pixel-based supervised classification performance.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Laser Radar Technology and Applications XXVII
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - The Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), on-orbit for nearly 3 years, continues to provide global elevation measurements to the broad science community. One of the most transformative discoveries during early mission operations was the realization that ICESat-2 could provide bathymetry in addition to the planned surface-specific data products for land ice, sea ice, ocean and land/vegetation. This is an important capability for coastal science, maritime intelligence and shallow water benthic monitoring at the global scale. ICESat-2 elevations are also becoming a critical component of satellite-derived bathymetry where multispectral imagery uses the measurements to create broad spatial maps with absolute vertical bathymetric depths. This article will highlight some of the most salient bathymetric observations and quantitative analyses of this space-based photon counting lidar that includes sea floor elevation retrievals but also environmental characterization such as wave structure and turbidity and monitoring of benthic habitats.

TI  - Non-Negative Minimum Volume Factorization (NMVF) for Hyperspectral Images (HSI) Unmixing: A Hybrid Approach
T2  - CMC-COMPUTERS MATERIALS & CONTINUA
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral unmixing is essential for exploitation of remotely sensed data of Hyperspectral Images (HSI). It amounts to the identification of a position of spectral signatures that are pure and therefore called end members and their matching fractional, draft rules abundances for every pixel in HSI. This paper aims to unmix hyperspectral data using the minimal volume method of elementary scrutiny. Moreover, the problem of optimization is solved by the implementation of the sequence of small problems that are constrained quadratically. The hard constraint in the final step for the abundance fraction is then replaced with a loss function of hinge type that accounts for outliners and noise. Existing algorithms focus on estimating the endmembers (Ems) enumeration in a sight, discerning of spectral signs of EMs, besides assessment of fractional profusion for every EM in every pixel of a sight. Nevertheless, all the stages are performed by only a few algorithms in the process of hyperspectral unmixing. Therefore, the Non-negative Minimum Volume Factorization (NMVF) algorithm is further extended by fusing it with the nonnegative matrix of robust collaborative factorization that aims to perform all the three unmixing chain steps for hyperspectral images. The major contributions of this article are in this manner: (A) it performs Simplex analysis of minimum volume for hyperspectral images with unsupervised linear unmixing is employed. (B) The simplex analysis method is configured with an exaggerated form of the elementary which is delivered by vertical component analysis (VCA). (C) The inflating factor is chosen carefully inactivating the constraints in a large majority for relating to the source fractions abundance that speeds up the algorithm. (D) The final step is making simplex analysismethod robust to outliners as well as noise that replaces the profusion element positivity hard restraint by a hinge kind soft restraint, preserving the local minima having good quality. (E) The matrix factorization method is applied that is capable of performing the three major phases of the hyperspectral separation sequence. The anticipated approach can find application in a scenario where the end members are known in advance, however, it assumes that the endmembers count is corresponding to an overestimated value. The proposed method is different from other conventionalmethods as it begins with the overestimation of the count of endmembers wherein removing the endmembers that are redundant by the means of collaborative regularization. As demonstrated by the experimental results, proposed approach yields competitive performance comparable with widely used methods.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT OF URBANIZATION GROWTH ON THE CLIMATE OF BAGHDAD PROVINCE USING REMOTE SENSING TECHNIQUES.
T2  - IRAQI JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was aimed to recognize the spatial and temporal features of urban development and its impact on the climate of Baghdad City. The analytical method of the study relies on changes in Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Land Surface Temperature(LST); GIS technology was used to measure these statistics. Landsat (5,8) and Sentinel2A imagery were used to detect the change of urbanization growth, vegetation change, and land surface temperature during the study period from 2001 to 2020, whereas used the supervised classification technique for determination for LULC variations. The results showed significant changes among the LULC classes in the studied periods, as most of the LULC changes were caused by human activities. The most prominent changes in LULC were the urban expansion on agricultural land, continuously in all years, which led to the decline of vegetation resulting from land degradation. The Building area increased from around 863 km2 in 2001 to 1469 km2 in 2020 concentrated mainly in the center, the northeastern and southeastern part of the city. Moderate plants decrease from around 88.5 km2 in 2001 to 59 km2 in 2020 and dense plants decreased from 0.0252 km2 in 2001 to 0.0135 km2 in 2020. This has led to negative effects on the climate where temperature rates increased from (26-47) degrees Celsius in 2001 to (32-56) degrees Celsius in the last year of the study, the highest temperatures were recorded in urban growth areas and areas without vegetation.

TI  - An Efficient Classification of Hyperspectral Remotely Sensed Data Using Support Vector Machine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work present an efficient hardware architecture of Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the classification of Hyperspectral remotely sensed data using High Level Synthesis (HLS) method. The high classification time and power consumption in traditional classification of remotely sensed data is the main motivation for this work. Therefore presented work helps to classify the remotely sensed data in real-time and to take immediate action during the natural disaster. An embedded based SVM is designed and implemented on Zynq SoC for classification of hyperspectral images. The data set of remotely sensed data are tested on different platforms and the performance is compared with existing works. Novelty in our proposed work is extend the HLS based FPGA implantation to the onboard classification system in remote sensing. The experimental results for selected data set from different class shows that our architecture on Zynq 7000 implementation generates a delay of 11.26 mu s and power consumption of 1.7 Watts, which is extremely better as compared to other Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation using Hardware description Language (HDL) and Central Processing Unit (CPU) implementation.

TI  - Linguistic Relativism and the Expression of Basic Theoretical Rationality in Inuktitut
T2  - ETUDES INUIT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper begins by stressing the importance of distinguishing between linguistic relativity, whose reality is hardly debatable, and linguistic relativism, which ultimately holds that language communities are locked within their own worldview, hence their own notions of truth. It then rejects linguistic relativism by asserting the existence of a universal core of theoretical rationality comprised at the very least of the logical principles of identity, noncontradiction, and excluded middle. It goes on to show how this theoretical rationality manifests itself in the lexicon of a language that differs greatly from English: Inuktitut spoken by Inuit of Nunavik (Arctic Quebec). The definitions provided by Taamusi Qumaq for three words relating to critical thought are translated for the first time. Other quotes give examples of theoretical rationality in actual usage. Finally, the paper asks why logic as such is accorded little value in the culture Inuktitut expresses. The suggested answer follows Jack Goody, who holds that a long written tradition is required for the rules of formal logic to take hold in language practices. Writing is not just a transcription of the spoken word; it is an intellectual technology that impacts the way speakers use their language.

TI  - Watershed-Based Attribute Profiles With Semantic Prior Knowledge for Remote Sensing Image Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we develop a novel feature extraction method that combines two well-established mathematical morphology concepts: watersheds and morphological attribute profiles (APs). In order to extract spatial-spectral features from remote sensing data, APs were originally defined as sequences of filtering operators on inclusion trees, i.e., the max- and min-trees, computed from the input image. In this study, we extend the AP paradigm to the more general framework of hierarchical watersheds. Moreover, we explore the semantic knowledge provided by labeled training pixels during different phases of the watershed-AP construction, namely within the construction of hierarchical watersheds from the raw image and later within the filtering of the resulting hierarchy. We illustrate the relevance of the proposed method with two applications including land cover classification and building extraction using optical remote sensing images. Experimental results show that the new profiles outperform various existing features using two public datasets (Zurich and Vaihingen), thus providing another high potential feature extraction method within the AP family.

TI  - Challenges of defining the floodplain through the "mean ordinary flood line" approach using remote sensing in Brazil: a case study of the Sao Francisco River
T2  - RBRH-REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE RECURSOS HIDRICOS
M3  - Article
AB  - The "Mean Ordinary Flood Line" (MOFL) is a conceptual line adopted by Brazil's Federal Government to delineate land within the floodplain under its ownership and jurisdiction having major social implications. Past attempts at the cartography of this line have encountered strong difficulties brought either by a low precision or an excessive cost. In this article, we propose a method based on historical water gauge data to determine the water level corresponding to the MOFL. Satellite images coincident with past dates when the MOFL. was reached are selected and processed to extract the water surface from which the MOFL. can then be produced. The approach was implemented in a 600 km reach of the Sao Francisco River in Minas Gerais as a pilot project. A field survey served to validate the results. The positional accuracy of the MOFL was estimated at 24 m which was considered excellent since mostly Landsat images with a spatial resolution of 30 m were used.

T2  - SLOVENSKY NARODOPIS-SLOVAK ETHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-religious identity, just like religious identity, is a matter of long evolution over time that often crosses multiple generations. Many papers have shown that young adulthood seems to be the key period of life when the personality is formed and often reaffirms its religious and worldview identity as well. I attempted to outline how this process can be extrapolated from the Census 2021 data, the ISSP Religion 2018 and 2008 surveys, as well as interviews with several young people to reveal the background of this transformation. The most significant evidence we see in the national census data is that the age of early adulthood is notable for the sudden growth of non-religious people (nones) and a decrease of Roman Catholics. Such a transformation seems to be crucial in terms of the background identities of nones in contemporary Slovakia, where a slight majority of nones were raised in any of the denominations. Although such transformations are only small, they seem to be essential and deserving of attention in the process of general changes in the religious landscape of a secularising Slovakia.

TI  - LOSSY COMPRESSION OF THREE-CHANNEL REMOTE SENSING IMAGES WITH "COLOR" COMPONENT DOWNSCALING

AB  - Multichannel systems of remote sensing provide a huge amount of data useful for different applications. However, such images occupy a large space that poses problems of processing, storage, transmission, and management. Lossy compression is widely used to decrease the size of data. In lossy compression, one has to provide a reasonable trade-off between compression ratio (CR) and introduced losses or quality of compressed data. Quality can be characterized in various ways including traditional criteria as peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) or some others as well as criteria that describe efficiency of solving the final tasks of remote sensing as, e.g., probability of correct classification. In this paper, we concentrate on classification of three-channel images that can be either color images or three components of multi- or hyperspectral data acquired, e.g., by Sentinel-2 sensor. In lossy compression of color images, downscaling of color components is often applied to increase CR without essential loss of quality. The goal of this paper is to study the influence of such downscaling on classification accuracy for three-channel remote sensing data. The compression method based on atomic functions is considered since this method allows easy control of compressed image quality and its providing. The neural networks trained for distorted-free images are applied for image classification. Analysis is carried out for four images of different complexity. Based on it, practical recommendations are given.

TI  - Discrete Atomic Transform-Based Lossy Compression of Three-Channel Remote Sensing Images with Quality Control
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lossy compression of remote sensing data has found numerous applications. Several requirements are usually imposed on methods and algorithms to be used. A large compression ratio has to be provided, introduced distortions should not lead to sufficient reduction of classification accuracy, compression has to be realized quickly enough, etc. An additional requirement could be to provide privacy of compressed data. In this paper, we show that these requirements can be easily and effectively realized by compression based on discrete atomic transform (DAT). Three-channel remote sensing (RS) images that are part of multispectral data are used as examples. It is demonstrated that the quality of images compressed by DAT can be varied and controlled by setting maximal absolute deviation. This parameter also strictly relates to more traditional metrics as root mean square error (RMSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) that can be controlled. It is also shown that there are several variants of DAT having different depths. Their performances are compared from different viewpoints, and the recommendations of transform depth are given. Effects of lossy compression on three-channel image classification using the maximum likelihood (ML) approach are studied. It is shown that the total probability of correct classification remains almost the same for a wide range of distortions introduced by lossy compression, although some variations of correct classification probabilities take place for particular classes depending on peculiarities of feature distributions. Experiments are carried out for multispectral Sentinel images of different complexities.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - In Tunisian agriculture, olive tree cultivation plays an important role. It is affected by different stresses that jeopardize its sustainability. In this context, our objective is to enhance the resilience of this crop. To achieve this goal, our work consists of detecting anomalies at early stage starting from the tree to the field scale. The proposed solution takes advantage of the emergence of satellites with high spatial and temporal resolution. In particular, the Sentinel-2 sensor which is well-adapted to monitor the vegetation. It is characterized by ten spectral bands allowing to access to key vegetation properties such as leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content (Cab) and water content (Cw), etc. Direct estimation of these parameters for the image is not practical as the signal is convolved. For that, we use artificial intelligence techniques to separate the effects of the different properties. We develop an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that learn to estimate the vegetation properties given the pixel signature. The learning is done using a database of simulated data produced by a radiative transfer model that simulates the satellite image given the vegetation cover properties. The stress detection is based on a threshold on tree LAI and Cab. Comparison with ground truth with healthy and stressed plots has shown the validity of our approach.

T2  - HYDROLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although rice is a major agricultural product in northeast Thailand, its productivity is low and unstable because rice is cultivated under rainfed conditions and there are issues with soil salinization. In this region, some of the paddy fields have been abandoned because of severe soil salinization. Therefore, effective agricultural management strategies are needed to manage soil salinization for achieving stable agricultural production. To realize effective management strategies, it is necessary to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of soil salinization. To evaluate and update the spatiotemporal soil salinization using remote sensing data, we first evaluate the relationship between soil electrical conductivity (ECe) and soil moisture content (SMC) during thy seasons. Subsequently, the effect of changes in this relationship on the normalized difference salinity index (NDSI) derived from remote sensing data for estimating soil ECe is evaluated. The relationship between ECe and NDSI, depending on the soil moisture conditions in the study area, is clarified. The findings of this study indicate that for estimating ECe using the NDSI, it is necessary to consider not only soil moisture conditions but also its quality at the time of satellite observation.

TI  - AMSR2 Thin Ice Detection Algorithm for the Arctic Winter Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We have developed a thin ice detection algorithm for the AMSR2 radiometer data. The algorithm, denoted as AMSR2 thin ice detection algorithm-version 2 (ATIDA2), is targeted for the Arctic Ocean. The detection of thin ice with a maximum thickness of 20 cm is based on the classification of the 36-GHz polarization ratio (PR36) and H-polarization 89-36-GHz gradient ratio (GR8936H) signatures with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and thick ice restoration with GR3610H. The thick ice restoration removes erroneous thin ice detections due to thin and thick ice PR36 and GR8936H signature mixing. ATIDA2 is applied only when sea ice concentration (SIC) is >= 70% and the air temperature is <=-5 degrees C to decrease misclassification of thick ice as thin ice. For the AMSR2 L1R brightness temperature data, an atmospheric correction is applied following an EUMETSAT OSI SAF correction scheme in SIC retrieval algorithms. ATIDA2 is applied to L1R swath datasets, and then, the results are combined to a daily thin ice chart. ATIDA2 was developed and validated using MODIS ice thickness charts over the Barents and Kara Seas. The average probability for misclassification of thick ice as thin ice in the daily chart is 8.7%, and 37.0% for vice versa. The comparison of the ATIDA2 chart and the SMOS ice thickness chart over the Arctic showed rough correspondence in the thin versus thick ice classification. The ATIDA2 chart is targeted to be used together with SAR imagery for various sea ice classifications.

M3  - Article
AB  - The location of a significant part of the agricultural territories of Kazakhstan in the risk agriculture zone implies the development and further application of an objective monitoring system for irrigated territories. The purpose of the study was to develop methods for on-the-spot and long-term recognition of irrigated massifs and verifica-tion of methods in the conditions of the territories of southern Kazakhstan. The paper describes the methods of on-the-spot recognition of irrigated fields, the general assessment of irrigated areas for the growing season, as well as the method of recognizing promising areas for irrigation. The on-the-spot recognition of the fields is based on the use of such spectral indices as the Global Vegetation Moisture Index, Green Normalized Difference Veg-etation Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and the xanthophyll index, combined into a single system by the Decision Tree algorithm. The assessment of irrigated areas is based on differences in the physiological state of plants in conditions of normal water supply and plants experiencing a lack of moisture. The evaluation system includes the calculation of the temperature difference according to the corresponding satellite data and the calculation of the difference in vegetation indices for the same period. The difference in vegetation indices in irrigated fields has positive values due to a steady increase in green biomass, and the temperature difference, on the contrary, is negative or zero, since healthy plants, with normal water supply, actively evaporate mois-ture to maintain optimal temperatures of biochemical processes. To develop these methods, ground data from 2017-2021 were used. Verification of the methods with ground data demonstrated acceptable accuracy (87% in the on-the-spot assessment of irrigated fields; 60-90% in the general assessment of irrigated areas), while the methods have significant potential for further improvement.

TI  - Identification of karstic zones using RS & GIS method, Fuzzy logic and AHP in Neka catchment, Mazandaran, Iran
T2  - ACTA MONTANISTICA SLOVACA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study focuses on identifying zones and karstic phenomena using the RS & GIS method along with Fuzzy logic integration and the Hierarchical Analysis Process (AHP) in part of Neka catchment in Mazandaran province in the north of Iran. In this research, eight lithological factors, density and distance from the fractured lineaments, density and distance from the drainages, topographic slope, precipitation and vegetation status, were extracted from satellite and archival data as well as field data. Then these factors which affect karst formation and development are fuzzy and are weighted by the AHP method and integrated with T-norm, T-conorm (S-norm) and Compromise Operators. The results were processed by using software such as ArcGIS, ENVI, RockWorks, IDRISI, Expert Choice and PCI Geomatica, which were evaluated based on fieldwork. The results of this study show that most karst developments occurred in Lar Formation with the upper Jurassic. According to field visits, the best and most appropriate output for fuzzy layers integration are the use of a compromise operator in the range of 0.9 to 0.95. In spite of the suitable ability of Landsat 8 bands to extract lineaments due to vegetation status and other environmental conditions, the use of DEM was also necessary. This study shows that the use of new remote sensing and GIS technology, combined with Fuzzy logic and AHP, increases accuracy and speed and reduces cost in karst studies.

T2  - BOLETIM DE CIENCIAS GEODESICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study makes contributions toward development of accurate DEM from ground and satellite data over South Africa. This is achieved by preparing recent satellite-based DEMs (AW3D30, SRTM, ASTER, TanDEM-X, and MERIT), assessing their vertical accuracy, selecting candidate DEMs, modelling errors for the candidate DEMs and fusing candidate DEMs. Following removal of outliers from each DEM, a different number of ground levelling data are used in the assessment of the DEMs (AW3D30 - 26,364 points, SRTM - 25,727, ASTER - 23,773, TanDEM-X - 25,964 and MERIT - 24,485). The standard deviations of the differences between ground levelling and DEMs heights are +/- 5.09, +/- 7.03, +/- 9.20, +/- 4.99 and +/- 8.36 m for AW3D30, SRTM, ASTER, TanDEM-X and MERIT, respectively. AW3D30 and TanDEM-X are therefore selected for fusion. The two candidate DEMs are improved by applying a combination of linear regression, multiple regression, and adaptive terrain-dependent methods using 17,307 model data points. A fused DEM is developed from improved candidate DEMs using a combination of different fusion methods and assessed using 8,657 data points (distinct from the model points). The standard deviation of the height differences between ground levelling and the fused DEM is +/- 4.290 m, and it is more accurate than all satellite based DEMs considered in this study.

TI  - DECADAL CHANGES OF OASES IN THE KASHGAR REGION FROM 1975-2015
T2  - FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Oasis in arid and semiarid lands is vulnerable to climatic changes and human activities. Spatial analyses with remote sensing and GIS (geographical information system) technology provide very useful tools to monitor its long-term dynamic change. In this study, the spatio-temporal changes of the oases in the Kashgar region have been analyzed by integrating remote sensing data (5 periods of Landsat images of 1975, 1985. 1995, 2005. and 2015), socioeconomic data, meteorological data, and hydrological data. The results show that oases in the Kashgar region have gradually changed over the past 40 years. The artificial oases area increased from 10432 km2 in 1975 to 23334 km2 in 2015, while the natural oases area decreased from 17270 km' in 1975 to 5270 km2 in 2015. Although the increased precipitation and temperature would contribute expansion of natural oases owing to the vegetation growth, the increasing human-induced land reclamation, and water consumption may cause the large-scale expansion of artificial oases. During the period between 1975 and 2015, the cultivated land area increased by 5450 km2, meanwhile, the population increased from 2.05 million to 4.5 million. Therefore. the increase of artificial oases area from 1975 to 2015 probably arose due to the large-scale land reclamation, rapid population growth. and increasing water consumption. This study will enhance our understanding of the driving mechanism of the oases dynamic changes under the influence of human activities and climatic changes.

TI  - CHANGES IN FORESTED AREAS OF THE NORTH-EASTERN REGION OF AZERBAIJAN REVEALED BY SATELLITE IMAGES
T2  - LESNOY ZHURNAL-FORESTRY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the most valuable natural resources of any country are its forest reserves. They need to be preserved. The need for forest protection also exists in Azerbaijan where there is less forest per inhabitant than in neighboring countries. The use of modern data acquisition and processing methods as well as geographical information system technologies has reduced research in this area to a set of standard procedures. The article describes the stages of processing satellite images available in the public domain using the case study of the north-eastern region of Azerbaijan in order to compile forest cover maps over a number of different years. The Landsat images obtained during the summer seasons in different years from 1987 to 2018 are studied. The images covered the territory' of 5 neighboring districts in the north-east of Azerbaijan. Preliminary processing of the images included radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction and was carried out using the ENVI software and the FLAASH module. The article also shows the final processing of images using the ArcGIS program in order to determine the areas covered by forests in different years. The analysis was based on the calculation of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The index was calculated for all considered satellite images. Then sections of images with high NDVI values were highlighted, vectorized, and the areas of the resulting polygons were found. Thus, a separate thematic layer is created for each year, showing the area of forest cover that year. i.e. 3 layers in total. The data obtained were summarized in a table, from which a diagram showing the dynamics of the forest area in the region was created. The data also became the basis for a thematic electronic map of forest loss. The continuation of this process has been described.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Forest fire burnt area estimation using Normalized Burn Ratio at regional level helps in understanding the pattern of the frequency and severity of forest fires. In this study, burnt area is estimated for all the thirteen districts of Indian state Uttarakhand for last six years from 2016 to 2021 using Sentinel 2A and 2B datasets. The spatial and temporal pattern of the burnt area was analyzed by incorporating different parameters such as meteorological parameters like land surface temperature, rainfall; edaphic parameter like surface soil moisture and vegetation parameters like Normalized Difference Vegetation Index & Enhanced Vegetation Index. The estimated burnt area was statistically analyzed with respect to the parameters stated and the relationship among them was quantified. It was found that burnt area is positively correlated with the land surface temperature, while it showed negative correlation with the pre-fire precipitation, pre-fire NDVI & EVI and the surface soil moisture for 11 out of 13 districts. The district-wise forest fire burnt area assessment and analysis of its spatio-temporal pattern can be used in the preparedness and mitigation planning to prevent drastic ecological impacts of forest fires on the landscape.

TI  - Assessing Vegetation Decline Due to Pollution from Solid Waste Management by a Multitemporal Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Nowadays, the huge production of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) is one of the most strongly felt environmental issues. Consequently, the European Union (EU) delivers laws and regulations for better waste management, identifying the essential requirements for waste disposal operations and the characteristics that make waste hazardous to human health and the environment. In Italy, environmental regulations define, among other things, the characteristics of sites to be classified as "potentially contaminated". From this perspective, the Basilicata region is currently one of the Italian regions with the highest number of potentially polluted sites in proportion to the number of inhabitants. This research aimed to identify the possible effects of potentially toxic element (PTE) pollution due to waste disposal activities in three "potentially contaminated" sites in southern Italy. The area was affected by a release of inorganic pollutants with values over the thresholds ruled by national/European legislation. Potential physiological efficiency variations of vegetation were analyzed through the multitemporal processing of satellite images. Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to calculate the trend in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the years. The multitemporal trends were analyzed using the median of the non-parametric Theil-Sen estimator. Finally, the Mann-Kendall test was applied to evaluate trend significance featuring areas according to the contamination effects on investigated vegetation. The applied procedure led to the exclusion of significant effects on vegetation due to PTEs. Thus, waste disposal activities during previous years do not seem to have significantly affected vegetation around targeted sites.

TI  - ROMA: A Database of Rock Reflectance Spectra for Martian In Situ Exploration
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The ROMA database (ROck reflectance for MArtian in situ exploration, https://roma.univ-lyonl fr) provides the reflectance spectra between 0.4 and 3-4 mu m of various terrestrial, Martian, and synthetic samples, as a means to document reference measurements for comparison with data acquired by visible and near-infrared spectrometers on planetary surfaces, with a focus on current and future Martian observations by the Perseverance (Mars 2020 mission) and Rosalind Franklin (ExoMars) rovers. The main specificity of this database is to include a significant fraction of spectra of unprocessed rock, which are more realistic analogs and often have different spectral features than the fine powders more commonly analyzed in reflectance spectroscopy. Additionally, these measurements were acquired with a spectrometer whose spot size is similar to those of the SuperCam instrument (Mars 2020 mission) at a few meters from a target. Supplementary information are provided in the ROMA database: higher-level data (such as absorption band parameters) as well as sample mineralogy estimated by whole-rock X-ray diffraction analyses. Future comparisons with this database will help improve the interpretation of spectral measurements acquired on the Martian surface. This work introduces the aim of the library and its current state, but additional data on intact natural rock surfaces will likely be added in the future.

TI  - A New Approach for the Estimation of Lake Ice Thickness From Conventional Radar Altimetry
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake ice thickness (LIT), a thematic product of lakes as an essential climate variable (ECV), is sensitive to changes in air temperature and on-ice snow mass. Here, a novel and efficient analytic method (retracking approach) is presented for the estimation of LIT from Ku-band (13.6 GHz) radar altimetry data. The new retracker, referred to as LRM_LIT, is based on the physical modeling of the conventional radar echoes (also called low-resolution mode or LRM) over ice-covered lakes that show a characteristic step-like feature in their leading edge attributed to the reflection of radar waves at the snow-ice and ice-water interfaces. The method is applied to Jason-2 and Jason-3 data acquired over Great Slave Lake, Canada, over three ice seasons (2013-2016). As expected, the agreement between the Jason-2 and Jason-3 LIT estimates over their overlapping period (2016 ice season) is excellent with a mean bias error of 0.013 m and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.024 m. LIT estimates from LRM_LIT are in good agreement with simulations from a thermodynamic lake ice model and in situ measurements with RMSE values of the order of a few centimeters for the three winter seasons. The retracker also provides a robust way to assess the accuracy of LIT estimates which is in the order of 0.10 m when the ice cover is well established and prior to melt onset. In addition, LRM_LIT captures the seasonal transitions during the freeze-up and breakup periods and ice growth over different winter seasons, making it a promising method for monitoring inter-annual variability and trends in LIT from past and current conventional radar altimetry missions.

AB  - Monitoring land cover classification and change detection based on remote sensing images using a machine learning algorithm has become one of the important factors. For our case study, we select Vientiane capital as the study area. Our proposed method aims to perform the land cover classification using random forest algorithm supervised classification in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and post classification comparison (PCC) of change detection using Arc GIS software between 1990 and 2020 with 5 years interval periods are evaluated. In this paper, we utilize GEE combining with multiple sources of satellite optical images time-series from three main satellites, Landsat 5, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2 integrating with multiple spectral, spatial, temporal, and textural features. Spectral indices such as NDVI and NDBI are calculated to enhance the accurate performance. Our results show that all six classes are obtained highly accurate land cover classification, with overall accuracy over 97.73% for training data and 90.35% for testing data, and kappa statistic of 0.97 for training data and 0.87 for testing data in 2020.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Change Detection in the Bhavani Basin of India through Remote Sensing Approach
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Using remote sensing data to detect changes in land use and land cover (LULC) is a valuable source of information for various decision support systems. Land use and land cover identification data was used to analyse land conservation, sustainable development, and water resource management. This research aims to determine how the Bhavani basin land use and land cover have changed over the period of time. Land cover changes were detected using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) 30 m resolution images in the GIS environment and with image processing techniques for the four years 1999, 2007, 2014, and 2020. The differences in the landuse and land cover classes are described using ERDAS imagine version 2015 and ARC GIS software. The four land cover classes viz. water body, built-up land, barren land, and vegetation were used to classify the region. The accuracy evaluation was assessed separately using the kappa coefficient after carefully examining the image pre-processing and classification. The overall accuracy in the basin was found to be 83.23%, 86.45%, 85.83%, and 88.75 % with a kappa coefficient of 0.79, 0.81, 0.87, 0.85 for the years 1999, 2007, 2014, and 2020 respectively. The Bhavani basin is mostly covered by barren and vegetation. According to the findings, the basin's built-up area has risen by 1.5 percentage to 3.5 percentage in the last 20 years. The increase in the vegetation area and reduction in the barren area may lead to low soil erosion.

AB  - Cyanobacterial Harmful Algal Blooms (CyanoHABs) are progressively becoming a major water quality, socioeconomic, and health hazard worldwide. In India, there are frequent episodes of severe CyanoHABs, which are left untreated due to a lack of awareness and monitoring infrastructure, affecting the economy of the country gravely. In this study, for the first time, we present a country-wide analysis of CyanoHABs in India by developing a novel interactive cloud-based dashboard called "CyanoKhoj" in Google Earth Engine (GEE) which uses Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) remotely sensed datasets. The main goal of this study was to showcase the utility of CyanoKhoj for rapid monitoring and discuss the widespread CyanoHABs problems across India. We demonstrate the utility of Cyanokhoj by including select case studies of lakes and reservoirs geographically spread across five states: Bargi and Gandhisagar Dams in Madhya Pradesh, Hirakud Reservoir in Odisha, Ukai Dam in Gujarat, Linganamakki Reservoir in Karnataka, and Pulicat Lake in Tamil Nadu. These sites were studied from September to November 2018 using CyanoKhoj, which is capable of near-real-time monitoring and country-wide assessment of CyanoHABs. We used CyanoKhoj to prepare spatiotemporal maps of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) content and Cyanobacterial Cell Density (CCD) to study the local spread of the CyanoHABs and their phenology in these waterbodies. A first-ever all-India CCD map is also presented for the year 2018, which highlights the spatial spread of CyanoHABs throughout the country (32 large waterbodies across India with severe bloom: CCD>2,500,000). Results indicate that CyanoHABs are most prevalent in nutrient-rich waterbodies prone to industrial and other nutrient-rich discharges. A clear temporal evolution of the blooms showed that they are dominant during the post-monsoon season (September-October) when the nutrient concentrations in the waterbodies are at their peak, and they begin to decline towards winter (NovemberDecember). CyanoKhoj is an open-source tool that can have a significant broader impact in mapping CyanoHABs not only throughout cyanobacteria data-scarce India, but on a global level using archived and future Sentinel3A/B OLCI data.

TI  - Nonlocal Multiscale Single Image Statistics From Sentinel-1 SAR Data for High Resolution Bitemporal Forest Wind Damage Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is a challenge for high-resolution applications. This study presents a new nonlocal averaging approach (STAl'SAR) to reduce the speckle of single Sentinel-1 SAR images and statistical parameters derived from the image. The similarity of SAR pixels is based on the statistics of 3 x 3 window as represented by the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum. K-means clustering is used to divide the SAR image in 30 similarity clusters. The nonlocal averaging is carried out within each cluster separately in magnitude order of the 3 x 3 window averages. The nonlocal filtering is applicable not only to the original pixel backscattering values but also to statistical parameters, such as standard deviation. The statistical parameters to be filtered can represent any window size, according to the need of the application. The nonlocally averaged standard deviation derived in two spatial resolutions, 3 x 3 and 7 x 7 windows, are demonstrated here for improving the resolution in which the forest damages can be detected using the VH polarized backscattering spatial variation change.

AB  - Currently, around half of the world's population lives in urban areas, which is only expected to increase in the future. The urban water resources took the brunt of this uncontrolled urbanization and expansion resulting in a swift decline in lakes and ponds in the cities. Bengaluru is one of the most prominent cities in India where the urban water body areas have fallen drastically over the years. This study attempts to assess the impact of urban growth in reducing the surface area of the water bodies in Bengaluru. The study used decadal Land Use Land Cover (LULC) maps between 1988 to 2020 generated from Landsat 4-5 and 8 datasets using the Maximum Likelihood (ML) technique to study and understand urban sprawl in Bengaluru and the changes occurring in water spread area. The results indicate that Bengaluru city has undergone a massive growth from 100 Sq. km to 600 Sq. km between 1988 to 2020. This excessive sprawl has blocked the ephemeral streams that replenish the water bodies, thus causing heavy damage not only to water bodies in the region but also to the vegetation present in the periphery of the expanding city.

TI  - Multimodal Fusion of Sentinel 1 Images and Social Media Data for Snow Depth Estimation
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent developments in remote sensing have shown that snow depth can be estimated accurately on a global scale using satellite images through cross-polarization and copolarization backscatter measurements. This method does, however, have some limitations in low-land areas with dense forest coverage and shallow snow, which are often found nearby urban areas. In these areas, citizen observations can be fused with satellite-based estimations to deliver more accurate solutions. To that end, we use snow-related tweets that have been annotated by artificial intelligence (AI) methods and are introduced in a novel neural network model, aiming to increase the estimation accuracy of the state-of-the-art remote sensing method. The proposed model combines the estimated snow depth from Sentinel 1 images with the number of Twitter posts and Twitter images that are semantically relevant to snow. The use of instant social media data for purposes of snow depth estimation is investigated, validated, and tested in Finland. Our results show that this approach does improve the snow depth estimation, highlighting its potential for use in civil protection agencies in managing snow conditions.

TI  - Saline stress tolerance index and growth analysis of two bean varieties (<i>Phaseolus vulgaris</i> L. and <i>Vigna unguiculata</i> L., Walp.), grown in a saline medium (NaCl) and treated with homeopathic medicines
T2  - TERRA LATINOAMERICANA
M3  - Article
AB  - Saline stress causes a significant reduction in agricultural production worldwide, which is why it is a priority to develop research that contributes to mitigating its negative effects in an eco-friendly way. Therefore, the objective of this work was to evaluate the effect of homeopathic dynamizations of Natrum muriaticum (NaM) on the tolerance index relative to saline stress (ITR) and the gain of plant biomass as growth rate (TC) in the development stage. Initial vegetative stage of common bean plants Phaseolus vulgaris L. variety Quivican (FC-Q) and bean Yorimon Vigna unguiculata L., Walp variety Paceno (FY-P). The experiment was developed under semi-controlled conditions, with a completely randomized design of factorial arrangement of 2A x 2B x 4C [(A: two bean species-variety (Comun-Quivican; Yorimon-Paceno), B: two levels of NaCl (0; 75mM), C: three homeopathic treatments (NaM-7CH; NaM-13CH; NaM-7CH + 13CH) and distilled water as control treatment (AD)], with five replications per treatment. A higher TC was observed in Common-Q beans; All homeopathic treatments applied increased TC with respect to the control AD treatment, the response being greater with NaM-7CH. The ITR increased in both species when they received NaM, being higher in FC-Quivican, surpassing the FY-P in dry biomass of leaves (18%), stems (14%) and roots (12%). This study demonstrated that agricultural homeopathy is a viable, eco-friendly and low-cost alternative to increase the production of common beans-Quivican (P. vulgaris L.) and Yorimon-Paceno beans (V. unguiculata L.) in areas salinized by NaCl.

AB  - Measurement of hydrological variables in rain-fed catchments is crucial for any decision support to mitigate flood risk. This paper describes our efforts in installation of a hydrometric sensor network in the Namal watershed area in Mianwali, Pakistan. Since the valley is formerly ungauged, minimal historic on-site data exists. Our network is composed of two devices, one to measure rainfall and another to measure stream level. For sensor placement and interpolation, past satellite data is used to obtain the spatial covariances of the rainfall process. The sensor nodes are placed so as to maximize the mutual information between gauged and ungauged locations. Kriging is applied to obtain the average spatial estimate for rainfall in the watershed. A level sensor on the dam reports the variation in the reservoir water level whereas another set of level sensors is used to evaluate lag times for flows in a major tributary. Results suggest that the data adequately captures the reservoir response to rainfall. Furthermore, we find that stream level measurements in the upper catchment can produce lead times sufficiently long enough to lower the damage caused by flash flooding in the Monsoon period.

TI  - Cloud Removal Based on SAR-Optical Remote Sensing Data Fusion via a Two-Flow Network
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing imagery plays an important role in observing the Earth's surface today. However, it is not easy to obtain complete multitemporal optical remote sensing images because of the cloud cover, how reconstructing cloud-free optical images has become a big challenge task in recent years. Inspired by the remote sensing fusion methods based on the convolutional neural network model, we propose a two-flow network to remove clouds from optical images. In the proposed method, synthetic aperture radar images are used as auxiliary data to guide optical image reconstruction, which is not influenced by cloud cover. In addition, a novel loss function called content loss is introduced to improve image quality. The ablation experiment of the loss function also proves that content loss is indeed effective. To be more in line with a real situation, the network is trained, tested, and validated on the SEN12MS-CR dataset, which is a global real cloud-removal dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed method is better than other state-of-the-art methods in many indicators (RMSE, SSIM, SAM, and PSNR).

T2  - VESTNIK OF SAINT PETERSBURG UNIVERSITY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper the analyzes dataset of global ocean chlorophyll A (Chl a) concentration from the GlobColour project over the equatorial Pacific during the La Nina events from 1998 to 2018. GlobColour includes satellite sensors such as SeaWiFS, MODIS, MERIS and others. The study of changes in chlorophyll A concentration is carried out with an analysis of sea temperature and current distributions on the surface and over the ocean depth taken from the NCEP GO-DAS reanalysis from 1981 to 2018. Additionally the trade wind indices from 1979 to 2018 are used. The purpose of the work is to study the mechanisms of formation of two La Nina types, leading to the occurrence of different climatic anomalies in different regions of our planet. It is found that at the initial stage of the Central Pacific La Nina type origin the ocean chlorophyll A concentration over the center equatorial Pacific increases in six to eight times (from 0.1 mg/m(3) to 0.8 mg/m(3)) and the thermocline depth in this area decreases to 50 m indicating the intensification of the central equatorial upwelling. During the East Pacific La Nina type the central equatorial upwelling is not formed and negative sea surface temperature anomalies are formed by increasing of the Peruvian upwelling supported intensification trade winds on the East Pacific equatorial sector. All obtained results are confirmed by a 95 % statistically signifi-cant by Student's test. Thus, the work is demonstrated significant differences in the features of the two La Nina types formation at their initial stage of origin.

AB  - We introduce the Satellite Neural Radiance Field (Sat-NeRF), a new end-to-end model for learning multi-view satellite photogrammetry in the wild. Sat-NeRF combines some of the latest trends in neural rendering with native satellite camera models, represented by rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) functions. The proposed method renders new views and infers surface models of similar quality to those obtained with traditional state-of-the-art stereo pipelines. Multi-date images exhibit significant changes in appearance, mainly due to varying shadows and transient objects (cars, vegetation). Robustness to these challenges is achieved by a shadow-aware irradiance model and uncertainty weighting to deal with transient phenomena that cannot be explained by the position of the sun. We evaluate Sat-NeRF using WorldView-3 images from different locations and stress the advantages of applying a bundle adjustment to the satellite camera models prior to training. This boosts the network performance and can optionally be used to extract additional cues for depth supervision.

AB  - Religions do not fit only in the realm of strict spirituality, but they aspire to shape the identity of their followers. This entails a whole worldview that, based on values, aims to provide an existential orientation. The expansion towards the social dimension has pushed religions towards the political sphere. Although this phenomenon affects all major religions, Islam is perhaps the most studied case in the West under the category of Islamism or political Islam. In this article we pro-vide some key elements of the contribution of Imam Yassine , his Justice and Spirituality movement, which, from Morocco, offer meaning-ful guidelines that go beyond the strict framework of the Islamic world.

T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of suspended sediment production and transport in large rivers are essential geomorphological processes that can influence biodiversity. The aim of this work was to analyze the spatio -temporal variation of suspended sediment transport in the lower Negro River using Sentinel-2 images. The suspended sediment concentration (SSC) was estimated from the reflectance of band 4 of the MSI sensor onboard the Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B. The results indicate that the hydrological regime controls the temporal variability of SSC, being higher in the low water period and lower during flooding, with a mean concentration of 5.28 mg L-1 for the period 2015-2019. Analysis of the spatial variation of SSC in Sentinel-2 images indicated a zone of active sediment deposition located downstream of the islands of the Anavilhanas Archipelago. Geology, forest cover, and hydrological variability are the main factors controlling the low sediment yield of the basin, with an estimated suspended solid flux of 5.76x10(6) ton.year(-1) and a specific yield of 8 ton.km(-2).year(-1). Despite the lower quantity of images between February and April, due to high cloud cover, this study showed that Sentinel-2 images could be used to monitor the temporal and spatial dynamics of suspended sediment transport in Amazonian blackwater rivers.

TI  - The Strategic Implications of India's Illiberalism and Democratic Erosion
T2  - ASIA POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article assesses the international implications of illiberalism and democratic erosion in India's domestic politics and considers whether and how Washington should recalibrate its strategic partnership with New Delhi.MAIN ARGUMENTThe U.S.-India relationship is founded on common interests, including a deepening strategic convergence with respect to China. U.S. policymakers also cite a shared commitment to liberal democratic governance as a central reason for closer alignment with India. Yet India's prevailing political culture is not best defined as "liberal," and under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, India's commitment to democracy is increasingly in doubt. Erosion is most obvious in the areas of tightened media controls, limits on civil society organizations, and reduced protections for minorities. The evolving character of India's domestic politics is likely to influence India's foreign policy aims and decision-making processes, hard-power capabilities, and the way India relates to other states, including the U.S.POLICY IMPLICATIONSThe U.S.-India strategic partnership is strong and likely to remain durable because of shared concerns about China's power and influence. Yet because India's domestic political culture and international worldview reflect unique historical, ideological, and cultural wellsprings, U.S. policymakers should not assume U.S.-India convergence on liberal aims, including India's commitment to the defense of the liberal international order.Rhetorically, the Biden administration has attached great significance to liberal democracy and thus risks politically costly criticism if it appears to ignore undemocratic trends in India. To avoid hypocrisy and, most importantly, to set realistic expectations for U.S.-India partnership, U.S. officials should convey their concerns about India's political trajectory forthrightly but bearing in mind that the U.S. has little influence over India's internal politics.Further erosion of democratic institutions and practices would, on balance, make India a less powerful and predictable international actor, and would reduce its capacity for reassurance and building partnerships with other states, including the U.S.The U.S. government should monitor political developments in India. If democratic erosion worsens, managing U.S. relations with India will demand a tricky balancing act that preserves and even strengthens partnership in areas deemed critical to geopolitical competition with China without extending U.S.-India cooperation into areas that would mistake India for an entirely like-minded U.S. treaty ally.

AB  - The estimation of dendrometric parameters of tree crops is crucial to decision making support for ecological and economic reasons. However, traditional methods for its measurement are time-consuming and laborious. Remote sensing data acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with computer vision and Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms can provide an easier and reliable solution to estimate those parameters. Nevertheless, various UAV flight settings can influence the quality of parameters derived from these data (e.g., flight height, imagery overlap). Thus, the main goal of this study is to assess the impact of different flight configurations on the detection of olive trees and on height and crown diameter estimation. The results showed that not only the configuration of the flight affects the dendrometric results, but also the topography of the terrain. Automatic tree detection revealed to be insensitive to the different flight configurations, whereas the tree height estimation was strongly affected. Among the analysed flights, the plan in double grid at 60 m of flight altitude and 90% of frontal overlap showed the best performance.

TI  - Blind Source Separation for MT-InSAR Analysis With Structural Health Monitoring Applications
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring large areas of the Earth's surface is possible thanks to the availability of remote sensing data obtained by a large collection of diverse satellites orbiting the Earth. Specifically, multitemporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) techniques supply the structural community with time series of line-of-sight displacements of terrain or structures, such as bridges or buildings, resulting from causes such as thermal expansion, contraction, and terrain deformation. The analysis of the different deformation signals observed is crucial in order to identify the different phenomena that cause the deformation. In this article, we explore the possibility of applying blind source separation algorithms to MT-InSAR, with the aim of developing methods towards automatic identification of different deformation patterns both in buildings and structures. We validate the proposed methodology using both synthetically generated datasets and real MT-InSAR data. We also provide a comparison with other similar methods. Our results demonstrate that InSAR time-series analysis can benefit from the use of the proposed blind source separation approach. Furthermore, the proposed technique is robust to the noise which is usually present in MT-InSAR data. This opens the door for monitoring infrastructure at scale over very large areas, helping to monitor civil infrastructures, and providing relevant insights to asset owners regarding the performance of such structures over time.

TI  - Estimation of the surface deformation of the slopes of the Turrialba volcano (Costa Rica) after an eruption using Sentinel-1A differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SAR)
T2  - REVISTA GEOGRAFICA DE AMERICA CENTRAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (SAR) is a technique known in remote sensing for its applications in the generation of digital terrain models and the monitoring of deformations of the earth's crust. This technique is based on the phase, a parameter present in SAR images and sensitive to terrain topography. Phase differences are related to elevation changes that occur between two satellite scans over the same space. To obtain topographic information, a digital terrain model is required and thus, phase differences provide information for estimating vertical terrain displacement to an accuracy greater than 1 centimeter. In the present work it was possible to estimate the surface deformation that occurred on the western slope of the crater of the Turrialba volcano after the eruption of August 1, 2020. For this purpose, several images captured by the Sentinel-1A sensor of the European Space Agency were used.

AB  - Deforestation in tropical rainforests is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, an important driver of climate change. For decades, the Brazilian government has maintained monitoring programs for deforestation detection in the Brazilian Legal Amazon area based on remotely sensed optical images in a protocol that involves considerable efforts of visual interpretation. However, the Amazon region is covered with clouds for most of the year, and deforestation assessment can rely only on images acquired in the dry season when cloud-free images are more likely to capture. One possibility to lessen that restriction and enable deforestation detection throughout the year is to synthesize cloud-free optical images from corresponding SAR images, which are only marginally influenced by atmospheric conditions. This work compares a set of such image synthesis methods, considering deforestation detection in the Amazon forest as the target application. Specifically, we evaluate three deep learning methods for cloud removal in Sentinel-2 images: a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) based on the pix2pix architecture; an extension of that method, which uses atrous convolutions (Atrous cGAN) to enhance fine image details; and a non-generative method (DSen2-CR) based on residual networks. In the evaluation, we assess both the quality of the generated images and the accuracy obtained when performing deforestation detection from those images. We further compare those methods with an image aggregation tool available in Google Earth Engine (GEE Tool), which creates cloud-free mosaics from sequences of images acquired at nearby dates. In this study, we considered two sites in the Brazilian Amazon, characterized by distinct vegetation and deforestation patterns. In terms of the quality metrics and classification accuracy, the Atrous cGAN was the best performing deep learning method. The GEE Tool outperformed all those methods when dealing with images from the dry season but turned out to be the poorest performing method in the wet season.

AB  - The contracts of indenture signed by Chinese workers in the Australian mandated territory of Nauru after 1920 may have been permitted by the League of Nations and approved by Hong Kong officials, but they remained part of an inherently fraught colonial labour system. The act of signing up to work for a single colonial employer, in this case the British Phosphate Commission, for a period of three years, while accepting that the employer would the provide food, clothing and communal housing, meant that these men gave up many personal liberties, such as family life. Indentured contracts had been subject to important revisions during the first decades of the twentieth century in response to criticisms from Chinese officials over flogging and penal sanctions. They now made provisions for reasonable wages, working hours and holidays. But despite this, the Australian administrators and the British Phosphate Commission maintained a racialized worldview, still referring to Chinese workers as "coolies". In this paper I draw upon the annual reports produced for the League of Nations, as well as written accounts by officials, Chinese representatives and workers, in order to paint a picture of everyday life for Chinese workers. I pay attention to the constraints imposed by the system of racial segregation, and aim to understand how Chinese men on Nauru sought to improve their quality of life through more varied food, entertainment and sport.

TI  - Multitemporal analysis of vegetation cover in the buffer zone of the Tambopata National Reserve, 2015-2020
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARLY CHILDHOOD SPECIAL EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of the research is to conduct a multi-temporal analysis of the vegetation cover in the buffer zone of the Tambopata National Reserve protected natural area for the period 2015-2020. One of the problems that have been identified is that since 2009, in the buffer zone, a series of mining camps have been installed, which are causing significant losses of forest areas and have caused the displacement of various species that are in a state of extension and vulnerable as the species Ateleschamek. For the analysis, the multispectral bands of Landsat 8 satellite images were used, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and supervised classification. The results determined that for 2015, 8.18% (10 409.8 ha) of vegetation cover was recorded as degraded in the buffer zone and 22.48% (28 618.95 ha) for the year 2020. Regarding the quality of vegetation cover, it was identified that unhealthy vegetation increased by 1.92% and 2.20% in 2015 and 2020, respectively. It is concluded that the application of the supervised classification method allows us to estimate the area of degraded vegetation cover, obtaining within the study period a total of 18 209, 15 ha, being illegal mining one of the leading causes and threats for the illegal mining is one of the leading causes and threats to native communities and biodiversity in the Tambopata National Reserve Buffer Zone.

TI  - Tidal measurements in the Gulf of Mexico: intercomparison of coastal tide gauge, insular GNSS reflectometry and SAR altimetry
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level can be monitored using conventional tide gauges, ground-based Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R), and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite altimetry. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages, so an intercomparison is a good exercise for cross-validation. We analyze the reliability of a standard geodetic-grade GNSS receiver and antenna and two Sentinel-3A SAR products to measure sea level variations in the Gulf of Mexico. We considered a one-year period over a 120 km wide region between an island and mainland, composed of reefs and shallow waters. First, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations from a GNSS station (CN26) on the island were analyzed. Second, high-resolution SAR altimetry data (20 Hz) of the Sentinel-3A satellite were acquired based on two processors, SARvatore and Peachi. The above results were compared to a conventional tide gauge located on the mainland at the shoreline of Progreso, Yucatan. The GNSS-R relative sea level had a correlation of 0.84 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 7.8 cm with the tide gauge, while SAR altimetry products had a correlation and RMSE of 0.86 12.4 cm for SARvatore and 0.85, 12.8 cm for Peachi. Furthermore, correlation and RMS between GNSS-R and SAR were found to be 0.94, 8.6 cm for SARvatore and 0.95, 7.2 cm for Peachi. Meanwhile, SARvatore and Peachi achieved an internal correlation of 0.92 and RMSE of 8.9 cm. Moreover, scale variations caused by the differences in the tidal range were quantified by linear regression slope with respect to the tide gauge, which amounted to 0.554, 0.843 and 0.814, respectively, for GNSS-R, SARvatore and Peachi. Finally, derived daily GNSS-R observations in conjunction with SAR altimetry were coherent with respect to the reference tide gauge indicating that GNSS-R can operate as an auxiliary validation instrument for SAR altimetry coastal measurements at ungauged locations.

TI  - IMPROVING RELIABILITY IN GLOBAL FLOOD MAPPING BY GENERATING A SEASONAL REFERENCE WATER MASK USING SENTINEL-1/2 TIME-SERIES DATA

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow

AB  - Variable intra-annual climatic and hydrologic conditions result in many regions of the world in a strong seasonality of the water extent throughout the year. This behaviour, however, is usually not reflected in satellite-based flood emergency mapping. This may lead to non-reliable representations of the flood extent and to misleading information within disaster management activities. In order to be able to separate flooding from normally present seasonal water coverage, up-to-date, high-resolution information on the seasonal water cover is crucial. In this work, we present an automatic methodology to generate a global and consistent permanent and seasonal reference water product based on high resolution Earth Observation data, specifically designed for the use within flood rapid mapping activities. The water masks are primarily based on the time-series analysis of optical Sentinel-2 imagery, which are complemented by Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar-based information in data scarce regions. The methodology has been developed based on data of five globally distributed study areas (Australia, Germany, India, Mozambique, and Sudan). Within this work results for Australia and India are demonstrated and are systematically compared with external reference water products. Results show, that by using the proposed product it is possible to give a more reliable picture on flood-affected areas in the frame of disaster response.

TI  - Real evapotranspiration estimate in watersheds in brazilian savana
T2  - BOLETIN GOIANO DE GEOGRAFIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The evapotranspiration is the phenomenon responsible for defining the transference of water from the soil-plant system to the atmosphere. It can be estimated through images obtained through remote sensing techniques, allowing the planning of proper water use, besides contributing to studies regarding environmental changes. The research has as objective to apply the SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithms of Land) model to estimate the real evapotranspiration from biophysical parameters measured by remote sensing and geoprocessing in different watersheds. After the implementation of SEBAL in 38 Landsat8 scenes from May 2018 to September 2019, a very good performance index was observed for daily and seasonal data, whereas for the instantaneous evapotranspiration the model still demands adjustments. The daily reference values (ETo) varied from 1.97 mm in winter to 8.16 mm in summer, while the real evapotranspiration values (ETr) varied from 3.68 mm in winter to 7.08 mm in spring, with the ETr presenting itself 33% inferior to the reference values. Considering the rainfall, the ETr corresponds to 74% of the annual value and indicates that the model is able to estimate these values in scale of 1:150.000 with inferior errors to 15%.

TI  - Use of soil moisture active passive satellite data and WorldClim 2.0 data to predict the potential distribution of visceral leishmaniasis and its vector Lutzomyia longipalpis in Sao Paulo and Bahia states, Brazil.
T2  - Geospatial Health
M3  - Article
AB  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease transmitted by Lutzomyia longipalpis, a sand fly widely distributed in Brazil. Despite efforts to strengthen national control programs reduction in incidence and geographical distribution of VL in Brazil has not yet been successful; VL is in fact expanding its range in newly urbanized areas. Ecological niche models (ENM) for use in surveillance and response systems may enable more effective operational VL control by mapping risk areas and elucidation of eco-epidemiologic risk factors. ENMs for VL and Lu. longipalpis were generated using monthly WorldClim 2.0 data (30-year climate normal, 1-km spatial resolution) and monthly soil moisture active passive (SMAP) satellite L4 soil moisture data. SMAP L4 Global 3-hourly 9-km EASE-Grid Surface and Root Zone Soil Moisture Geophysical Data V004 were obtained for the first image of day 1 and day 15 (0:00-3:00 hour) of each month. ENM were developed using MaxEnt software to generate risk maps based on an algorithm for maximum entropy. The jack-knife procedure was used to identify the contribution of each variable to model performance. The three most meaningful components were used to generate ENM distribution maps by ArcGIS 10.6. Similar patterns of VL and vector distribution were observed using SMAP as compared to WorldClim 2.0 models based on temperature and precipitation data or water budget. Results indicate that direct Earth-observing satellite measurement of soil moisture by SMAP can be used in lieu of models calculated from classical temperature and precipitation climate station data to assess VL risk.

AB  - Brazil is a country of continental scale area, with a territory of over 8.5 millions of km(2). Nowadays, data from different satellites and sensors with distinct spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions are available for free. However, prepare and handle these large amounts of data is an exhaustive task. The Brazil Data Cube (BDC) Project emerges in this context processing and preparing Analysis Ready Data (ARD) of medium spatial resolution satellite sensors, condensing it as image data cubes for the Brazilian territory, allowing researchers to easily extract time series from them, focusing on the analysis instead of the processing. This paper describes the workflow to generate BDC ARD input data, which are used as input for data cubes, as well as point our learnings and findings handling and processing these data.

AB  - The use of multitemporal SAR sequences is becoming more intensive in mapping and change detection applications, because of the availability of data sets with enough time length and sampling frequency. However, this procedure often requires to consider sequences of heterogeneous SAR data sets acquired by different sensors with different spatial resolution, frequency and polarimetric features. Their full exploitation is still an open and interesting research task.This work introduces first a pre-processing sequence applied by the team of the project MultiBiGSARData to obtain calibrated and co-registered heterogeneous SAR sequences. Then, a first example of their use for land cover classification is provided. The results are shown for test areas in Italy and Argentina, because the data sets are obtained by combining images acquired by the SIAGSE constellation, composed by the COSMO-SkyMed (CSK), COSMO-SkyMed Second Generation (CSG), and SAOCOM satellites.

AB  - In this work, we investigate how time series of the Normalized Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) can provide useful clues to enhance the traceability of organic food, and discuss the possibility to use machine learning in this context. Crop rotation, non-chemical weed control operations such as "greenmulching", fertilization, water supply management, all reflect into variables that are observable from space and may help reassuring the consumer that the traceable food they are purchasing matches the declared standards of sustainability and organic compliance.In this study we address detection of green mulching and weeding, based on experiments on a set of rice fields in Northern Italy. Our findings suggest that the cover crops associated with green mulching can be confirmed and weeding can be detected using data from the Sentinel-2 satellite constellation, whereas fertilization is far more difficult to detect correctly. The cost associated with procuring training data seems to discourage the use of machine learning at this stage.

TI  - Thermal Noise Removal From Polarimetric Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes, for the first time, an approach to remove thermal noise from the wave coherency matrix, C-2, estimated from single-look complex dual-polarization Interferometric Wide Swath mode Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. The approach is straightforward; it exploits the Thermal-NoiseRemoval module, provided by the European Space Agency (ESA) in its Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software, to remove thermal noise from the channel intensities. Then, noise correction on the complex data is applied, in order to estimate the noise-free C-2 matrix. As a further novelty, the proposed approach can be implemented in SNAP, through the use of a processing graph that is here provided. The method is applied on a dense time series of Sentinel-1 data, collected on an agricultural area located near Seville, Spain. The impact of thermal noise on the estimation of the eigendecomposition parameters of C-2, i.e., entropy (H-2), average alpha angle ((alpha) over bar (2)), and anisotropy (A(2)), is assessed for different land-cover types, namely river, rice, forest, and urban areas. Monte Carlo simulations are implemented to assess the performance of the proposed approach in estimating H-2, (alpha) over bar (2), and A(2). Results show that the proposed noise removal method improves the estimation of these parameters for the considered land-cover classes.

TI  - Model-Based Decomposition of Dual-Pol SAR Data: Application to Sentinel-1
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we advance a new family of model-based decompositions adapted for dual-pot synthetic aperture radar data. These are formulated using the Stokes vector formalism, coupled to mappings from full quad-pot decomposition theory. A generalized model-based decomposition is developed, which allows separation of an arbitrary Stokes vector into partially polarized and polarized wave components. We employ the widely used random dipole cloud as a volume model but, in general, nondipole options can he used. The cross-polarized phase delta, and the alpha angle, which is a function of the ratio between wave components, measure the transformation of polarization state on reflection. We apply the decomposition to dual-pol data provided by Sentinel-1 (S1) covering different scenarios, such as agricultural, forest, urban, and glacial land-ice. We show that the polarized term of received polarization state is not usually the same as the transmitted one, and can therefore be used for key applications, e.g., classification and geo-physical parameter estimation. We show that, for vegetated terrain, depolarization is not the only influencing factor to S1 backscattered intensities and, in the case of vertical crops (e.g., rice), this allows the crop orientation effects to be decoupled from volume scattering in the canopy. We demonstrate that coherent dual-pol systems show strong phase signatures over glaciers, where the polarized contribution significantly affects the backscattered state, resulting in elliptical polarization on receive. This is a key result for S1, for which dual-pot phase analysis coupled to dense time series offer great opportunities for land-ice monitoring.

TI  - Oxygen Dynamics during the Period of Dystrophic Processes in the Black Sea
T2  - PHYSICAL OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. The paper is aimed to analyze (i) peculiarities of the oxygen content and distribution in the Black Sea waters and (ii) the ratio of the observed changes in the oxygen distribution, the total primary production level and changes in the cold intermediate layer ventilation.Methods and Results. The expedition data (2015-2019) as well as the data array (1980-2013) from the Oceanographic Data Bank of Marine Hydrophysical Institute, RAS, were used to analyze the oxygen content. The data for the deep part of the Black Sea (exceeding the 200 m depth) were selected. To analyze the primary production values, the shipboard fluorometric measurements of the chlorophyll a concentrations (1980-2001), and also the surface chlorophyll a concentrations derived from the SeaWiFS and MODIS-Aqua color scanners remote sensing (1998-2019) were utilized. The primary production was calculated using the regression equations in the form y = a + bx that bound up the primary production in the water column with the surface chlorophyll concentration. The calculated data reveal a significant increase in the annual primary production level (to 400 g C/m(2).year) in the first half of the 1980s, then it declined on the average to similar to 140 g C/m(2) year from 1985 to 1995, and it remains at the level of similar to 100 g C/m(2) year from 1998 up to the present time. These variations in the primary production values correspond to the observed changes in the vertical distribution of nitrate and an increase in the temperature of the cold intermediate layer core, resulting in a decrease of the oxygen concentration in the deep oxic layers.Conclusions. An increase in temperature in the upper layers of the sea and a reduction of the winter convective mixing intensity resulted in a decrease in the oxygen supply to all layers of the aerobic zone of the Black Sea. The lowest oxygen content recorded for the whole period of 1980-2019 was revealed in 2010. At the same time, dystrophication process drove the Black Sea system to its natural state, when the oxygen content dynamics depended mainly on the intensity of physical ventilation.

M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE Mediterranean and Middle-East Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (M2GARSS)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - One of the main risk factors which affect the archaeological heritage is the looting which causes the destruction of stratigraphic data and the "cultural context" that are lost forever and cannot be restored any more. The use of appropriate technologies, including Earth Observation (EO), for the identification of sites exposed to the destructive action of grave robbers, the timely detection and quantification of the extension of the looted areas is a mandatory step for setting effective in situ monitoring strategies in particular for remote and inaccessible archaeological areas. In this paper a remote and close range sensing based approach, including satellite and UAS based image processing, and GPR, has been applied to the Inca settlement of Paredones, in desert environment in Southern Peru, for the detection of looting features. The approach includes also the use of an automatic algorithm named ALFEA (Archaeological Looting Feature Extraction Approach), developed and already experienced by the same authors for other desert sites in South, Central and North of Peru. ALFEA is based on the integration of spatial autocorrelation statistics, unsupervised classification and segmentation. To improve the capability in discriminating and extracting looting features a segmentation step including the setup of multi threshold parameters has been added (ALFEA-I method). Close range analyses based on UAS have been performed with the twofold aims: i) to validate, along with in situ surveys, ALFEA-I method, thus evidencing a good rate of success; ii) to analyze the morphological characteristics of looting features, useful to understand the technique and the depth of digging. With this latter respect complementary information have been provided by also GPR prospecting.

TI  - Retrieval of Sub-Kilometric Relative Surface Soil Moisture With Sentinel-1 Utilizing Different Backscatter Normalization Factors
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal distribution of soil moisture is important for hydrometeorological and agricultural applications. There is growing interest in monitoring soil moisture in relation to soil- and land-based natural flood management (NFM), to understand the soil's ability, via land-use and management changes, and to delay the arrival of flood peaks in nearby watercourses. This article monitors relative surface soil moisture (rSSM) across the Thames Valley, U.K., using Sentinel-1 data, and the Vienna University of Technology (TU-Wien) Change Detection Algorithm, with a novel exploration of monthly and annual normalization factors and spatial averaging. Two pairs of normalization factors are introduced to remove impacts from varying local incidence angles through direct and multiple regression slopes. The spatiotemporal distribution of rSSM values at various spatial resolutions (1000, 500, 250, and 100 m) is assessed. Comparisons with in situ soil moisture data from the COSMOS-UK network show that, while general temporal trends agree, the difference in effective depth of measurements, coupled with vegetation impacts during the growing season, makes comparison with soil moisture observations difficult. Temporal rSSM trends can be retrieved at spatial resolutions down to 100 m, and the rSSM RMSE was found to decrease as the spatial resolution increases. The vegetation effects upon the rSSM are further explored by comparing the two dominant land cover types: Arable and Horticulture, and Improved Grassland. It was found that, while the rSSM retrieval for these land covers was possible, and the general soil moisture trend is clear, overlying vegetation during the summer artificially increased the rSSM values.

TI  - The Interaction of Chlorophyll-a and Total Suspended Matter along the Western Semarang Bay, Indonesia, Based on Measurement and Retrieval of Sentinel 3
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kendal Regency area is one of the areas on the northern coast of Central Java that has been experiencing rapid industrial development. The high human activity in this area will impact the quality of water in these surrounding areas and affect the fertility of the waters. The concentrations of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and total suspended matter (TSM) are major water quality parameters that can be retrieved using remotely sensed data. The retrieval satellite of the 3 OLCI chosen in this study has a 300 m spatial resolution. This study aimed to see the distribution and ef-fect of total suspended matter (TSM) on chlorophyll-a based on measurement and retrieval of Sentinel 3 imagery using the linear regression method. The results show the chlorophyll-a distribution and the value from retrieval satellite are higher and occur over larger surface area compared to chlorophyll-a measurements. The linear regres-sion model of chlorophyll-a by retrieval satellite imagery and measurement is y = 0.65x + 4.65 with R2 = 0.54. The presence of high amounts of suspended solids in the waters causes disturbances in the reflectance values, which are recorded by the retrieval of satellite. The model regression chlorophyll-a with TSM accuracy from retrieval satellite results in the equationy =-0.0416x + 5.14 (R2 = 0.45, p = 0.05, n = 13). The determination (R2) coefficient value is 0.445, which means that suspended solids have a 44.5% effect on chlorophyll-a and 55.5% is influenced by other factors and not examined in this study. The results show that TSM has an influence on the accuracy of chlorophyll-a and retrieval satellite recording can be disrupted if waters have high turbidity.

TI  - Assessing the Influence of Land Use/Land Cover Alteration on Climate Variability: An Analysis in the Aurangabad District of Maharashtra State, India
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining the influence of land use/land cover transformation on meteorological variables has become imperative for maintaining long-term climate sustainability. Rapid growth and haphazard expansion have caused the conversion of prime agricultural land into a built-up area. This study used multitemporal Landsat data to analyze land use/land cover (LULC) changes, and Terra Climate monthly data to examine the impact of land transformation on precipitation, minimum and maximum temperature, wind speed, and soil moisture in the Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state in India during 1999-2019. Multiple linear regression and correlation analysis were performed to determine the association among LULC classes and climatic variables. This study revealed rapid urbanization in the study area over the years. The built-up area, water bodies, and barren lands have recorded a steep rise, while the agricultural area has decreased in the district. Drastic changes were observed in the climatic variables over the years. The precipitation and wind speed have shown decreasing trends during the study period. A positive relationship between soil moisture and agricultural land was found through a correlation analysis. Conspicuous findings about the positive relationship between the agricultural land and maximum temperature need further investigation. A multiple linear regression analysis demonstrated a negative relationship between the built-up area and precipitation. The intensity of the precipitation has reduced as a consequence of the developmental activities in the study area. Moreover, a positive relationship was observed between the built-up area and maximum temperature. Thus, this study calls for policy implications to formulate a futuristic land-use plan considering climate change projection in the district.

TI  - Long-term monitoring of NDVI changes by remote sensing to assess the vulnerability of threatened plants
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about how much continuous landscape transformation might affect the most vulnerable elements of biodiversity. In this study, we quantified changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) over the past 35 years across locations with threatened plants and in Natura 2000 (N2000) protected areas, in an environmentally heterogeneous region of Southern Europe. First, we estimated the intensity and duration of NDVI gains and losses based on Landsat time series using the LandTrendr algorithm in Google Earth Engine. Then, we tested: 1) whether populations of threatened plants were located in more stable sites than non-threatened plants (i.e., lower NDVI changes); 2) whether NDVI changes around populations of threatened plants differed across habitats and inside/outside N2000 areas, and 3) whether lower NDVI changes occurred in N2000 areas than unprotected areas, thereby indicating their effectiveness at preserving biodiversity. Threatened plants tended to be concentrated in sites with less change irrespective of the habitat where they occurred and their location within protected areas. Occurrence in stable sites also reduced the risk associated with small-sized populations. N2000 areas were in line with the overall greening trend but they experienced less loss events than the unprotected areas, thereby supporting their role in slowing down human-induced land cover changes. Our approach demonstrates how long-term remote sensing monitoring can help to assess the effects of both slow processes and drastic landscape transformation events on priority plants in a comprehensive and rapid manner. This method can identify hidden patterns in extensive regions and guide effective conservation management.

M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this article is to identify the features of functioning of the ritual and mythological complex in the structure of the nurturing novel. On the example of novels "My Soul Pavel" by A.N. Varlamov and "Inspection Bureau" by A.N. Arkhangelsky the analysis of mythopoetic motifs and images endowed with ritual component is carried out. The article analyzes the relationship of rituals and mythological allusions to the genre specificity of the educational novel. The focus of the article is on identification of functional meaning and role of ritual in the plot of the novels. The article explores the social content of the ritual-mythological complex: the functional basis of the ritual is the creation of a sustainable model of social situations. The novelty of the article lies in the study of the role of the ritual-mythological complex in the artistic world of the plot of the modern novel of education. The analysis concludes that the ritual complex performs the function of systematization in the plot of the educational novel and creates the transfer zone allowing the characters to pass from one social status to another one by overcoming certain tests aimed to check the hero's readiness for the new status. Also, ritual, based on the mythological worldview, divides the stages of the hero's path: following the rituals, the hero gradually moves from initiation to initiation. Mythopoetic of ritual actions acts as a kind of practical guide to the ritual rite, thus strengthening faith in the magical and creating intergenerational continuity.

T2  - Uttar Pradesh Journal of Zoology
M3  - Article
AB  - The Bivalvia class constitute an important molluscan class that exert its effect on human society an important food component and sentinel organism indicating environmental contamination. Accurate species identification is a prerequisite for management of aquaculture, diversity studies and for human consumption. Presence of different species of bivalves on the global markets for human consumption has given rise to several commercial frauds based on species substitution. Reliable and rapid techniques are required to identify seafood species in different products and thus prevent wilful or unintentional fraudulence. This article reviews the molecular tools used by different researchers in the last two decades. By reviewing virtually all genetic markers used during the last two decades of bivalve molecular research, it is obvious that the best tools for bivalve molecular study are mitochondrial COI and nuclear ITS2.

TI  - Retroperitoneal Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy by Vaginally Assisted Natural Orifices Endoscopic Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery in Early Stage Endometrial Cancer: Description of Technique and Surgeon's Perspectives after the First Experience
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Endometrial cancer is the most commonly diagnosed gynecological malignancy. Feasibility and safety of laparoscopy are no longer to be demonstrated in patients with uterine-confined endometrial carcinoma. Vaginally assisted natural orifices endoscopic transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) is a new endoscopic approach over the past decade with significant evidence in benign pathology. Publications exploring VNOTES surgery in gynecological cancer were published first in 2014. We hereby report our first experience with vNOTES surgery in endometrial cancer. A 64-year-old patient presented with postmenopausal bleeding. Endometrial biopsy identified a G1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma. MRI suspected deep invasion of myometrium with no abnormal lymph node. She underwent a total hysterectomy with bilateral adnexectomy and retroperitoneal pelvic sentinel node biopsy by vNOTES. The final histopathology confirmed G1 endometrial adenocarcinoma FIGO II (proximal focal invasion of cervical stroma and superficial invasion of myometrium). The patient was discharged 2 days postoperatively with no complications. vNOTES offers a closer approach and a better view of afferent lymphatics and probably the best chances to identify the true sentinel node. This approach presents several advantages compared to abdominal laparoscopy such as faster postoperative recovery, reduced pain, decreased postoperative wound infections, and no abdominal trocar port complications. The future research should focus on oncological safety, accuracy, and reliability of this technique, and an international registry should help to gather rapidly these informations.

TI  - Theological Discourse in the Formation of the Literary Tale: How Worldview came to Dominate Narrative
T2  - INTERLITTERARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is motivated by new perspectives that help to expend the boundaries of multidisciplinary research. The article examines the discourse on the literary tale with regard to its theological specificity of narrative and how worldview came to dominate it. The most significant examples of German, Russian, Polish, Romanian and Ukrainian tales are analysed, taking into consideration national ethos. The specifics of the genre are explored in their historical and cultural contexts, with an emphasis on the difference between the literary tale and the folktale. Previous research indicates that the poetics of literary tales of this type has not been studied sufficiently. The paper aims to examine the literary tale within an ethno-national historical context, considering the main aspects of the Christian religious ethos of the 19th century. Our methodology includes an integrative multidisciplinary approach that combines the principles of historical poetics, hermeneutics, receptive poetics and classical methods of folkloristics in the light of transitivity theory.The findings support the idea that reception peculiarities of Christian tale poetics predominantly focus on plot development, personosphere, chronotope, Christian tokens, divine symbols and paradigms. The focused was both on the encoded religious intentions of literary tales (requiring receptive decoding of allusions) and the transparently expressed appeals to God with an emphasis on Christian hermeneutic instruction. Accordingly, fabulous archetypes related to religious morality were analysed using the example of Pushkin's literary tales.Overall, distinction between the genres of Christian fairy tale, Christmas tale and Christian fantasy appeared to be the most productive. We conclude that the genre matrix of the fairy tale remains open to various modifications, and consequently, fairy tale narrative structures when combined with Christian motifs actuate other genre forms. We emphasise that reception of theological discourse on a literary tale depends on the readers' psycholinguistic competencies and the peculiarities of their religious identity.

TI  - Mapping Deforestation in Cerrado Based on Hybrid Deep Learning Architecture and Medium Spatial Resolution Satellite Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cerrado is the second largest biome in Brazil, covering about 2 million km2. This biome has experienced land use and land cover changes at high rates due to agricultural expansion so that more than 50% of its natural vegetation has already been removed. Therefore, it is crucial to provide technology capable of controlling and monitoring the Cerrado vegetation suppression in order to undertake the environmental conservation policies. Within this context, this work aims to develop a new methodology to detect deforestation in Cerrado through the combination of two Deep Learning (DL) architectures, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and U-Net, and using Landsat and Sentinel image time series. In our proposed method, the LSTM evaluates the time series in relation to the time axis to create a deforestation probability map, which is spatially analyzed by the U-Net algorithm alongside the terrain slope to produce final deforestation maps. The method was applied in two different study areas, which better represent the main deforestation patterns present in Cerrado. The resultant deforestation maps based on cost-free Sentinel-2 images achieved high accuracy metrics, peaking at an overall accuracy of 99.81%& PLUSMN;0.21 and F1-Score of 0.8795 & PLUSMN;0.1180. In addition, the proposed method showed strong potential to automate the PRODES project, which provides the official Cerrado yearly deforestation maps based on visual interpretation.

TI  - Chesterton Motifs in the Works of S.L. Frank
T2  - VOPROSY FILOSOFII
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the reception of the ideas of G.K. Chesterton by S.L. Frank: (1) direct quotes from Chesterton in Frank's writings; (2) Frank's reproduction of the Chestertonian ideas without reference to the writer; (3) the coincidence of two intuitions without borrowing. Motives of the second and third types are considered for the first time. It is shown that the main source of borrowing for Frank is Chesterton's Orthodoxy. Frank's use of the Chesterton concept of "common sense" is noted: both thinkers insist that it is the religious worldview that recognizes both the visible and invisible layers of being that is "common sense", while the materialistic worldview is the result of reduction, "narrowing of the spiritual horizon". The constructions of Frank and Chesterton converge in emphasizing the beingness of the world and man and in the theme of the absolute ideal as a condition of social progress. The article states, that Chesterton ideas appears in the writings of Frank in the expatriate period, when religious topics are becoming important for him. Engaging the argumentative moves of an English Christian apologist mainly takes place in texts where Frank himself addresses the apologetic problems: The Downfall of Idols, Religion and Science, God With Us, but can be also traced in Frank's key metaphysical works The Incomprehensible and Reality and Man.

TI  - Anthropological Ideas in the Prose of the Ukrainian Diaspora: Traditions and Postmodernism
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article discusses the main anthropological ideas in diaspore's prose in the context of existing traditions and postmodern stylistic characteristics. It also highlights characteristic features of the Ukrainian diaspora's prose. The latter contains the views on the literary character as personality, as well as the world and place of humans in it. Importantly, the research follows the concepts of Christian theology, superhuman, rationalism, and postmodernism. It also emphasizes the axiological matrices of humans and their worldviews. The scientific value of the article lies in disclosing anthropological models that correspond to axiological functionality. Using the prose of the Ukrainian diaspora and the art of words, the authors of the article attempt to find how to overcome the crisis of human and society. The proposed approach allows finding the place of humans in this world and give their lives meaning. It shows that the world is beautiful and cannot exist on its own, given that it acts as one's awareness. At the same time, the anthropological concept is considered a system. Furthermore, the authors have applied a system of theoretical-methodological approaches to the problem in question. It was important to identify the main theoretical principles of the research, describe anthropological ideas of prose and highlight anthropological ideas in the Ukrainian diaspora's prose in the context of existing traditions and postmodern postulates.

TI  - On the Ritual Practices of the Population of the Gorokhovo Culture
T2  - STRATUM PLUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the ritual practices of the population of the Gorokhovo culture, which were reconstructed based on materials of the burial mounds Vodennikovo-I and Murzino-IV. We assumed that the vessels with red-hot talc hammers were used for ritual purification and fumigation of the space before placing the deceased. Bronze bells were probably considered magical items that could provide a link between the living and the dead. We associate the absence of a bell clapper with the Ugric tradition of tying up clappers and hiding noisy things during the wake, as well as the tradition of deliberately damaging the things. Bronze wheels could be used as flywheels for whirligig in divination or spindle whorls in sacral spinning. This material allows us to talk about two main components that underlie the worldview of the population of the Gorokhovo culture - substrate Ugric component and superstrate Iranian component.

TI  - Assessment of glacier retreat in the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy, Colombia based on multisensor image classification
T2  - BOLETIN DE GEOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Andean glaciers represent one of the most important water sources in South America. They have been significantly reduced in recent decades because of climate change and climate variability. The most extensive snow-capped peak in the Colombian Andes Mountains corresponds to the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy (SRC), a mountain range located toward the northeast of the Eastern Cordillera with snow at altitudes ranging from approximately 4800 to 5345 meters above sea level (masl). From Landsat-4 (1987), Landsat-5 (1991, 1997, 2009), Landsat-7 (2000, 2003), Landsat-8 (2014, 2016, 2017), and Sentinel-2 (2019, 2021) satellite imagery, a pixel-oriented classification was performed using the PCI Geomatics software, defining four cover types: glacier area, soil-rock, vegetation, and water. For accuracy validation, high spatial resolution satellite imagery (Google Earth similar to 1.0 m and Planet's high-resolution, analysis-ready mosaics of the world's tropics similar to 4.7 m) and field control points were used as reference data. Overall accuracy values (all coverages) ranged from 86-99%, with accuracy for glacier area coverage between 97-100%. The decrease in the glacier area is of 1099.59 ha over 34 years (1987-2021). This analysis revealed that the glacier area decreased by approximately 37.92% regarding the first scene (1987). According to this trend, the SRC glacier would be extinct by 2048. The rate of glacier retreat is mainly influenced by factors related to global warming, such as the increase in mean annual temperature and the decrease in precipitation rates and climate variability factors such as the El Nino phenomenon.

TI  - EFFICIENT USE OF INTERFEROMETRIC COHERENCE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN CLASSIFICATION OF URBAN AND TALL VEGETATION WITH SAR DATA
T2  - 2022 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM (IGARSS 2022)
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Kuala Lumpur, MALAYSIA
AB  - Classification of synthetic aperture radar data has been attempted by researchers in the past for several years, with varying degrees of success. One of the most challenging problem in such classifications is the segregation of urban (built-up region) and tall vegetation (TV). This is due to lack of difference in their scattering power. Therefore, an attempt has been made to improve urban and TV classification accuracy by exploring the use of Sentinel-1 interferometric coherence images as an additional feature along with other popularly used scattering features. A convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained on these features to obtain a good accuracy for classifying urban, TV and other classes. Obtained results are analyzed in both visual and quantitative ways. It is observed that when interferometric coherence images are added as an additional input feature in the CNN, producer and user accuracy for the urban and TV are improved from 15 to 25%, and overall accuracy(OA) is reached from 72.5% to 79.3%. Results oabtained with the CNN model is also compared with the traditional machine learning models such as support vector machine(SVM) and k-nearest neighbors(KNN). CNN over performes with 79.3% OA, followed by KNN with 66% OA while the performance of SVM is the worst among them all with 60% OA.

TI  - Ecosystem Productivity and Evapotranspiration Dynamics of a Seasonally Dry Tropical Forest of the Yucatan Peninsula
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are among the most threatened ecosystems despite their important role in the global carbon and water cycles. In Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula (YP) hosts near to 30% of these ecosystems. We established an ecohydrological monitoring site in a relatively pristine tropical dry forest (TDF) within "El Palmar" state reserve at the northwest of the YP, to study the seasonal dynamics of its carbon and water fluxes and to evaluate their main controls as they respond to climatic variability. Spatio-temporal analyses using Bio-meteorological data from an Eddy Covariance station (from January 2017 to August 2019) and remotely sensed data (from 2001 to 2019), reveal the inter and intra-annual dynamics of carbon and water fluxes between this ecosystem and the atmosphere. The TDF's greenness, net exchange of carbon, gross primary production, ecosystem respiration, and evapotranspiration are strongly controlled by the seasonality in precipitation pulses and their legacy from recharged moisture in the shallow aquifer observed through three marked seasons: dry, rainy, and post-rainy. The study site continuously behaves like a carbon sink with annual rates ranging between -1.09 and -7.06 tonC/ha/yr ${\mathrm{ton}}_{\mathrm{C}}/\mathrm{ha}/\mathrm{yr}$, whose performance responds to a precipitation threshold above which its productivity declines. Differences in the ecosystem productivity among years result from a combination of water and energy availability during the growing season and variable access to groundwater during the post-rainy and dry seasons. This highlights the ecosystem sensitivity to rainfall modulation of energy and water availability throughout the year and its impact on the ecosystem's functioning and resilience.

TI  - Stochastic modeling of sea ice concentration fields for assessment of navigation conditions along the Northern Sea Route
T2  - LED I SNEG-ICE AND SNOW
M3  - Article
AB  - Article describes a probabilistic model (stochastic generator) of spatial-temporal variability of sea ice concentration. Values of the ice concentration are generated at the nodes of the spatial grid with 10 km resolution; the model time step is one day. The change in ice concentration with time (temporal variability) is modeled on the basis of a matrix of transient probabilities (discrete Markov chain), each row of which is a distribution function of the conditional probability of changes in the ice concentration. Spatial variability is determined by empirical probability fields, with which the observed changes in fields of the ice concentration are associated with known conditional probability distribution functions. To identify the parameters of the stochastic generator, satellite data from the OSI SAF project for the period 1987-2019 were used. The generator takes into account seasonal, interannual and climatic variability. Interannual and climatic variability are determined on the basis of a stochastic model of changes in the types of ice coverage. In order to verify the developed stochastic generator, we compared the statistical indicators of observed and calculated ice fields. The results showed that the field average absolute error of statistical characteristics of the ice concentration (mean and standard deviation) does not exceed 3.3%. The discrepancy between the correlation intervals of ice coverage calculated from the model and measured ice concentration fields does not exceed 2 days. The variograms of the modeled and observed fields have a similar form and close values. As an example, we determined the duration of navigation of Arc4 ice class ships between the Barents and Kara Seas using synthetic fields of the ice concentration reproduced by the stochastic generator.

AB  - The use of satellite-based remote sensing data to investigate ground surface conditions has recently been growing. Specifically, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data have successfully been utilized to detect ground surface deformations and damaged area mapping. This study uses Sentinel-1 SAR data to map the 2018 Naga landslide area in Cebu Island in the Philippines. The intensity and coherence difference analyses were conducted to detect surface changes resulting from the landslide. The amplitude- and coherence-based results coincide with the actual landslide area and successfully map ground surface mass movement using pre- and post- failure SAR images. This paper presents the unique advantages and potential of Sentinel-1 SAR data for landslide area mapping in large-scale open-pit mining sites for rapid disaster impact assessment.

TI  - Alloimmunization to Rh Antigen (D, C, E, C, E) Among Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Care in South Western Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF BLOOD MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Maternal red cell alloimmunization to Rh antigen in pregnant women occurs when the immune system is sensitized by foreign red blood cell surface antigens, in this case fetal red blood cells, inducing an immune response. Various antigens of blood group systems may cause alloimmunization, especially the Rh, Kel, Fy, JK, and MNS systems. This study aimed to determine alloimmunization to the different frequencies of Rh antigen among pregnant women in South Western Uganda.Methods: A total of 1369 pregnant women consented and were recruited into a cross-sectional study during their regular antenatal visits during the period August 2020 to July 2021. Samples (4 mL) of anticoagulated and coagulated blood were obtained, and Rh blood grouping including Rh antigen and the indirect antiglobulin test (IAT) was carried out using the agglutination technology of the LISS ID-Card technique in the Ortho Biovue ID-Micro Typing System.Results: Out of 1369 participants recruited to the study, 78 (5.7%) were D-, 1291 were D+, and 134 (9.8%) had alloantibodies. Among those with alloantibodies, 115 (85.8%) were D+ and 19 (14.2%) D-. The percentage alloimmunization according to the Rh antigens was highest in e (9.72%), c (2.48%), C (2.34%) and E (0.94%) antigens. With the ABO system, alloimmunization was highest in blood group B (10.7%), followed by A (10.6%), O (9.2%) and then AB (7.1%). Alloimmunization was more prevalent in D- (24%) than in D+ participants (8.9%). Rhesus antigen e was the most prevalent antigen (99.8%), followed by c. The alloimmunization rate of 9.8% among these participants is high, and appears in both D+ and D- women. The other Rhesus antigens are seen to cause alloimmunization, with antigen e causing the highest prevalence. In conclusion, there is a need to identify antibodies and study the outcome for clinical significance, especially in D+ women, to facilitate proper pregnancy management.

M3  - Article
AB  - Drought-associated water shortage is a complicated hazard, and extreme weather and climate events have serious impacts on agricultural, ecological, and socio-economic activities in any society. This work focuses on drought analysis using a high-resolution remote sensing and meteorological dataset from MODIS's NDVI and LST to evaluate the spatio-temporal distribution drought events and intensities in three physiographic regions of the USA from 2000-2019. Results were compared with other remote-sensing-based drought indices, such as the temperature condition index (TCI) and the vegetation health index (VHI), and it was observed that the VCI and VHI, which was a combination of vegetation and meteorological information, had a strong correlation with precipitation data than the NDVI-derived VCI. The results demonstrated the severity of vegetation stress and extreme droughts in 2000, 2006, 2011, and 2012. The long-term agricultural drought situation compared with other drought indices reveals a good agreement as to the TCI and VHI, and precipitation anomalies also decreased significantly.

TI  - Assessment of polarization sensitivity of Aqua-MODIS using co-incident POLDER-3 polarized measurements over marine stratocumulus clouds
T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - Over the MODIS mission, normalized trends of Earth-view digital numbers (EV-dn) over desert calibration sites (PICS) have shown biases in several Terra MODIS reflective solar bands (RSBs) related to the changes in polarization sensitivity. The MODIS Characterization Support Team (MCST) corrects for these effects at the Level 1B stage in Collection 7 with monthly coefficient updates from NASA Ocean Biology Processing Group (OBPG). However, upcoming orbit changes for both MODIS instruments may require more frequent updates and new algorithms. In this work, we present a vicarious calibration algorithm with the potential to characterize polarization sensitivity using a single MODIS granule, across a range of angles-of-incidence (AOI). Marine stratocumulus cloud targets off the coast of South America, measured in near-real-time by Aqua-MODIS and the polarimeter POLDER-3, are used. These clouds strongly polarize light in optical wavelengths, are spatially uniform over wide areas, and are present year-round. After geo-registering both data to similar to 50 km superpixels, we find the polarized reflectance fit that best matches the cloud microphysics of the POLDER-3 target at 0.865 mu m. We then interpolate the fit to the Aqua-MODIS target geometry. We derive polarization sensitivity coefficients for Aqua-MODIS Band 2 (0.858 mu m) at a range of AOI using the POLDER-3 retrieval results for six different matchups in 2005. The results suggest that cloud development in the time between Aqua-MODIS and POLDER-3 measurements (similar to 3 min) and simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) distance are the main error contributions, combined with relatively low polarization sensitivity for Aqua Band 2. Even so, the derived sensitivity coefficients agree with pre-launch values within uncertainty. Therefore, simultaneous, co-incident radiometer and polarimeter data are optimal, such as from OCI and HARP-2/SPEXone on the upcoming NASA Plankton Aerosol Cloud and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial surveillance could be a useful tool for early detection and quantification of plant diseases, however, there are often confounding effects of other types of plant stress. Stemphylium leaf blight (SLB), caused by the fungus Stemphylium vesicarium, is a damaging foliar disease of onion. Studies were conducted to determine if near-infrared photographic images could be used to accurately assess SLB severity in onion research trials in the Holland Marsh in Ontario, Canada. The site was selected for its uniform soil and level topography. Aerial photographs were taken in 2015 and 2016 using an Xnite-Canon SX230NDVI with a near-infrared filter, mounted on a modified Cine Star-8 MK Heavy Lift RTF octocopter UAV. Images were taken at 15-20 m above the ground, providing an average of 0.5 cm/pixel and a field of view of 15 x 20 m. Photography and ground assessments of disease were carried out on the same day. NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index), green NDVI, chlorophyll index and plant senescence reflective index (PSRI) were calculated from the images. There were differences in SLB incidence and severity in the field plots and differences in the vegetative indices among the treatments, but there were no correlations between disease assessments and any of the indices.

AB  - The associated morbidity and mortality fromCOVID-19 and the public health response to prevent the spread of the virus has repeatedly demonstrated the significant impact of social determinants of health (SDoH) and social inequities on health outcomes. Social prescriptions are interventions aimed at tackling SDoH. In 2019, NHS-England committed to support the use of social prescribing across England. NHS-England commissioned the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) sentinel network to monitor the distribution of social prescribing services within English primary care and, within that, monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic response on SDoH. To track incidence of people presenting to primary care with SDoHrelated issues, we implemented an ontological approach to curate SDoH indicators in computerised medical records (CMR) using the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). These indicators were then extracted from the RCGP-RSC sentinel network database to present weekly incidence rates per 10,000 people to assess the impact of the pandemic on these SDoH. Pre- versus peri-pandemic, we observed an increase in the recording of several of our SDoH indicators; namely issues related to homelessness, unemployment, mental health, harmful substance use and financial difficulties. As far as we are aware, this is the first time that routinely collected primary care CMR data has been utilised for the monitoring and surveillance of SDoH and demonstrates the feasibility of this approach for future surveillance.

AB  - Water is a valuable resource and an understanding of soil moisture dynamics is critical in many land management, agricultural and engineering applications. Satellite and UAV remote sensing platforms present an opportunity for rapid, cost-efficient data collection; however, soil moisture remote sensing presents unique challenges. Specifically, spectral bands near 1400nm and 1900nm associated with water are typically avoided in remote sensing data products due to strong interference by atmospheric moisture. Using soil reflectance data collected in the lab, this paper presents a number of linear equations which maybe be applied to predict soil moisture content from Landsat 5 MSS, 7 TM and 9 data, as well as other NIR sensors collecting data at 1720, 1782, 2140 and 2240nm.

T2  - The British journal of oral & maxillofacial surgery
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Patients undergoing sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) for early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) who harbour occult metastases (pN+ve) may be at greater risk of mortality due to prolonged overall treatment times than those identified as pN+ve on elective neck dissection (ELND). A retrospective comparative survival analysis was therefore undertaken to test this hypothesis. Patients were identified from the South Glasgow multidisciplinary team (MDT) database. Group 1 comprised 38 patients identified as pN+ve, or who were false negative, on sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Group 2 comprised 146 patients staged pN+ve on ELND. The groups were compared with the Kaplan Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, a matched-pair analysis was performed. A unique and specifically designed algorithm was deployed to optimise the pairings. No difference in disease-specific or overall survival was found between the groups. Patients undergoing SLNB as the initial neck staging modality in early OSCC and are identified as pN+ve do not appear to be at a survival disadvantage compared with those staged with ELND.

TI  - Assessing transfluthrin mortality against Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus inside and outside US military tents in a northern Florida environment.
T2  - Current research in parasitology & vector-borne diseases
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Mortality caused by passive resin transfluthrin diffusers (5mg AI per 24h release rate) suspended in small 2-person tents was measured for colony-reared sentinel pyrethroid susceptible Aedes aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus female mosquitoes, as well as a pyrethroid-resistant strain of Aedes aegypti, in a USA military field camp scenario. Mortality effects were investigated for impact by factors such as sentinel cage location (inside tent, tent doorway and outside tent), exposure time (15, 30, 45 and 60min), and environmental temperature (°C), all of which were examined over an 8-week period. Analyses determined there was a significant interaction between mosquito strain and transfluthrin susceptibility, with the two susceptible strains experiencing significantly greater mean mortality than the resistant Ae. aegypti strain. Significant differences were likewise observed between the mosquito strains over the 8-week study period, where study week and temperature were both positively correlated with an increase in observed mean mosquito mortality. Mosquito proximity to the transfluthrin diffusers was also influenced by week and showed that sentinel cage placement in the environment demonstrates different mortality measurements, depending on the environmental conditions. The length of exposure to transfluthrin, however, was determined to not significantly impact transfluthrin efficacy on the examined mosquito strains, although increased exposure did result in increased susceptible strain mortality. These results suggest that transfluthrin is highly effective in causing mortality against susceptible Ae. aegypti and Cx. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes under field conditions but is minimally effective against pyrethroid-resistant Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. Transfluthrin-infused devices are influenced by environmental factors that can combine to impact mosquito mortality in the field.

TI  - After neoadjuvant therapy, axillary sentinel lymph node frozen sections from breast cancer patients are accurately diagnosed using telepathology.
T2  - Journal of pathology informatics
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Context: Telepathology is a digital, microscope-independent method of diagnosing pathology from scanned slides. Frozen sections (FS) can be performed and read by a pathologist at any site. At our institution, telepathology is used for diagnosis of frozen sections of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in patients who have undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy and are enrolled in a clinical trial.Objective: We investigated the accuracy of diagnosing SLN frozen sections in the neoadjuvant setting using telepathology.Design: SLN were entirely submitted for frozen section. A pathology assistant prepared the frozen and scanned the slides using VisionTek M6 digital microscope ecosystem (East Dundee, IL). Cases were interpreted by trained, board-certified pathologists. All frozen sections remnants were submitted for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded permanent sections. Frozen section diagnoses using telepathology were compared to final pathology. Turn-around time from specimen collection to frozen section diagnosis was recorded.Results: 54 SLN from 22 breast neoadjuvant cases were diagnosed via telepathology from March 2017 to July 2019. 95% of SLNs interpreted as negative on frozen section and on permanents. A definitive diagnosis could not be rendered on six SLNs; diagnosed "atypical" at frozen. Sensitivity and specificity were 80% and 100% respectively with accuracy of 95.8%. The false-negative rate was 5%. There were no false positives. The average turn-around time was over an hour.Conclusions: Telepathology is an accurate method of diagnosing SLN frozen sections in the neoadjuvant setting, but lobular carcinomas and treatment effect pose diagnostic challenges and the time to report results is increased compared to standard microscopy.

AB  - Coherent Change Detection (CCD) is applied to exact repeat passes of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images to identify subtle changes in targets and surfaces. When farmers till their fields, the soil is disturbed and this disturbance can be detected and sometimes measured by SARs. CCD is being investigated as a technique to detect tillage in the Canadian Lake Erie Basin. In this study C-band data from 12 passes of the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) are processed and compared to field observations. RCM CCD pairs are helpful to distinguish when change happens (due to harvest, tillage and chemical termination of crops). However other scattering parameters, such as volume scattering from the m-chi decomposition, will likely be required to separate harvest from tillage events.

AB  - The reliability of European Remote Sensing 5 (ERA5) satellite-based air temperature data is under investigation in this letter. To evaluate this, the ERA5 data will be compared with land-based data obtained from weather stations on the global historical climatology network (GHCN). Two climate regions are taken into consideration, temperate and tropical. Five years worth of data is collected and compared through box plots, regression models, and statistical metrics. The results show that the satellite temperature performs better in the temperate region than the tropical region. This suggests that the time of year and climate region have an impact on the accuracy of the satellite data as milder temperatures produce better approximations.

CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - The introduction of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) through the Oceans and Coasts Monitoring Information system (OCIMS) has therefore become a critical tool for operational coastal and ocean monitoring in South Africa. Natural/man-made ocean phenomena can be observed using satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) techniques, making it an integral part of large ocean area monitoring for maritime domain awareness. SAR is an active instrument on-board a satellite platform that transmits electromagnetic waves and measures the returning signal to infer what is happening on the ocean surface. The objective of this paper was to provide information and present options to the decision-makers around sustainability of commercial SAR data acquisition in support of OCIMS IVT. The OCIMS IVT tool identifies ships from multiple types of SAR data, which can provide locations of vessels that have switched off their AIS and oil slicks caused by vessels. Although open-data offerings, such as Sentinel-1, can be considered alternatives to commercial sensors, they present severe limitations for an operational service. To meet OCIMS requirements, and address the imperative to reduce costs, a hybrid of commercial acquisition being used in conjunction with an open data source such as Sentinel-1 is recommended. This would ensure that an operational service with the desired latency as well as increasing the revisit time over the EEZ.

TI  - Feature Selection and Classification of Oil Spill From Vessels Using Sentinel-1 Wide-Swath Synthetic Aperture Radar Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills are often caused by vessels when dumping oily bilge wastewater at sea (also referred to as bilge dumping). In an synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image, oil spills dampen the radar energy return and appear as linearly shaped dark regions. However, naturally occurring phenomena (e.g., natural seepage) known as oil spill look-alikes can also dampen energy return and occur more often compared to a real oil spill. The primary goal of the study is to develop a monitoring system dedicated to automatically detect oil spill events caused by ships (bilge dumping) in African Oceans. To achieve this goal, the knowledge of features that has a high probability of separating oil spills from look-alikes is of great importance. The study aimed to accomplish three things, 1) to improve the lack of oil spill studies in Africa; 2) to determine the critical features that yield the highest discrimination accuracy of oil spills caused by moving vessels from look-alikes; and 3) to use these features to automatically detect and classify oil spill events. The study investigated the most common features used in literature for discriminating oil spills from look-alikes from SAR imagery. Multiple feature selection methods and the gradient boosting decision tree (GBT) classifier were used to select, classify, and determine the significant features for discriminating oil spills caused by moving vessels. The results showed that while some features vary, there are features that consistently have high and low significance across all methods.

TI  - Locality of Topographic Ground Truth Data for Salt Marsh Lidar DEM Elevation Bias Mitigation
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lidar-derived digital elevation models (DEMs) are crucial for modeling salt marsh evolution, forecasting inundation depth, frequency, and duration, and simulating sea level rise. Advances in lidar acquisition and data processing techniques have led to increased accuracy; however, in densely vegetated coastal salt marsh areas, lidar-derived DEMs are generally unreliable without adjustment. In this article, we investigate the need for local topographic ground truth data to train random forest (RF) DEM adjustment models for two similar northern Gulf of Mexico salt marshes. Two RTK-GNSS field surveys were conducted to acquire ground truth topographic elevations near St. Marks, Florida, USA (n = 377) and Pascagoula, MS, USA (n = 610). These elevations, along with Sentinel-2A MSI reflectance values and lidar DEM elevations, were used to validate and train local and combined RF salt marsh DEM adjustment models. The local RF models achieved mean absolute error values of 0.054 m and 0.045 m in the leave-one-out cross-validation for St. Marks and Pascagoula, respectively. Elevation bias predictions using remote RF models were far worse and those using the combined RF model were marginally worse. Using the local RF predictions to mitigate the bias in the lidar DEMs improved their accuracy by 69.1% for St. Marks and 90.9% for Pascagoula. The DEM elevation was identified as the most important predictor. This evidence suggests that local ground truth data are necessary for mitigating bias in salt marsh lidar DEMs although it remains to be seen if increasing the data set size and incorporating additional hydrologic predictor variables could narrow the accuracy gap.

AB  - In this article, the High Pass Filter-HPF, and Wavelet A trous transforms are developed mathematically, to later implement them in Matlab. The fusion of satellite images is performed with each one of the implemented transforms, with a proposed methodology. A Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS image (Panchromatic - PAN and multispectral - MULTI) of a northwestern sector of Peru -where sugar cane crops are evident-is used to generate two fused images, namely: MULTIHPF and MULTITWA. The fused images were evaluated both in spatial and spectral quality through four indices, specifically: correlation index, ERGAS, RASE and Q index, in order to determine the efficiency of the proposed methods. Best results of the spectral evaluation were obtained with the MULTITWA image, achieving correlations higher than 0.95, a Q index of 0.96 and a RASE value of 9.2%, while spatially higher values than 0.96. Regarding spatial richness, the best results were obtained with MULTIHPF with an ERGAS of 14.6, a RASE of 29.3% and a Q of 0.7.

AB  - This paper is an attempt to approach the Covid 19 pandemic from the vantage point of the Sufi tradition which is the spiritual dimension of Islam. Based on the guidance of the Qur'an and the Prophetic examples, Sufis have contributed to the Islamic spiritual and psychological domains to the extent that their science, Tasawwuf, itself was termed by them Psychology, Modified Letter Turned Commailm al-nafs. Utilizing some of the basics of their tradition and employing analytic methodology accompanied by insights from semantics, philosophy, psychology, and history, the paper endeavours to present the Sufi approach to pandemics in simple language. The aim is to draw attention to this usually ignored approach in the context of this pandemic and to highlight some of what, I believe to be useful means of solace for the modern man who is caught between the rim and axis of this affliction. It also can provide him with some necessary inspiration as to how to free himself from depression and be optimistic, especially in times of pandemics and afflictions. The paper also seeks to remind the reader of the importance of the worldview one holds in any discussion related to human life and cosmic events.

TI  - Epistemological Expansion through Christian Allegory in Apocalyptic Science Fiction: Greg Bear’s Darwin’s Radio and Darwin’s Children
T2  - The Journal of English Language and Literature
T2  - 영어영문학
M3  - research-article
AB  - In Greg Bear’s Darwin series, which portrays the eschatological crisis caused by a virus named SHEVA, Christian allegory works as a mythical source that provides natural thematic coherence on one side and as a counter-narrative against which a new worldview makes sense on the other. Using the fragmentariness and incoherency of allegory, Bear juxtaposes dialectical images of the divine/the secular, the human/the non-human, and good/evil, thus blurring essentialist conceptions and promoting readers’ epistemological transformation. Appropriating the framework of Christian apocalypticism, wherein salvation and eschatology are embodied and vision and reality intermingle, conflicts become synthesized in terms of the interaction of Shevites and humans. Evoking the possibility of the redemption of the human world, creating a counter-discourse to human conflict and disgust, the posthuman existence of Shevites, a new species of humanity, represents the blurred distinction between nature and culture in addition to that of human and nonhuman; this post-humanity breaks with Cartesian dualism and thereby demands a new epistemology which presupposes a network of human and nonhuman and their interrelatedness, negating anthropocentrism. At the ambivalent intersection, the Christian allegory in the Darwin series does not work to convey Christian messages as a Grand Narrative but instead serves as an axis with which to produce an anti-discourse and ultimately to go beyond binarism and essentialism, inviting readers to a new skepticism regarding the conventions they have held. In this way, the pandemic crisis leads to the emergence of new myths supplanting biblical ideologies as well as anthropocentrism and supporting interconnectedness of everything.

AB  - Deep learning-based land cover classifiers learnt from Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) are known to reach high performances. In order to explain, at least partly, the rationale leading to each one of their decisions, attention-based architectures have been proposed to automatically weight the importance of predefined data components in the classification process. Though generated for each decision separately, the informational content conveyed by such explanations can remain insufficient to end-users because of the complex nature of SITS. Moreover, getting a general perspective about the way a classifier works requires merging all explanations for each class and relating them to its mode of operation, which is not always straightforward. A preliminary and complementary approach for automatically identifying the data features detected by a pixel-wise deep spatiotemporal land cover classifier and explaining its behavior at the class level is therefore proposed in this paper. Classified pixels are first described using interpretable features coming under the form of data mining patterns. A redescription mining technique is then employed to automatically select, for each class, the features matching the different activation level configurations of the layer that is assumed to capture the aforementioned patterns. Experiments based on a Sentinel-2 time series and a deep spatiotemporal neural network implementing a channel-separated processing as well as a channel-based attention mechanism show the interest of such a combined approach.

TI  - Citizen participation and the production of situated knowledge about pollution. Review on two experiments in the biomonitoring of pollution by the Ecocitizen's Institute in Fos (France)
T2  - REVUE D ANTHROPOLOGIE DES CONNAISSANCES
M3  - Review
AB  - This article is based on a description of the functioning of the Ecocitizen Institute for the Knowledge of Pollution (IECP in French). The aim of this atypical organisation in the French research landscape is to produce, together with the local authorities and residents of the Fos industrial port area, the data on environmental pollution and health that are lacking to inform the public debate. We review two participatory biomonitoring experiments conducted by the IECP: lichen monitoring for air quality assessment and the use of conger eels as a sentinel species for marine environmental quality. Our research argues that situated knowledge, based on different levels of collaboration between scientists and lay people, can contribute to improving the governance of technological risks, not only because it generates new socio-ecosystemic links, but also because it provokes a cosmopolitical shift towards care and precaution. We conclude with the emergence of situated sciences that transform the very way of considering scientific practices when they become sensitive to the common conditions of habitability of the living.

TI  - Humanizing Industry 4.0: Some Criteria Drawn from Catholic Social Teaching
T2  - BUSINESS & PROFESSIONAL ETHICS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Industry 4.0, which is at the core of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, posits the challenge of humanizing it. Drawing upon Catholic Social Teaching (CST), this article offers a set of ethical and spiritual criteria for such humanization. The starting point is a positive attitude of CST toward technology, admiring it not only for its usefulness, but also as an expression of human creativity, ingenuity, and beauty. This entails a transcendent sense leading to praise the Creator. At the same time, CST warns that technology involves the risk of fostering a techno-centered worldview and calls for a humanistic-centered worldview. Other ethical criteria regard conducting technological developments with ethical guidelines, minimizing inside effects of technological implementations, managing technology for the com-mon good, and introducing technology into the production process in respect of human dignity and favoring human flourishing.

TI  - "A Candle is Burning in my Boat...": The Image of the River in the "The Travel Notes" of Archbishop Nil (N. F. Isakovich)
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to studying the travel prose of the Orthodox clergy in the 19th century as a phenomenon of the Siberian regional literature and one of the classical versions of the "Siberian text." The boundaries of the "Siberian text" in Russian literature are defined by the characteristics of regional identity, which is reflected in this text and is shaped by the Siberian geographical space. The hypothesis of the importance of the river image - as the most obvious space-time coordinate - in Siberian literature is put forward. The specifics of the representation of this image in the works of the clergy are examined on the example of "Travel Notes" by Nil (Isakovich), Archbishop of Irkutsk (1838-1853). The notes recount missionary journey along the Lena and other rivers in its basin in the summer of 1843. Archbishop Nil constructs the image of the river as a multi-faceted model of human interaction with space - in the context of a Christian worldview, as well as personal and cultural memory. 'This model is revealed in historical, emotional-psychological, mythopoetic and ontological terms in relation to the categories of chaos and cosmos, border and transition, existential solitude and spiritual transformation. The author's intention is aimed at overcoming the prehistoric pagan essence of the river in the traveler's mind through its aestheticization, conceptualization and sacralization as a space of meeting with the Creator. This correlates with the genre strategy of the Christian pilgrimage. The image of the river recreates a dynamic image of all of Siberia - ancient, steeped in primeval chaos, pagan and mythological in its essence, but open to Christian transfiguration and rebirth. The significance of Archbishop Nil's travel notes, and clergy travelogues in general, in the history of Russian literature is determined by the fact that the Siberian space is reflected in their writings in its spiritual dimension. This approach, in turn, makes it possible to present the process of Siberian exploration in its ontological and axiological essence - as an incorporation into the Russian national consciousness, Christian in its basis.

TI  - Mapping drainage ditches in agricultural landscapes using LiDAR data
T2  - Agronomy Research
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to develop a method for identification of the drainage ditch network, which can be used for surface runoff modeling and to increase accuracy of estimation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in croplands and grasslands, using remote sensing data. The study area consists of 11 objects throughout Latvia with a total area of 145 km2. Digital elevation models (DEMs) in two resolutions, which were created using three different interpolation methods, were used for the analysis. Several multi-level data filtering methods were applied to identify ditch network, including flow patterns, which can be used in surface runoff process. The method we developed correctly identified 85-89% of ditches, depending on the DEM used, in comparison to the reference data. Mapped ditches are located within 3 m range of the reference data in 89-93% of cases. The elaborated model is robust and uses openly available source data and can be used for large scale ditch mapping with sufficient accuracy necessary for hydrological modelling and GHG accounting in the national inventories.

TI  - Revising Anthropocentrism of Technics in the Light of the 21st Century New Anthropological Models
T2  - ANTHROPOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS OF PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose. To substantiate the definition of technics as the attributive characteristics of a human being and the necessity of its orientation towards human flourishing in the context of new anthropological models of the 21st century. Theoretical basis. Correlation between technics, technology and the human essence is examined. The role of technics is traced at different historical stages of human development. Negative and positive effects of digital technology development upon a contemporary human being is analysed in the light of new anthropological models: homo technologicus, homo digitalis and homo eudaimonicus. The content of a new worldview-value paradigm of defining goals of technology is outlined. Originality. Transformation of the role of technics correlates with value and worldview shifts in person's understanding of his/her purpose in both natural and social worlds. Nowadays, philosophical analysis of anthropological dimension of technics and technology opens a horizon for seeking effective solutions in the face of the contemporary challenges and anti-utopian threats by means of focusing on the fact that, indeed, technological development is subordinate to the humanist goal that is flourishing, wellbeing and comprehensive development of a human being. Conclusions. The essence of technology reveals not through its functional but anthropogenic definitions in a sense of a source of institutionalization and in a sense of a source of realization of a human way of self-identification and self-objectification of human subjectivity. Technics/technology is the attributive characteristics of human essence and being: a human being is as much human as much he/she is a creator of technics. The purpose of technics is not to master the nature and to transform the world; technics is, above all, a tool of human self-improvement and self-creation through broadening the horizon of human capacities. The analysis of new modern anthropological models shows that it is the orientation of technology/technology towards human flourishing that is, on the one hand, a response to the existential demands of modern man, and on the other hand, a way of preventing future threats related to technological development.

AB  - This paper examines in situ water quality data measured during 2020-2021 in the Chesapeake Bay for comparison with optical satellite data. This collection was performed as part of a NASA project aiming to develop new methods for water quality monitoring from satellite remote sensing using artificial intelligence. Our objective is to use in situ data as ground-truth to provide water quality classifications, or labels, to their overlapping (in time and location) satellite imagery. Having such labeled data, can help us achieve our project's longer-term goal: to train artificial intelligence models to recognize features in spectral information for monitoring water quality from satellites. Because routine monitoring by state agencies is conducted at discrete locations, we obtained a flow-through system operated from small boats to measure water quality parameters along transects for comparison with two-dimensional maps collected from space, with an initial focus on low oxygen events, due to their large spatial extent and regular occurrence each summer. We also evaluated similar in situ data collected during 1984-2021 by the Chesapeake Program.

TI  - Development of a Deep Learning-Based Atmospheric Correction Algorithm for Oligotrophic Oceans
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the 5% mission goal for National Aeronautics and Space Administrations (NASA's) standard atmospheric correction (AC) algorithm (i.e., the near-infrared (NIR) algorithm) for oligotrophic oceans has been met, this algorithm applies only to blue bands and is highly sensitive to contamination from cloud straylight and sunglint. Here, we developed an AC algorithm for clear waters based on deep learning (namely, DLAC). The algorithm was trained using 3.6 million pairs of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua high-quality Rrs from the NIR algorithm and Rayleigh-corrected reflectances selected across the global oceans and from all seasons. Validations using in situ data and a chlorophyll (Chl) constraint-based approach showed that the uncertainties in the Rrs retrievals for DLAC are lower than those for the NIR algorithm, especially for the green and red bands. More importantly, the DLAC algorithm is more tolerant to cloud adjacency effects and moderate sunglint. As a result, the number of valid observations increased by similar to 50%, and the coverage of monthly global Level-3 Rrs composites increased by up to 20%. More spatially and temporally consistent patterns were also found for the Level-3 Rrs and Chl products, and large changes in their magnitudes (up to 20% for Rrs and 30% for Chl) were detected in some oceanic regions. With these improvements in the quality and quantity of data, our DLAC algorithm may be valuable as another option for processing global data.

TI  - Snowmelt retrieval algorithm for the Antarctic Peninsula using SAR imageries
T2  - ANAIS DA ACADEMIA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIAS
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images by knowledge-based algorithms with elevation and backscatter thresholds were used in several studies to detect the Wet Snow Radar Zone (WSZ) in the Antarctic Peninsula. To identify it more accurately based on its seasonal variations, this study proposed the additional use of a threshold in synthetic images, created by rationing summer and winter sigma linear images. In our algorithm we used the following thresholds to detect the WSZ in Envisat ASAR imageries, using the Radarsat Antarctic Map Digital Elevation Model as ancillary data: i) -25 dB < s(0) < -14 dB; ii) s(linear) summer / s(linear) winter < 0.4; iii) elevation H < 1,200 m for northern tip and H < 800 m for southern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The classified images were post-processed by a focal majority 5 x 5 filter and superimposed by an image of rock outcrops derived from the Antarctic Digital Database. The ratio image threshold allowed discriminating the WSZ from the Dry Snow Radar Zone and radar shadows, as well as transitional areas between this glacier zone and the Frozen Percolation Radar Zone, which would be classified incorrectly if we used only elevation and backscatter thresholds.

AB  - Typhoon Rai has recently affected central and southern parts of the Philippines. Based on the valuation of the country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC), it is estimated that the typhoon has damaged 1,700 buildings, 2 million houses, and 10 million hectares of agricultural land in the affected locations. Given the effects of the typhoon, in terms of the extent of the area where it has caused destruction, the tremendous economic losses due to its incurred damages, and to the number of people affected by it, it became necessary to create rapid damage assessment maps that could provide the needed geospatial information to emergency responders so they can prioritize areas of most concern. In this effort, Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery was used due to the data's temporal resolution (i.e., pre- and post-disaster images are available), relative independence from atmospheric conditions (i.e., unaffected by cloud cover), and open-access availability (i.e., data can be readily downloaded after the typhoon). Complex coherence correlation from stacks of pre- and post-disaster SAR images were analyzed for change detection in order to create the rapid damage assessment maps. In order to validate the results, ancillary data (i.e., aerial photos, local reports, and UNITAR / UNOSAT damage tags and maps) were used to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the maps. Upon analysis, we found that there is good correspondence between the SAR-derived maps and the aerial photos/UNITAR maps and that the damage tags by UNITAR / UNOSAT would match the rapid damage assessment maps to up to 93% if the correlation threshold is set to 0.5 and if the damage classification is set to just two levels (i.e., "damaged" and "not damaged"). It is deemed that the resulting maps of this research will be useful in the on-going efforts to rehabilitate the affected areas of Typhoo Rai. Future work includes further ground validation efforts and use of other datasets and methods in deriving the rapid damage assessment maps.

Theoretical predictions are contrasted with actual measurements acquired - over the same oil-covered area and under the same met-ocean conditions - by the X-band TerraSAR-X (TSX) and Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions.Experimental results show that the AIEM provides a fairly good agreement with both TSX and CSK actual measurements for both oil-free and oil-covered sea surfaces.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal-Spectral Collaborative Learning for Spatio-Temporal Fusion with Land Cover Changes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal fusion by combining the complementary spatial and temporal advantages of multisource remote-sensing images to obtain time-series high spatial resolution images is highly desirable in monitoring surface dynamics. Currently, deep learning (DL)-based fusion methods have received extensive attention. However, existing DL-based spatio-temporal fusion methods are generally limited in fusing the images with land cover changes. In this article, we propose a spatio-temporal-spectral collaborative learning framework for spatio-temporal fusion to alleviate this problem. Specifically, the proposed method integrates the convolutional neural network and recurrent neural network into a unified framework, consisting of three subnetworks: the multiscale Siamese convolutional neural network (MSCNN), the multilayer convolutional recurrent neural network, and the adaptive weighting fusion network (AWFNet). The MSCNN has a flexible weight-sharing network to extract multiscale spatial-spectral features from multisource remote-sensing images. The multilayer convolutional recurrent neural network is constructed on the convolutional long short-term memory units to comprehensively learn the land cover changes by spatial, spectral, and temporal joint features. The AWFNet with a spatio-temporal-spectral change (STSC) loss is proposed to further improve the interpretability and robustness. The experiments were performed on the publicly available benchmark datasets featured phenology and land cover type changes, respectively. The experimental results demonstrated the competitive performance of the proposed method than other state-of-the-art fusion methods.

TI  - Vision Transformer for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a fundamental and hot-spot research topic in remote sensing image fusion. In recent years, self-attention-based transformer has attracted considerable attention in natural language processing (NLP) and introduced to attend to computer vision (CV) tasks. Inspired by great success of the vision transformer (ViT) in image classification, we propose an improved and advanced purely transformer-based model for pansharpening. In the proposed method, stacked multispectral (MS) and panchromatic (PAN) images are cropped into patches (i.e., tokens), and after a three-layer self-attention-based encoder, these tokens contain rich information. After upsampled and stitched, a high spatial resolution (HR) MS image is finally obtained. Instead of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) pursuing a short-distance dependency, our proposed method aims to build up a long-distance dependency, to make full use of more useful features. The experiments were conducted on an opening benchmark dataset, including IKONOS with four-band MS/PAN images and WorldView-2 MS images featured by eight bands. In addition, the experiments were performed on reduced and full-resolution datasets from both qualitative and quantitative evaluation aspects. The experimental results indicate the competitive performance of the proposed model than other pansharpening methods, including the state-of-the-art pansharpening algorithms based on CNN.

We use ground radiosounding profiles collected from 163 radiosonde observations to provide insights on how well the ERA5 reanalysis product performs in the atmospheric correction of Landsat series TIR data. Despite the poor performance of the ERA5 product for estimating atmospheric upward radiance, downward radiance, and transmittance of Landsat series TIR data in the Americas and Africa, the performance of the ERA5 product was superior to that of the M2I6NPANA (inst6_3d_ana_Np) dataset (MERRA2) and (Final) Operational Global Analysis data (FNL) products in Asia and Europe. The vertical distribution of air temperature and relative humidity profiles may explain the poor performance of ERA5 in the Americas and Africa. This letter shows the advantages and weaknesses of the ERA5 reanalysis product in the atmospheric correction of Landsat series TIR data and will benefit research fields that require an atmospheric profile as input.

TI  - Accuracy Evaluation of the Landsat 9 Land Surface Temperature Product
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Having a good knowledge of the uncertainty in the land surface temperature (LST) product will help to encourage its use in a wide number of applications, including urban heat islands, geothermal detection, and surface energy balance. Landsat 9 was launched on 27 September 2021 and provides an LST product, which is generated by the radiative transfer equation algorithm and has a spatial resolution of 30 m. In this article, we evaluated the performance of the Landsat 9 LST product by using a temperature-based (T-based) method and cross-validation. The T-based validation results showed that the average bias at the surface radiation budget network and baseline surface radiation network sites was 0.24 K and that the corresponding root mean square error (RMSE) was 3.42 K. The Landsat 9 LST product was in good agreement with the Landsat 7/8 LSTs, with an average bias of 0.25/0.08 K, an RMSE of 0.51/1.04 K, and a mean absolute error of 0.38/0.64 K. The comparable performance of the Landsat 7/8/9 LST products can be explained by the consistent LST retrieval algorithm. The absolute differences in the LST between Landsat 9 LST and MOD11 (MOD21) LST images were between 0.01 (0.65) and 2.50 K (1.76 K), whereas the RMSE values were between 1.40 (1.80) and 3.65 K (3.26 K). The specific heat capacity and thermal inertia of the different land surface covers can explain the significant biases. The above evaluation results are consistent with the initial performance testing of thermal infrared sensor-2 (TIRS-2) by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey. Although the released Landsat 9 LST product showed good performance in the preliminary evaluation, the split-window algorithm may be a better option for Landsat 9 LST retrieval, as the TIRS-2 data addressed stray light incursion. Since there are no official validation results that have been published, this article provides a third-party performance evaluation of the Landsat 9 LST product and will benefit research fields that require Landsat series LST products.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - Reducing speckle and limiting the variations of the physical parameters in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images is often a key-step to fully exploit the potential of such data. Nowadays, deep learning approaches produce state of the art results in single-image SAR restoration. Nevertheless, huge multi-temporal stacks are now often available and could be efficiently exploited to further improve image quality. This paper explores two fast strategies employing a single-image despeckling algorithm, namely SAR2SAR [1], in a multi-temporal framework. The first one is based on Quegan filter [2] and replaces the local reflectivity pre-estimation by SAR2SAR. The second one uses SAR2SAR to suppress speckle from a ratio image encoding the multi-temporal information under the form of a "super-image", i.e. the temporal arithmetic mean of a time series. Experimental results on Sentinel-1 GRD data show that these two multi-temporal strategies provide improved filtering results while adding a limited computational cost.

TI  - Soil Salinity Classification Using Machine Learning Algorithms and Radar Data in the Case from the South of Kazakhstan
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinity is one of the major impact factors on agriculture in the South of Kazakhstan. Prediction and estimation of soil salinity before planting a season usually helps to plan for the leaching of the salt. In the paper, satellite data such as radar data and machine learning algorithms, were used to classify soil salinity. Numerical results were presented for the Turkestan region, which contains more than 102 points. The machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian Process, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were compared. The evaluation of the model score was realized by using metrics, such as accuracy, Recall, and f1. In addition, the influence of the dataset features on the classification was investigated using machine learning algorithms. The research results showed that the Gaussian Process model has the best score among considered algorithms. In addition, the results are consistent with the outcome of the Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) framework.

TI  - Behavioral and Physiologic Effects of Dirty Bedding Exposure in Female ICR Mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR LABORATORY ANIMAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure of sentinel mice to dirty bedding is commonly used in health monitoring programs to screen colonies for clinical and subclinical disease. Despite the potential stressors present in dirty bedding, including but not limited to microorganisms, pheromones, and ammonia, it is unknown whether sentinel mice exposed to soiled bedding experience stress. In this study, select behavioral and physiologic changes associated with stress were assessed in female ICR mice exposed to dirty bedding. Behavioral parameters included evaluation in the home cage and selected behavioral tests; physiologic measurements included neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio and weight. Mice in the acute group were exposed for 24 h whereas mice in the chronic group were exposed for 4 wk. Mice in the chronic group exposed to dirty bedding weighed less at days 21 and 28 than did control mice. Chronic mice exposed to dirty bedding also exhibited decreased net weight gain over the entire study period as compared with control mice. No significant differences were detected in the other behavioral and physiologic parameters measured. These results indicate that dirty bedding exposure may affect sentinel mice, but further investigation is needed to determine the specific mechanism(s) behind the weight difference.

TI  - A 3D CNN APPROACH FOR CHANGE DETECTION IN HR SATELLITE IMAGE TIME SERIES BASED ON A PRETRAINED 2D CNN
T2  - XXIV ISPRS CONGRESS: IMAGING TODAY, FORESEEING TOMORROW, COMMISSION III
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 24th ISPRS Congress on Imaging Today, Foreseeing Tomorrow
CL  - Nice, FRANCE
AB  - Over recent decades, Change Detection (CD) has been intensively investigated due to the availability of High Resolution (HR) multispectral multi-temporal remote sensing images. Deep Learning (DL) based methods such as Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have recently received increasing attention in CD problems demonstrating high potential. However, most of the CNN-based CD methods are designed for bi-temporal image analysis. Here, we propose a Three-Dimensional (3D) CNN-based CD approach that can effectively deal with HR image time series and process spatial-spectral-temporal features. The method is unsupervised and thus does not require the complex task of collecting labelled multi-temporal data. Since there are only a few pretrained 3D CNNs available that are not suitable for remote sensing CD analysis, the proposed approach starts with a pretrained 2D CNN architecture trained on remote sensing images for semantic segmentation and develops a 3D CNN architecture using a transfer learning technique to jointly deal with spatial, spectral and temporal information. A layerwise feature reduction strategy is performed to select the most informative features and a pixelwise year-based Change Vector Analysis (CVA) is employed to identify changed pixels. Experimental results on a long time series of Landsat 8 images for an area located in Saudi Arabia confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

TI  - Thanatological Discourse in Ivan Bunin's Works
T2  - PROBLEMY ISTORICHESKOI POETIKI
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyses the memoir notes of Ivan Bunin and his contemporaries, who knew him closely, which express his attitude to death. Bunin's notes, drafts and diaries are full of his reflections on the subject of finiteness of human life. In conversations with relatives and friends he confessed that he "is obsessed with the death" and that he "is afraid of it." The theme of death is the key issue in many of Ivan Bunin's prosaic and poetic works. In the book " The Life of Arsenyev," which can be considered the writer's autobiography, he mentions the fact that the acceptance of death has made him think about the existence of God and the existential dilemma for the first time. Bunin's fear of death was a kind of a phobia reflected in all his works. The idea of the finiteness of existence is based not only on the perception and feelings of some of Bunin's characters, but also on the fate of entire social classes. This is why Bunin's imagery is characterized by a nostalgic, elegiac tone, the "matte silver" colour (according to M. Gorky). The writer rebels against the inevitability of death the way children do ("I will not give in") and the way writers do by using their works as a line of defense in the struggle over time ("Now you are a thought. You are eternal"). A specific thanatological perception of the world sharpened his attention to Buddhism and to the doctrine of reincarnation. The "law of beauty" for Bunin is based on an eschatological view. That is why he doesn't write about the future and interprets everything related to the ideal, nature and eternity in a Christian way.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article states that the principle of the separation of powers is what determines the independence of courts, including constitutional courts, from the other branches of state power. It is recalled that institutions of constitutional justice base their interpretation of constitutional provisions solely on the constitution. This leads to a general understanding that constitutional law and political science are not only objectively separated but that their distinction leads to (as it is commonly believed) ensuring impartiality when interpreting the constitution. The declarative separation of constitutional law and political science constantly contrasts with reality. Political processes are not only a source of knowledge and understanding of constitutional legal relations and their content. Their implementation of constitutional justice is also an integral part of the general political process of the state. It is demonstrated that the argumentation of particular interpreter is related to legal form to preserve the semblance of judicial independence, his (her) choices are inevitably influenced by individual political worldview. However, this does not deny the general principle that all attempts by political and legal subjects to influence the independence of constitutional justice institutions are intolerable.

AB  - This research seeks to understand the potential for up taking new services and products derived from Sentinel-2 data to assist with existing water and nutrient management challenges from the perspective of a diverse range of stakeholders in key target locations in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) of Australia. Through semi-structured interviews with farmers, irrigation operators and water authorities, we found that key issues hampering uptake and adoption of Sentinel-based products and services are related to: information deluge; difficulties in translating data into decision-making; privacy issues; trust in satellite imagery; interpreting new information, and satellite data resolution and frequency -which for several services can clash with expressed needs for accessing real-time data.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThere is a large variation between Dutch hospitals in the use of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB) in patients with a biopsy diagnosis of Ductal Carcinoma in Situ. The aim of our study was to investigate whether this variation might be explained by preferences of surgeons, organisational factors or the influence of patients preferences.MethodsA cross-sectional web survey was conducted among 260 Dutch oncological/breast surgeons. Preferences of surgeons and the influence of the patients' preferences were determined by means of best-worst scaling (BWS) of profile case scenarios and by ranking risk factors. The survey also explored organisational questions, the reported use of diagnostic techniques and influences on the decision.ResultsThe BWS scenarios were completed by 57 surgeons. The most important reasons for performing SLNB were a suspected invasive component and DCIS grade 3. In the ranking, these were also the first and second most important factor, followed by the size of the lesion and a mass on mammogram. In 58% to 70% of the scenarios, the surgeons would not change their decisions on the use of SLNB if the patient's chose differed. No organisational factor was significantly associated with the reported use of SLNB.ConclusionThe inter-hospital variation in the use of SLNB could not be attributed to organisational factors or surgeons' preferences for risk factors. The risk factors that most surgeons reported as reasons for performing SLNB are consistent with the factors described in Dutch treatment guideline for the use of SLNB.

TI  - Climate warming causes photobiont degradation and C starvation in a boreal climate sentinel lichen
T2  - Zenodo
M3  - Software
AB  - The long-term potential for acclimation by lichens to warming climates is poorly known, despite their prominent roles in forested ecosystems. Although often considered "extremophiles", lichens may not readily acclimate to novel climates well beyond historical norms. In a previous study (Smith et al. 2018), Evernia mesomorpha transplants in a whole-ecosystem climate change experiment showed drastic mass loss after one year of warming. We examined the causes of this warming-induced mass loss by measuring physiological, functional, and reproductive attributes of lichen transplants. Severe loss of mass and physiological function occurred above +2C of warming. Loss of algal symbionts ("bleaching") and turnover in algal community compositions increased with temperature and were the clearest impacts of experimental warming. Enhanced CO 2 had no significant physiological or symbiont composition effects. The functional loss of algal photobionts led to significant loss of mass and specific thallus mass (STM), which in turn reduced water-holding capacity (WHC). Although algal genotypes remained detectable in thalli exposed to higher temperatures, within-thallus photobiont communities shifted in composition towards greater diversity. Analogous to the effects of climate change on corals, the balance of symbiont carbon metabolism in lichens is central to their resilience to changing conditions. Copyright: MIT License Open Access

The functional loss of algal photobionts led to significant loss of mass and specific thallus mass (STM), which in turn reduced water-holding capacity (WHC). Although algal genotypes remained detectable in thalli exposed to higher temperatures, within-thallus photobiont communities shifted in composition towards greater diversity. Analogous to the effects of climate change on corals, the balance of symbiont carbon metabolism in lichens is central to their resilience to changing conditions. Copyright: MIT License Open Access

AB  - The presented paper deals with the issue of selecting a suitable system for monitoring the winter wheat crop in order to determine its condition as a basis for variable applications of nitrogen fertilizers. In a four-year (2017-2020) field experiment, 1400 ha of winter wheat crop were monitored using the ISARIA on-the-go system and remote sensing using Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images. The results of spectral measurements of ISARIA vegetation indices (IRMI, IBI) were statistically compared with the values of selected vegetation indices obtained from Sentinel-2 (EVI, GNDVI, NDMI, NDRE, NDVI and NRERI) in order to determine potential hips. Positive correlations were found between the vegetation indices determined by the ISARIA system and indices obtained by multispectral images from Sentinel-2 satellites. The correlations were medium to strong (r = 0.51-0.89). Therefore, it can be stated that both technologies were able to capture a similar trend in the development of vegetation. Furthermore, the influence of climatic conditions on the vegetation indices was analyzed in individual years of the experiment. The values of vegetation indices show significant differences between the individual years. The results of vegetation indices obtained by the analysis of spectral images from Sentinel-2 satellites varied the most. The values of winter wheat yield varied between the individual years. Yield was the highest in 2017 (7.83 t/ha), while the lowest was recorded in 2020 (6.96 t/ha). There was no statistically significant difference between 2018 (7.27 t/ha) and 2019 (7.44 t/ha).

AB  - Predicting forest fire risks constitutes a significant component of territorial risk management and combat strategies. It plays a major role in resource allocation, in mitigation and recovery efforts as well as in anticipating landscape deterioration around urban areas that create an ecological balance at the territorial scale. The purpose of this study is to develop a smart predictive system of seasonal forest fire risk using a machine learning approach. To achieve this aim, data related to 2,130 forest fire events that occurred between 1997 and 2014 were used. Furthermore, biophysical characteristics over the study area were completely processed and retrieved from in-situ measurements; and from time series of MODIS and Landsat (TM, ETM+ and OLI/TIRS) satellite imagery. These data sources served to represent 5 groups of variables, namely Rainfall, Wind, Evapotranspiration, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) andWater Balance; in total, these variable groupings were structured into 39 elemental variables according to the month of the year. The Random Forests algorithm was used to find the best-fit link between theses predictors and the target variable of seasonal forest fire risk.The trained model exhibited a good predictive ability (83% of accuracy, p-value = 0.013). It showed that precipitations, mainly those of the wintry period, have a strong influence on fire occurrence and seasonal severity in the fire season.Accordingly, the developed model allows to predict seasonal risk according to the winter precipitation and to anticipate forest fire risks at a very early stage as well as their impact on improving socio-ecosystem services and territorial resilience.

TI  - An Improved Lightweight RetinaNet for Ship Detection in SAR Images
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of remote sensing technology has led to a sharp increase in the amount of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements, which put forward higher requirements for remote sensing image processing. As an important application of SAR, fast and accurate ship detection has always been a research hotspot. In this article, an improved lightweight RetinaNet for ship detection in SAR images is proposed. Compared with the standard RetinaNet, the shallow convolutional layers of the backbone are replaced by ghost modules and the number of the deep convolutional layers is reduced. The spatial and channel attention modules are embedded into the model to enhance detectability. K-means clustering algorithm is applied to adjust the initial aspect ratios of the model. The effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated by numerical experiments with SSDD dataset, Gaofen-3 mini dataset, and a large-scale SAR image of Hisea-1 satellite, it is shown that the proposed method can significantly reduce the floating-point operations and the number of parameters without decreasing the detection accuracy and recall ratio. Moreover, the experimental results also show the proposed model's robustness and the ability to detect ship targets in small datasets.

T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Interferometric Imaging Radar Altimeter (InIRA) carried on the Tiangong-2 Space Laboratory can observe three-dimensional sea surface topography over a swath tens of kilometers wide. The InIRA represents a test mission that will provide valuable experience for the design and data processing technology of future wide-swath altimeters. In addition to the tropospheric delay, ionospheric delay, and sea state bias (SSB) that affect traditional altimeters, InIRA was affected by the cross-track error derived from roll error, baseline length error, and interference phase error, which had to be properly corrected. In this letter, range error correction based on correction models and cross-track error correction based on the reference topography data (RTD) method were applied to a 15-day InIRA dataset and evaluated using the Jason-2, Jason-3, Saral/AltiKa, and Sentinel-3A. The results showed that the standard deviation (STD) between corrected InIRA and the combined dataset was 7.96 cm after eliminating the influence of tides and dynamic atmospheric correction (DAC), which was comparable to nadir altimeter measurement accuracy.

TI  - GIS AND SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS FOR THE KNOWLEDGE AND MONITORING OF THE URBAN AREA OF FALERII NOVI AND THE SURROUNDING AREA
T2  - ARCHEOLOGIA E CALCOLATORI
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents some results obtained by the application of remote sensing methodologies in the study and monitoring of the Roman city of Falerii Novi and its surrounding area. This landscape changes quickly and for this reason is suitable for non-invasive investigation, which ensure the regular tilling of the land and allow the monitoring of the conservation of the ancient buried structures. Specifically, the research concerns the experimental application of the recent image processing methodologies on five high-resolution satellite images (one QuickBird-2, two GeoEye-1 and two WorldView-2 acquired between 2003 and 2014). The aim of this processing phase is to enhance spectral, spatial and radiometric properties of the images and so, to facilitate the identification of the archaeological marks related to buried structures. The photointerpretation was necessarily supported by the examination of the bibliographic sources, and was validated, where was possible, by field checks. In general, no significant archaeological marks have emerged in the urban area, but the strategic use of the spectral properties of the images has allowed the identification of the areas with the greatest erosion of the surface soil and those of greatest deposition of the colluvial soil. In the extra-urban area, on the other hand, vegetation marks relating to a probable suburban villa in the immediate territory to the South of the city and to the route of the Via Amerina to the North have been identified.

T2  - EARTH OBSERVING SYSTEMS XXVII
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Conference on Earth Observing Systems XXVII
CL  - San Diego, CA
AB  - The Landsat 9 satellite was launched on September 27, 2021 to continue systematic imaging of the Earth's land surfaces. Together with Landsat 8, it provides coverage of the entire Earth every 8 days. Landsat 9 carries the Operational Land Imager (OLI), which is practically a copy of the Landsat 8 OLI, and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). In this paper we demonstrate the excellent radiometric performance of Landsat 9 OLI over its first several months of operations on orbit. On-board calibrator data were used to assess the sensor's radiometric performance characteristics. All spectral bands are radiometrically stable to within 0.1%. The signal-to-noise performance is stable and is 3 to 8% better than Landsat 8. The bias stability is better than 1 DN (Digital Number). The validation of the absolute calibration performed with surface measurements indicated the OLI was calibrated to within 5% in spectral radiance and 3% in reflectance. Still, a comparison between Landsat 9 and Landsat 8 OLI derived top-of-atmosphere reflectance indicated small disagreements between the instruments in all spectral bands, The absolute radiometric calibration of Landsat 9 OLI was adjusted to be in closer agreement with Landsat 8 OLI before products were released to the public.

TI  - Assessing and mapping wind erosion-prone areas in Northeastern Algeria using additive linear model, fuzzy logic, multicriteria, GIS, and remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion is one of the most severe environmental problems in arid, semiarid, and dry sub-humid regions of the planet. This paper aimed to identify areas sensitive to wind erosion in Northeastern Algeria (Wilaya of Tebessa) based on empirical model using analytic hierarchy process, fuzzy analytic hierarchy process approaches, and geomatics-based techniques. Sixteen causative factors were used incorporating meteorological, soil erodibility, physical environment, and anthropogenic impacts as main available inputs in this approach. Weighted linear combination algorithm was adopted to combine all standardized raster layers. Area under curve value equal to 0.96 indicates an excellent accuracy for the proposed approach. Globally, wind erosion risk increases gradually from the North to South of the whole area. Besides, it was found that areas with slight, moderate, high, and very high risk covered 9.65%, 25.83%, 24.30%, and 40.22% of the total area, respectively. Our results highlighted the potential of additive linear model and free available medium resolution multi-source remote sensing data in studying natural hazards and disasters mainly under data-scarce or areas of difficult access in developing countries. In addition, restoration and re-vegetation activities of sensitive areas at high risk of wind erosion represent a challenge for researchers and decision-makers.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to compare the literary time-space of “Kangho-sasiga” and “Jeonwon-sasiga” using a “micro-chronotope” presented by Joy Ladin, who embodied Bakhtin’s chronotope as an analysis tool, and to derive educational implications for “Kangho-sijo” and "Jeonga-sijo." A "micro-chronotope" generated by centrifugal chronotopic energy from language units smaller than sentences helps analyze lyric poetry; it is relatively shorter than narrative prose. "Micro-chronotopes" are synthesized into literary time-space by centripetal syntactic energy, and it is related to the worldview of the text. “Kangho-sasiga” and “Jeonwon-sasiga” share a common feature in adopting the “sasiga” genre, which pursues human-nature unity and eternity. However, their “micro-chronotopes” exhibited contrasting patterns. While “Kangho-sasiga” revealed an optimistic and ideological time-space in harmony with the generic pursuit, “Jeonwon-sasiga” depicts a more realistic time-space disclosing the discordance between nature and humans, which conflicts with it. In addition, the last two poems of “Jeonwon-sasiga” emphasize the problem of death and maximize preceding discordance. This analysis suggests that reading poetry at the microscopic level can spontaneously lead learners to understand the worldview reflected in the works.

AB  - Developing a remote sensing-based monitoring system for detecting marine plastics requires a thorough investigation of their discrimination possibilities from other floating objects. To this end, this study aims to explore the ability to discriminate marine debris from other floating materials and sea features using high-resolution multispectral satellite data. To perform our analysis, we utilized the open-access Marine Debris Archive (MARIDA), which contains several marine classes on Sentinel-2 (S2) data and benchmarks machine learning frameworks. In particular, we investigated well-established spectral indices, GrayLevel Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), Local Binary Pattern (LBP) texture and other spatial features at multiple scales. A Random Forest (RF) classifier was also applied for the classification procedure, and the spectral and spatial features which contributed the most were underlined. The quantitative and qualitative assessment indicated that the spectral information alone is insufficient to distinguish marine plastic from other floating materials which exhibit similar spectral behavior, such as vessels. However, a strong potential even for challenging discrimination tasks is presented when combined with spatial information. By further evaluating our results qualitatively, significant insights are gained, and specific combinations are proposed for challenging floating materials discrimination.

AB  - We employ a previously developed statistical method to evaluate the performance of the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) global ocean color data relying on the temporal stability of the retrievals. We analyze the normalized water-leaving reflectance rho(wN)(lambda) spectra generated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Multi-Sensor Level-1 to Level-2 (MSL12) ocean color data processing system from the OLCI measurements and the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT)-Instrument Processing Facility for OLCI Level-2 (IPF-OL-2) OLCI reflectance rho wN(lambda) spectra. The deviations in rho wN(lambda) spectra from temporally and spatially averaged baseline data are statistically evaluated corresponding to various parameters, including the solar-sensor geometry, various ancillary data (i.e., surface wind speed, sea-level atmospheric pressure, water vapor amount, and ozone concentration), and other related parameters. Our results show that, under most conditions, both NOAA-MSL12 and EUMETSAT-IPF-OL-2 data processing systems produce statistically consistent ocean color products in the open ocean with respect to all corresponding parameters analyzed but with some underestimates of rho wN(lambda) spectra by EUMETSAT retrievals in moderate sun glint conditions being the notable exception.

AB  - An overview of new approaches to the intellectualization of the use of Earth remote sensing (ERS) is presented. The paper shows that such approaches can be implemented only when solving control problems in precision farming systems. Two groups of tasks are considered - organizational management, in which control decisions are made by farm management, and technological control tasks, implemented by robotic machines. When solving both types of problems, remote sensing data are used as a means of system-wide feedback. This feedback is implemented in the form of algorithms for evaluating non-quantitative indicators and parameters of the state of crops and the soil environment. To implement such algorithms, mathematical models of the estimated parameters themselves and models of their connection with remote sensing data are needed. In this case, the models of the parameters of the state of crops and the soil environment are the basis for the construction of control algorithms in real time. The purpose of this work is to present the above approaches as far as the volume of one article allows.

TI  - CATEGORIES OF SPACE AND TIME IN THE CHRISTIAN SUPERTEXT OF THE EXPLANATORY DICTIONARY
T2  - IZVESTIYA URALSKOGO FEDERALNOGO UNIVERSITETA-SERIYA 2-GUMANITARNYE NAUKI
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines religious terminology (religious vocabulary recorded in explanatory dictionaries of the Russian literary language) from the standpoint of the categorial-textual approach. The methodological basis of the research proceeds from the fact that religionyms as a system-structural integrity form a special kind of supertext in the explanatory dictionary, which is organised by universal text categories based on their thematic unity.The article analyses the textual categories of space and time which structure the supertext. The study aims to identify the specificity of categories, which are peculiar to the Christian worldview and are reflected in the explanatory dictionary. The study mostly employs the categorial-textual analysis method and techniques of the component and contextual analysis methods. The most important conclusions drawn are that the spatial category of the supertext of religionyms includes objective and conceptual spaces. Objective space is based on the hierarchical dichotomy of "the earthly" and "the heavenly". Earthly space is structured as a field where the core is the temple, the prototypical place, the nearest periphery is the place in the temple and near the temple, while the far periphery is the territory united by Christianity. Heavenly space is a linear vertical structure with the poles in the form of heaven and hell. Conceptual space can be represented as an "inverted cone" where the concrete turns into the abstract and opens into general cultural space. The Chronos of religious discourse represents the dichotomy "the temporal" vs "the eternal". The category of temporality in the supertext of religious names is represented by objective time existing both in profane and sacred manifestations. The general conclusion is that the types of space and time in the Christian explanatory dictionary supertext do not contradict the chronotope of religious texts. The study refers to examples from the following explanatory dictionaries: The Dictionary of the Russian Language by S. I. Ozhegov (1953); The Explanatory Dictionary of the Russian Language by S. I. Ozhegov and N. Yu. Shvedova (1994); and The Dictionary of the Russian Language edited by A. P. Evgenyeva (1985 1988).

AB  - This release primarily addresses an issue identified in https://github.com/singularity-energy/open-grid-emissions/issues/271, in which our data pipeline was dropping a substantial amount of data due to mismatches in the reported energy source codes used in EIA-860 and EIA-923, and our failure to validate the outputs of the allocation process more carefully. While fixing this issue, we also came across several other issues that were causing anomalous emission factor outputs. Summary of changes Previously, some generation and fuel data reported in EIA Form 923 was being dropped from OGE due to inconsistent energy source codes being used for certain plants between the EIA-923 input data and EIA-860 input data. This was resulting in incorrect emissions and generation totals for certain plants, as well as incorrect primary fuel categories being assigned to these plants. This release also includes several updates to the method for identifying the primary fuel type of each plant, which fixes a bug that was causing certain nuclear plants to be identified as a non-nuclear fuel type due to missing fuel consumption data in EIA-923. This release also includes updates to our methodology for converting gross generation data reported in CEMS to net generation. These updates include more stringent standards for which conversion factors are used for each plant, and more robust backstop conversion factors. This update will result in more net generation being reported for certain plants, and more realistic plant-level emission intensity values. We have also added the newly-released eGRID2021 dataset to the list of downloaded files so that 2021 OGE values can be easily compared to 2021 eGRID values using our validation notebooks included in the repository. Detailed changes Fixes the generation and fuel allocation process Fix bugs in pudl allocate_net_gen module, as described in this PR (https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/pull/2235): Adds a new function add_missing_energy_source_codes_to_gens() that adds energy_source_codes that appear in the gf table but not gens to gens. In some cases, non-zero fuel consumption and net generation is reported in the EIA-923 generation and fuel table that is associated with an energy_source_code that is not associated with that plant-prime mover in the gens table, which would cause these data to get dropped when these two tables are merged. To fix this, for each plant-pm, this function identifies such esc, and adds them to the gens_at_freq table as new energy_source_code columns. The sub-function identify_missing_gf_escs_in_gens() identifies when there are fuels reported in the gf table for that plant-pm that are not listed in the gens table for that plant pm. Adds the MISSING_SENTINEL value to the net_generation_mwh_g_tbl column. For some reason, this column had been commented out, which was leading to NaNs appearing in the data when dividing by this column when the value was zero. I un-commented this line. In allocate_net_gen_by_gen_esc(), we no longer allow frac_from_g_tbl to be greater than 100%. This was previously happening when the mwh reported in the g table were greater than the mwh reported in the gf table. However, numbers greater than 100% was causing the frac_missing_from_g_tbl to become negative, which was resulting in nonsensical allocations. We implement the same cap on frac_from_bf_tbl in allocate_fuel_by_gen_esc(). In allocate_fuel_by_gen_esc(), when calculating frac_cap, the code had been dividing capacity_mw by capacity_mw_unit_fuel. However, this was resulting in some nonsensical allocations because fuel is being allocated by PM-fuel, not by unit. We changed this to divide by capacity_mw_pm_fuel instead. This is consistent with how frac_cap is calculated in the allocate_net_gen_by_gen_esc() function Rename adjust_energy_source_codes() to adjust_msw_energy_source_codes() to more precisely describe what the function does Adds new entries to the manual emissions factor tables for NOx and SO2 to represent fuel-boiler combinations that had previously been getting dropped from the data due to this bug. Changes the pudl version that we use in our environment from catalyst-cooperative/pudl@main to grgmiller/pudl@oge_release. This will give us more control over performing fixes like this in the future. Adds a new validation check to the EIA-923 data cleaning process to verify that for each plant, the total allocated fuel and generation matches the total fuel and generation reported in the input generation and fuel table (basically that the allocation process is not dropping or inflating the data). Updates plant primary fuel identification When assigning the plant primary fuel based on the most consumed fuel, we were previously assigning this based on the fuel with the highest fuel_consumed_mmbtu. However, we should be using fuel_consumed_for_electricity_mmbtu since we want to assign the primary fuel used for electricity generation. Sometimes nuclear generators report 0 fuel consumption in EIA-923. Since we were assigning a plant's primary fuel first based on fuel consumption, this meant that sometimes if a nuclear plant had a backup fossil generator, the plant was being assigned the fuel code of that backup generator. To fix this, we now assign the primary fuel of any plant that contains a nuclear unit based on the nameplate capacity of the unit. Updates to gross to net generation conversions Previously, when converting CEMS gross generation to net generation, we had filtered out any ratios that were greater than 1.5 or less than 0.2. However, these values were somewhat arbitrary and turning out to be too wide of a range. For example, when there was a large discrepancy between CEMS gross generation and EIA-923 net generation, we were scaling the CEMS generation to match, even though the fuel consumption and emissions reported in CEMS also disagreed and were not being scaled. This was leading to instances where a plant was using CEMS CO2 totals but EIA-923 net generation totals, resulting in the plant having abnormally high emission rates. To be consistent, if we are going to use CEMS data at all, we want to make sure that the net generation values are reasonable given the reported net generation. After analyzing three years (2019-2021) of annual gross to net ratios, both at the plant and subplant levels, it appears that generally the interquartile range of GTN ratios is between 0.75 and 1.00, with an upper bound around 1.25. Thus, we are now using 0.75 as the lower bound for filtering out ratios, and 1.25 as the upper bound. Previously, the backstop gross to net generation approach if all other conversion factors were not available was to assume that gross generation equaled net generation (i.e. a GTN ratio of 1). However, as identified in https://github.com/singularity-energy/open-grid-emissions/issues/177, the EIA has default gross to net conversion factors for each prime mover that they use. This PR introduces these PM-specific gross to net conversion factors as the default backstop option now. As noted in the issue, there are still improvements that need to be made before #177 can be closed, but this is a step in the right direction. Flags potentially anomalous generated emission factors When outputting annual plant level data, we add a new validation check that calculates a generated co2 rate, and flags any rates that appear to be anomalous, so that we can manually inspect these plants to see if there are any unexpected results. For this test, we define anomalous values two ways. On the high end, the check flags the plant if the co2 rate is higher than 15,000 lb/MWh. On the low end, the check flags any plants that have rate lower than 10 lb/MWh but higher than 0 MWh. Add eGRID2021 to the list of downloads for validation This release adds eGRID 2021 data to our list of downloads, and updates the list of non-grid connected plants based on additions to the list in eGRID 2021. Fixes a bug that was leading to incorrect balancing authority assignments Fixes an issue where a plant with no reported ba_code was getting filled with the incorrect code based on the ba_name. We have also identified a new known issue that is not fixed in this release: In comparing our 2021 data to the eGRID 2021 data, we found that there are some plants that EIA-860 identifies as being in ISNE that are getting assigned to NYIS by pudl, and thus are categorized in a different BA than they are in eGRID. All of these plants seem to be physically located in the state of New York, but are listed with an ISNE BA code. Also, all of these plants are pretty small. See: https://github.com/catalyst-cooperative/pudl/issues/2255. We will work to address this with the pudl team. If you use this software, please cite it using the metadata from this file.

AB  - A continuous constraint satisfaction problem (CCSP) is a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) with an interval domain U subset of R. We engage in a systematic study to classify CCSPs that are complete of the Existential Theory of the Reals, i.e., there exists R-complete. To define this class, we first consider the problem ETR, which also stands for Existential Theory of the Reals. In an instance of this problem we are given some sentence of the form there exists x(1), ..., x(n) is an element of R : Phi(x(1), ..., x(n)), where Phi is a well-formed quantifier-free formula consisting of the symbols {0, 1, x(1), ..., x(n),+, ., >=, >, boolean AND, boolean OR, (sic)}, the goal is to check whether this sentence is true. Now the class. there exists R is the family of all problems that admit a polynomial-time many-one reduction to ETR. It is known that NP subset of there exists R subset of PSPACE.We restrict our attention on CCSPs with addition constraints (x+y = z) and some other mild technical condition. Previously, it was shown that multiplication constraints (x.y = z), squaring constraints (x(2) = y), or inversion constraints (x.y = 1) are sufficient to establish there exists R-completeness. We extend this in the strongest possible sense for equality constraints as follows. We show that CCSPs (with addition constraints and some other mild technical condition) that have any one well-behaved curved equality constraint (f(x, y) = 0) are there exists R-complete. We further extend our results to inequality constraints. We show that any well-behaved convexly curved and any wellbehaved concavely curved inequality constraint (f(x, y) >= 0 and g(x, y) >= 0) imply there exists R-completeness on the class of such CCSPs.Here, we call a function f : U-2 -> R well-behaved if it is a C-2-function, f(0, 0) = 0, all its partial derivatives f(x), f(y), f are rational in (0, 0), f(x)(0, 0) not equal 0 or f(y)(0, 0) not equal 0, and it can be computed on a real RAM. Furthermore we call integral curved if the curvature of the curve given by f(x, y) = 0 is nonzero, at the origin. In this case we call f either convexly curved if the curvature is negative, or concavely curved if it is positive.We apply our findings to geometric packing and answer an open question by Abrahamsen et al. [1, FOCS 2020]. Namely, we establish there exists R-completeness of packing convex pieces into a square container under rotations and translations.This work is based on the master's thesis of the second author [2].

TI  - Nonnegligible Diurnal and Long-Term Variation Characteristics of the Calibration Biases in Fengyun-4A/AGRI Infrared Channels Based on the Oceanic Drifter Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study mainly focuses on the diurnal and long-term variation characteristics of the calibration performance of the geostationary (GEO) meteorological satellite Fengyun-4A/Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (FY-4A/AGRI) infrared (IR) channels from June 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020. An improved algorithm is developed in this research based on the in situ observations from ocean drifters, which can capture the diurnal variations of the calibration performance of FY-4A/AGRI IR channels. The results suggest that there are significant and nonnegligible diurnal variations of the uncertainties and biases for the brightness temperature (TB) observed by the FY-4A/AGRI, especially the IR channels at 3.71, 8.61, 10.83, and 12.07 mu m. Among them, the calibration performance from 16:00 to 18:00 UTC (around the time of local midnight at the subsatellite point of FY-4A) is worse at 3.71 mu m, while TB biases from 04:00 to 16:00 UTC are relatively large at 12.07 mu m. Moreover, after the operational calibration and update in June 2020, the long-term TB biases at channel 08 (3.71 mu m) obviously decrease from about 5-2.5 K, and the TB biases at channel 14 (13.54 mu m) increase from about 0.5-3 K, implying a possible positive or negative impact of the calibration update on the calibration performance of IR channels. Overall, this method based on the in situ drifter data can well monitor the on-orbit calibration performance of GEO satellite imaging sensor's IR channels such as the FY-4A/AGRI, allowing an objective assessment on the effect of calibration update events.

AB  - Modern physics checks and tracks quantum. The most fundamental state of matter, from which a concrete science is almost in its final stage. However, a new task of interpretation was raised on how to understand this. Philosophical interpretation was requested in the physics of observation and verification. But if quantum is the origin of everything, what happens to God? What about metaphysics? People don’t know quantum exactly, but know to some extent. Modern civilization depends on it, even though it does not know exactly. Compared to this quantum, what is the understanding of the Eastern world like? In the East, there is the Ki(氣: Chinese letter ‘qi’) that has been said every day. There’s definitely something, but people don’t know. Eastern energy(Ki) also belongs to this. Therefore, the article proposes an approach to Ki in another way for quantum understanding. The origin of the Ki is the Taegeuk(太極) of Yin and Yang. There is a Tao(道) to the movement of Ki. In Yi-jing(易經), this is called ‘one-eum(陰: Chinese letter Yin)-one-yang(陽)’. In the end, the movement of all things is the self-differentiation of TaegeukYin(陰)Yang(陽), which is the worldview of Ki. In this, Ki appears as a ‘moving metaphysical being’. Everything is based on quantum, and the world is a sea of quantum. Therefore, the worldview between the two is extremely similar.Human energy(Ki) is an inner being. However, at the same time, it is intertwined and overlapped with the movement of external energy(Ki). In their interaction, human destiny appears. In the process of exercising with internal and external Ki, the world’s natural change of everything and exercise. When the Ki is determined, reason also exists. They always act as the way called “Yin in Yang and Yang in Yin.” From this, Myeong-ri(命理: the Law of Destiny) demands an unobstructed state of neutralization, requiring the control of needs and proper ethical practice.In other words, there can be no such thing as not knowing ethics while talking about Myeong-ri. In the new era, an intellectual transformation in which the mind and material are harmonized must be made. There are still much more things I don’t know than I know. However, I look forward to finding an idea that can be applied to oriental energy(Ki) theory or quantum theory.

AB  - Recent, an advanced Persistent Scatterers and Distributed Scatterers (PSDS) InSAR algorithm has been implemented as an open-source TomoSAR package (https://github.com/DinhHoTongMinh/TomoSAR). This effort aims to contribute the spatial distribution of subsidence in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), the most crowded city and economic hub of Viet Nam, in its horizontal and vertical components by using TomoSAR. With Sentinel-1 data, taking into account the presence of east-west horizontal motion, our findings indicate that the accuracy of the decomposed vertical velocity can be improved by up to 3 mm/year for Sentinel-1 data. The obtained results revealed that subsidence is most pronounced in the areas along the Sai Gon River, in the northwest-southeast axis, and in the southwest of the city, with a maximum value of 80 mm/yr, which is in accordance with the findings of the literature. The amplitude of east-west horizontal velocities is relatively small and large-scale eastward movement can be observed in the west of the city at a rate of 3-5 mm/year. This confirmed that the displacement in Ho Chi Minh City area is mainly vertical downward.

AB  - After the advent of modern times, Chinese intellectuals saw themselves and other disparate things taking over the world. This was a big shock to the Chinese who have enjoyed hegemony in their worldview until then. Here, the ‘heterogeneous’ experiences of Chinese intellectuals put Chinese intellectuals on a kind of boundary in the issue of identity. This was a longing for the outside, a denial of himself, and on the other hand, a completely different rejection of the outside and a defensive appearance of himself. For Chinese intellectuals who had both contradictory ambivalence at the same time, the shock of being ‘heterogeneous’ had come in a great sense, and efforts to properly understand and analyze it were needed.For the above reasons, I would like to try an approach to the identity problem that I would have experienced and felt foreign to Chinese intellectuals. In particular, I would like to examine this through the travelogue of Qu Qiubai(瞿秋白), one of the core of the Chinese intellectual world. Travel can be said to be an act that brings direct experience of heterogeneous things, especially heterogeneous spaces. Therefore, it is of great significance for the appearance of the Chinese intellectual system at that time to examine the thinking of Qu Qiubai contained in the travelogue through Michel Foucault's concept of ‘Heterotopia’.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important component in investigations of land-surface climate and hydrology. Recently several methodologies and techniques have been proposed, allowing soil moisture retrieving from SAR remote sensing techniques at large scales. In this work we investigate the relation between the closure phases and the time varying soil moisture. We combine three interferograms obtained from three SAR images of the same area acquired at different times, to derive maps of bi-coherence and phase triplet. The results show that there is a linear correlation between the modelled phases derived from soil moisture measurements and the closure phases. The correlation coefficient was R-2=0.76 and R-2=0.86 for the descending and ascending passes, respectively. However, a scale effect of the closure phases was found when compared with the derived model phases. The scale is about 10% for both passes, meaning that the estimated closure phases underestimate the soil moisture changes.

AB  - This paper reports the design and implementation of a circularly polarized microstrip array antenna operating in C-band. The antenna was designed to upgrade a C-band active reflector to be used with the ESA Sentinel-1 satellite SAR. The use of circular polarization improves the exploitation of the single polarization active reflectors allowing their use for the complete set of linearly polarized radar images available from the SAR acquisitions. This improvement can be done simply by replacing one of its two antennas. High gain, low cost, and a fine axial ratio are the main requirements of this prototype. Results show a good agreement between simulations and measurements, moreover, the close-range operational test done with the active reflector using the proposed antenna demonstrates the feasibility of the idea described in this work.

TI  - Using canopy height model derived from UAV imagery as an auxiliary for spectral data to estimate the canopy cover of mixed broadleaf forests
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy cover is an important structural trait that is frequently used in forest inventories to assess sustainability as well as many other important aspects of forest stands. Remote sensing data is more effective and suitable for canopy cover estimating than traditional field measurements such as sample plots, especially at broad scales. Measurement and mapping this attribute in fine-scale is a difficult task. Aerial imagery using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been recognized as an excellent tool to estimate canopy attributes. In this study, we compared the potential of using digital hemispherical photography (DHP), digital cover photography (DCP), UAV RGB data, and canopy height model (CHM) for estimation of canopy cover of mix broad-leaved forest on seven different stands. The canopy cover was measured from two digital canopy photographic methods, including DHP (as the reference method) and DCP. The stand orthophotos were segmented using a multi-resolution image segmentation method. Afterward, the classification in two classes of the canopy cover and the non-canopy cover was conducted using minimum distance classification to estimate canopy cover. The CHM layer was generated based on the SfM algorithm and utilized in the canopy cover estimation in each stand as auxiliary data. The results showed a slight improvement when we used the CHM as auxiliary data. Overall, the results showed that the efficiency of the ground digital canopy photographic methods (zenith view) in multi-storied and dense forests is the lowest. In return, our method for digital aerial canopy photography (object-based canopy segmentation and classification) is simple, quick, efficient, and cost-effective.

AB  - Temporal analysis of deformations Time Series (TS) provides detailed information of various natural and humanmade displacements. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) generates millimetre-scale products, indicating the chronicle behaviour of detected targets via TS products. Deep Learning (DL) can handle a massive load of InSAR TS to categorize significant movements from non-moving targets. To this end, we employed a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to distinguish five deformations trends, including Stable, Linear, Quadratic, Bilinear, and Phase Unwrapping Error (PUE). Considering several arguments in a CNN model, we trained numerous combinations to explore the most accurate combination from 5000 samples extracted from a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique and Sentinel-1 images over the Granada region, Spain. The model overall accuracy exceeds 92%. Deformations of three cases of landslides were also detected over the same area, including the Cortijo de Lorenzo, El Arrecife, and Rules Viaduct areas.

T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. The study draws attention to the need to transform the Russian system of medical education. It is connected with overcoming modern challenges and Russia's focus on improving the quality of life of people as a key state priority. The authors substantiate the connection of the patient-centred approach with the values of the "anthropological turn" in the field of medical education. The results of the analysis of foreign experience in the implementation of patient-oriented pedagogical focus in the practices of medical education are given. The study analyses the cases related to the peculiarities of patient communities functioning in order to identify their possible influence on the development of medical education practices.Aim. The current research aimed to identify ways and conditions of using the opportunities of patient communities for the development of practices of Russian medical education.Methodology and research methods. System-based, activity-oriented and phenomenological approaches made up the methodology of the study. Research methods: theoretical analysis, phenomenological analysis, structural analysis, survey, Delphi technique, focus group.Results. The research results are the following:1. The main directions for the development of medical education practices in the patient-oriented paradigm were outlined, namely: the formation of new, defined in terms of polysubjectivity (students, teachers, practitioners, representatives of patient communities) ways of organising educational interaction; transformation of didactic characteristics of medical academic programmes; updating the forms and means of work to form the worldview of future doctors within the framework of humanistic values.2. The study revealed the features of the educational functionality of patient communities, which is significant for the development of medical education practices, shown through the following roles of patient community: diagnostician, content developer, designer, moderator, mediator, researcher, analyst, technologist, teacher (trainer), expert. The revealed roles allowed the authors to identify patient community as an actor in the development of modern Russian medical education practices.3. The organisational and pedagogical ways of patient community influence on the development of medical education were identified: interactive polysubject collaboration of pedagogical, medical and patient communities in the design and implementation of academic programmes; organisation of open design-reflective communication platforms for discussing topical problems of patient communities with the involvement of subjects of medical education; volunteer projects integrating the activity of patient communities and students of medical academic programmes.4. The study identified the conditions for using patient communities for the development of education practices and professional development of a modern physician, including: well-established organisational and methodological mechanisms for the implementation of roles of the patient community in the organisation of all didactic components of the educational process (its types) in the system of continuous professionalisation of physicians (objectives, content, teaching technologies, monitoring of educational results); availability of systemically functioning mechanisms for introducing students of medical academic programmes to the practices of medical communities.Scientific novelty. The study substantiates the expediency of the interaction of the professional and educational medical communities with the patient as a factor in the development of the Russian system of medical education within the framework of a patient-oriented paradigm that reflects the values of the anthropological turn.The study reveals the types of activities of patient communities. These types reflect their identity as a new actor in the development of Russian medical education practices, namely: communicative, informational, project, expert, and diagnostic; evidence-based motivation for change.The authors prove the potential of the patient community as an actor in the development of Russian medical education practices, the implementation of which is ensured by creating organisational and pedagogical conditions that actualise these communities as the subjects of the educational process through multifaceted and functionally defined roles.The study outlines the ways and conditions of using the potential of polysubject interaction (patient, professional and educational medical communities) to transform the basic didactic characteristics of the educational process (its variations) in the medical education system.Practical significance. The obtained scientific results can be used to develop the content and activity-technological formats of educational programmes of higher medical education, to enrich practices of continuous medical education, to expand the productive experience of interaction between patient, medical and educational communities.

This is because 'popularity' shows the 'philosophy of the times' and at the same time shows what kind of sentiment and worldview prevail among the silent majority. <Sukhyangjeon> has repeated readers' tension and relaxation through narrative strategies to gain popularity. In addition, it contains a dual message that implies both the superficial theme that makes the reader conform to the existing conventions and the hidden theme that reverses the ideology and gender issues of the contemporary society.

AB  - Monitoring Reservoir-induced landslides is critical for determining and mitigating the geo-environmental risks associated with the artificial reservoir. This paper employs Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique for the mapping and monitoring of Reservoir Induced Landslides in the rim area of Baglihar Dam Reservoir on Chenab river (Jammu and Kashmir, India) along National Highway NH-244. It has been evident that the slope movements are necessarily impacted by the reservoir drawdown effect (RDE) as well as the rainfall. We have utilised 46 Sentinel-1A C-band radar satellite imagery of the study area. The monitoring results have yielded the Line of Sight slope movement along the reservoir rim varies from -97 mm/year to +80 mm/year. The temporal correlation between the displacements and the local precipitation (derived from TRMM using Google Earth Engine) was qualitatively analysed. Two unstable slopes have been identified and monitored.

AB  - The specifics of the Arctic region necessitates extensive use of satellite remote sensing data to obtain operational and scientific information about the state and variability of surface and atmospheric characteristics. In February 2021 the Arctica-M spacecraft No. 1 with a multispectral scanning device MSU-GS for hydrometeorological support was launched into a highly elliptical orbit. The MSU-GS receives radiation of the Earth surface and clouds in the 3 visible and 7 infrared (IR) spectral bands [1]. The MSU is an operational source of data on dynamic processes in the environment with a temporal resolution of 15-30 minutes.When studying surface characteristics, however, a significant limitation is cloud cover, the probability of which in some areas of the Arctic reaches 80% and more [2]. For many applications, quantitative values of Arctic environment parameters are needed regardless of cloud cover and time of day (illumination). These include, for example, surface wind speed, sea surface temperature (SST), ice drift speed and direction, ice concentration, area of land ice melting zones, type and intensity of solid and liquid precipitation, cloud liquid water content, total atmospheric water vapor content, and other geophysical parameters. The source of information on these parameters are the data obtained by microwave scanning radiometers, scatterometers, and radars of various types from polar orbiting satellites of various countries. Examples of the joint analysis of data acquired from highly elliptical ( HE) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are given in the present paper.

AB  - Thanks to the development of information technologies and computing resources, it became possible to obtain and process big data, including geospatial data. Most research in the field of precision farming is interdisciplinary in nature, with experimental field data used by disparate scientific groups. In this connection, it became necessary to develop a unified web-based system for storing, organizing, and exchanging experimental information between researchers. The first step in achieving this goal was to create a geospatial database. Since the system being developed in the future may require extensions, modifications, adjustments, integration into other projects, it seems appropriate to use the ontology to form the database structure. The most popular tools were used as the main tools: the ontology language OWL (Ontology Web Language), the Protege 5.5 development environment. The main initial information obtained in the course of experimental studies carried out at the biopolygon: weather data, agrochemical indicators (sampling of soil and plants with georeferencing), agrophysical parameters (humidity, electrical conductivity), remote sensing data. Based on the results of the analysis of the current state of research in the field of storage and systematization of experimental information in crop production, as well as a survey of ARI employees, a prototype of the database structure was formed based on the ontological approach. Nine parent classes were defined as the foundation: Field, Crop rotation - experience, Agrotechnology, Yield, Meteo, Ground samples, Orthophoto, Calendar, and Dictionary - units of measurement.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY-CHIGAKU ZASSHI
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of drought on vegetation activity at Chichi-jima, Ogasawara(Bonin)Islands from 2015 to 2018 were investigated based on remote sensing data. Chichi-jima suffered from severe periods of drought in 2016-2017 and 2018-2019. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index(NDVI)was calculated using data from Band 4(Red)and Band 5(Near Infrared)of the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager. Even at Chichi-jima, which is located in the subtropics, the NDVI exhibited seasonal variations. The range of the NDVI(maximum minus minimum) is approximately 0.11 when averaged at the watersheds of reservoirs supplying drinking water. During drought periods in September 2016 and 2018, the NDVI values decreased compared to those of September in the other years, which were less affected by drought. The decrease in the NDVI is approximately 0.04, which corresponds to approximately one-third of the seasonal variations in the NDVI. Although the absolute value of this decrease is subtle, it is relatively large considering seasonal variations. From a difference map of the NDVI between September 2016 (during the drought)and September 2015(before the drought), it is observed that the decrease in the NDVI occurred across all of Chichi-jima. When comparing the vegetation map of Chichi-jima, the decrease in the NDVI did not occur in a specific species or region. This implies that the effects of drought appeared in the vegetation of Chichi-jima as a whole.

TI  - Thermal remote sensing over heterogeneous urban and suburban landscapes using sensor-driven super-resolution
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring regional climate and environment, including urban heat islands. However, it suffers from a relatively lower spatial resolution compared to optical remote sensing. To improve the spatial resolution, various "data-driven" image processing techniques (pan-sharpening, kernel-driven methods, and machine learning) have been developed in the previous decades. Such empirical super-resolution methods create visually appealing thermal images; however, they may sacrifice radiometric consistency because they are not necessarily sensitive to specific sensor features. In this paper, we evaluated a "sensor-driven" super-resolution approach that explicitly considers the sensor blurring process, to ensure radiometric consistency with the original thermal image during high-resolution thermal image retrieval. The sensor-driven algorithm was applied to a cloud-free Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) scene of heterogeneous urban and suburban landscape that included built-up areas, low mountains with a forest, a lake, croplands, and river channels. Validation against the reference high-resolution thermal image obtained by the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) shows that the sensor-driven algorithm can downscale the MODIS image to 250-m resolution, while maintaining a high statistical consistency with the original MODIS and ASTER images. Part of our algorithm, such as radiometric offset correction based on the Mahalanobis distance, may be integrated with other existing approaches in the future.

TI  - 12 Years of Area Variation by the Drygalski Ice Tongue as Measured With COSMO-SkyMed
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One important coastal polynya around Antarctica is Terra Nova Bay (TNB) polynya. Its formation and persistence are due to the combined effect of katabatic winds, regional ice conditions, and the Drygalski Ice Tongue (DIT). The combined effect of these elements arranges a delicate balance in TNB. To evaluate the interacting elements, we focused our attention on the DIT, one of the largest ice tongues in Antarctica. The DIT is a 70-km long tongue, which juts out like a pier from the icy land into northern McMurdo Sound of Antarctica's Ross Dependency. The analysis presented in this article was carried out using Cosmo-SkyMed (CSK) images. The methodology developed for the analysis consists of three steps: 1) DIT shape enhancement, 2) fuzzy Bayesian segmentation which associates the analyzed set of pixels with a binary label field, and 3) parametric representation of the shape of the DIT to compare the area of the ice tongue as it was 12 years ago and as it is today. The computed mean value of the DIT surface velocity was 703 m y(-1). To estimate the closeness of the derived parameter to the true value, using a statistical approach, the 95% confidence interval for the true mean value is 703 +/- 4.236 m y(-1). Our analysis confirms a trend of advance. That is, after the significant calving events of the tongue in 2005 and 2006, the DIT has resumed its normal growth, and its length has increased by 12% in the last 12 years.

TI  - Distortion Robust Relative Radiometric Normalization of Multitemporal and Multisensor Remote Sensing Images Using Image Features
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we propose a novel framework to radiometrically correct unregistered multisensor image pairs based on the extracted feature points with the KAZE detector and the conditional probability (CP) process in the linear model fitting. In this method, the scale, rotation, and illumination invariant radiometric control set samples (SRII-RCSS) are first extracted by the blockwise KAZE strategy. They are then distributed uniformly over both textured and texture-less land use/land cover (LULC) using grid interpolation and a set of nearest-neighbors. Subsequently, SRII-RCSS are scored by a similarity measure, and the histogram of the scores is then used to refine SRII-RCSS. The normalized subject image is produced by adjusting the subject image to the reference image using the CP-based linear regression (CPLR) based on the optimal SRII-RCSS. The registered normalized image is finally generated by registration of the normalized subject image to the reference image through a two-pass registration method, namely affine-B-spline and, then, it is enhanced by updating the normalization coefficient of CPLR based on the SRII-RCSS. In this study, eight multitemporal data sets acquired by inter/intra satellite sensors were used in tests to comprehensively assess the efficiency of the proposed method. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art relative radiometric normalization (RRN) methods both qualitatively and quantitatively, indicating its capability for RRN of unregistered multisensor image pairs.

AB  - Urban metabolism is an active field of research that deals with the estimation of emissions and resource consumption from urban regions. The analysis could be carried out through a manual survey or by the implementation of elegant machine learning algorithms. In this exploratory work, we estimate the water consumption by the buildings in the region captured by satellite imagery. To this end, we break our analysis into three parts: i) Identification of building pixels, given a satellite image, followed by ii) identification of the building type (residential/non-residential) from the building pixels and finally iii) using the building pixels along with their type to estimate the water consumption using the average per unit area consumption for different building types as obtained from municipal surveys.

AB  - The main objective of this study is the spatial downscaling of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture (36 km) using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) products. The study was conducted over India during the post-monsoon (i.e., Rabi) season Daily SMAP soil moisture (SM) data was composited to 3 days to cover the entire study area. MODIS data for the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Albedo, and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were similarly obtained by constructing a three day composite. SMAP soil moisture was used as a dependent variable, whereas, MODIS NDVI, NDWI, Albedo, LST, and SRTM elevation were used as independent variables in a regression analysis for downscaling of SMAP soil moisture. The coefficient of determination (R-2 ) was used to evaluate the performance of multi-variate linear regression (MLR), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR). Each method was used to test the performance of monthly and seasonal models. RFR outperformed MLR and SVR for monthly and seasonal models. Furthermore, a comparison of monthly and seasonal models revealed that the model created on Jan. data performed best (R-2 =0.80), while R-2 of 0.73, 0.61, 0.75, and 0.76 were attained using RFR for seasonal, Dec., Feb., and Mar. models, respectively. In addition, in-situ soil moisture data was used to validate downscaled soil moisture (1 km). Comparison between downscaled soil moisture and in-situ soil moisture showed good agreement with a difference ranging between -9.3 to 7.4 %.

AB  - The optical satellite observations are affected by cloud cover. Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) has the potential to provide insights into plant water and vegetation structure. The main objective of this study is to spatially downscale VOD using a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) observations. The study considered India geography and post-monsoon cropping season (locally called Rabi season). Data for three different Rabi crop seasons, i.e., 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20, was used in the analysis. The VOD estimates at 25 km scale derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) were used for spatial down-scaling. Three day VOD composites were created to cover the study area. MODIS products such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), albedo (black and white sky), and Land Surface Temperature (LST) were similarly acquired at a 3-day interval by constructing a 3-day composite. In addition, SRTM digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 90 m was used in this study. We carried out regression modeling where VOD was used as a dependent variable, with NDVI, NDWI, Albedo (black and white sky), LST, and elevation as independent variables. We compared three regression algorithms, viz., Linear Regression (LR), Random Forest Regression (RFR), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), using the R-square (R-2) as the assessment metric. A comparison between the various regression techniques showed that the SVR outperformed monthly and seasonal models. Furthermore, a comparison of monthly and seasonal models revealed that the model generated with January data performed best, with an R-2 of 0.85, followed by R-2 of 0.82, 0.80, and 0.78 for March, December, and February, respectively. The R-2 for the seasonal model was 0.83. Finally, for the wheat crop time series of down-scaled VOD and Sentinel 2 based NDVI was compared to gain insights on seasonal variations in VOD. We found that down-scaled VOD and NDVI have a significant agreement.

AB  - Degradation of vegetation cover and expansion of barren land are remained the leading environmental problem at global level. Land surface temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Barren Index (NDBaI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were used to quantify the changing relationships using correlation analysis. This study attempted to analyze the relationship between LST and NDVI, NDBaI, and MNDWI using Geospatial tech-nologies in Gida Kiremu, Limu, and Amuru districts in Western Ethiopia. All indices were estimated by using thermal bands and multispectral bands from Landsat TM 1990, Landsat ETM+ 2003, and Landsat OLI/TIRS 2020. The correlation of LST with NDVI, NDBaI and MNDWI were analyzed by using scatter plot. Accordingly, the NDBaI was positive correlation with LST (R2 = 0.96). However, NDVI and MNDWI were substantially negative relationship with LST (R2 = 0.99, 0.95), respectively. The result shows that, LST was increased by 5 & DEG;C due to decline of vegetation cover and increasing of bare land over the study periods. Finally, our result recommended that, decision-makers and environmental ana-lysts should give attention on the importance of vegetation cover, water bodies and wetland in climate change mitigation, particularly, LST in the study area.& COPY; 2022 The Authors.

CP  - 11th Computer Science On-Line Conference (CSOC)
CL  - ELECTR NETWORK
AB  - Crop classification with the use of remote sensing satellite images is a broadly discussed topic in the literature. Much less attention is paid to borderlines of farmer's parcels and the fact, that these pixels may contain mixed vegetation content due to decreased spatial resolution of the satellite images, comparing to images obtained with the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). In this paper an accuracy of the crop classification is improved by exclusion of borderline pixels of parcels. For the sunflower by 12 and sugar beet by 10 percentual points. Rules for the exclusion of these pixels are presented. Sentinel 2 level 2 satellite images are used to evaluate the proposed solution. Random Forest and Support Vector Machines machine learning models are used for crop classification. There is a comparison of the crop classification accuracy results with and without the borderline pixels use.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations in the water quality of the Doorndraai Dam, South Africa: An assessment of sustainable water resource management
T2  - CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The problem of water scarcity and clean water in sub-Saharan Africa is a growing concern. This study aims to quantify the water quality on a temporal scale in the Doorndraai dam site in sub-Saharan Africa to design possible management options. Here, an integrated approach using both in-situ measurements of water quality parameters and remote sensing data was used to derive the water quality index (WQI) and inherent optical properties of water to deduce the factors governing seasonal and annual variability. The results show that all the water quality parameters analyzed fall under the permissible limit of the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water, except turbidity. The average value of turbidity for the dry and wet periods was 12.52 and 3.39 NTU, respectively. WQI value ranges from good to excellent during the wet season, and poor in the dry season owing to the high values of turbidity in the water samples. Both in-situ and remote sensing-based analysis shows that during the last five years, the value of suspended particulate matter (SPM) based on Landsat-8 increased gradually in the study area. The Sentinel-2 derived modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) shows a decreasing trend in the water area due to encroachment. The strong correlation between in-situ and remote sensing data supports the usefulness of remote sensing techniques for water resource management, especially in data-scarce regions. Looking at the spatio-temporal trend of water quality evolution, the findings of this study will help local decision-makers design sustainable plans for water resource management of Doorndraai dam.

AB  - A recently developed prototype (Laparoscopic Differential Magnetometer, in short LapDiffMag) identifies magnetic tracer accumulated inside sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) during clinical laparoscopic procedures. The LapDiffMag relies on excitation of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and subsequent laparoscopic detection based on a nonlinear detection principle. The prototype uses an excitation coil to generate a magnetic field needed to activate SPIONs. This study reports on the process of developing a new excitation coil by describing the design choices based upon clinical requirements, by modeling delivered magnetic field using digital twin, and by comparing the magnetic fields of modeled and manufactured prototype. Digital twin technology was used to produce relevant and reliable data to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the excitation coil. The magnetic field originating from manufactured prototype was validated at two different heights above the excitation coil and have shown a good concordance to the data generated by its digital twin. Clinical Relevance- Current standard-of-care for a variety of tumor types consists of minimally invasive radical resection of primary tumor and regional lymph nodes (LNs). The newly introduced excitation coil will (after full validation) enable minimally invasive harvesting of sentinel LNs by means of magnetic tracer detection.

AB  - This work presents a Sentinel-2 based exploratory workflow for the estimation of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in a Mediterranean forest. Up-to-date and reliable mapping of AGB has been increasingly required by international commitments under the climate convention, and in the last decades, remote sensing-based studies on the topic have been widely investigated. After the generation of several vegetation and topographic features, the proposed approach consists of 4 major steps: 1) Feature selection 2) AGB prediction with k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); 3) hyper-parameters finetuning with Bayesian Optimization; and finally, 4) model explanation with the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) package. The following results were obtained: 1) before hyper-parameters optimization, the Deep Neural Network (DNN) yielded the best performance with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 42.30 t/ha; 2) after hyper-parameters fine-tuning with Bayesian Optimization, the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model yielded the best performance with a RMSE of 37.79 t/ha; 3) model explanation with SHAP allowed for a deeper understanding of the features impact on the model predictions. Finally, the predicted AGB throughout the study area showed an average value of 83 t/ha, ranging from 0 t/ha to 346.56 t/ha.

AB  - Climate variability in the Apacheta micro-basin has an impact on vegetation behavior. The objective is to analyze the annual trend, anomalies and predict the behavior of vegetation cover (CV) with Landsat images and the MOD13Q1 product in the Apacheta micro-basin of the Ayacucho Region. For this purpose, the CV was classified and validated with the Kappa index (p-value=0.032; <0.05), obtaining a good agreement between the values observed in situ and the estimated in the Landsat images. The CV data were subjected to the Lilliefors normality test (p-value=0.0014; <0.05) indicating that they do not come from a normal distribution. CV forecasting was performed with the auto.arima, forecast and prophet packages, in R, according to the Box-Jenkins and ARIMA approaches, whose two-year future scenario is acceptable, but with higher bias. The results show an annual increasing CV trend of 3,378.96 ha with Landsat imagery and 3,451.95 ha with the MOD13Q1 product, by the end of 2020. The anomalies and the CV forecast also show a significant increase in the last 9 years, becoming higher in the forecasted years, 2021 and 2022.

AB  - Earthquakes fall in catastrophic natural disasters that affect man-kind, buildings, and other properties. In the Himalayan region, an earthquake can be seen as an agent that triggers other natural hazards such as landslides, and lake outburst floods due to moraine-dam breach. Such events occur due to alteration in the shear strength properties of soil triggered by a tectonic event. In this study, an attempt has been made to investigate the potential of interferogram and coherence derived from Sentinel-1 SLC to identify the changes caused by MW5.7 earthquake (20-Mar-2020) around the Lake Dingmu, Tibet. The pre- and co-seismic interferogram and coherence images for the surrounding region of Lake Dingmu have been generated. Subsequently, the decreased coherence around the lake periphery have been investigated for soil liquefaction/cyclic mobility through Temporal difference liquefaction index (TDLI) using Landsat-8 OLI. The TDLI detects the changes in the soil moisture content due to the earthquake event. The results of Sentinel-1 SLC data corroborate well with the results of optical remote sensing data. It is evident from the analysis that a significant amount of changes occurred due to the earthquake. However, the topography makes the lake very stable.

AB  - The Himalayan cryosphere or the third pole is a dynamic component of the Earth System. The Himalayan landscape's weather conditions, topography, and seismicity results in various natural hazards such as landslides, outburst floods, and avalanches. Avalanches are sudden and endanger life and property, especially in the Annapurna mountain range of Nepal. In this study, an attempt is made for the first time to identify the activation zones of snow avalanches that occurred on 17th Jan 2020 around some of the major peaks of the Annapurna mountain range. The post-avalanche backscatter intensities overlaid on the topographic slope of the area from ALOS-PALSAR DEM helped in capturing possible release areas near the peaks. This helped in identifying the avalanche activation zones that can be helpful in planning the mitigation. Radar backscatter intensities derived using Sentinel-1A SLC products helped in the temporal classification of the area into recent and older avalanches.

AB  - Precise estimation of ground displacement at regional scales from optical satellite imagery is fundamental for the study of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, landslides, etc. Current methods make use of correlation techniques between two acquisitions in order to retrieve a fractional pixel shift. However, differences in local lighting conditions between two acquisitions can lead to differences in image reflectance, which in turn can bias the displacement estimate, especially in the sub-pixel domain. Data-driven methods may provide a way to overcome these errors. From the generation of a realistic simulated database based on Landsat-8 satellite image pairs with added simulated sub-pixel shifts, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) able to retrieve sub-pixel displacements.

TI  - Landsat 9 Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) Stray Light Mitigation and Assessment
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Thermal Infrared Sensor 2 (TIRS-2) payload for the Landsat 9 mission closely follows the design of the TIRS instrument currently flying aboard Landsat 8. The TIRS-2 instrument, however, incorporates an important design change to mitigate the stray light issue that plagued the TIRS instrument. Shortly after the launch of Landsat 8 in 2013, calibration errors due to stray light artifacts were observed in Earth imagery from TIRS with magnitudes of 4% (10.8 mu m band) and 8% (12.0 mu m band). Out-of-field scans of the Moon were conducted to map the angles from which off-axis radiance was detected on the focal plane arrays. Optical modeling, constrained by reverse ray traces of the lunar data, identified the primary scattering sources within the TIRS telescope, and these results informed the locations and design of mitigating baffles for TIRS-2. The effect of the modifications to the TIRS-2 instrument was tested preflight through thermal vacuum (TVAC) characterization tests, and the optical models were updated to be consistent with the measured data. Preliminary assessments indicated at least an order of magnitude reduction of the total signal due to scattering in TIRS-2. On-orbit lunar scans provided the final confirmations and demonstrated that the new design changes to TIRS-2 have reduced the primary out-of-field scattering by over 40x from the original TIRS design bringing the total scattering to 1% or less. More importantly, Earth imagery produced by Landsat 9 TIRS-2 does not show any stray-light-related artifacts, as was prevalent in the Landsat 8 TIRS imagery.

TI  - Monitoring Plant Diversity to Support Agri-Environmental Schemes: Evaluating Statistical Models Informed by Satellite and Local Factors in Southern European Mountain Pastoral Systems
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial monitoring of plant diversity in the endangered species-rich grasslands of European mountain pastoral systems is an important step for fairer and more efficient Agri-Environmental policy schemes supporting conservation. This study assessed the underlying support for a spatially explicit monitoring of plant species richness at parcel level (policy making scale) in Southern European mountain grasslands, with statistical models informed by Sentinel-2 satellite and environmental factors. Twenty-four grassland parcels were surveyed for species richness in the Peneda-Geres National Park, northern Portugal. Using a multi-model inference approach, three competing hypotheses guided by the species-scaling theoretical framework were established: species-area (P1), species-energy (P2) and species-spectral heterogeneity (P3), each representing a candidate spatial pathway to predict species richness. To evaluate the statistical support of each spatial pathway, generalized linear models were fitted and model selection based on Akaike information criterion (AIC) was conducted. Later, the performance of the most supported spatial pathway(s) was assessed using a leave-one-out cross validation. A model guided by the species-energy hypothesis (P2) was the most parsimonious spatial pathway to monitor plant species richness in mountain grassland parcels (P2, AICc = 137.6, increment AIC = 0.0, wi = 0.97). Species-area and species-spectral heterogeneity pathways (P1 and P3) were less statistically supported (Delta AICc values in the range 5.7-10.0). The underlying support of the species-energy spatial pathway was based on Sentinel-2 satellite data, namely on the near-infrared (NIR) green ratio in the spring season (NIR/Green(spring)) and on its ratio of change between spring and summer (NIR/Green(change)). Both predictor variables related negatively to species richness. Grassland parcels with lower values of near-infrared (NIR) green ratio and lower seasonal amplitude presented higher species richness records. The leave-one-out cross validation indicated a moderate performance of the species-energy spatial pathway in predicting species richness in the grassland parcels covered by the dataset (R-2 = 0.44, RMSE = 4.3 species, MAE = 3.5 species). Overall, a species-energy framework based on Sentinel 2 data resulted in a promising spatial pathway for the monitoring of species richness in mountain grassland parcels and for informing decision making on Agri-Environmental policy schemes. The near-infrared (NIR) green ratio and its change in time seems a relevant variable to deliver predictions for plant species richness and further research should be conducted on that.

TI  - MMFlood: A Multimodal Dataset for Flood Delineation From Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate flood delineation is crucial in many disaster management tasks, such as risk map production and update, impact estimation, claim verification, or planning of countermeasures for disaster risk reduction. Open remote sensing resources such as the data provided by the Copernicus ecosystem enable to carry out this activity, which benefits from frequent revisit times on a global scale. In the last decades, satellite imagery has been successfully applied to flood delineation problems, especially considering Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals. However, current remote mapping services rely on time-consuming manual or semi-automated approaches, requiring the intervention of domain experts. The implementation of accurate and scalable automated pipelines is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To address these issues, we propose MMFlood, a multimodal remote sensing dataset purposely designed for flood delineation. The dataset contains 1,748 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, comprising 95 flood events distributed across 42 countries. Along with satellite imagery, the dataset includes the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hydrography maps, and flood delineation maps provided by Copernicus EMS, which is considered as ground truth. To provide baseline performances on the MMFlood test set, we conduct a number of experiments of the flood delineation task using state-of-art deep learning models, and we evaluate the performance gains of entropy-based sampling and multi-encoder architectures, which are respectively used to tackle two of the main challenges posed by MMFlood, namely the class unbalance and the multimodal setting. Lastly, we provide a future outlook on how to further improve the performance of the flood delineation task. Dataset and code can be found at https://github.com/edornd/mmflood.

TI  - Performance assessment of GNSS-based real-time navigation for the Sentinel-6 spacecraft
T2  - GPS SOLUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The feasibility of precise real-time orbit determination of low earth orbit satellites using onboard GNSS observations is assessed using six months of flight data from the Sentinel-6A mission. Based on offline processing of dual-constellation pseudorange and carrier phase measurements as well as broadcast ephemerides in a sequential filter with a reduced dynamic force model, navigation solutions with a representative position error of 10 cm (3D RMS) are achieved. The overall performance is largely enabled by the superior quality of the Galileo broadcast ephemerides, which exhibits a two- to three-times smaller signal-in-space-range error than GPS and allows for geodetic-grade GNSS real-time orbit determination without a need for external correction services. Compared to GPS-only processing, a roughly two-times better navigation accuracy is achieved in a Galileo-only or mixed GPS/Galileo processing. On the other hand, GPS tracking offers a useful complement and additional robustness in view of a still incomplete Galileo constellation. Furthermore, it provides improved autonomy of the navigation process through the availability of earth orientation parameters in the new civil navigation message of the L2C signal. Overall, GNSS-based onboard orbit determination can now reach a similar performance as the DORIS (Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite) navigation system. It lends itself as a viable alternative for future remote sensing missions.

AB  - We built a global archive of DInSAR co-seismic displacement maps based on Sentinel-1 (S1) data. The DInSAR measurements are generated through a tool that considers the main significant (Mw > 5.5) worldwide earthquakes since 2015. The tool is automatically triggered by the occurrence of an earthquake in the main public catalogues (USGS and INGV). The DInSAR processing is carried out via the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud-Computing (CC) environment, to benefit of high computing capacity. The tool is continuously running allowing the update of the archive once a new earthquake occurs. The generated DInSAR results consist of about 6500 Interferograms, LOS Displacement and Coherence maps that are made freely and openly available to the Solid Earth scientific community through the European Plate Observing System (EPOS) Research Infrastructure and the ESA Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP).

TI  - Integrated Water Vapor Estimation Through Microwave Propagation Measurements: First Experiment on a Ground-to-Ground Radio Link
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurement of water vapor (WV) in the lower troposphere on a continuous temporal basis would improve our knowledge of the atmospheric dynamics and the performance of numerical weather prediction models. In recent studies, a new measurement concept, the normalized differential spectral attenuation (NDSA) approach, was proposed. It is based on measurements of differential attenuation at 18.8 and 19.2 GHz performed along a tropospheric radio link. While NDSA measurement at a fixed elevation angle provides information on integrated WV (IWV), measurements at different elevation angles allow to retrieve the vertical WV content profile. A prototype NDSA demonstrator, which consists of two units, a synthesized transmitter and a software-defined radio receiver, has been designed and implemented. The system was accurately characterized through several laboratory tests, and then a first experimental campaign was conducted at fixed elevation angle along a ground-to-ground radio link. Obtained results confirm the sensitivity of the NDSA measurements to the IWV along such link with a good agreement with the existing ground-based and satellite data products.

TI  - On the Use of Satellite Nightlights for Power Outages Prediction
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hurricanes are a dominant disaster in the Caribbean, always causing serious power outages throughout the islands. Hurricane Maria was a prime example, causing unimaginable destruction of the power infrastructure of Puerto Rico (PR). Consequently, one month after the hurricane landfall, approximately 80% of the population was still without power. After an event of such massive destruction, the electric power restoration process progresses very slowly. This timeline can be improved using power outage (PO) forecast models that help identify the vulnerable places before the hurricane landfall. Generally, these models are trained with historical power outages records, associated data on weather conditions, and additional information about the natural and built environments. However, PO records are often difficult to acquire, and, in many instances, the power utility companies may not record them. This study utilizes a satellite-based Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) night light data product as a surrogate for the power delivery to predict hurricane-induced PO in areas having limited to nonexistent historical data records. The processed satellite data is then used along with geographic variables, and simulated weather data to formulate machine learning-based algorithms to predict PO for future hurricane events. These models are applied and validated in the context of the PR catastrophic storm, Hurricane Maria.

AB  - This thesis re-examines the life of Lee Sang-jae, who was active in the Christian civil society in the early 20th century in Korea, and summarizes the process through which his ideological worldview was transformed. Through this, tried to identify the representative case of a Confucian born at the end of the 19th century who converted his worldview to a Christian.Lee Sang-jae was born into a family of Confucian scholars of the typical Joseon Dynasty and wanted to live a life as a bureaucrat while learning Confucian knowledge. While he was about to begin his life as a bureaucrat, he learned a western worldview as he went on to engage in diplomatic activities in Japan and the United States. After that, he reprinted the civic movement representing the people for the transformation of Korean society. As a result, he was imprisoned and suffered hardships, but in the process, he met a turning point in his life when he converted to a Christian. It was a historical event similar to the fall of Korea to a Japanese colony that he had to go through an unprecedented life journey from being a Confucian scholar to a Christian. He was born as a representative modern Korean figure who accepted the values ​​of Western Christianity based on the Confucian worldview.

In this short story, the older waiter sympathizes with the loneliness the old man felt after losing his wife, the despair of trying to hang himself, and why he remained in the cafe late at night to overcome darkness and emptiness. The older waiter equates the old man’s plight with that of himself, and finds the importance of the dignity in the old man's appearance.The older waiter reflects on the emptiness of his own life and is now one of those who like to stay late in the cafe. He wants to keep his cafe open late for those who don't want to sleep and need lights. He lights up to fight against the darkness, fills the emptiness of the world, and stays up late at night to fight the futility. Although he is not portrayed as a hero, he knows that light, cleanness, order is necessary for humans to overcome their emptiness, and the elderly's patience and dignified attitude represent Hemingway's worldview that is a value that humans can survive in a naturalistic world.

M3  - research-article
AB  - This paper is to find the purpose of Augustine’s writing De Doctrina Christiana in the concept of doctrina. This paper suggests that doctrina should be understood in terms of hermeneutics, rhetoric, and culture beyond the category of the meaning of liberal arts or educational theory. Augustine’s various interpretations of doctrina will be examined, and the meaning he intended will be highlighted. Christianity emerging as the dominant religion of Rome, Roman education was led by the Second Sophist. Through the encounter of Roman education and Christian education, I will reveal his view of education and Christian worldview through doctrina. Augustine uses doctrina as a headword only in De Doctrina Christiana among his writings.Augustine began writing in the early days of the Christian bishop's ministry and finished writing at the end of the ministry.Even though there is a gap of 30 years, he explains with doctrina at the center the Bible which is the scripture of Christianity, and the culture of Christianity. And he explains the issues dealt with by the entire Bible, focusing on doctrina. He presents the methodology of biblical interpretation and rhetoric in matters dealing with the entire Bible. When he deals with the entire Bible, the most important word is doctrina, and doctrina is essential when he also emphasizes hermeneutics and rhetoric. When Augustine preaches or argues with heresy, doctrina is bound to be important. Perhaps doctrina is the most meaningful word to reveal not merely his entire ministry but also his entire life. In addition, doctrina may be the key word that encompasses the entire Bible, a Christian scripture. In this paper, I will examine doctrina from the perspective of education and from one of biblical interpretation, rhetoric, and Christian culture.In this process, his intention to write De Doctrina Christiana will be clarified, and furthermore, the evaluation of De Doctrina Christiana will be made.

AB  - The trees at the heart of this paper are not an isolated story but contribute to the machinery of the settler colonial present, feeding off indigenous dispossession of the Arkansas Ozarks. In this paper, I explore "trail trees," a form of culturally-modified tree used to sustain and perpetuate replacement narratives romanticizing a lost Native American past and constructing a pure, modern, scientific "reality" of White settler possession of the region. My critique is directed at the settler colonial worldview and the systems through which it is constructed, legitimated, and spread. I ask: What is at stake for advocates for the existence of "trail trees"? What can disrupt and dismantle the "trail tree" discourse and the replacement narrative that it functions within? What work can we do to create an opening for anti-colonial praxis? The answers to these questions involve direct engagement with conservation and conservationists and the narratives of replacement that suffuse their work.

TI  - Above-ground biomass estimation in a Mediterranean sparse coppice oak forest using Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Implementing a scheduled and reliable estimation of forest characteristics is important for the sustainable management of forests. This study aimed at evaluating the capability of Sentinel-2 satellite data to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) in coppice forests of Persian oak (Quercus brantii var. persica) located in Western Iran. To estimate the AGB, field data collection was implemented in 80 square plots (40-40 m, area of 1600 m(2)). Two diameters of the crown were measured and used to calculate the AGB of each tree based on allometric equations. Then, the performance of satellite data in estimating the AGB was evaluated for the area of study using the field-based AGB (dependent variable) as well as the spectral band values, spectrally-derived vegetation indices (independent variables) and four machine learning (ML) algorithms: Multi -Layer Perceptron Artificial Neural Network (MLPNN), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR). A five-fold cross-validation was used to verify the effectiveness of models. Examination of the Pearson's correlation coefficient between AGB and the extracted values showed that IPVI and NDVI vegetation indices had the highest correlation with AGB (r = 0.897). The results indicated that the MLPNN algorithm was the best ML option (RMSE = 1.71 t ha-1; MAE = 1.37 t ha(-1); relative RMSE = 24.75%; R2 = 0.87) in estimating the AGB, providing new insights on the capability of remotely sensed-based AGB modeling of sparse Mediterranean forest ecosystems in an area with limited number of field sample plots.

TI  - Estimating Aboveground Biomass in Dense Hyrcanian Forests by the Use of Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the challenges brought by field measurements to estimate the aboveground biomass (AGB), such as the remote locations and difficulties in walking in these areas, more accurate and cost-effective methods are required, by the use of remote sensing. In this study, Sentinel-2 data were used for estimating the AGB in pure stands of Carpinus betulus (L., common hornbeam) located in the Hyrcanian forests, northern Iran. For this purpose, the diameter at breast height (DBH) of all trees thicker than 7.5 cm was measured in 55 square plots (45 x 45 m). In situ AGB was estimated using a local volume table and the specific density of wood. To estimate the AGB from remotely sensed data, parametric and nonparametric methods, including Multiple Regression (MR), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Random Forest (RF), were applied to a single image of the Sentinel-2, having as a reference the estimations produced by in situ measurements and their corresponding spectral values of the original spectral (B2, B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B8a, B11, and B12) and derived synthetic (IPVI, IRECI, GEMI, GNDVI, NDVI, DVI, PSSRA, and RVI) bands. Band 6 located in the red-edge region (0.740 nm) showed the highest correlation with AGB (r = -0.723). A comparison of the machine learning methods indicated that the ANN algorithm returned the best ABG-estimating performance (%RMSE = 19.9). This study demonstrates that simple vegetation indices extracted from Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery can provide good results in the AGB estimation of C. betulus trees of the Hyrcanian forests. The approach used in this study may be extended to similar areas located in temperate forests.

AB  - Land cover and topography influence land surface temperature (LST). The purpose of this study was to determine whether there is a correlation between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST and air temperature (AT) under various physiographic conditions in Iran. A novel method was developed to determine the match-up time between the LST of the Terra/Aqua overpass and the AT observation at an appropriate distance. Numerous statistical metrics were used, including the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square differences (RMSD), and relative root mean square differences (RRMSD). The findings indicate that LST and AT have a strong correlation coefficient (0.7-0.9) in Iran. Intra-annual changes in R, on the other hand, show higher values during the cold months than during the warmer months. The differences between LST and AT were lowest at the coasts and highest in the central and northwestern deserts of Iran according to the spatial distribution of the RRMSD. The RRMSD for MODIS Terra night LST (LSTTN) was lower than for MODIS Aqua day LST (LSTAD). Seasonal differences between LST and AT were observed, particularly at higher elevations and slopes. The most important factors that result in a higher correlation and a smaller difference between LST and AT are surface moisture, vegetation density, and land cover dynamics (LCD). The LST/AT correlation and difference can also be affected by the daily and intra-annual temperature cycle. The findings can be applied to further studies, e.g. when estimating AT from LST in deserts and at high elevations.

TI  - The Cichlidae fish <i>Geophagus brasiliensis</i> (Quoy & Gaimard, 1824) has suitability as a sentinel species for changes caused by xenobiotics?
T2  - Acta Scientiarum Biological Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrial wastewater and agricultural practices are among the main activities discharging organic pollutants, such as Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners and organochlorine insecticides (e.g. DDT - dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane), to the environment. In this study, we used the native Cichlidae fish species Geophagus brasiliensis as a sentinel to evaluate the hepatic 7-ethoxyresorufin-O- deethylase EROD activity, a biomarker of exposure to CYP1A-inducing pollutants, to assess the bioavailability of xenobiotics in two reaches of a large lotic system in Southeast Brazil: a less disturbed area (site 1) in the upper stretch, and an area in the middle stretch, which receives various industrial and agricultural effluents from upstream cities (site 2). In addition, G. brasiliensis were exposed to a single dose of 50 mg kg(-1) betanaphthoflavone (BNF) or of 50 mg kg(-1) dimethylbenzoanthracene (DMBA) to test the effects on, respectively, the hepatic EROD activity in S9 supernatant fraction, and the frequency of micronucleated erythrocytes three days after the i.p. treatments, and compared to an unexposed group, to test its potential as a sentinel for biomonitoring studies. The EROD activity was approximately two-fold higher in fish from the impacted stretches than in fish from the less disturbed stretches (p < 0.05). Micronuclei (MN) frequency was also significantly different (p < 0.01) in DMBA-treated fish. The induced EROD activity in the impacted site suggests that organochlorinated pollutants are reaching the biota of the Paraiba do Sul River, confirming the suitability of Geophagus brasiliensis as a useful sentinel species to detect changes caused by xenobiotics.

AB  - The current land cover mapping paradigm relies on automatic classification of satellite images, with supervised methods being the most used, implying training data to have a crucial role. Aspects such as training sample size and quality should be carefully considered. This paper proposes assessing the use of a detailed class nomenclature to reinforce class diversity in the training sample. A Random Forest (RF) classification of Sentinel-2 multi-temporal data was conducted. Additionally, the effect of sample size and class distribution were evaluated. The results indicate that the use of a detailed nomenclature provided better results in terms of classification accuracy. With respect to sample distribution, adopting class sizes proportional to their occurrence in a reference land cover map exhibited superior performance in comparison to an equal size approach. The effect of sample size on classification performance was limited, as previous studies with RF suggested.

AB  - Hyperspectral satellite images provide highly-resolved spectral information for large areas. However, spaceborne imaging spectrometers are expensive and currently only a few hyperspectral satellites are in operation. This is a strong limitation, since hyperspectral satellite data provide vital information for numerous fields of application. To overcome this, we developed an emulator using machine learning techniques to generate a synthetic hyperspectral satellite image based on the relationship of a Sentinel-2 (S2) scene and a hyperspectral HyPlant airborne image. The proposed approach was tested on data sets recorded from an agricultural region in western Germany and the results show that a reliable hyperspectral image with the spectral resolution of HyPlant and the spatial extent of the S2 scene can be generated. We systematically tested the approach for different spatial resolutions, including and excluding the S2 spectral bands B1 (coastal aerosol band) and B10 (cirrus band), different machine learning regression algorithms and different numbers of training samples. The best performing parameters were: excluding B1 and B10 bands, resample to 20m and train the emulator with a Neural Networks (NN) with 100'000 samples. That emulator was then applied to the L2A (bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance) S2 subset, and obtained hyperspectral reflectance data were then compared to a reference HyPlant reflectance image of the same region. The synthetic hyperspectral S2-like map was generated quickly and a good agreement with the reference reflectance was achieved. To evaluate the result image we selected the band located at 760 nm due to its importance for the retrieval of solar-induced fluorescence. Goodness-of-fit results (R-2 of 0.92 and NRMSE of 3.87%) suggest that hyperspectral S2-like reflectance scenes can be produced with high accuracy. The emulator was then applied to a full S2 tile to generate a hyperspectral S2-like reflectance scene (60 Gb), which took less than one hour.

AB  - The Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mission was selected in 2015, by the European Space Agency (ESA), as an Earth Explorer mission, with a launch planned for 2025. The main scientific objective is the quantitative global mapping of actual photosynthetic activity of terrestrial ecosystems, and its spatial/temporal variability with vegetation health status and environmental stress conditions. The very high spectral resolution measurements (0.1 nm sampling) provided by the FLORIS instrument, with a spatial resolution of 300 m, are designed to derive, as the main mission product, the spectrally resolved fluorescence emission spectrum in the range 600-780 nm. The mission is designed to fly in tandem with Copernicus Sentinel-3. The OLCI and SLSTR instruments on Sentinel-3 provide the necessary information to retrieve the emitted fluorescence, and to allow proper interpretation of the spatial and temporal dynamics of vegetation photosynthesis from such global measurements. As the launch date approaches, the scientific community is getting ready to exploit the data, developing not only the Level-1 and Level-2 data processing but also the high level data analysis strategies, involving exploitation of FLEX data, in combination with other data sources, in data assimilation schemes into global dynamical vegetation models and terrestrial carbon cycle models. This paper addresses recent developments in mission preparation, with particular focus on mission data exploitation plans.

T2  - GE-CONSERVACION
M3  - Review
AB  - The nature of rammed earth fortifications and the environmental conditions where they are located determine the pathologies that these structures suffer in the presence of humidity sources and strong winds. The objective of this project is to revise the main mechanisms of deterioration of rammed earth fortifications and evaluate the use of remote detection as a tool to register environmental threats that affect their preservation. The selected images and satellite results offer information about precipitation, ground humidity, temperature, wind intensity and direction and the presence of particles in the wind. The use of statistical analysis methodologies for large volumes of satellite images makes it possible to acquire daily, monthly and yearly maximums, averages and minimums of these variables. The application of satellite resources GPM, SMAP, MODIS, Merra-2 and the statistical analysis of large volumes of images for preventive conservation in Andalusia has become useful to monitor the main threats that affect rammed earth fortifications on a global level: humidity, wind and temperature.

AB  - Applications from Remote Sensing (RS) unveiled unique challenges to Deep Learning (DL) due to the high volume and complexity of their data. On the one hand, deep neural network architectures have the capability to automatically extract informative features from RS data. On the other hand, these models have massive amounts of tunable parameters, requiring high computational capabilities. Distributed DL with data parallelism on High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems have proved necessary in dealing with the demands of DL models. Nevertheless, a single HPC system can be already highly heterogeneous and include different computing resources with uneven processing power. In this context, a standard data parallelism strategy does not partition the data efficiently according to the available computing resources. This paper proposes an alternative approach to compute the gradient, which guarantees that the contribution to the gradient calculation is proportional to the processing speed of each DL model's replica. The experimental results are obtained in a heterogeneous HPC system with RS data and demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a significant training speed up and gain in the global accuracy compared to one of the state-of-the-art distributed DL framework.

AB  - Satellite images can be analyzed and used for a variety of purposes. In the future, satellite image analysis will become more important since the number of satellites launches, and the amount of satellite data increase every year. Under these circumstances, there are some problems to be solved. One is the existence of low-resolution satellite images. To analyze the lower resolution of satellite images there are some technical issues such as reduction of noise, misclassification of object recognition. Therefore, high-resolution images are necessary. However, high-resolution satellite images are expensive, and its images may not be available in the past satellite images. Super-resolution which is introduced in image processing is a method to solve these problems. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods are effective, and there is a need for models that can perform super-resolution with higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose a method for super-resolving satellite images, based on the improved the RCAN (residual channel attention network) model with SRM (style-based recalibration module). The proposed method improves the PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) by 0.0181 dB compared to the conventional RCAN model.

T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The current global crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic has already become a challenge for individual national economies, as well as the global world system as a whole. The eminent English historian Toynbee (1987) wrote that the viability of a civilization depends on the extent to which its elite ("the creative minority)" can mobilize its intellectual, moral, and physical strength to respond adequately to the challenges. Therefore, challenges are necessary for humanity since without them one would deal with spiritual and intellectual stagnation. Indeed, that which does not kill us makes us stronger. This aphorism becomes especially relevant in present times when the world is concerned with what the "post-covid" world will be, what transformations the values and worldview of individuals will undergo. The coronavirus pandemic acts in this case as a catalyst and accelerator for change and forces one to pay attention to them. As Toffler (1971) once pointed out, "The inhabitants of the earth are divided not only by race, nation, religion or ideology, but also, in a sense, by their position in time". The future is rapidly coming, although only a few per cent of the entire human population "live" in the future, that is, are psychologically ready for it. The vast majority of people (more than 70 per cent of the population) live with old ideas, stereotypes, and norms of past generations. This does not mean that one should break "the link of times" and recklessly erase the historical past. However, one cannot ignore the fact that a new era is being replaced by a new one.

T2  - VESTNIK SANKT-PETERBURGSKOGO UNIVERSITETA-ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the study of the most valuable source at the culture and architecture of Persia and Central Asia during the reign of Timur (late 14th - early 15th centuries) - the diary of the Spanish ambassador to the court of Timur. At this stage in the development of re-searching on the Persian and Central Asian architecture of the Timurid period, along with the problem of "analysis" of monuments and artistic style, the problem of "synthesis" of image of these architecture is urgent. The authors of this article propose a methodology for restoring the general impression of this architecture, which can serve as a basis for the process of "synthesis", based on the study of the contemporary written source of the early 15th century - the diary of the Spanish grandee Ruy Gonzalez de Clavijo, who was part of the Spanish embassy, sent by the Castilian king Enrice III to the court of Timur at 1403-1406. Being an educated man and recep-tive to the new, Clavijo was able to isolate the characteristic features of the worldview of a man of the East, primarily an oriental despot, and the associated features of the art of the East. He and his colleagues in the embassy drew attention to the cunning, treachery, ingenuity, secrecy of the eastern rulers. The Spaniards were struck by the luxury, power and wealth of Timur's state, which at that time was at the zenith of glory. The Spaniards, accustomed to the stability of architectural images in their native Spain, were amazed at the variability of the artistic images of the East. They drew attention to the love of the representatives of the peoples of the East for free draperies, giving themselves to the will of the wind, in the temporary architecture and in festive women's clothes, that by their nature were well consistent with the decoration of architectural buildings. The Spanish envoys revealed that subservient to the first and most faithful fresh impression, tenaciously grasping the main difference between the architecture of Timur's state and contem-porary European architecture. This difference consisted in the desire to create an image that is changing, diverse, fluid, mobile, not instantly solved and full of mystery, but at the same time striking the imagination with its luxury and wealth and according to the understanding of their masters, customers and spectators. The conclusion about the specifics of Timurid architecture, made on the basis of a study of the diary of the Spanish ambassador, is supported by the authors of the article turning to the analysis of written and pictorial sources created by representatives of the studied culture itself

He knows everything from the self and knows the great secret of monotheism in the unity of these same selves.Iqbal's own theory seeks to awaken man, to make him aware of himself, and to realize his values and ideals.

The detec-tion of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) with a selective dye and further histological examination in selecting the proper (personalized) surgical strategy and the volume of surgical intervention for clinically undetermined regional lymph nodes. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of intraoperative detection of SLN with a 1% toluidine blue aque-ous solution.Material and methods: The significant tasks are to identify the pattern of TC metastases to cervical lymph nodes, to establish the prevalence of "skip" metastases, to compare the frequency of complications after total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection and lateral neck dissec-tion with total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection, and to deter-mine the feasibility of the application of lateral neck dissections in patients with papillary and follicular TC without metastases to regional lymph nodes (according to physical examination and ultrasound).Results: According to our data the SLN identification rate was 97.6%. Sensi-tivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and frequency of false negative and false positive results was 89.2, 94.6, 88.03, 95.16, 10.8, and 5.4%, respectively. The most common metastasis was in the central neck compartment (83.7%). Skip metastases were deter-mined in 4.9% of patients. Conclusions: The low prevalence of "skip" metastases and a significant risk of postoperative complications (wound exudation, lymphorrhagia, inflammation, hypoparathyroidism, paresis of the vocal cords) support the idea that lateral neck dissection is appropriate only in cases of confirmed metastases by physical examination and/or ultrasound at the preoperative stage.

AB  - The term "land cover" indicates the physical characteristics of a land (vegetation, water...), while the term "land use" is the way in which people use a land (agriculture, conservation...). Land use and land cover change (LULCC) refers to the conversion of land from one use to another. The analysis of LULCC is a real challenge and can be very useful in various fields. Forecasting deforestation, urban growth, or soil moisture, to name a few, are some of the commonly studied applications. For a very long time, predictions of LULCC were mostly made by Cellular Automata and Markov Chain (CAMarkov) methods. However, with the success of deep learning (DL) algorithms in predictive analysis, and thanks to the wide availability of satellite images, DL algorithms are increasingly being used to predict land cover changes. This paper aims at comparing these two aforementioned methods for LULCC prediction. Models based on CAMarkov, ConvLSTM and CNN-LSTM are applied in turn on Sentinel-1A images from the Bouba-Ndjida National Park (Cameroon), in order to predict the next image of the input sequence. Metrics such as the peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), the structural similarity index (SSIM), the coefficient of correlation (r), the mean squared error (MSE) and the number of pixels close to zero (NPCZ) are used to assess the models. The experimental results indicate that models based on DL algorithms, and specifically on ConvLSTM networks, are better suited for LULCC prediction.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of North African forest cover dynamics using time series of vegetation indices - case of the Maamora forest (Morocco)
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY
M3  - Article
AB  - North African forest areas play several roles and functions and represent a heritage of great economic and ecological impor-tance. As a result of global changes, that act independently or synergistically, these areas are currently undergoing a pronounced degradation and their productivity is decreasing due to several factors. This work aims to characterize spatio-temporal dynamics of vegetation within the Maamora forest. This forest is considered as the most extensive cork oak woodland in the world and is di-vided, from west to east, into five cantons A, B, C, D and E. The data, extracted between 2000-2021 from MODIS NDVI/EVI images of 250 m, were analyzed using statistical parameters with the Pettitt homogeneity and the Mann-Kendall trend tests, with their seasonal and spatial components, in order to better consider the vegetation distribution of this forest. Results show a clear temporal and spatial (inter-canton) variability of vegetation intensity, unrelated to the continental gradient. In fact, recorded mean values in cantons C and E are significantly higher than those of cantons B and D respectively. This is confirmed by both regressive and progressive trends, which were identified respectively from the months of March 2012 and October 2008, in the data series of cantons B and E successively. Spatially, the regressive dynamic remains generalized and affects more than 26.7% of the Maamo-ra's total area with extreme rates (46.1% and 14.0%) recorded respectively by the two aforementioned cantons. Similarly, all the stand types in canton B show the highest regressive rates, especially the cork oak regeneration strata (75.4%) and the bare lands (86.1%), which may explain the positive tendencies identified by the related series during the fall season. However, the cantons C and E record the lowest rates, respectively, for natural stands of cork oak and artificial plantations. These results highlight also the absence of a causal relationship between the contrasting vegetation dynamics of the Maamora and the climatic conditions, ex-pressed here by the continental gradient. However, they do highlight the effects of other factors, particularly those of a technical nature.

TI  - Assessing flooding and possible adaptation measures using remote sensing data and hydrological modeling in Sweden
T2  - CLIMATE RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, Europe is experiencing more frequent and greater floods compared to the last 500 years due to climate change among other factors. This has increased the associated risks, especially in urban areas, which poses a great challenge to all stakeholders. To protect traffic networks from possible floods, this paper uses QGIS, remote sensing data, and HEC-HMS model to assess flooding events and possible adaptation measures. Two case studies have been taken; 1) a 60-mm rain-storm that occurred in 2012 on a main road in the Northern part of Sweden (NB)); and 2) a 35 -mm rainstorm that occurred in 2019 in the Southern part of Gothenburg (GO). The resulting flood hydrographs show that the peak reached are 0.5 m3/s and 3.8 m3/s in GO and NB, respectively. To adapt to these flood events, four adaptation measures were assessed namely afforestation, permeable pavements & green roofs, multi-use detention basins and culvert installation consid-ering food production, biodiversity, prosperity, and the environment. The study has shown that afforestation is an effective flood risk mitigation measure to handle both moderate and extreme rain events. Well-maintained permeable surfaces and green roofs are effective in reducing flooding due to moderate rainfall, but not in reducing the impacts of extreme rainfall events. Well-designed multi-functional detention basins are good flood protection measures, however, if they are not well-maintained, their efficiency may be reduced by up to 90 %. Culverts are effective for frequent and limited rain events, but extreme rain events may even increase flood risk and thereby contribute to damaging the infrastructure.

TI  - Sparse Representation-Based Inundation Depth Estimation Using SAR Data and Digital Elevation Model
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods increase every year worldwide, and prompt information about the affected areas is essential for early disaster response. There has been extensive development in applying remote sensing data to identify floods. In fact, remote sensing data are the only tool to identify the extent of large-scale floods within hours after their occurrence. However, few studies have addressed methods to estimate inundation depth. Inundation depth can be advantageous for identifying areas where people may need assistance during evacuation and estimating damage loss. We present a practical application of sparse representation that integrates a synthetic aperture radar-based flood binary map with a digital elevation model to estimate inundation depths. We assume that the floodwaters can be modeled as a combination of water bodies at a state of rest. A dictionary of water bodies computed under potential inundation levels is constructed from the digital elevation model. Then, the actual flood extent is represented as a sparse linear combination of the water body dictionary. The inundation depth can be estimated because each water body from the linear combination is associated with an inundation level. To assess our proposed procedure, we computed the inundation depth of the flood in the town of Mabi, Okayama Prefecture, produced during the 2018 heavy rainfall. An average absolute value difference of about 60 cm between our results and a field survey performed by a third party was observed. Two other floods produced by the 2019 Hagibis typhoon were analyzed to illustrate the relevant information that can provide inundation depths.

TI  - ALARMISM VS ESCHATOLOGY: CONCEPTUAL ANALYSIS (ON MATERIAL OF UKRAINIAN DISCOURSE)
T2  - WISDOM
M3  - Article
AB  - The article studies and conceptualises alarmism and eschatology in the modern Ukrainian discourse. The approach to understanding the concept developed by G. Frege ("Fregean Thoughts") was used as the theoretical basis for conceptualising these categories. The research interest of the paper is caused by the identification of the content of the conceptual levels of alarmism and eschatology. The results make it possible to define alarmism as a worldview sensation of an intuitive level that historically emerged from empiricism, reflecting the readiness to overcome the current global challenges. Eschatology arises as a doctrine that accepts the finiteness of individual and universal beings. The conceptualization of alarmism and eschatology allows us to conclude that, although both categories act as a means of characterizing the state of modern global society that has lost its intentions for its development, eschatology is looking for ways to reconcile with the inevitable approaching of "end of history"; the alarmism tries to mobilize the efforts of the global society to overcome the acute challenges of our time, gives one or another problem the status of serious.
