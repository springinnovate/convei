TI  - Comprehensive evaluation of empirical algorithms for estimating land surface evapotranspiration
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many empirical algorithms for obtaining evapotranspiration (ET) from vegetation indices (VIs) have been developed, but there has been little work comparing these algorithms to each other or deriving coefficients for them using large data sets for training and validation. Twelve different vegetation index-based regression algorithms for retrieval of ET on a daily basis are reviewed and evaluated here. New coefficients have been derived for four of these algorithms using data from 181 Ameriflux and Fluxnet2015 sites and 1 km MODIS subsets centered at each site location. Algorithm validation with previously published and new coefficients was performed using one year of data from each Ameriflux and Fluxnet2015 site. There was a wide range of performance of these algorithms, with the median R-2 by site in the 0.6 to 0.7 range, median root mean square error (RMSE) about 25 W/m(2) and median bias within 10 W/m(2). When algorithm coefficients were re-derived, the RMSE and bias of the worst-performing algorithms were largely reduced, but R-2 was little changed. Agricultural and wetland sites had a low bias across most of the algorithms, and wetland sites had a higher RMSE. When several of the algorithms were re-tuned to obtain coefficients specific to each surface type, the biases of the agricultural and wetland sites were reduced to those more typical of other site types, and RMSE for agricultural and wetland sites was also reduced. The effects of linear interpolation of VIs to obtain daily LE and interpolation over periods of rapid VI change at agricultural sites were examined. No significant algorithm performance degradation was found in either case. It is recommended to use more detailed algorithms when possible, with inclusion of net radiation as a parameter along with VI at a minimum.

TI  - A model to assess microphytobenthic primary production in tidal systems using satellite remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying spatial variability in intertidal benthic productivity is necessary to guide management of estuaries and to understand estuarine ecological processes, including the amount of benthic organic carbon available for grazing, burial and transport to the pelagic zone.We developed a model to assess microphytobenthic (MPB) primary production using (1) remotely sensed information on MPB biomass and remotely sensed information on sediment mud content, (2) surface irradiance and ambient temperature (both from local meteorological observations), (3) directly-measured photosynthetic parameters and (4) a tidal model. MPB biomass was estimated using the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) and mud content was predicted using surface reflectance in the blue and near-infrared, both from Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The photosynthetic capacity (maximum photosynthesis rate normalized to MPB chl-a) was estimated from ambient temperature, while photosynthetic efficiency and the light saturation parameter were derived from in situ fluorometry-based production measurements (PAM). The influence of tides (submergence by turbid water) on MPB production was accounted for in the model. The method was validated on several locations in two temperate tidal basins in the Netherlands (Oosterschelde and Westerschelde). Model based production rates (mg C m(-2) h(-1)) matched well with an independent set of in situ (PAM) measurement based production rates (Oosterschelde: RMSE = 9.7, mean error = 1.5, chi = 0.57; Westerschelde: RMSE = 46.7, mean error = -17.6, chi = 0.9). The relationship between photosynthetic capacity and temperature shows considerable variation and may be improved by using sediment surface temperature instead of ambient temperature. A sensitivity analysis revealed that emersion duration and mud content determine most of the variability in MPB production. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to derive a satellite remote sensing based overview of average hourly and daily MPB primary production rates at the macro scale. As the proposed model is generic, the model can be applied to other tidal systems to assess spatial variability in MPB primary production at the macro scale after calibration at the site of interest. Model calibration, results and possible applications for regular monitoring of MPB production are discussed below.

TI  - Development of a conceptual warning system for toxic levels of <i>Alexandrium fundyense</i> in the Bay of Fundy based on remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Harmful algal blooms (HABs) present a potential danger for human health and commercial activities, especially in coastal regions. Observing systems increasingly rely on remote sensors to monitor and possibly predict the locations and intensity of such blooms. Here we present a novel approach for detecting HABs of Alexandrium fundyense in the Bay of Fundy, Canada. A. fundyense is considered toxic for individuals who consume shellfish when cell abundances adjacent to shellfish harvesting areas are as low as 200 cells.L-1, making it difficult to use direct remote sensing techniques to assess the threat in the early stages of the development of the bloom. Using in situ A. fundyense cell abundance measurements, together with satellite observations of sea-surface temperature and the occurrence of diatom-dominated phytoplankton populations, a warning system was developed based on three levels of alerts: green (low abundance of A. fundyense), orange (possible threat of A. fundyense) and red (high probability of A. fundyense concentrations that would result in shellfish toxicity above safe levels for human consumption). Combined information on diatom phenology and variations in sea-surface temperature are key to the timing of A. fundyense blooms: our data reveal that the termination of the diatom spring bloom, associated with the warming of the water, can trigger an increase in A. fundyense cell abundance. The objective criteria for a HAB warning system was developed and tested in the Bay of Fundy using two different datasets: one to develop the algorithm (data collected between 1998 and 2007) and one to assess its performance (data collected in 2011). The warning system is based on the cautionary principle that a false negative (warning not issued when it should have been) is far more serious than a false positive (warning issued when it should not have been). The overall success of the algorithm when tested on the validation dataset is about 70% using a threshold of 150 A. fundyense cells.L-1, with a low occurrence of false negative red alerts (< 8%). The satellite data -based warning can be used to optimize an in situ monitoring system, which can be designed to be more intensive when the warning status is orange or red. This study demonstrates that combined satellite information on phytoplankton phonology and sea-surface temperature can help predict low abundances of toxic A. fundyense cells. It also highlights the importance of an integrated approach combining satellite and in situ observations to monitor HABs.

TI  - Quantify contribution of aerosol errors to cloud fraction biases in CMIP5 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project simulations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the error sources in total cloud fraction (CF) simulated by global climate models is essential for improving climate prediction. This study investigates if and how significant the aerosol simulation errors contribute to the model CF biases in the Atmosphere Model Inter-comparison Project (AMIP) simulations of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. The aerosol optical depths (AODs) and CFs in 12 CMIP5/AMIP models have been examined and compared with 8-year moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite observations. The results show that the global-averaged multi-model ensemble mean AOD and CF, which are .14 and 56.2%, are 22.2 and 15.2% lower than those from MODIS, respectively. The simulated relationship between AOD and CF generally agrees with the observation on the global scale but differs on regional scale. Based on the conditional sampling approach, the AOD simulation errors that affect the CF biases of the models were separated from the model biases caused by the aerosol-CF errors that are related to dynamics, thermodynamics, and microphysics. It is found that the AOD errors barely contribute to the CF biases for most CMIP5/AMIP models on the global scale. Instead, simulated aerosol-CF errors are still the major contributors to the CF biases. However, we should note that AOD biases contribution in some regions, such as south Indian Ocean, Asia, Europe, and North Pacific Ocean, cannot be ignored. We also found that with increasing cloud liquid water path the CF does not increase with AOD as sensitively in the CMIP5/AMIP models as in the MODIS observations.

TI  - Refining surface net radiation estimates in arid and semi-arid climates of Iran
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the downwelling fluxes exhibit space-time scales of dependency on characteristic of atmospheric variations, especially clouds, the upward fluxes and, hence the net radiation, depends on the variation of surface properties, particularly surface skin temperature and albedo. Evapotranspiration at the land surface depends on the properties of that surface and is determined primarily by the net surface radiation, mostly absorbed solar radiation. Thus, relatively high spatial resolution net radiation data are needed for evapotran-spiration studies. Moreover, in more arid environments, the diurnal variations of surface (air and skin) temperature can be large so relatively high (sub-daily) time resolution net radiation is also needed. There are a variety of radiation and surface property products available but they differ in accuracy, space-time resolution and information content. This situation motivated the current study to evaluate multiple sources of information to obtain the best net radiation estimate with the highest space-time resolution from ISCCP FD dataset. This study investigates the accuracy of the ISCCP FD and AIRS surface air and skin temperatures, as well as the ISCCP FD and MODIS surface albedos and aerosol optical depths as the leading source of uncertainty in ISCCP FD dataset. The surface air temperatures, 10-cm soil temperatures and surface solar insolation from a number of surface sites are used to judge the best combinations of data products, especially on clear days. The corresponding surface skin temperatures in ISCCP FD, although they are known to be biased somewhat high, disagreed more with AIRS measurements because of the mismatch of spatial resolutions. The effect of spatial resolution on the comparisons was confirmed using the even higher resolution MODIS surface skin temperature values. The agreement of ISCCP FD surface solar insolation with surface measurements is good (within 2.4-9.1%), but the use of MODIS aerosol optical depths as an alternative was checked and found to not improve the agreement. The MODIS surface albedos differed from the ISCCP FD values by no more than 0.02-0.07, but because these differences are mostly at longer wavelengths, they did not change the net solar radiation very much. Therefore to obtain the best estimate of surface net radiation with the best combination of spatial and temporal resolution , we developed a method to adjust the ISCCP FD surface longwave fluxes using the AIRS surface air and skin temperatures to obtain the higher spatial resolution of the latter (45 km), while retaining the 3-h time intervals of the former. Overall, the refinements reduced the ISCCP FD longwave flux magnitudes by about 25.5-42.1 W/m(2) RMS (maximum difference -27.5 W/m(2) for incoming long-wave radiation and -59 W/m(2) for outgoing longwave radiation) with the largest differences occurring at 9:00 and 12:00 UTC near local noon. Combining the ISCCP FD net shortwave radiation data and the AIRS-modified net longwave radiation data changed the total net radiation for summertime by 4.64 to 61.5 W/m(2) and for wintertime by 1.06 to 41.88 W/m(2) (about 11.1-39.2% of the daily mean).

TI  - Global patterns of vegetation carbon use efficiency and their climate drivers deduced from MODIS satellite data and process-based models
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of net primary production (NPP) to gross primary production (GPP), represents the capacity of plants in converting assimilated atmospheric carbon dioxide to ecosystem carbon storage. Process-based models are important tools for simulating NPP and GPP; yet the model performance in simulating vegetation CUE has not been fully explored. The goal of this paper is thus to investigate the spatial variations in CUE from different process-based carbon cycle models in comparison with that from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data, and to analyze their linkage with climate factors. The global average CUE derived from the five process-based models is 0.45 +/- 0.05 (range from 0.38 to 0.52), slightly lower than the value of 0.48 obtained from MODIS data. A strong latitudinal gradient of CUE, with greater CUE at high latitudes, is well agreed by these different datasets. However, there also exist considerable discrepancies in CUE estimations among those products, especially in temperate Northern Hemisphere. Furthermore, for both the satellite-based dataset and results from process-based models, vegetation CUE declines non-linearly with increase in temperature, but remains relatively stable with enhanced precipitation. Our results also indicate that the differences in global patterns of CUE estimated by different approaches could be primarily resulted from their systematic differences in autotrophic respiration (R-a) rather than in GPP. Understanding mechanisms behind spatio-temporal changes in R-a is therefore a critical step towards better quantifying global CUE.

TI  - Addressing spatio-temporal resolution constraints in Landsat and MODIS-based mapping of large-scale floodplain inundation dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have developed novel long-term records of surface water (SW) maps on continental and global scales but due to the spatial and temporal resolution constraints of available satellite sensors, they are either of high spatial and low temporal resolution or vice versa. In this study, we address this limitation by exploring two approaches for generating an 8-day series of Landsat resolution (30 m) SW maps for three floodplain sites in south-eastern Australia during the 2010 La Nina Floods. Firstly, we applied a generalized additive regression model (GAM) that empirically relates Landsat-based SW extent to in-situ river flow to then predict additional time steps. Secondly, we used the STARFM and ESTARFM blending algorithms for predicting the Open Water Likelihood at 8-daily intervals and 30 m resolution from Landsat and MODIS imagery. ESTARFM outperformed STARFM and best blending accuracies were achieved in the floodplain site with the slowest changes in inundation extent through time. There was good agreement between the blended and statistically-modeled 8-day SW series and both series provided new and temporally consistent information about changes in inundation extent throughout the flooding cycles. After careful consideration of accuracy limitations and model assumptions, these SW records hold great potential for assimilation into hydrodynamic and hydrological models as well as improved management of terrestrial freshwater ecosystems.

TI  - Calibrating an evapotranspiration model using radiometric surface temperature, vegetation cover fraction and near-surface soil moisture data
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate representation of the partitioning between soil evaporation and plant transpiration is an asset for modeling crop evapotranspiration (ET) along the agricultural season. The Two-Surface energy Balance (TSEB) model operates the ET partitioning by using the land surface temperature (LST), vegetation cover fraction (fc), and the Priestley Taylor (PT) assumption that relates transpiration to net radiation via a fixed PT coefficient (alpha(pT)). To help constrain the evaporation/transpiration partition of TSEB, a new model (named TSEB-SM) is developed by using, in addition to LST and fc data, the near-surface soil moisture (SM) as an extra constraint on soil evaporation. An innovative calibration procedure is proposed to retrieve three key parameters: an and the parameters (a(rss) and b(rss)) of a soil resistance formulation. Specifically, a(rss) and b(rss) are retrieved at the seasonal time scale from SM and LST data with f(c) < 0.5, while apT is retrieved at the daily time scale from SM and LST data for f, > 0.5. The new ET model named TSEB-SM is tested over 1 flood- and 2 drip-irrigated wheat fields using in situ data collected during two field experiments in 2002-2003 and 2016-2017. The calibration algorithm is found to be remarkably stable as an, a and brss parameters converge rapidly in few (2-3) iterations. Retrieved values of alpha(pT), a(rss) and b(rss) are in the range 0.0-1.4, 5.7-9.5, and 1.4-6.9, respectively. Calibrated daily apT mainly follows the phenology of winter wheat crop with a maximum value coincident with the full development of green biomass and a minimum value reached at harvest. The temporal variations of alpha(pT) before senescence are attributed to the dynamics of both root-zone soil moisture. Moreover, the overall (for the three sites) root mean square difference between the ET simulated by TSEB-SM and eddy-covariance measurements is 67 W M-2 (24% relative error), compared to 108 W m(-2) (38% relative error) for the original version of TSEB using default parameterization (alpha(pT) = 1.26). Such a calibration strategy has great potential for applications at multiple scales using remote sensing data including thermal-derived LST, solar reflectance-derived f(c) and microwave-derived SM.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node metastasis in primary cutaneous basosquamous carcinoma. A cross-sectional study
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesBasosquamous carcinoma (BSC) is a rare, biologically aggressive tumor. This cross-sectional study aims to define risk factors for subclinical nodal metastasis in primary BSC, and identify the patients who would benefit from routine sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) as part of the initial management.MethodsA total of 142 patients, with histologically proven BSC without palpable lymph nodes, underwent SLNB after the initial excision. Clinicopathological features and demographics were analyzed between the patients with detected micrometastasis (SLNM) and those with negative SLN.ResultsIn 7.7% patients, subcapsular and <0.1mm SLNM were found. The frequency of SLNM was 0.9%, 11.8%, and 80.0% in patients with maximum lesion diameter2cm, 2.1-3.0cm and >3.0cm, respectively (P<0.001) and was strongly associated with perineural (P<0.001; OR=26.46, 95% CI=5.62-124.52) and lymphatic invasion (P<0.001; OR=17.35, 95% CI=4.44-67.91). Within 18-84 months, no recurrence or metastasis were observed in SLNM positive patients. False negative SLNB rate of 15.4% was recorded.ConclusionCutaneous BSC is associated with early nodal metastatic potential. Tumor size >2cm, lymphatic and perineural invasion are significant determinants for SLN micrometastasis. In the absence of palpable lymphadenopathy, wide resection and SLNB with long-term follow-up are highly recommended in these patients.

TI  - Quantification of selective logging in tropical forest with spaceborne SAR interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forest disturbance (such as selective logging and fire) along with deforestation have significant contributions to the carbon source due to land-use change and anthropogenic CO2 emissions, and thus envisioned by United Nation's REDD + programme. In previous work, spaceborne single-pass InSAR phase-center height has been shown to have the capability of accurately monitoring the subtle height change due to forest growth and degradation (with meter or even sub-meter level RMSE about the regression curve fit to time). In this paper, a new approach using spaceborne SAR interferometry has been developed to detect and quantify selective logging events. In particular, a quantitative indicator of forest disturbance is first defined, namely disturbance index (DI; from 0 "no disturbance" to 1 "deforestation"). A numerical field data-based InSAR simulation is then performed to study the functional relationship between the field-measured DI and InSAR relative phase-center height change from a modeled perspective. A selective logging event (October 2015 through January 2016) over the Tapajos National Forest in Brazil is used for experimental validation. The InSAR-inverted DI estimates derived from DLR's TanDEM-X time-series data were compared with those measured from a field work over 32 quarter hectare stands at Tapajos with relative RMSE of 30% for DI up to 0.3 and the disturbance epoch can be determined with an average accuracy of 13 days (constrained by the satellite repeat interval usually on the order of 2 weeks). As a comparison, the repeat-pass InSAR coherences from the concurrent JAXA's ALOS-2 data are shown to qualitatively correspond to the TanDEM-X results, confirming both the location and the epoch of the disturbance event. This new method is anticipated to contribute to the range of tools being developed for large-scale forest disturbance assessment and monitoring (for UN's REDD + programme) through using spaceborne single-pass InSAR missions (e.g., DLR's TanDEM-X and in the future, TanDEM-L).

TI  - Topographic changes and their driving factors after 2008 Wenchuan earthquake
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake caused topographic change in the stricken areas because of the occurrence of numerous coseismic landslides. The emergence of new landslides and debris flows and movement of loose materials under the driving force of high rainfall could further shape the local topography. Currently, little attention has been paid to continuously monitoring and assessing topographic changes after the major earthquake. In this research, we obtained an elevation dataset (2002,2010,2013 and 2015) based on digital elevation model (DEM) data and a DEM extracted from ZY-3 stereo paired images with validation by field measurement We quantitatively assessed elevation changes in different years and qualitatively analyzed spatiotemporal variation of the terrain and mass movement across the study area. The results show that the earthquake affected area experienced substantial elevation changes caused by seismic forces and subsequent rainfalls. High rainfall after the earthquake have become the biggest driver of elevation reduction, which overwhelmed elevation increase caused by the major earthquake. Increased post-earthquake erosion intensity has caused large amounts of loose materials to accumulate in river channels, and gullies and on upper-middle mountain slopes, which increases the risk of flooding and geo-hazards in the area (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating bamboo forest aboveground biomass using EnKF-assimilated MODIS LAI spatiotemporal data and machine learning algorithms
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - High-precision LAI (leaf area index) spatiotemporal data obtained from MODIS satellite remote sensing products are important for studying vegetation growth status, biomass carbon reserves, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon cycling. LAI significantly influences biomass accumulation during the growth of bamboo forest in subtropical zones. Therefore, we applied the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation algorithm to assimilate MODIS LAI products, and used assimilated LAI and the normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, simple ratio index as variables in the random forest model to estimate bamboo forest above ground biomass (AGB) in Zhejiang Province. Assimilated LAI spatiotemporal data using EnKF greatly improve the accuracy of MODIS LAI products, the R-2 between assimilated and observed LAI was 0.92, and the RMSE was 0.37. Variations in the assimilated LAI time series were consistent with the seasonal dynamics of bamboo forest growth and had a significant effect on AGB. Moreover, the random forest model had strong predictive capabilities. A comparison of training and testing results produced accuracy (R) values for the random forest model using the assimilated LAI time series of 0.71 and 0.73, respectively. Using the assimilated LAI achieved a more accurate AGB estimate than using MODIS LAI time series products, as the R values were 54.3% and 58.7% higher, and the RMSE values were 19.2% and 19.1% lower for training and testing results, respectively. The calculated spatial distribution of bamboo forest AGB in Zhejiang province was consistent with the observed values. By combining assimilation technology of the MODIS LAI time series with the random forest model to more accurately estimate bamboo forest AGB in Zhejiang province, this study provided a new method for estimating large scale forest AGB based on low-resolution time series data.

AB  - Forzieri et al. (Reports, 16 June 2017, p. 1180) used satellite data to show that boreal greening caused regional warming. We show that this positive sensitivity of temperature to the greening can be derived from the positive response of vegetation to boreal warming, which indicates that results from a statistical regression with satellite data should be carefully interpreted.

TI  - Evaluation of remote sensing-based evapotranspiration estimates using a water transfer numerical simulation under different vegetation conditions in an arid area
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Daily actual evapotranspiration (AET) and seasonal AET values are of great practical importance in the management of regional water resources and hydrological modelling. Remotely sensed AET models and Landsat satellite images have been used widely in producing AET estimates at the field scale. However, the lack of validation at a high spatial frequency under different soil water conditions and vegetation coverages limits their operational applications. To assess the accuracies of remote sensing-based AET in an oasis-desert region, a total of 59 local-scale daily AET time series, simulated using HYDRUS-1D calibrated with soil moisture profiles, were used as ground truth values. Of 59 sampling sites, 31 sites were located in the oasis subarea and 28 sites were located in the desert subarea. Additionally, the locally validated mapping evapotranspiration at high resolution with internalized calibration surface energy balance model was employed to estimate instantaneous AET values in the area containing all 59 of the sampling sites using seven Landsat subimages acquired from June 5 to August 24 in 2011. Daily AET was obtained using extrapolation and interpolation methods with the instantaneous AET maps. Compared against HYDRUS-1D, the remote sensing-based method produced reasonably similar daily AET values for the oasis sites, while no correlation was observed for daily AET estimated using these two methods for the desert sites. Nevertheless, a reasonable monthly AET could be estimated. The correlation analysis between HYDRUS-1D-simulated and remote sensing-estimated monthly AET values showed relative root-mean-square error values of 15.1%, 12.1%, and 12.3% for June, July, and August, respectively. The root mean square error of the summer AET was 10.0%. Overall, remotely sensed models can provide reasonable monthly and seasonal AET estimates based on periodic snapshots from Landsat images in this arid oasis-desert region.

TI  - An active fire detection algorithm based on multi-temporal FengYun-3C VIRR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visible and Infra-Red Radiometer (VIRR) is an improved third-generation sensor used for Earth observation with channels ranging from visible to thermal bands and carried on board the Chinese FengYun-3C satellite. An active fire detection algorithm based on VIRR data has already been designed and tested in different study areas worldwide. Most of the previously related algorithms were developed merely focusing on the spatial and spectral features of pixels while the temporal attributes of these observed active fires were ignored. In this research, multi-temporal VIRR data were used to construct time series of pixels. The core content of the algorithm consists of the changes in the time-series profiles together with the observed data. By calculating the predicted mid infrared (MIR) value and the stable MIR value of the target area, fire pixels can be easily distinguished. To assess the performance of this algorithm, a total of eight target areas distributed across the world were used for testing. Two stages of validation were carried out with data of different spatial resolutions. A rough comparison was carried out first. During this step, results from Collection 6 of MODIS Fire and Thermal Anomalies products (MOD14A1) and results generated from the previously used algorithm were used for comparison. The detailed validation work was conducted with the support of Landsat series (including ETM + and OLI sensors) data even though the different imaging time may affect the actual validation results.

TI  - Hierarchical Bayesian space-time estimation of monthly maximum and minimum surface air temperature
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface air temperature (SAT) is a critical metric that is used to assess regional warming and cooling patterns, and maximum and minimum SATs are required to evaluate the model predictions of climate extremes. Since station SAT data are irregularly distributed, land surface temperature (LST) values derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data are used to estimate regional SAT by using linear regression methods. The deviations between SAT and LST are largely dependent on space and time, which hampers the estimation of linear regression, especially for the maximum SAT. To obtain accurate regional SAT estimates, a three-stage hierarchical Bayesian (HB) model is proposed that incorporates the MODIS LSTs as model covariates and specifies the deviations with structured dependence of MODIS LST fields. Sampling of model parameters and estimation of SAT values are implemented under the Bayesian paradigm using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. Sensitivity analyses involving various model configurations and running processes are discussed to help build a robust HB model. The model's performance is evaluated using station measurements that are not used in the modeling process, with RMSEs of 2.15 K (0.75%) and 1.97 K (0.73%) for monthly maximum and minimum SATs, respectively. The evaluation indicates that HB modeling is an effective method to estimate SAT from MODIS LST. The verified HB model with the covariate inputs of both MODIS daytime and nighttime LSTs is used to reproduce monthly maximum and minimum SATs that are spatially continuous over the Qinghai province in Northwestern China for 2003-2011. From the comparison between MODIS LST and HB-estimated SAT, it is found that the spatial structure and warming patterns of LST and SAT show significant distinctions, implying that they cannot be substituted for one another when assessing the regional warming trends. The spatial heterogeneity of HB model estimation is able to provide thorough insights into regional SAT status changes that could otherwise be biased by station deployment.

TI  - High serum vascular endothelial growth factor C predicts better relapse-free survival in early clinically node-negative breast cancer.
T2  - Oncotarget
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A recent meta-analysis indicated that higher tumoral expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C) was related to poorer relapse-free and overall survival in breast cancer patients. However, a retrospective study found that higher circulating VEGF-C levels were associated with better survival in breast cancer patients. In 2009, we initiated a prospective study to determine the utility of preoperative serum VEGF-C levels for predicting the risk of sentinel lymph node involvement in early breast cancer and to assess serum VEGF-C levels as a prognostic factor for relapse-free and overall survival. We analyzed serum samples from 174 patients with early breast cancer who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsies. VEGF-C levels were determined using an ELISA. Serum VEGF-C levels were normally distributed, with a median value of 6561.5 pg/mL, and did not correlate with any other clinical or pathological variables. During a median follow-up period of 58 months, the five-year relapse-free survival rate was higher in patients with VEGF-C levels above the median than in patients with lower levels (95.3% vs. 85.9%, p < 0.04). No association was found between VEGF-C levels and overall survival. Our study demonstrates that the prognosis was better for early breast cancer patients with high serum VEGF-C levels.

TI  - Lidar supported estimators of wood volume and aboveground biomass from the Danish national forest inventory (2012-2016)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - National forest inventories (NFI) provide estimates of forest resources at the national and regional level but are also increasingly used as basis for mapping forest resources based on remotely sensed data. Such maps procure local estimates of forest resources but may also improve precision of national and regional estimates. Supported by a countrywide airborne laser scanning (circa 2014) and a national land-use map (circa 2014), direct (DI), model-assisted (MA), and model calibrated (MC) estimates of wood volume (V) and aboveground biomass (AGB) densities in forest areas derived from the Danish NFI (2012-2016) are presented. Nonlinear models with three LiDAR metrics are used to predict V and AGB in forested areas. According to these models, the predicted values of V and AGB in sample plots missed in the field inventory was lower than in those visited in the field; we therefore opted for estimation with multiple (stochastic) imputations. MA estimates for the country suggested a 2% lower level of both V and AGB densities with errors 45% lower than estimated errors in DI results. National MC estimates were close to the DI estimates with an error approximately 40% lower than errors in DI estimates yet 5% greater than the MA estimates of error. Multiple imputations had the strongest impact on DI estimates, but only a weak impact on MA and MC results.

TI  - Productivity of an Australian mountain grassland is limited by temperature and dryness despite long growing seasons
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Changing climates have extended growing seasons and increased vegetation productivity in many northern ecosystems, but less is known about Southern Hemisphere counterparts. Among the more dramatic changes are reductions in winter snow cover in mountainous ecosystems in southeastern Australia; some forecasts predict almost complete absence of snow by 2050. We used the eddy covariance technique in a montane grassland (Nimmo) of the Snowy Mountains, which was a carbon sink of 26-185 g C m(-2) yr(-1) from 2007-2014 but was temperature- and moisture-limited. Higher soil temperatures increased net productivity at a rate of about 2.2 g C m(-2)month(-1) per 1 degrees C, when soil water content was not limiting. Carbon uptake of Australian mountain grasslands may therefore increase in a warming climate, provided growing season precipitation remains adequate. We used the MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to monitor phenology at Nimmo from 2001-2016. We also recorded daily estimates of greenness from digital imagery (i.e. PhenoCam) and found close correspondence between satellite and near-surface greenness indices in 2015, suggesting that remote sensing can reliably extend PhenoCam records. Mean growing season length (244 days) did not change over the study period and was two weeks longer than mountain grasslands in the Northern Hemisphere. The longer Australian growing season is not correlated with productivity and is likely attributable to the lower latitude of the Snowy Mountains (36 degrees S) and mild Australian climate. Green-up of the grassland advanced by 16 days over the past 15 years, seemingly as a result of increasing August (late winter) temperature. Grass senescence (i.e. yellowing) was most closely related to vapor pressure deficit in March (early autumn). When high temperatures (14 C) and low rainfall (<= 50 mm) resulted in high March VPD (similar to 0.7 kPa), grass yellowed nearly 3 months early and the growing season was < 200 days. These results suggest there is a tipping point beyond which high summer VPD prevents late-season recovery of Australian mountain grasslands.

TI  - The accuracy of snow melt-off day derived from optical and microwave radiometer data - A study for Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the methodology for deriving yearly pixel-wise snow melt-off day maps from optical data based FSC (Fractional Snow Cover) without conducting any interpolation for cloud-obscured pixels or otherwise missing data. The Copernicus CryoLand Pan-European FSC time series for 2001-2016 re-gridded to 0.1 degrees serves as input for the production of 16 years of melt-off day maps for Europe. These maps are compared with passive microwave radiometer (MWR) melt retrievals, to compare the performance of these two independent datasets, particularly concerning the effect of physiographic and snow conditions on the accuracy of the melt-off day estimates. Both these datasets are evaluated against melt-off day derived from in situ snow depth (SD) time series observed at European weather stations. We also present the relationship of these snow melt-off day products to a passive microwave radiometer-derived landscape freeze/thaw product.Our results show that the melt-off day derived from optical springtime FSC time series provides the strongest correlation with the snow melt-off day with respect to the in situ data. Overall the deviation of CryoLand FSC data derived melt-off day to that indicated by in situ observations is quite small, with positive bias of 0.9 days, and RMSE of 13.1 days. For 85% of the analyzed cases the differences are between 10 days. Across Europe the MWR-based detection of melt-off day is less accurate; the investigated method performs the best for areas with sustained seasonal snow cover. Based on the time series for MWR-based melt-off day (1980-2016) and FT-ESDR (1980-2014), separately for boreal forests and tundra, we also found a clear trend towards earlier snow clearance: a decrease of melt-off day by as much as 5 days per decade in boreal forest region was observed.

TI  - SCOPE model applied for rapeseed in Spain
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The integrated SCOPE (Soil, Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy balance) model, coupling radiative transfer theory and biochemistry, was applied to a biodiesel crop grown in a Spanish agricultural area. Energy fluxes and CO2 exchange were simulated with this model for the period spanning January 2008 to October 2008. Results were compared to experimental measurements performed using eddy covariance and meteorological instrumentation. The reliability of the model was proven by simulating latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes, soil heat flux (G), and CO2 exchanges (NEE and GPP). LAI data used as input in the model were retrieved from the MODIS and MERIS sensors. SCOPE was able to reproduce similar seasonal trends to those measured for NEE, GPP and LE. When considering H, the modelled values were underestimated for the period covering July 2008 to mid -September 2008. The modelled fluxes reproduced the observed seasonal evolution with determination coefficients of over 0.77 when LE and H were evaluated. The modelled results offered good agreement with observed data for NEE and GPP, regardless of whether LAI data belonged to MODIS or MERIS, showing slopes of 0.87 and 0.91 for NEE-MODIS and NEE-MERIS, and 0.91 and 0.94 for GPP-MODIS and GPP-MERIS, respectively. Moreover, SCOPE was able to reproduce similar seasonal behaviours to those observed for the experimental carbon fluxes, clearly showing the CO2 sink/source behaviour for the whole period studied.

TI  - Scaling up spring phenology derived from remote sensing images
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology, especially spring phenology, has been reported as a powerful indicator of ecosystem responses to climate change. It also exerts strong control on the carbon, water and energy balances and, hence, climatic feedbacks. Researchers have produced numerous spring phenology products from various coarse-resolution remote sensing data at regional or global scales. Scaling up observations of spring phenology from plot level (or finer resolution) to coarser resolution is important for the validation, synthesis, and evaluation of those products. The best method for scaling up is unclear although coarse resolution data can be obtained by averaging across fine-scale pixels, or selecting the start of spring phenology (SOS) date associated with the earliest 30% (or another percentile) of fine-scale pixels within a coarse-scale pixel. In this study, we tested different methods that were average and percentile approaches to aggregate SOS as measured at 250 m (SOS (250 m)) resolution to 8 km (SOS (8 km)) resolution pixels, and then to ecosystems and national scales for the continental United States. The results indicated that the average absolute difference (AAD) between SOS (250 m) and SOS (8 km) from the average approach was close to that achieved by the percentile approach. Relatively large AAD values occurred in the western and southern regions of the continental United States. The distribution of AAD was positively related to landscape heterogeneity. The percentile approach generally yielded smaller AADs than the average approach did, but these two approaches performed similarly. Across landscapes and ecosystems, the optimal percentile usually ranged from 30-45th instead of a single value. Our findings indicated that the percentile approach may be best for finer scale areas, but that the average approach is an adequate alternative for scaling up SOS in most circumstances. In addition, the detailed error distributions of scaling up spring phenology across scales are helpful to identify the appropriate method of scaling up for validating the coarse SOS products derived from remote sensing images.

TI  - Using phenology-based enhanced vegetation index and machine learning for soybean yield estimation in Parana State, Brazil
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely regional estimates of agricultural production are key for decision makers. This study aims to understand how different machine learning techniques impact soybean yield estimation in extracting maximum information from remotely sensed MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI) that is constrained by phenology. Specifically, a methodology is developed for incorporating phenological information aligned with EVI acquisition for each pixel and selecting the most significant predictors out of 36 predictors using feature selection. These predictors were then used in four machine learning algorithms (MLA) to obtain soybean yield estimates for observed farms in the Parana State, Brazil. The optimal MLAwas then implemented for the whole state to obtain regional soybean yield. The gradient boosting model (GBM) with all 36 predictors performed well with a mean difference of 3.5 kg ha(-1), an RMSD of 373 kg ha(-1), and Willmott's d of 0.85, however, the random forest (RF) algorithm using five optimal EVI predictors presented similar results, but with considerably less computational time. Both GBM and RF provided higher regional yields compared to the officially reported yields by 1775 x 10(3) and 2059 x 10(3) metric tons, respectively. The RF with five EVI predictors provided the best results for regional soybean estimations, considering the accuracy and computational performances.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to model deforestation susceptibility in forest ecosystem of Rudraprayag district, India. For this purpose, site-specific physical (slope angle, slope aspect, altitude, annual average rainfall, soil texture, soil depth), and anthropogenic (population distribution, distance from road, distance from settlement, proximity to agricultural land) deforestation conditioning factors were chosen. Landsat TM and OLI images for 1990 and 2015 were utilized to evaluate the changes in forest cover. The frequency ratio model was used for deforestation susceptibility mapping. The extent of deforestation was examined by overlaying forest fragmentation map and deforestation susceptibility map. The results showed that about 112.5 km(2) forest area has been deforested over the last 25 years. Of the total existing forest, nearly 10% area falls under very high, 17% under high and 30% under moderate deforestation susceptibility categories. Patch, edge and perforated have influenced high (64%) and very high (81%) deforestation susceptibility zones. The integrated methodology involving frequency ratiomodel, fragmentation approach and remote sensing and GIS techniques has proved useful in analyzing deforestation susceptibility and identifying its causative factors. Thus, the methodology adopted in this study can best be utilized for effective planning and management of forest ecosystem. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping spatio-temporal dynamics of the cover and management factor (C-factor) for grasslands in Switzerland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The decrease in vegetation cover is one of the main triggering factors for soil erosion of grasslands. Within the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE), a model commonly used to describe soil erosion, the vegetation cover for grassland is expressed in the cover and management factor (C-factor). The site-specific C-factor is a combination of the relative erosion susceptibility of a particular plant development stage (here expressed as soil loss ratio SLR) and the corresponding rainfall pattern (here expressed as R-factor ratio). Thus, for grasslands the fraction of green vegetation cover (FGVC) determines the SLRs. Although Switzerland is a country dominated by grassland with high percentages of mountainous regions and evidence for high erosion rates of grassland exists, soil erosion risk modeling of grasslands and especially of mountainous grasslands in Switzerland is restricted to a few studies. Here, we present a spatio-temporal approach to assess the dynamics of the C-factor for Swiss grasslands and to identify erosion prone regions and seasons simultaneously. We combine different satellite data, aerial data, and derivative products like Climate Change Initiative (CCI) Land Cover, Swissimage false-color infrared (Swissimage FCIR), PROBA-V Fraction of green Vegetation Cover (FCover300m), and MODIS Vegetation Indices 16-Day L3 Global (MOD13Q1) for the FGVC mapping of grasslands. In the spatial mapping, the FGVC is extracted from Swissimage FCIR (spat. res. 2 m) by linear spectral unmixing (LSU). The spatially derived results are then fused with the 10-day deviations of temporal FGVC derived by FCover300m. Following the original RUSLE approach, the combined FGVC are transformed to SLRs and weighted with high spatiotemporal resolved ratios of R-factors to result in spatio-temporal C-factors for Swiss grasslands. The annual average C-factor of all Swiss grasslands is 0.012. Seasonal and regional patterns (low C in winter, high C in summer, dependency on elevation) are recognizable in the spatio-temporal mapping approach. They are mainly explicable by the R-factor distribution within a year. Knowledge about the spatio-temporal dynamic of erosion triggering factors is of high interest for agronomists who can introduce areal and time specific selective erosion control measures and thereby reduce the direct costs of mitigation as well as erosion measures.

TI  - Comparison of sentinel lymph node biopsy guided by blue dye with or without indocyanine green in early breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThere were limited data available for a head-to-head comparison of the identification rate and survival between the combined method of indocyanine green fluorescence and blue dye versus the traditional blue dye alone method for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy.MethodsFrom January 2013 to December 2015, 523 eligible breast cancer patients were included in this nonrandomized prospective analysis. The identification rates, the number of SLNs identified, and the disease-free survival (DFS) between the two mapping methods were compared.ResultsThe identification rate of SLNs was significantly higher with the combined method than that with the blue dye alone method (99.2% vs 93.3%, respectively; P<0.001). The average number of SLNs identified per patient in the combined method group was 3.72.4, which was more than that in the blue dye alone group (3.2 +/- 1.6; P=0.004). With a median follow-up of 29 months, 0.5% patients in the combined group, and 1.3% patients in the blue dye group had axillary recurrences. The DFS between the two groups showed no significant difference (P=0.161).ConclusionThe combined method achieved a higher identification rate and lower rate of axillary recurrence compared to the blue dye alone method.

TI  - DNA damage and micronuclei in parthenogenetic and bisexual <i>Darevskia</i> rock lizards from the areas with different levels of soil pollution
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural species are widely used as indicator organisms to estimate of the impact of environmental pollution. Here we present the results of first study of a reliability of parthenogenetic Darevskia armeniaca and bisexual Darevskia raddei rock lizards as sentinels for monitoring of environmental genotoxicity. The comet assay and micronucleus test were applied to the lizards sampled in six areas in Armenia and Artsakh with different levels of soil contamination. The results obtained showed a clear relationship between the pollution level of lizards' habitats and the frequency of DNA damage in the comet assay. Low baseline frequency of micronuclei in D. armeniaca and D. raddei, however, makes this parameter ineffective for environmental genotoxicity evaluation. The parthenogenetic lizards D. armeniaca showed higher sensitivity toward genotoxic pollutions compared with bisexual D. raddei living in the same environment. The correlations between soil content of heavy metals Cr, Cu, Zn, Mo, Pb and DNA damage in D. armeniaca and between Cu, As, Mo, Pb and DNA damage in D. raddei were revealed. Overall, the lizards D. raddei and D. armeniaca appeared to be sensitive species in detecting soil pollution in natural environment. The application of the comet assay in Darevskia lizard species can be considered as a more appropriate method than a micronucleus test. The use of parthenogenetic lizards D. armeniaca as bioindicator will permit to assess the environmental genotoxicity independent of the genetic polymorphism of bisexual species.

TI  - Long-term surface water changes and driving cause in Xiong'an, China: from dense Landsat time series images and synthetic analysis
T2  - SCIENCE BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - China's government statement recently reported the plan of constructing Xiong'an New Area, which aims to phase out some extra capital functions from Beijing and to explore an innovative urban development mode with the priority in eco-environmental protection. The New Area is located in the semi-arid North China Plain (NCP) and is home to NCP's largest natural freshwater wetland, Baiyangdian Lake. A comprehensive realization of surface water dynamics would be crucial for policy-makers to outline a sustainable environment development strategy for New Area. In this study, we used a total of 245 time slices of cloud-free Landsat images to document the continuous changes of water bodies within Xiong'an City during 1984-2016 and to provide detailed evidence of water presence and persistency states and changes under the influences of climate change and human actions. Our results reveal that the New Area water body areas varied dramatically during the past 33 years, ranging from 0.44 km(2) in April 1988 to 317.85 km(2) in February 1989. The change of surface water area was not characterized by a monotonically decreasing tendency. The evolution processes can be divided into four sub-stages: the first extreme desiccation in mid-1980s, the wet stage with the most extensive inundation areas and strong inter-annual fluctuations from late-1988 to late 1999, another desiccation stage in early 2000s, and the overall recovering stage between 2007 and 2016. We also mapped the maximum water inundation extents and frequencies of all-season, pre-wet season (February-May) and post-wet season (September-December) for the 33 years and different sub-periods. Although there is good agreement between time series of surface water area evolution in the New Area and station-based precipitation and evaporation variations, multiple lines of evidences reviewed in previous research indicate that the degraded Baiyangdian Lake was also tightly associated with human activities from various aspects, including dam construction, groundwater extraction, agricultural irrigation, etc. We highlighted the current status of exploring the driving mechanism of surface water changes and existing problems, and then offer recommendations.

TI  - Long-term record of top-of-atmosphere albedo over land generated from AVHRR data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) albedo is a fundamental component of Earth's energy budget. To date, long-term global land TOA albedo products with spatial resolution higher than 20-km are not available. In this study, we propose a novel algorithm to retrieve TOA albedo from multispectral imager observations acquired by Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which provides the longest continuous record of global satellite observations since 1981. Direct estimation models were established first to derive instantaneous TOA broadband albedo under various atmospheric and surface conditions, including cloudy-sky, clear-sky (snow-free) and snow cover conditions. To perform long-term series analysis, the instantaneous TOA albedo were then converted to daily/monthly mean values based on the diurnal curves from multi-year Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) 3-hourly flux dataset. Calibration differences between sequential AVHRR sensors were further mitigated by invariant targets normalization. The retrieved TOA albedo at 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees was validated against two TOA albedo datasets, CM SAF (Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility) flux data and CERES flux data, at spatial resolutions of 0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees, 20 km x 20 km and 1 degrees x 1 degrees. The instantaneous TOA albedo had an overall Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) of 0.047 when compared with 20-km CERES fluxes, whereas the 1 degrees by 1 degrees monthly mean TOA albedo showed closer agreements with both CM SAF and CERES, with RMSE ranging from 0.029 to 0.040 and from 0.022 to 0.031, respectively. Moreover, our product was found to be highly consistent with both CERES and CM SAF at long-term trend detection. The extensive validation indicated the robustness of our algorithm and subsequently, comparable data quality with existing datasets. With global coverage and long time series (1981-2017), our product is expected to provide valuable information for climate change studies.

TI  - Estimating sowing dates from satellite data over the US Midwest: A comparison of multiple sensors and metrics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop sowing date information is important for driving crop models and estimating crop yield. However, data on sowing dates are often scarce for both developed and developing countries, making remote sensing approaches to map sowing date an attractive approach. Yet the relative merits of different satellite sensors and metrics to estimate sowing date have not been well studied. We assess and compare the accuracies and uncertainties of satellite-derived sowing date estimates using different metrics (inflection point and threshold approaches) and satellite sensors that cover the range in the electromagnetic spectrum (optical, fluorescence, and radar). We validate these estimates using a county-level dataset derived from area-weighted field-level reported sowing dates for maize and soybean in the US states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana, and conduct our analysis both at the county level and at the aggregated tri-state region. We specifically use the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) and Ku-band backscattering from QuikSCAT (dB). We also compare the inflection point method and the threshold approach that defines sowing date as a specific threshold value (10%, 30% and 50%) between the minimum and maximum value in a logistic-curve smoothed phonology. We find that satellite-based estimate of sowing dates from all methods and sensors shows a wide range of predictive power at the county level, with R-2 ranging between 0.15 and 0.90, with significant variation across sensors. SIF has excellent prediction for more counties than the other sensors, but EVI performs more consistently with moderate to good prediction for the greatest bulk of counties among all sensors, while dB's predicted sowing dates are negatively correlated with observed dates for most counties. For each sensor, aggregation to the regional level produces time series of predicted sowing dates that more successfully capture linear time trends and inter-annual variability. Adjusting for spring temperatures and crop areal coverage significantly improves the accuracies of the estimated sowing dates at both the county and regional scales. Among the combinations of the three satellite products and four metrics, we find using SIF and/or EVI and the 30% threshold metric have the highest accuracies in terms of reproducing inter-annual variability and minimizing RMSE at regional scales. This study provides a systematic assessment of using different satellite sensors and metrics to estimate county- to regional scale crop sowing dates, which has important implications for mapping sowing date in data-limited regions across the globe.

TI  - Snow cover phenology affects alpine vegetation growth dynamics on the Tibetan Plateau: Satellite observed evidence, impacts of different biomes, and climate drivers
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Alpine vegetation plays a crucial role in global carbon cycle. Snow cover is an essential component of alpine land cover and shows high sensitivity to climate change. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) has a typical alpine vegetation ecosystem and is rich of snow resources. With global warming, the snow of the TP has undergone significant changes that will inevitably affect the growth of alpine vegetation, but observed evidence of such interaction is limited. In particular, a comprehensive understanding of the responses of alpine vegetation growth to snow cover variability is still not well characterized on TP region. To investigate this, we calculated three indicators, the start (SOS) and length (LOS) of growing season, and the maximum of normalized difference vegetation index (NOVImax) as proxies of vegetation growth dynamics from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data for 2000-2015. Snow cover duration (SCD) and melt (SCM) dates were also extracted during the same time frame from the combination of MODIS and the Interactive Multi-sensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) data. We found that the snow cover phenology had a strong control on alpine vegetation growth dynamics. Furthermore, the responses of SOS, LOS and NDVImax to snow cover phenology varied among different biomes, eco-geographical zones, and temperature and precipitation gradients. The alpine steppes showed a much stronger negative correlation between SOS and SCD, and also a more evidently positive relationship between LOS and SCD than other types, indicating a longer SCD would lead to an earlier SOS and longer LOS. Most areas showed positive correlation between SOS and SCM, while a contrary response was also found in the warm but drier areas. Both SCD and SCM showed positive correlations with NDVImax, but the relationship became weaker with the increase of precipitation. Our findings provided strong evidence between vegetation growth and snow cover phenology, and changes in snow cover should be also considered when analyzing alpine vegetation growth dynamics in future,

TI  - Temporal and spatial changes in estimated near-surface air temperature lapse rates on Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lapse rate (LR) of near-surface (2 m) air temperature is essential for determining spatially distributed and gridded air temperature interpolated from in situ observational sites. However, due to the limitation of sparse observational networks, high-resolution LRs are not usually available on regional scales, especially in mountainous regions. The purpose of this study is to estimate LRs for the entire Tibetan Plateau (TP) using observed air temperature and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) night-time land surface temperatures (LSTs) and to analyse the spatio-temporal changes of the estimated LRs. First, diurnal cycles of LRs derived from in situ observations in three subregions of the TP were analysed, which shows that the LRs in the western and northeastern regions were shallow in the cold season and steep in the warm season, whereas the southeastern region exhibited a different pattern. Further comparisons revealed that the LRs for night-time air temperatures better represented the LRs for daily mean air temperatures than the daytime ones, and the night-time MODIS LSTs correlated well with the night-time air temperatures, especially for the MODIS Terra data sets. Therefore, the night-time MODIS LSTs from the Terra data sets were used to estimate high-resolution (10 km) LRs for the daily mean temperatures over the entire TP. Estimated LRs over most areas of the TP were shallower than the commonly used environmental LR (-6.5 K/km). The LRs in the southeastern region were steeper than those in the northeastern region, while steeper LR values occurred in the northwestern region with lower temperatures and less humidity.

TI  - Measuring spatio-temporal dynamics of impervious surface in Guangzhou, China, from 1988 to 2015, using time-series Landsat imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the spatio-temporal change characteristics of urban development at different scales with time-series impervious surface fractions. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images were used to extract impervious surface fractions using a modified linear spectral mixture analysis method in Guangzhou from 1988 to 2015. The results indicated that the impervious surface area has substantially increased, from 70.3 km(2) in 1988 to 580.5 km(2) in 2015. In 2015, the impervious surfaces were distributed almost throughout the whole region of the study area, except in the forest region. Next, impervious surface weighted mean centre (ISWMC) and the standard deviational ellipse (SDE) methods were used to systematically analyse the principle orientation, direction, spatio-temporal expansion trends, and the distribution differences of impervious surfaces at the whole and local region scales from 1988 to 2015. The spatio-temporal dynamics of ISWMC exhibited different expansion directions and intensities of impervious surfaces at the whole and local region scales. On a whole region scale, the principle expansion direction of impervious surfaces was northward. However, the expansion trend of impervious surfaces in the different districts was significantly different from other trends at the local region scale. The parameters of SDE were used to investigate the orientation and the clustering or dispersion degree of impervious surface at different scales. The results from SDE analysis indicated that the impervious surfaces exhibited uncertainty in the expansion direction at the whole region scale; in contrast, they had a distinct preferred orientation and expansion direction at the local region scale. The analysis revealed that urban expansion exhibited different change characteristics in various directions at the local region scale. In summary, the results at the local region scale can better reflect the change trajectory of spatio-temporal dynamics of urban development and its fine spatial structure than at the whole region scale.

TI  - Effects of image pansharpening on soil total nitrogen prediction models in South India
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Image fusion is in its infancy in the application of Digital Soil Mapping, and the incorporation of the image pansharpened spectral indices into the soil prediction models has seldom been analyzed. This research performed image pansharpening of Landsat 8, WorldView-2, and Pleiades-1A in a smallholder village called Masuti in South India using three pansharpening techniques: Brovey, Gram-Schmit (GS), and Intensity-Hue-Saturation (IHS) methods. The research analyzed the relationships between multispectral (MS) and pansharpened (PAN) spectral indices and soil total nitrogen (TN), developed the soil TN prediction models using Random Forest methods, and explored the effects of different PAN spectral indices on soil TN prediction models. The results showed the spectral behavior of PAN spectral indices and MS spectral indices were similar. The results also demonstrated that soil TN models based on MS/PAN spectral indices have slightly higher model performance and more detailed characterization of TN spatial pattern compared with soil TN models based on MS spectral indices. Soil TN models based on the GS PAN and MS spectral indices attained slightly higher prediction accuracy compared with those based on other PAN and MS spectral indices. This research advocates the promotion of image pansharpening techniques in digital soil mapping and soil nutrient management research.

TI  - Improved detection of low stratus and fog at dawn from dual geostationary (COMS and FY-2D) satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel method was proposed to detect low stratus and fog (LSF) at dawn during the summertime using near simultaneous observations from dual geostationary-orbit satellites (GEOs): the Korean Communication, Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS; 128.2 degrees E) and the Chinese Feng-Yun-2D (FY-2D; 86.5 degrees E). The orbital positions of the GEOs provided a large difference (similar to 46.5 degrees) in the viewing zenith angle (VZA) in the study region (122-132 degrees E, 32.5-42.5 degrees N) and high contrast observations at dawn. Numerical simulations were carried out to derive the optical properties of the LSF and the radiative differences between the GEOs due to both the VZA and spectral response function (SRF). The conventional threshold method, which used the visible reflectance at 0.67 mu m (120.67) and the brightness temperature difference between 3.7 mu m and 11 mu m (BTD3.7-11), had limitations in detecting LSF at dawn due to weak visible light and fast night-to-day transition. We utilized the observed stereo differences (Delta R-0.67, Delta BTD3.7-11) between the two GEOs to improve LSF detection. The dual-satellite observations were verified with ground-based data from 45 stations in South Korea co-located with each GEO pixel. The Delta R-0.67 threshold value showed better accuracy (78% vs. 67%) than the conventional R-0.67 threshold method. In addition, the Delta BTD3.7-11 threshold was better (55% vs. 38%) than the Delta BTD3.7-11 threshold. The dual-satellite method allowed more reliable LSF detection using the combination of Delta R-0.67 and R-0.67, particularly for LSF without cumuliform or high clouds. Our method is applicable to multiple geostationary satellites for continuous LSF monitoring.

TI  - Deriving high-quality surface emissivity spectra from atmospheric infrared sounder data using cumulative distribution function matching and principal component analysis regression
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) provides limited hyperspectral thermal infrared (TIR) emissivity data for the retrieval of critical land surface and climate parameters in environmental research. However, the AIRS land surface emissivity (LSE) data lack accuracy, resulting in low-quality data retrieval, particularly for the lower boundary layer. In this study, a practical and effective method is proposed to derive high-accuracy AIRS LSE data and continuous emissivity spectra in the TIR range of 8-14.5 mu m. The AIRS LSE is first rescaled to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LSE using cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching, and then the emissivity spectra are recovered from the rescaled AIRS LSE using principal component analysis (PCA) regression. The results show that resealing the AIRS LSE significantly reduced the bias and root mean square (RMS) error in the study area of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, and PCA regression successfully recovered the emissivity spectra in the 8-14.5 mu m range from the resealed AIRS LSE. At two validation sites in the Namib and Kalahari deserts of southern Africa, the biases of the resealed AIRS LSE at three hinge points are 0.62% and 0.61%, respectively, and the biases of the recovered AIRS LSE spectra in the 8-12 mu m TIR range are 0.53% and 0.56%, respectively. Variations in land cover homogeneity and the accuracy of the MODIS LSE are the critical factors impacting the final accuracy of the rescaled AIRS LSE and the recovered emissivity spectra.

TI  - Evaluation of land surface phenology from VIIRS data using time series of PhenoCam imagery
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely retrieved from time series of various satellite instruments in order to monitor climate change and ecosystem dynamics. However, any evaluation of the quality of LSP data sets is quite challenging because the in situ observations on a limited number of individual trees, shrubs, or other plants are rarely representative of the landscape sampled in a single satellite pixel. Moreover, vegetation indices detecting biophysical features of vegetation seasonality are different from (but related to) the specific plant life history stages observed by humans at ground level. This study is the first comprehensive evaluation of the LSP product derived from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data using both MODIS LSP products and observations from the PhenoCam network across the Contiguous United States during 2013 and 2014. PhenoCam observes vegetation canopy over a landscape at very high frequency, providing nearly continuous canopy status and enabling the estimate of discrete phenophase using vegetation indices that are conceptually similar to satellite data. Six phenological dates (greenup onset, mid-greenup phase, maturity onset, senescence onset, mid-senescence phase, and dormancy onset) were retrieved separately from daily VIIRS NDVI (normalized difference vegetative index) and EVI2 (two-band enhanced vegetation index) time series. Similarly, the six phenological dates were also extracted from the 30-min time series of PhenoCam data using GCC (green chromatic coordinate) and VCI (vegetation contrast index) separately. Phenological dates derived from VIIRS NDVI and EVI2 and PhenoCam GCC and VCI were generally comparable for the vegetation greenup phase, but differed considerably for the senescence phase. Although all indices captured green leaf development effectively, performance discrepancies arose due to their ability to track the mixture of senescing leaf colors. PhenoCam GCC and VCI phenological observations were in better agreement with the phenological dates from VIIRS EVI2 than from VIIRS NDVI. Further, the VIIRS EVI2 phenological metrics were more similar to those from PhenoCam VCI than from PhenoCam GCC time series. Overall, the average absolute difference between the VIIRS EVI2 and PhenoCam VCI phenological dates was 7-11 days in the greenup phase and 10-13 days in the senescence phase. The difference was smaller in forests, followed by grasslands and croplands, and then savannas. Finally, the phenological dates derived from VIIRS EVI2 were compared with MODIS detections, which showed a good agreement with an average absolute difference less than a week except for the senescence onset. These results for the first time demonstrate the upper boundary of uncertainty in VIIRS ISP detections and the continuity to MODIS LSP product.

TI  - Accelerating glacier mass loss on Franz Josef Land, Russian Arctic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The glaciers of the Franz Josef Land (FJL) archipelago in the Russian Arctic are subjected to rapidly-warming temperatures but are small contributors to sea level. We analyze ice surface elevation data derived from satellite stereo imagery (WorldView and SPOT), radar altimetry (CryoSat-2), and a digitized 1953 cartographic map to calculate elevation change rates (dh/dt). Mass loss from FJL doubled between 2011 and 2015 compared to 1953-2011/2015, increasing from a rate of -2.18 +/- 0.72 Gt yr(-1) to -4.43 +/- 0.78 Gt yr(-1). This 2011-2015 rate indicates an acceleration in ice loss from that observed in 2003-2009 by multiple studies using ICESat and GRACE. Glacier thinning rates are spatially highly variable. We observe glacier thinning rates of up to 10 m per year, and in general we see a trend of increased thinning from the NE towards the SW. Glacier retreat is widespread and has led to the creation of at least one new island. Historically, ice wastage from FJL is thought to have been relatively small, but accelerating ice loss may be the new normal for this archipelago in a warming Arctic.

TI  - The rapid but "invisible" changes in urban greenspace: A comparative study of nine Chinese cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the spatial pattern and change of urban greenspace is a prerequisite to understanding the myriad ecosystem services provided by urban greenspace. Previous studies have largely focused on loss of greenspace due to urban expansion, using medium resolution imagery. This paper presents a comparison study on the spatiotemporal patterns of urban greenspace in nine major cities in China, using 2.5 m resolution ALOS and SPOT image data collected in 2005 and 2010, respectively. The changes in urban greenspace were further compared with those based on the commonly used 30 m Landsat TM data. The results show: 1) Urban greenspace was highly fragmented and heterogeneous, characterized by a mix of a large number of small-sized patches (smaller than 0.1 ha) with relatively few dispersed large patches in nine cities. 2) In contrast to findings from previous research that greenspace in inner cities tends to remain largely unchanged, urban greenspace in all nine cities was highly dynamic, experiencing both gain and loss, with net change ranging from 0.51% to 11.26% over five years. Most of the changes in urban greenspace, however, tended to occur as small patches, and could only be revealed by high spatial resolution imagery. 3) Spatial patterns of greenspace varied greatly across cities in terms of patch size, patch and edge density, and shape. Urban greenspace became increasingly fragmented and complex in the southern cities, but the opposite in the northern cities. The high turnover dynamics of urban greenspace in cities proper provide opportunities for better design and planning to achieve urban sustainability, but also call for better protection of small-sized urban greenspaces in Chinese cities.

TI  - Identification of a low risk population for parametrial invasion in patients with early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent studies have challenged radical procedures for less extensive surgery in selected patients with early-stage cervical cancer at low risk of parametrial invasion. Our objective was to identify a subgroup of patients at low risk of parametrial invasion among women having undergone surgical treatment.Methods: Data of 1447 patients with cervical cancer treated between 1996 and 2016 were extracted from maintained databases of 10 French University hospitals. Patients with early-stage (IA2-IIA) disease treated by radical surgery including hysterectomy and trachelectomy, were selected for further analysis. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to esmate the survival distribution. A Cox proportional hazards model including all the parameters statistically significant in univariate analysis, was used to account for the influence of multiple variables.Results: Out of the 263 patients included for analysis, on final pathology analysis 28 (10.6%) had parametrial invasion and 235 (89.4%) did not. Factors significantly associated with parametrial invasion on multivariate analysis were: age > 65 years, tumor > 30 mm in diameter measured by MRI, lymphovascular space invasion (LVSI) on pathologic analysis. Among the 235 patients with negative pelvic lymph nodes, parametrial disease was seen in only 7.6% compared with 30.8% of those with positive pelvic nodes (p < 0.001). In a subgroup of patients presenting tumors < 30 mm, negative pelvic status and no LVSI, the risk of parametrial invasion fell to 0.6% (1/173 patients).Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that there is a subgroup of patients at very low risk of parametrial invasion, potentially eligible for less radical procedures.

TI  - The Community Cloud retrieval for CLimate (CC4CL) - Part 2: The optimal estimation approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Community Cloud retrieval for Climate (CC4CL) is a cloud property retrieval system for satellite-based multispectral imagers and is an important component of the Cloud Climate Change Initiative (Cloud_cci) project. In this paper we discuss the optimal estimation retrieval of cloud optical thickness, effective radius and cloud top pressure based on the Optimal Retrieval of Aerosol and Cloud (ORAC) algorithm. Key to this method is the forward model, which includes the clear-sky model, the liquid water and ice cloud models, the surface model including a bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), and the "fast" radiative transfer solution (which includes a multiple scattering treatment). All of these components and their assumptions and limitations will be discussed in detail. The forward model provides the accuracy appropriate for our retrieval method. The errors are comparable to the instrument noise for cloud optical thicknesses greater than 10. At optical thicknesses less than 10 modeling errors become more significant. The retrieval method is then presented describing optimal estimation in general, the nonlinear inversion method employed, measurement and a priori inputs, the propagation of input uncertainties and the calculation of subsidiary quantities that are derived from the retrieval results. An evaluation of the retrieval was performed using measurements simulated with noise levels appropriate for the MODIS instrument. Results show errors less than 10% for cloud optical thicknesses greater than 10. Results for clouds of optical thicknesses less than 10 have errors up to 20 %.

TI  - A statistical model to estimate the local vulnerability to severe weather
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a spatial analysis of weather-related fire brigade operations in Berlin. By comparing operation occurrences to insured losses for a set of severe weather events we demonstrate the representativeness and usefulness of such data in the analysis of weather impacts on local scales. We investigate factors influencing the local rate of operation occurrence. While depending on multiple factors - which are often not available - we focus on publicly available quantities. These include topographic features, land use information based on satellite data and information on urban structure based on data from the OpenStreetMap project. After identifying suitable predictors such as housing coverage or local density of the road network we set up a statistical model to be able to predict the average occurrence frequency of local fire brigade operations. Such model can be used to determine potential "hotspots" for weather impacts even in areas or cities where no systematic records are available and can thus serve as a basis for a broad range of tools or applications in emergency management and planning.

TI  - Regional co-variability of spatial and temporal soil moisture-precipitation coupling in North Africa: an observational perspective
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude and sign of soil moisture-precipitation coupling (SMPC) is investigated using a probability-based approach and 10 years of daily microwave satellite data across North Africa at a 1 degrees horizontal scale. Specifically, the co-existence and co-variability of spatial (i.e. using soil moisture gradients) and temporal (i.e. using soil moisture anomaly) soil moisture effects on afternoon rainfall is explored. The analysis shows that in the semi-arid environment of the Sahel, the negative spatial and the negative temporal coupling relationships do not only co-exist, but are also dependent on one another. Hence, if afternoon rain falls over temporally drier soils, it is likely to be surrounded by a wetter environment. Two regions are identified as SMPC "hot spots". These are the south-western part of the domain (7-15 degrees N, 10 degrees W-7 degrees E), with the most robust negative SMPC signal, and the South Sudanese region (5-13 degrees N, 24-34 degrees E). The sign and significance of the coupling in the latter region is found to be largely modulated by the presence of wetlands and is susceptible to the number of long-lived propagating convective systems. The presence of wetlands and an irrigated land area is found to account for about 30% of strong and significant spatial SMPC in the North African domain. This study provides the first insight into regional variability of SMPC in North Africa, and supports the potential relevance of mechanisms associated with enhanced sensible heat flux and mesoscale variability in surface soil moisture for deep convection development.

TI  - The Community Cloud retrieval for CLimate (CC4CL) - Part 1: A framework applied to multiple satellite imaging sensors
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present here the key features of the Community Cloud retrieval for CLimate (CC4CL) processing algorithm. We focus on the novel features of the framework: the optimal estimation approach in general, explicit uncertainty quantification through rigorous propagation of all known error sources into the final product, and the consistency of our long-term, multi-platform time series provided at various resolutions, from 0.5 to 0.02 degrees.By describing all key input data and processing steps, we aim to inform the user about important features of this new retrieval framework and its potential applicability to climate studies. We provide an overview of the retrieved and derived output variables. These are analysed for four, partly very challenging, scenes collocated with CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) observations in the high latitudes and over the Gulf of Guinea-West Africa.The results show that CC4CL provides very realistic estimates of cloud top height and cover for optically thick clouds but, where optically thin clouds overlap, returns a height between the two layers. CC4CL is a unique, coherent, multi-instrument cloud property retrieval framework applicable to passive sensor data of several EO missions. Through its flexibility, CC4CL offers the opportunity for combining a variety of historic and current EO missions into one dataset, which, compared to single sensor retrievals, is improved in terms of accuracy and temporal sampling.

TI  - Digging Deeper Into Pyriproxyfen-Response of the Amphipod <i>Gammarus fossarum</i> With a Next-Generation Ultra-High-Field Orbitrap Analyser: New Perspectives for Environmental Toxicoproteomics
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Taxon-specific proteins from sentinel species have been shown to be among the most relevant proteins to monitor the biological effects of anthropogenic contaminations. Shotgun proteomics allows high-throughput analysis of animal proteomes, but comprehensive coverage remains difficult to achieve due to the wide dynamic range. Here, the advantages of a new generation of mass analyser for environmental toxicoproteomics are documented through the identification of candidate biomarkers in a sentinel animal species for which the genome is as yet unsequenced. A label-free comparative proteomic study was performed on testis from the freshwater amphipod Gammarus fossarum challenged with 0.5 mu g or 50 mu g/L pyriproxyfen, a juvenile hormone analog used as an insecticide. A total of 4,031 proteins could be monitored with a Q Exactive HF mass spectrometer incorporating an ultra-high-field Orbitrap analyser. Five times more MS/MS spectra and 4-fold more peptides and proteins were identified with this instrument compared to a LTQ Orbitrap XL spectrometer. Comparison of protein abundance between control and organisms exposed to 0.5 mu g or 50 mu g/L pyriproxyfen indicated that 32 and 21 proteins, respectively, were significantly modulated between test and control conditions. Functional annotation of these novel candidate biomarkers and their specificities are discussed in light of their potential applications in freshwater quality monitoring. The potential contribution of next-generation mass spectrometers to environmental toxicoproteomics is also touched on.

TI  - Assessing the capability of different satellite observing configurations to resolve the distribution of methane emissions at kilometer scales
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Anthropogenic methane emissions originate from a large number of fine-scale and often transient point sources. Satellite observations of atmospheric methane columns are an attractive approach for monitoring these emissions but have limitations from instrument precision, pixel resolution, and measurement frequency. Dense observations will soon be available in both low-Earth and geostationary orbits, but the extent to which they can provide fine-scale information on methane sources has yet to be explored. Here we present an observation system simulation experiment (OSSE) to assess the capabilities of different satellite observing system configurations. We conduct a 1-week WRF-STILT simulation to generate methane column footprints at 1.3 x 1.3 km(2) spatial resolution and hourly temporal resolution over a 290 x 235 km(2) domain in the Barnett Shale, a major oil and gas field in Texas with a large number of point sources. We sub-sample these footprints to match the observing characteristics of the recently launched TROPOMI instrument (7 x 7 km(2) pixels, 11 ppb precision, daily frequency), the planned GeoCARB instrument (2.7 x 3.0 km(2) pixels, 4 ppb precision, nominal twice-daily frequency), and other proposed observing configurations. The information content of the various observing systems is evaluated using the Fisher information matrix and its eigenvalues. We find that a week of TROPOMI observations should provide information on temporally invariant emissions at similar to 30 km spatial resolution. GeoCARB should provide information available on temporally invariant emissions similar to 2-7 km spatial resolution depending on sampling frequency (hourly to daily). Improvements to the instrument precision yield greater increases in information content than improved sampling frequency. A precision better than 6 ppb is critical for GeoCARB to achieve fine resolution of emissions. Transient emissions would be missed with either TROPOMI or GeoCARB. An aspirational high-resolution geostationary instrument with 1.3 x 1.3 km(2) pixel resolution, hourly return time, and 1 ppb precision would effectively constrain the temporally invariant emissions in the Barnett Shale at the kilometer scale and provide some information on hourly variability of sources.

TI  - Soil moisture estimation for spring wheat in a semiarid area based on low-altitude remote-sensing data collected by small-sized unmanned aerial vehicles
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an important component of the Earth's ecosystem, soil moisture plays a vital role in the global water cycle and serves as an important parameter in the study of hydrology, meteorology, and agroecology. Based on the energy balance theory of underlying surface, the atmospheric temperature data recorded by an automatic weather station as well as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne thermal infrared and multispectral remote-sensing data were used to establish inversion models of relative soil moisture at different depths based on remote-sensing UAV data and date from near-ground quadrats, respectively. Spatial differences and data accuracy verification were then performed using the 2017 spring wheat moisture data as a control. The results showed that: (1) the relative moisture of farmland soil can be effectively estimated using the proposed soil moisture inversion model. In terrestrial ecosystems, the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration, which is often used to characterize potential drought levels, is linearly correlated to soil moisture at different depths; (2) during the inversion of farmland soil moisture, the UAV-based observation method is superior to the near-ground quadrat observation method in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the relative soil moisture estimation model based on UAV data has a high accuracy, with R-2 reaching 0.629, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of <0.100; and (3) the number and size of quadrats are important factors affecting the inversion accuracy. The data collected by the UAVs covered a wide range and had high spatial matching degree at the field scale. Especially, during estimation of the relative moisture of surface soil (0 to 10 and 0 to 20 cm), the linear fitting between the inversion model based on UAV data and the measured value was optimal. The error was minimal (RMSE <0.07) and R-2 was >0.714, so this method is more suitable for estimating and dynamically monitoring relative soil moisture of farmland at the field scale.

TI  - Spring warming in Yukon mountains is not amplified by the snow albedo feedback
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Decreasing spring snow cover may amplify Arctic warming through the snow albedo feedback. To examine the impact of snowmelt on increasing temperature we used a 5,000 m elevation gradient in Yukon, Canada, extending from valley-bottom conifer forests, through middle elevation tundra, to high elevation icefields, to compare validated downscaled reanalysis air temperature patterns across elevational bands characterized by different patterns of spring snowmelt. From 2000 to 2014 we observed surface warming of 0.01 degrees C/a.1,000 m in May (0.14 degrees C/a at 1,000 m to 0.19 degrees C/a at 5,000 m), and uniform cooling of 0.09 degrees C/a in June at all elevations. May temperature trends across elevationally dependent land cover types were highly correlated with each other despite large variations in albedo and snow cover trends. Furthermore, a clear dependency of infrared skin temperature on snow cover mediated albedo decline was observed in tundra, but this was insufficient to influence average diurnal air temperature. We observed negative June temperature trends which we attribute to increasing daytime cloud cover because albedo and snow cover trends were unchanging. We conclude that 8-day and monthly averaged Spring air temperature trends are responding to a synoptic external forcing that is much stronger than the snow albedo feedback in sub-Arctic mountains.

TI  - The Impact of Antidepressant Therapy on Glycemic Control in Canadian Primary Care Patients With Diabetes Mellitus
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: Depression is common in people with diabetes and is associated with poor glycemic control. Evidence suggests that certain antidepressants (AD) increase the risk of poor control. Few population-based studies have examined the impact of individual ADs on glycemic control. This study's objective is to measure the impact of Citalopram, Amitriptyline, Venlafaxine, Trazodone and Escitalopram on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in Canadian primary care patients with diabetes.Methods: A retrospective study of electronic medical records (EMR) from 115 primary care practices across Canada was undertaken. Data were obtained from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). The sample population comprised 1,084 diabetic patients with 1,127 prescriptions of one of the five selected ADs and with baseline and post-exposure HbA1c measurements. Generalized linear mixed models were computed to estimate the effect of the ADs on HbA1c.Results: Mean HbA1c ratios for Amitriptyline, Venlafaxine, Trazodone and Escitalopram were all numerically lower than Citalopram. The confidence intervals included the minimum detectable effect, however the differences were not statistically significant. The lowest clinically relevant HbA1c ratios, relative to Citalopram, were found in patients prescribed Trazodone and Escitalopram. Accounting for the prescription of Trazodone for indications other than depression, this research suggests that Escitalopram may be safer than Citalopram for people with diabetes and depression, in terms of its effect on blood glucose.Conclusion: This study can inform future research examining the relationship between ADs and blood glucose and provides insight into the limitations pertaining to the use of health data in health research. Future research should seek to control for, across multiple time points: depression symptoms, depression severity, depression duration, weight, diabetes medication, tobacco and alcohol consumption and other medications with a known impact on blood glucose.

TI  - Experimental evidence for delayed contingent cooperation among wild dwarf mongooses
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Many animals participate in biological markets, with strong evidence existing for immediate cooperative trades. In particular, grooming is often exchanged for itself or other commodities, such as coalitionary support or access to food and mates. More contentious is the possibility that nonhuman animals can rely on memories of recent events, providing contingent cooperation even when there is a temporal delay between two cooperative acts. Here we provide experimental evidence of delayed cross-commodity grooming exchange in wild dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula). First, we use natural observations and social-network analyses to demonstrate a positive link between grooming and sentinel behavior (acting as a raised guard). Group members who contributed more to sentinel behavior received more grooming and had a better social-network position. We then used a field-based playback experiment to test a causal link between contributions to sentinel behavior and grooming received later in the day. During 3-h trial sessions, the perceived sentinel contributions of a focal individual were either up-regulated (playback of its surveillance calls, which are given naturally during sentinel bouts) or unmanipulated (playback of its foraging close calls as a control). On returning to the sleeping refuge at the end of the day, focal individuals received more grooming following surveillance-call playback than control-call playback and more grooming than a matched individual whose sentinel contributions were not up-regulated. We believe our study therefore provides experimental evidence of delayed contingent cooperation in a wild nonprimate species.

TI  - Characterization of aerosol loading in urban and suburban locations: Impact on atmospheric extinction
T2  - COGENT ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of atmospheric aerosols remains a very strong factor in the understanding of the Earth's climate and predicting the air quality within any given environment. In view of this, analysis of aerosol characteristics measured using AERONET sun photometer, MODIS, Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization, AIRS and TOMS/OMI sensors, over six distinctly different environments in Nigeria for a period of 10 years was carried out. The results revealed significant regional and temporal variation. It showed that different aerosol types impact differently on atmospheric extinction properties. The result further revealed that aerosol loading peaks in the south and middle belt regions during the dry season (November-March), while the reverse was the case in the north during the rainy season (April-October). It was found out that coarse aerosols prevail all year round within these regions, with the rate of occurrence varying with season. The range of the ratio of coarse-to-fine aerosol was found to be as high as 19:1 during the rainy season in Sokoto and Maiduguri, and 3:1 during the dry season. In Abuja and Ilorin, it ranged from 13:1 to 2:1 in both seasons. The atmospheric extinction values plotted against relative humidity (RH) showed that extinction grows at very low RH of about 45% in a less anthropogenic polluted environment (north), while a RH of 60% and above is required for growth to take place in a more polluted environment in the south. This implies that the use of rain water for drinking and other domestic purposes should be done with caution.

TI  - A full-mission data set of H<sub>2</sub>O and HDO columns from SCIAMACHY 2.3μm reflectance measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new data set of vertical column densities of the water vapour isotopologues H2O and HDO from the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) instrument for the whole of the mission period from January 2003 to April 2012 is presented. The data are retrieved from reflectance measurements in the spectral range 2339 to 2383 nm with the Shortwave Infrared CO Retrieval (SICOR) algorithm, ignoring atmospheric light scattering in the measurement simulation. The retrievals are validated with ground-based Fourier transform infrared measurements obtained within the Multi-platform remote Sensing of Isotopologues for investigating the Cycle of Atmospheric water (MUSICA) project. A good agreement for low-altitude stations is found with an average bias of -3.6 x 10(21) for H2O and -1.0 x 10(18) moleccm(-2) for HDO. The a posteriori computed delta D shows an average bias of -8%, even though polar stations have a larger negative bias. The latter is due to the large amount of sensor noise in SCIAMACHY in combination with low albedo and high solar zenith angles. To demonstrate the benefit of accounting for light scattering in the retrieval, the quality of the data product fitting effective cloud parameters simultaneously with trace gas columns is evaluated in a dedicated case study for measurements round high-altitude stations. Due to a large altitude difference between the satellite ground pixel and the mountain station, clear-sky scenes yield a large bias, resulting in a delta D bias of 125 %. When selecting scenes with optically thick clouds within 1000m above or below the station altitude, the bias in a posteriori delta D is reduced from 125 to 44 %. The insights from the present study will also benefit the analysis of the data from the new Sentinel-5 Precursor mission.

TI  - Mapping an ancient city with a century of remotely sensed data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapidly growing global population places cultural heritage at great risk, and the encroachment of modern settlement on archaeological sites means that valuable information about how past societies worked and interacted with the environment is lost. To manage and mitigate these risks, we require knowledge about what has been lost and what remains, so we can actively decide what should be investigated and what should be preserved for the future. Remote sensing provides archaeologists with some of the tools we need to do this. In this paper we explore the application of multitemporal, multisensor data to map features and chart the impacts of urban encroachment on the ancient city of Jerash (in modern Jordan) by combining archives of aerial photography dating back to 1917 with state-of-the-art airborne laser scanning. The combined results revealed details of the water distribution system and the ancient city plan. This demonstrates that by combining historical images with modern aerial and ground-based data we can successfully detect and contextualize these features and thus achieve a better understanding of life in a city in the past. These methods are essential, given that much of the ancient city has been lost to modern development and the historical imagery is often our only source of information.

TI  - GEO-CEOS stage 4 validation of the Satellite Image Automatic Mapper lightweight computer program for ESA Earth observation level 2 product generation - Part 2: Validation
T2  - COGENT GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - ESA defines as Earth Observation (EO) Level 2 information product a multi-spectral (MS) image corrected for atmospheric, adjacency, and topographic effects, stacked with its data-derived scene classification map (SCM), whose legend includes quality layers cloud and cloud-shadow. No ESA EO Level 2 product has ever been systematically generated at the ground segment. To fill the information gap from EO big data to ESA EO Level 2 product in compliance with the GEO-CEOS stage 4 validation (Val) guidelines, an off-the-shelf Satellite Image Automatic Mapper (SIAM) lightweight computer program was selected to be validated by independent means on an annual 30m resolution Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) image composite time-series of the conterminous U.S. (CONUS) for the years 2006 to 2009. The SIAM core is a prior knowledge-based decision tree for MS reflectance space hyperpolyhedralization into static (non-adaptive to data) color names. For the sake of readability, this paper was split into two. The present Part 2Validationaccomplishes a GEO-CEOS stage 4 Val of the test SIAM-WELD annual map time-series in comparison with a reference 30m resolution 16-class USGS National Land Cover Data (NLCD) 2006 map. These test and reference map pairs feature the same spatial resolution and spatial extent, but their legends differ and must be harmonized, in agreement with the previous Part 1 - Theory. Conclusions are that SIAM systematically delivers an ESA EO Level 2 SCM product instantiation whose legend complies with the standard 2-level 4-class FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) Dichotomous Phase (DP) taxonomy.

TI  - Numerical study of hydrodynamic and salinity transport processes in the Pink Beach wetlands of the Liao River estuary, China
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Interaction studies of vegetation within flow environments are essential for the determination of bank protection, morphological characteristics and ecological conditions for wetlands. This paper uses the MIKE 21 hydrodynamic and salinity model to simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics and salinity transport processes in the Pink Beach wetlands of the Liao River estuary. The effect of wetland plants on tidal flow in wetland areas is represented by a varying Manning coefficient in the bottom friction term. Acquisition of the vegetation distribution is based on Landsat TM satellites by remote sensing techniques. Detailed comparisons between field observation and simulated results of water depth, salinity and tidal currents are presented in the vegetated domain of the Pink Beach wetlands. Satisfactory results were obtained from simulations of both flow characteristics and salinity concentration, with or without vegetation. A numerical experiment was conducted based on variations in vegetation density, and compared with the tidal currents in non-vegetated areas; the computed current speed decreased remarkably with an increase in vegetation density. The impact of vegetation on water depth and salinity was simulated, and the findings revealed that wetland vegetation has an insignificant effect on the water depth and salinity in this wetland domain. Several stations (from upstream to downstream) in the Pink Beach wetlands were selected to estimate the longitudinal variation of salinity under different river runoff conditions ; the results showed that salinity concentration decreases with an increase in river runoff. This study can consequently help increase the understanding of favourable salinity conditions for particular vegetation growth in the Pink Beach wetlands of the Liao River estuary. The results also provide crucial guidance for related interaction studies of vegetation, flow and salinity in other wetland systems.

TI  - Equatorial plasma bubble seeding by MSTIDs in the ionosphere
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Occurrences of equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs) and medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) were studied using GPS satellite data-based total electron content mapping, ionograms, and 630 nm all-sky airglow images observed over the South American continent during the period of 2014-2015. In many cases, we observed a close relationship between the inter-bubble distance and the horizontal wavelength of the MSTIDs. The MSTIDs followed by EPBs occurred primarily in the afternoon to evening period under strong tropospheric convective activities (cold fronts and/or intertropical convergence zones). The close relationship between EPBs and MSTIDs suggests that MSTIDs could be one of the seeding sources of EPBs.

TI  - Predicting the provisioning potential of forest ecosystem services using airborne laser scanning data and forest resource maps
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Remote sensing-based mapping of forest Ecosystem Service (ES) indicators has become increasingly popular. The resulting maps may enable to spatially assess the provisioning potential of ESs and prioritize the land use in subsequent decision analyses. However, the mapping is often based on readily available data, such as land cover maps and other publicly available databases, and ignoring the related uncertainties.Methods: This study tested the potential to improve the robustness of the decisions by means of local model fitting and uncertainty analysis. The quality of forest land use prioritization was evaluated under two different decision support models: either using the developed models deterministically or in corporation with the uncertainties of the models.Results: Prediction models based on Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data explained the variation in proxies of the suitability of forest plots for maintaining biodiversity, producing timber, storing carbon, or providing recreational uses (berry picking and visual amenity) with RMSEs of 15%-30%, depending on the ES. The RMSEs of the ALS-based predictions were 47%-97% of those derived from forest resource maps with a similar resolution. Due to applying a similar field calibration step on both of the data sources, the difference can be attributed to the better ability of ALS to explain the variation in the ES proxies.Conclusions: Despite the different accuracies, proxy values predicted by both the data sources could be used for a pixel-based prioritization of land use at a resolution of 250 m(2), i.e., in a considerably more detailed scale than required by current operational forest management. The uncertainty analysis indicated that maps of the ES provisioning potential should be prepared separately based on expected and extreme outcomes of the ES proxy models to fully describe the production possibilities of the landscape under the uncertainties in the models.

AB  - A 53-year-old healthy man presented with recurrent in-transit melanoma of the right lower extremity. Eight years prior he had undergone wide local excision and sentinel lymph node biopsy for invasive melanoma of the anteromedial aspect of the distal right thigh. Pathology revealed an ulcerated melanoma, Breslow depth 3.5 mm, and with one involved micrometastatic inguinal lymph node. Staging studies did not demonstrate distant metastases. Superficial inguinal node dissection was performed and did not identify any additional metastatic nodes of 14 retrieved for a final pathologic staging of T3bN1aM0 (stage IIIB) cutaneous melanoma. He received 12 months of adjuvant high-dose interferon alfa-2b. Two years later, he developed a 1.2-cm subcutaneous focus of in-transit recurrence approximately 4 cm proximal to the original melanoma site in the right thigh, which was treated with surgical resection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Over the next 4 years, he underwent six additional surgeries for isolated in-transit recurrences affecting the same limb. He was referred for therapeutic options at the time of his latest in-transit recurrence. Examination revealed three palpable subcutaneous nodules in the right thigh in the setting of lymphedema. A core biopsy confirmed recurrent melanoma (Fig 1). Whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging revealed at least 17 hypermetabolic cutaneous and subcutaneous nodules in the right thigh, four fluorodeoxyglucose-avid nodules below the right knee, but no distant metastases (Fig 2A). Brain magnetic resonance imaging was normal. His serum chemistry profile, including lactate dehydrogenase, was normal. Molecular analysis demonstrated presence of BRAF V600E mutation in the tumor. After multidisciplinary evaluation, an isolated limb infusion procedure of the right lower extremity was not believed to be feasible, secondary to the proximal extent of the recurrence. Therapy was initiated with pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks.

TI  - Insight into global trends in aerosol composition from 2005 to 2015 inferred from the OMI Ultraviolet Aerosol Index
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations of aerosol scattering and absorption offer valuable information about aerosol composition. We apply a simulation of the Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI), a method of detecting aerosol absorption from satellite observations, to interpret UVAI values observed by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) from 2005 to 2015 to understand global trends in aerosol composition. We conduct our simulation using the vector radiative transfer model VLI-DORT with aerosol fields from the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. We examine the 2005-2015 trends in individual aerosol species from GEOS-Chem and apply these trends to the UVAI simulation to calculate the change in simulated UVAI due to the trends in individual aerosol species. We find that global trends in the UVAI are largely explained by trends in absorption by mineral dust, absorption by brown carbon, and scattering by secondary inorganic aerosol. Trends in absorption by mineral dust dominate the simulated UVAI trends over North Africa, the Middle East, East Asia, and Australia. The UVAI simulation resolves observed negative UVAI trends well over Australia, but underestimates positive UVAI trends over North Africa and Central Asia near the Aral Sea and underestimates negative UVAI trends over East Asia. We find evidence of an increasing dust source from the desiccating Aral Sea that may not be well represented by the current generation of models. Trends in absorption by brown carbon dominate the simulated UVAI trends over biomass burning regions. The UVAI simulation reproduces observed negative trends over central South America and West Africa, but underestimates observed UVAI trends over boreal forests. Trends in scattering by secondary inorganic aerosol dominate the simulated UVAI trends over the eastern United States and eastern India. The UVAI simulation slightly overestimates the observed positive UVAI trends over the eastern United States and underestimates the observed negative UVAI trends over India. Quantitative simulation of the OMI UVAI offers new insight into global trends in aerosol composition.

However, the interactions and processes between host airway epithelium and pathogens are not fully understood.Results: In this study, we identified responses of the human airway epithelium cells to respiratory pathogen infection. We retrieved three mRNA expression microarray datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, and identified 116 differentially expressed genes common to all three datasets. Gene functional annotations were performed using Gene Ontology and pathway analyses. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis and text mining, we identified a subset of genes functioned as a group and associated with infection, inflammation, tissue adhesion, and receptor internalization in infected epithelial cells. These genes were further identified in BESE-2B cells in response to Talaromyces marneffei by Real-Time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). In addition, we performed an in silico prediction of microRNA-target interactions and examined our findings.Conclusions: Using bioinformatics analysis, we identified several genes that may serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis or the surveillance of early respiratory tract infection, and identified additional genes and miRNAs that warrant further fundamental experimental research.

TI  - Laser pulse bidirectional reflectance from CALIPSO mission
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an innovative retrieval method that translates the CALIOP land surface laser pulse returns into the surface bidirectional reflectance. To better analyze the surface returns, the CALIOP receiver impulse response and the downlinked samples' distribution at 30m vertical resolution are discussed. The saturated laser pulse magnitudes from snow and ice surfaces are recovered based on information extracted from the tail end of the surface signal. The retrieved snow surface bidirectional reflectance is compared with reflectance from both CALIOP cloud-covered regions and MODIS BRDF-albedo model parameters. In addition to the surface bidirectional reflectance, the column top-of-atmosphere bidirectional reflectances are calculated from the CALIOP lidar background data and compared with the bidirectional reflectances derived from WFC radiance measurements. The retrieved CALIOP surface bidirectional reflectance and column top-of-atmosphere bidirectional reflectance results provide unique information to complement existing MODIS standard data products and are expected to have valuable applications for modelers.

TI  - The development of high resolution maps of tsetse abundance to guide interventions against human African trypanosomiasis in northern Uganda
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Vector control is emerging as an important component of global efforts to control Gambian sleeping sickness (human African trypanosomiasis, HAT). The deployment of insecticide-treated targets ("Tiny Targets") to attract and kill riverine tsetse, the vectors of Trypanosoma brucei gambiense, has been shown to be particularly cost-effective. As this method of vector control continues to be implemented across larger areas, knowledge of the abundance of tsetse to guide the deployment of "Tiny Targets" will be of increasing value. In this paper, we use a geostatistical modelling framework to produce maps of estimated tsetse abundance under two scenarios: (i) when accurate data on the local river network are available; and (ii) when river information is sparse.Methods: Tsetse abundance data were obtained from a pre-intervention survey conducted in northern Uganda in 2010. River network data obtained from either digitised maps or derived from 30 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) data as a proxy for ground truth data. Other environmental variables were derived from publicly-available resolution remotely sensed data (e.g. Landsat, 30 m resolution). Zero-inflated negative binomial geostatistical models were fitted to the abundance data using an integrated nested Laplace approximation approach, and maps of estimated tsetse abundance were produced.Results: Restricting the analysis to traps located within 100 m of any river, positive associations were identified between the length of river and the minimum soil/vegetation moisture content of the surrounding area and daily fly catches, whereas negative associations were identified with elevation and distance to the river. The resulting models could accurately distinguish between traps with high and low fly catches (e.g. < 5 or > 5 flies/day), with a ROC-AUC (receiver-operating characteristic area under the curve) greater than 0.9. Whilst the precise course of the river was not well approximated using the DEM data, the models fitted using DEM-derived river data performed similarly to those that incorporated the more accurate local river information.Conclusions: These models can now be used to assist in the design, implementation and monitoring of tsetse control operations in northern Uganda and further can be used as a framework by which to undertake similar studies in other areas where Glossina fuscipes fuscipes spreads Gambian sleeping sickness.

TI  - Therapeutic potential of CPI-613 for targeting tumorous mitochondrial energy metabolism and inhibiting autophagy in clear cell sarcoma
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Clear cell sarcoma (CCS) is an aggressive type of soft tissue tumor that is associated with high rates of metastasis. In the present study, we found that CPI-613, which targets tumorous mitochondrial energy metabolism, induced autophagosome formation followed by lysosome fusion in HS-MM CCS cells in vitro. Interestingly, CPI-613 along with chloroquine, which inhibits the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes, significantly induced necrosis of HS-MM CCS cell growth in vitro. Subsequently, we established a murine orthotropic metastatic model of CCS and evaluated the putative suppressive effect of a combination of CPI-613 and chloroquine on CCS progression. Injection of HS-MM into the aponeuroses of the thigh, the most frequently affected site in CCS, resulted in massive metastasis in SCID-beige mice. By contrast, intraperitoneal administration of CPI-613 (25 mg/kg) and chloroquine (50 mg/kg), two days a week for two weeks, significantly decreased tumor growth at the injection site and abolished metastasis. The present results imply the inhibitory effects of a combination of CPI-613 and chloroquine on the progression of CCS.

TI  - Seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations - Latin America, 2013
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Despite widespread utilization of influenza vaccines, effectiveness (VE) has not been routinely measured in Latin America.Methods: We used a case test-negative control design to estimate trivalent inactivated influenza VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza among hospitalized children aged 6 months-5 years and adults aged >= 60 years which are age-groups targeted for vaccination. We sought persons with severe acute respiratory infections (SARI), hospitalized at 71 sentinel hospitals in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Honduras, Panama, and Paraguay during January-December 2013. Cases had an influenza virus infection confirmed by real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR); controls had a negative rRT-PCR result for influenza viruses. We used a two-stage random effects model to estimate pooled VE per target age-group, adjusting for the month of illness onset, age and preexisting medical conditions.Results: We identified 2620 SARI patients across sites: 246 influenza cases and 720 influenza-negative controls aged <= 5 years and 448 cases and 1206 controls aged >= 60 years. The most commonly identified subtype among participants (48%) was the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus followed by influenza A (H3N2) (34%) and influenza B (18%) viruses. Among children, the adjusted VE of full vaccination (one dose for previously vaccinated or two if vaccine naive) against any influenza virus SARI was 47% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 14-71%); VE was 58% (95% CI: 16-79%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, and 65% (95% CI:-9; 89%) against influenza A(H3N2) viruses associated SARI. Crude VE of full vaccination against influenza B viruses associated SARI among children was 3% (95% CI:-150; 63). Among adults aged >= 60 years, adjusted VE against any influenza SARI was 48% (95% CI: 34-60%); VE was 54% (95% CI: 37-69%) against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 43% (95% CI: 18-61%) against influenza A(H3N2) and 34% (95% CI:-4; 58%) against B viruses associated SARI.Conclusion: Influenza vaccine provided moderate protection against severe influenza illness among fully vaccinated young children and older adults, supporting current vaccination strategies.

TI  - What causes subsidence following the 2011 eruption at Nabro (Eritrea)?
T2  - PROGRESS IN EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A major goal in volcanology is to be able to constrain the physical properties of a volcanic system using surface observations. The behaviour of a volcanic system following an eruption can provide powerful constraints on these properties and can provide valuable information for understanding future hazard. We use spatially and temporally dense observations of surface deformation following the 12 June 2011 eruption of Nabro (Eritrea) to place constraints on the mechanics of its subsurface volcanic system. Nabro was imaged 129 times by TerraSAR-X and COSMO-SkyMed satellites during a 15-month period following the eruption. We have produced a detailed time series of the line-of-sight (LOS) displacements at Nabro, finding that the volcano subsides during the entire observation period at a decaying rate. We found significant atmospheric artefacts remained in the data set after a standard spatio-temporal filter was applied. Applying an empirical correction using a linear phase-elevation relationship removed artefacts but also removed real topographically correlated deformation. Instead, we were able to correct each SAR acquisition using independent delay estimates derived from the ECMWF ERA-Interim (ERA-I) global atmospheric model. The corrected time series can be modelled with the deflation of a Mogi source at similar to 6.4 +/- 0.3 km depth. Modelling the time series using viscoelastic relaxation of a shell which surrounds a spherical magma chamber can explain the observed subsidence without a source of further volume loss if the magma is compressible. CO2 outgassing is also a possible cause of continued subsidence. Contraction due to cooling and crystallisation, however, is probably minor. If any post-eruptive recharge of the magmatic system at Nabro is occurring, the rate of recharge must be slower than the post-eruptive relaxation processes. Combined with the lack of pre-eruptive inflation, we suggest that recharge of the magmatic system at Nabro either occurs at a rate that is slower than our detection limit, or it occurs episodically. This case study demonstrates the power of long, dense geodetic time series at volcanoes.

TI  - Assessing seasonal land cover dynamics in the tropical Kilombero floodplain of East Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing demand for food in East Africa has created a shift to utilize wetlands for food production. Lack of spatial information hampers sustainable use of the Kilombero Valley floodplain. We take advantage of multispectral data from RapidEye, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 to derive high temporal resolution maps along three hydrological zones of the Kilombero Valley, assess seasonal land cover dynamics, and relate these dynamics to groundwater measurements. The depth of groundwater increases from June and declines from December, consistent with the end and the beginning of the rainy season, respectively. Bare land cover over the study area was 45% to 57% and increases to 62% to 69% as the season shifts from rainy to dry seasons while vegetation coverage, which was 34% to 47%, decreased to 25% to 27%. During the dry season, 68% to 81% of the total vegetation is within the riparian zone indicating the hydrological conditions favor plant growth. Vegetation growth in the fringe and middle zones mainly relies on precipitation whereas that in the riparian zone relies on saturation from the river. Our findings exemplify the relationship between seasonal land cover change and hydrological conditions and contribute to improved understanding of the spatial-temporal land cover dynamic in the Kilombero floodplain, required for planning sustained use of the wetland.

TI  - Bone cement distribution is a potential predictor to the reconstructive effects of unilateral percutaneous kyphoplasty in OVCFs: a retrospective study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) is a common type of fracture, and percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) is an eligible solution to it. Previous studies have revealed that both the volume and filling pattern of bone cement correlate with the clinical outcomes after PKP procedure. However, the role of bone cement distribution remains to be illustrated.Methods: To retrospectively evaluate the relationship between the bone cement distribution and the clinical outcomes of unilateral PKP, we enrolled 73 OVCF patients receiving unilateral PKP treatment. All the intervened vertebrae were classified into three groups based on the bone cement distribution observed on postoperative X-ray films. Preoperative and postoperative radiographic parameters including the vertebral height and kyphotic Cobb angle were recorded, and anterior vertebral height restoration rate (AVHRR) and Cobb angle correction (CR) were then calculated to assess the vertebral height reconstruction. Preoperative and postoperative Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analogue scale (VAS) were adopted by interviewing patients to assess the mobility improvement and pain relief. Demographic data, body mass index (BMI), lumbar bone mineral density (evaluated by BMD T-score) of each patient, bone cement volume (BV), and bone cement extravasation (BE) were also recorded. Between-and within-group comparisons and multivariable correlation analysis were carried out to analyze the data.Results: VAS and ODI scores were both significantly improved in all of the enrolled cases with no significant differences between groups. Among the three groups, the average age, AVHRR, and BV were significantly different. Occurrence of BE was significantly different between two of the three groups. AVHRR was demonstrated to correlate negatively with preoperative anterior vertebral height ratio and positively with preoperative Cobb angle, CR, diffusion score, and ODI changes.Conclusions: Bone cement distribution is a potential predictor to the reconstructive effects in unilateral PKP for OVCFs. Bone cement distribution is associated with AVHRR and BV, as well as the risk of BE occurrence. Greater bone cement distribution may indicate better vertebral restoration along with a higher BE risk.

TI  - A weighted least squares approach to retrieve aerosol layer height over bright surfaces applied to GOME-2 measurements of the oxygen A band for forest fire cases over Europe
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a weighted least squares approach to retrieve aerosol layer height from top-of-atmosphere reflectance measurements in the oxygen A band (758-770 nm) over bright surfaces. A property of the measurement error covariance matrix is discussed, due to which photons travelling from the surface are given a higher preference over photons that scatter back from the aerosol layer. This is a potential source of biases in the estimation of aerosol properties over land, which can be mitigated by revisiting the design of the measurement error covariance matrix. The alternative proposed in this paper, which we call the dynamic scaling method, introduces a scene-dependent and wavelength-dependent modification in the measurement signal-to-noise ratio in order to influence this matrix. This method is generally applicable to other retrieval algorithms using weighted least squares. To test this method, synthetic experiments are done in addition to application to GOME-2A and GOME-2B measurements of the oxygen A band over the August 2010 Russian wildfires and the October 2017 Portugal wildfire plume over western Europe.

TI  - Endemic and emerging arboviral diseases of livestock in Nigeria: a review
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) are the largest biologic group of vertebrate viruses and constitute important emerging infectious disease agents globally. Arthropod transmission provides a way for viruses to cross species barriers since the same arthropod may bite animals that rarely or never come into close contact in nature. In Nigeria, arboviruses have, over several decades, caused severe diseases in livestock resulting in great economic losses and, sometimes, infection of humans leading to morbidity and mortality. In the present review, a computerized search of existing literature was conducted using the Google search engine and PubMed electronic database to identify and review relevant publications on arboviral diseases of livestock in Nigeria. The keywords used were 'arbovirus', 'arthropod-borne viral diseases' or 'livestock diseases' and 'Nigeria' while the Boolean operator 'OR' was used to combine and narrow the searches. Additional information was obtained by searching the veterinary libraries for journals not listed in the database. The available publications were thereafter reviewed and findings qualitatively described. Our findings revealed that although there were several studies on arboviruses and the livestock diseases they cause in Nigeria, most of such reports were made four to six decades ago, with only a few reported recently. Consequently, the true economic and public health impact of these diseases are likely to be underestimated, mainly due to under-reporting or lack of awareness of them. Thus, it is essential to update information on arboviral diseases in Nigeria in order to increase awareness of the diseases and facilitate their prompt identification and reporting. The importance of routine surveillance for arbovirus livestock diseases and sentinel herd monitoring as basis for development of an early warning and alert system to prevent future outbreaks is discussed.

TI  - Remotely Assessing Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (<i>FPAR</i>) for Wheat Canopies Based on Hyperspectral Vegetation Indexes
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR), as an important index for evaluating yields and biomass production, is key to providing the guidance for crop management. However, the shortage of good hyperspectral data can frequently result in the hindrance of accurate and reliable FPAR assessment, especially for wheat. In the present research, aiming at developing a strategy for accurate FPAR assessment, the relationships between wheat canopy FPAR and vegetation indexes derived from concurrent ground-measured hyperspectral data were explored. FPAR revealed the most strongly correlation with normalized difference index (NDI), and scaled difference index (N*). Both NDI and N* revealed the increase as the increase of FPAR; however, NDI value presented the stagnation as FPAR value beyond 0.70. On the other hand, N* showed a decreasing tendency when FPAR value was higher than 0.70. This special relationship between FPAR and vegetation index could be employed to establish a piecewise FPAR assessment model with NDI as a regression variable during FPAR value lower than 0.70, or N* as the regression variable during FPAR value higher than 0.70. The model revealed higher assessment accuracy up to 16% when compared with FPAR assessment models based on a single vegetation index. In summary, it is feasible to apply NDI and N* for accomplishing wheat canopy FPAR assessment, and establish an FPAR assessment model to overcome the limitations from vegetation index saturation under the condition with high FPAR value.

TI  - A long-term time series of global and diffuse photosynthetically active radiation in the Mediterranean: interannual variability and cloud effects
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Measurements of global and diffuse photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) have been carried out on the island of Lampedusa, in the central Mediterranean Sea, since 2002. PAR is derived from observations made with multi-filter rotating shadowband radiometers (MFRSRs) by comparison with a freshly calibrated PAR sensor and by relying on the on-site Langley plots. In this way, a long-term calibrated record covering the period 2002-2016 is obtained and is presented in this work.The monthly mean global PAR peaks in June, with about 160 W m(-2), while the diffuse PAR reaches 60 W m(-2) in spring or summer. The global PAR displays a clear annual cycle with a semi amplitude of about 52 W m(-2). The diffuse PAR annual cycle has a semi amplitude of about 12 W m(-2).A simple method to retrieve the cloud-free PAR global and diffuse irradiances in days characterized by partly cloudy conditions has been implemented and applied to the dataset. This method allows retrieval of the cloud-free evolution of PAR and calculation of the cloud radiative effect, CRE, for downwelling PAR. The cloud-free monthly mean global PAR reaches 175 W m(-2) in summer, while the diffuse PAR peaks at about 40 W m(-2).The cloud radiative effect, CRE, on global and diffuse PAR is calculated as the difference between all-sky and cloud-free measurements. The annual average CRE is about 14.7 W m(-2) for the global PAR and + 8.1 W m(-2) for the diffuse PAR. The smallest CRE is observed in July, due to the high cloud-free condition frequency. Maxima (negative for the global, and positive for the diffuse component) occur in March-April and in October, due to the combination of elevated PAR irradiances and high occurrence of cloudy conditions. Summer clouds appear to be characterized by a low frequency of occurrence, low altitude, and low optical thickness, possibly linked to the peculiar marine boundary layer structure. These properties also contribute to produce small radiative effects on PAR in summer.The cloud radiative effect has been deseasonalized to remove the influence of annual irradiance variations. The monthly mean normalized CRE for global PAR can be well represented by a multi-linear regression with respect to monthly cloud fraction, cloud top pressure, and cloud optical thickness, as determined from satellite MODIS observations. The behaviour of the normalized CRE for diffuse PAR can not be satisfactorily described by a simple multi-linear model with respect to the cloud properties, due to its nonlinear dependency, in particular on the cloud optical depth. The analysis suggests that about 77% of the global PAR in terannual variability may be ascribed to cloud variability in winter.

To this end, a validation was processed comparing each product with a BA reference covering the period of 2001 to 2016, available for one of the largest savanna vegetation enclaves located in the southern Brazilian Amazon, the Campos Amazonicos Savanna Enclave. Three indices derived from cross-tabulated error matrices were used in the comparison [commission error, omission error (Oe), and Dice coefficient]. Pareto boundaries were also computed to explore the influence of the spatial resolution of the MODIS products on detecting BAs. The overall assessment found a clear decrease in Oes, varying from 0.797 and 0.499 in the MCD45A1 v051 and MCD64A1 v051, respectively, to a value of 0.280 in the MCD64A1 v006. Improvements obtained with MCD64A1 v006 in the middle and late dry season periods were significant. The results validate the higher performance of MCD64A1 v006 and confirm it as a useful instrument for the regional mapping of BAs over tropical savanna areas.

TI  - Evaluating and predicting the effectiveness of farmland consolidation on improving agricultural productivity in China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security has always been a focus issue in China. Farmland consolidation (FC) was regarded as a critical way to increase the quantity and improve the quality of farmland to ensure food security by Chinese government. FC projects have been nationwide launched, however few studies focused on evaluating the effectiveness of FC at a national scale. As such, an efficient way to evaluate the effectiveness of FC on improving agricultural productivity in China will be needed and it is critical for future national land consolidation planning. In this study, we selected 7505 FC projects completed between 2006 and 2013 with good quality Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as samples to evaluate the effectiveness of FC. We used time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer NDVI from 2001 to 2013, to extract four indicators to characterize agricultural productivity change of 4442 FC projects completed between 2006 and 2010, i.e., productivity level (PL), productivity variation (PV), productivity potential (PP), and multi-cropping index (MI). On this basis, we further predicted the same four characteristics for 3063 FC projects completed between 2011 and 2013, respectively, using Support Vector Machines (SVM). We found FC showed an overall effective status on improving agricultural productivity between 2006 and 2013 in China, especially on upgrading PL and improving PP. The positive effect was more prominent in the southeast and eastern China. It is noteworthy that 27.30% of all the 7505 projects were still ineffective on upgrading PL, the elementary improvement of agricultural productivity. Finally, we proposed that location-specific factors should be taken into consideration for launching FC projects and diverse financial sources are also needed for supporting FC. The results provide a reference for government to arrange FC projects reasonably and to formulate land consolidation planning in a proper way that better improve the effectiveness of FC.

TI  - Prediction of daily <i>PM</i><sub>2.5</sub> concentration in China using partial differential equations
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate reporting and forecasting of PM2.5 concentration are important for improving public health. In this paper, we propose a partial differential equation (PDE) model, specially, a linear diffusive equation, to describe the spatial-temporal characteristics of PM2.5 in order to make short-term prediction. We analyze the temporal and spatial patterns of a real dataset from China's National Environmental Monitoring and validate the PDE-based model in terms of predicting the PM2.5 concentration of the next day by the former days' history data. Our experiment results show that the PDE model is able to characterize and predict the process of PM2.5 transport. For example, for 300 continuous days of 2016, the average prediction accuracy of the PDE model over all city-regions is 93% or 83% based on different accuracy definitions. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use PDE-based model to study PM2.5 prediction in both temporal and spatial dimensions.

TI  - Detection and displacement characterization of landslides using multi- temporal satellite SAR interferometry: A case study of Danba County in the Dadu River Basin
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Detection of potential slope instabilities across wide areas using SAR interferometry (InSAR) techniques can aid prevention and mitigation of landslide disasters. Nevertheless, the low spatial density of coherent radar targets detected by conventional time series InSAR methods in mountainous areas with complex topography and vegetation cover introduces considerable uncertainties into the deformation measurements, and thus results in a high probability of omissions for landslide detection. In this study, a new time series InSAR method named Coherent Scatterers InSAR (CSI) is proposed to solve this problem through the joint exploitation of Persistent Scatterers (PS) and Distributed Scatterers (DS) to increase the quantity of Measurement Points (MPs) in rural environments. We applied this approach to detect potentially unstable slopes at a catchment scale, delineate sliding boundaries, and measure the deformation of major landslides. The archived ALOS PALSAR and ENVISAT ASAR data stacks covering the Danba County in the upper reach of the Dadu River Basin in southwest China, were processed. The PALSAR-measured deformation rate map revealed 17 suspected landslides and their sliding boundaries. By contrast, only six out of these 17 landslides were detected from the ASAR results, as the other 11 landslides were undetected due to the much lower density of coherent points. These detection results were indirectly verified by two different approaches. Two differential interferograms for recently acquired L-band ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data pairs were visually inspected to check whether these landslides are still in active deformation. The reliability of the InSAR results was further evaluated by comparisons against field survey and in situ GPS measurements. The spatial and temporal patterns of surface displacements at several slow-moving landslides were analyzed in detail, and general guidelines on the application of the CSI method for landslide investigations were discussed and summarized.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is an uncommon tumoi in the brain. Although most PCNSL are readily diagnosed as diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) on the first biopsy, very rare cases have been described in which the first detected intracerebral lesions are non-neoplastic, and are composed mostly of perivascular T cells, not B cells. This phenomenon is known as "sentinel lesions".

TI  - Strong and highly variable push of ocean waves on Southern Ocean sea ice
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice in the Southern Ocean has expanded over most of the past 20 y, but the decline in sea ice since 2016 has taken experts by surprise. This recent evolution highlights the poor performance of numerical models for predicting extent and thickness, which is due to our poor understanding of ice dynamics. Ocean waves are known to play an important role in ice break-up and formation. In addition, as ocean waves decay, they cause a stress that pushes the ice in the direction of wave propagation. This wave stress could not previously be quantified due to insufficient observations at large scales. Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radars (SARs) provide high-resolution imagery from which wave height is measured year round encompassing Antarctica since 2014. Our estimates give an average wave stress that is comparable to the average wind stress acting over 50 km of sea ice. We further reveal highly variable half-decay distances ranging from 400 m to 700 km, and wave stresses from 0.01 to 1 Pa. We expect that this variability is related to ice properties and possibly different floe sizes and ice thicknesses. A strong feedback of waves on sea ice, via break-up and rafting, may be the cause of highly variable sea-ice properties.

TI  - Estimating grassland curing with remotely sensed data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire can become a catastrophic natural hazard, especially during dry summer seasons in Australia. Severity is influenced by various meteorological, geographical, and fuel characteristics. Modified Mark 4 McArthur's Grassland Fire Danger Index (GFDI) is a commonly used approach to determine the fire danger level in grassland ecosystems. The degree of curing (DOC, i.e. proportion of dead material) of the grass is one key ingredient in determining the fire danger. It is difficult to collect accurate DOC information in the field, and therefore ground-observed measurements are rather limited. In this study, we explore the possibility of whether adding satellite-observed data responding to vegetation water content (vegetation optical depth, VOD) will improve DOC prediction when compared with the existing satellite-observed data responding to DOC prediction models based on vegetation greenness (normalised difference vegetation index, NDVI). First, statistically significant relationships are established between selected ground-observed DOC and satellite-observed vegetation datasets (NDVI and VOD) with an r(2) up to 0.67. DOC levels estimated using satellite observations were then evaluated using field measurements with an r(2) of 0.44 to 0.55. Results suggest that VOD-based DOC estimation can reasonably reproduce ground-based observations in space and time and is comparable to the existing NDVI-based DOC estimation models.

TI  - Progress on elimination of lymphatic filariasis in Sierra Leone
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A baseline survey in 2007-2008 found lymphatic filariasis (LF) to be endemic in Sierra Leone in all 14 districts and co-endemic with onchocerciasis in 12 districts. Mass drug administration (MDA) with ivermectin started in 2006 for onchocerciasis and was modified to add albendazole in 2008 to include LF treatment. In 2011, after three effective MDAs, a significant reduction in microfilaraemia (mf) prevalence and density was reported at the midterm assessment. After five MDAs, in 2013, mf prevalence and density were again measured as part of a pre-transmission assessment survey (pre-TAS) conducted per WHO guidelines.Methods: For the pre-TAS survey, districts were paired to represent populations of one million for impact assessment. One sentinel site selected from baseline and one spot check site purposefully selected based upon local knowledge of patients with LF were surveyed per pair (two districts). At each site, 300 people over five years of age provided midnight blood samples and mf prevalence and density were determined using thick blood film microscopy. Results are compared with baseline and midterm data.Results: At pre-TAS the overall mf prevalence was 0.54% (95% CI: 0.36-0.81%), compared to 0.30% (95% CI: 0.19-0.47) at midterm and 2.6% (95% CI: 2.3-3.0%) at baseline. There was a higher, but non-significant, mf prevalence among males vs females. Eight districts (four pairs) had a prevalence of mf < 1% at all sites. Two pairs (four districts) had a prevalence of mf > 1% at one of the two sites: Koinadugu 0.98% (95% CI: 0.34-2.85%) and Bombali 2.67% (95% CI: 1.41-5. 00%), and Kailahun 1.56% (95% CI: 0.72-3.36%) and Kenema 0% (95% CI: 0.00-1.21%).Conclusions: Compared to baseline, there was a significant reduction of LF mf prevalence and density in the 12 districts co-endemic for LF and onchocerciasis after five annual LF MDAs. No statistically significant difference was seen in either measure compared to midterm. Eight of the 12 districts qualified for TAS. The other four districts that failed to qualify for TAS had historically high LF baseline prevalence and density and had regular cross-border movement of populations. These four districts needed to conduct two additional rounds of LF MDA before repeating the pre-TAS. The results showed that Sierra Leone continued to make progress towards the elimination of LF as a public health problem.

TI  - Correcting for trace gas absorption when retrieving aerosol optical depth from satellite observations of reflected shortwave radiation
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieving aerosol optical depth (AOD) from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) satellite-measured radiance requires separating the aerosol signal from the total observed signal. Total TOA radiance includes signal from the underlying surface and from atmospheric constituents such as aerosols, clouds and gases. Multispectral retrieval algorithms, such as the dark-target (DT) algorithm that operates upon the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS, on board Terra and Aqua satellites) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS, on board Suomi-NPP) sensors, use wavelength bands in "window" regions. However, while small, the gas absorptions in these bands are non-negligible and require correction. In this paper, we use the High-resolution TRANsmission (HITRAN) database and Line-By-Line Radiative Transfer Model (LBLRTM) to derive consistent gas corrections for both MODIS and VIIRS wavelength bands. Absorptions from H2O, CO2 and O-3 are considered, as well as other trace gases. Even though MODIS and VIIRS bands are "similar", they are different enough that applying MODIS-specific gas corrections to VIIRS observations results in an underestimate of global mean AOD (by 0.01), but with much larger regional AOD biases of up to 0.07. As recent studies have been attempting to create a long-term data record by joining multiple satellite data sets, including MODIS and VIIRS, the consistency of gas correction has become even more crucial.

T2  - BMJ case reports
M3  - Case Reports
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - In patients with primary cutaneous melanomas of the distal upper limb, metastatic involvement of the epitrochlear lymph nodes is uncommon. It belongs to a particular category of nodal metastasis termed as interval or in-transit lymphadenopathies often encountered by tumour cells as they spread from the primary sites. We describe the case of a 41-year-old woman who presented with a right forearm melanoma that was metastatic to both the epitrochlear and axillary lymph nodes. She underwent wide excision of the primary lesion as well as epitrochlear and axillary nodal clearances in the same sitting. Although uncommon, It is prudent to search for the presence of sentinel lymph nodes in the epitrochlear region although uncommon, and where positive, a completion axillary clearance should be undertaken at the same time as the epitrochlear clearance. Failure to detect the presence of interval lymph nodes along the melanoma spread pathways may be a cause of tumour recurrence.

AB  - Background: To further characterize the micromorphometric immunological pattern to metastatic melanoma in sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsies and completion lymph node (CLN) dissections and their relation to 5-year overall survival (OS).Methods: Retrospective cohort of 49 patients from 1996 to 2005 with a positive SLN who underwent CLN dissection (CLD) was studied. Micromorphometric characteristics included follicular center count (FCC)/profile, sinus histiocytosis, metastatic size, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (intranodal), paracortical dendritic cells, germinal center reaction and morphology. Comparison of Kaplan-Meier survival curves used the exact log-rank statistic.Results: In the high-FCC (n = 5-51) vs the low-FCC (n < 5) lymph nodes, a delayed separation occurred at 3 years, with 5-year OS rates being 73% vs 54% in the high-and low-FCC groups, respectively. Improved survival up to 3 years was also noted in CLDs that showed a higher FCC when compared to the prior SLN. Patients with metastatic deposits > 2 mm had significantly lower 5-year survival (both <. 001).Conclusions: Nodal micromorphometric features (ie, FCC) are probably related to host immune response to metastasis. Quantitative evaluation of lymphoid follicular centers could provide valuable prognostic information to help to stratify patients.

TI  - ASSESSMENT ON THE AEROSOLS VARIATION DURING THE INTENSE HAZE EVENT OF JUNE 2013 OVER MALAYSIA BY UTILIZING THE SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING AND GROUND BASED MEASUREMENT
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid occurrence of forest fires in Southeast Asia and associated biomass burning, has contributed obviously to the problem of trans-boundary haze and the dispersion of pollutants in the region. Atmospheric pollutants, such as particulate matter in the atmosphere, have received extensive attention, mainly because of their adverse effect on people's health. In 2013, Malaysia experienced an intense haze episodes with a high concentration of aerosols were recorded and degrading the local air quality and reduce the visibility. This paper aim is to analyze the spatio-temporal variation of aerosols concentration during intense haze event in 2013 over Malaysia by using remote sensing data and ground-based measurement. The air quality data across Malaysia was assessed based on PM10 concentration which provided by Malaysia Department of Environment (MDOE) and the spatial view of aerosols optical depth (AOD) data from satellites (Terra Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The environmental parameters including temperature, rainfall, and wind speed were obtained from NOAA's National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) while an additional information about the occurrence of active fires in surrounding region was retrieved from MODIS Active Fire Data was retrieved from NASA/LANCE FIRMS. In June 2013, the PK10 value was recorded high in few stations over the Peninsular Malaysia with the highest PK10 was recorded in the Bukit Rambai Station from 21st until 23rd of June with more than 400 mu g/m(3). Low wind speed and low mixing depth, together with the absence of rainfall persisted during this hazy condition. The PK10 was began cleared with the increase of wind speed starting 26th of June with the rainfall also contributed to disperse the haze from the atmosphere. The sources and destination of aerosols are identified via the HYSPLT trajectory model, revealing that aerosols during June 2013 are mainly originated from the west and southwest area (Sumatera, Indonesia).

TI  - An Advanced Forest Fire Danger Forecasting System: Integration of Remote Sensing and Historical Sources of Ignition Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire is one of the major natural hazards/disasters in Canada and many ecosystems across the world. Here, our objective was to enhance the performance of an existing solely remote sensing-based forest fire danger forecasting system (FFDFS), and its implementation over the northern region of the Canadian province of Alberta. The modified FFDFS was comprised of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived daily surface temperature (Ts) and precipitable water (PW), and 8-day composite of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference water index (NDWI), where we assumed that cloud-contaminant pixels would reduce the risk of fire occurrences. In addition, we generated ignition cause-specific static fire danger (SFD) maps derived using the historical human- and lightning-caused fires during the period 1961-2014. Upon incorporating different combinations of the generated SFD maps with the modified FFDFS, we evaluated their performances against actual fire spots during the 2009-2011 fire seasons. Our findings revealed that our proposed modifications were quite effective and the modified FFDFS captured almost the same amount of fires as the original FFDFS, i.e., about 77% of the detected fires on an average in the top three fire danger classes of extremely high, very high, and high categories, where about 50% of the study area fell under low and moderate danger classes. Additionally, we observed that the combination of modified FFDFS and human-caused SFD map (road buffer) demonstrated the most effective results in fire detection, i.e., 82% of detected fires on an average in the top three fire danger classes, where about 46% of the study area fell under the moderate and low danger categories. We believe that our developments would be helpful to manage the forest fire in order to reduce its overall impact.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - EGYPT Nile Delta has very limited area of fertile soils which threatening by urban sprawl. Assessment of the urban area stretch effect on agricultural lands of the Egyptian Northern Nile Delta has been detected by using Landsat TM, Landsat ETM+ and Landsat OLI satellite images (1984, 2002, and 2016 respectively). Monitoring of urban sprawl was applied by visual interpretation via supervised classification, on-screen digitizing and post classification change detection technique. The urban thematic layer and the land capability map using GIS made it possible to highlight the hazards of urban growth on the soils that have high capability. The obtained results showed that the overall increase of urban area amounted to 28 Km(2).(210% of the urban area) during the study from 1984 to 2016. The urban area growth throughout the 1984 - 2016 was on the expense of the soils that have good capability with amount of 18 km(2) (4 % of the good capability soil area). While the soils with fair capability lost 9 km(2) had 4 % of the fair capability soil area. The urban area growth over the noncapable soils (barren land) was very large during the 1984 and 2002 period, where it has been amounted to 11 km(2) was converted to urban. The urban sprawl pattern has been changed during the period from 2002 to 2016, where very partial area amounted to(1km(2)) of the noncapablesoils (barren land) was changed to urban area. It could be summarized that the urban sprawl represents one of the main soil loss and degradation processesin the Nile delta.

AB  - Exploiting geothermal resources for either power, home heating, Spa, greenhouses, industrial or tourism requires an initial identification of suitable areas. This can be done cost-effectively using remote sensing satellite data for identifying possible areas of hydrothermal alteration and minerals related to geothermal systems. Earth features and minerals are known to have unique diagnostic spectral reflectance characteristics that can be used to discriminate them. The focus of this paper is to investigate the applicability of mapping hydrothermal alteration in relation to geothermal systems (thermal springs) at Yankari Park Northeastern Nigeria, using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) satellite data for resource exploration. The ASTER Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) bands are used to highlight and discriminate alteration areas by employing digital image processing techniques such as; Band ratios and Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) image transforms and spectral mapping techniques including; Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) and Linear Spectral Unmixing (LSU). Field verifications are conducted at the Yankari Park using hand held Global Positioning System (GPS) MONTERRA(@) to identify locations of hydrothermal alteration and rock sampling obtained at the vicinity of the 'Mawulgo' and 'Wikki' thermal springs. X-ray Diffraction (XRD) results of rock samples obtained from the field validated hydrothermal alteration by the presence of indicator minerals including; Dickite, Kaolinite, Hematite and Quart. The study indicated the applicability of mapping geothermal anomalies for resource exploration in unmapped sparsely vegetated savanna environment characterized by subtle surface manifestations such as thermal springs. The results could have implication for geothermal resource exploration especially at the prefeasibility stages by narrowing targets for comprehensive surveys and in unexplored savanna regions where expensive airborne surveys are unaffordable.

TI  - Struggling with social-ecological mismatches in marine management and conservation at Easter Island
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Easter Island, most of fisheries regulations are top-down implemented by the central fisheries authority located 4000 km eastwards. This could generate problems in regulations compliance, given the cultural differences between the western worldview and Polynesian culture of Easter Island. A total of 18 issues that must be considered previously to an intervention in the island were identified. Four of them scored the highest difference between Rapanui and public services representatives. Among them, "Integrating traditions and culture" had a little priority for the public services representatives, but was the most important for the Rapanui. According to the public services representatives in Easter Island and local fishermen, there is a little compliance with regulations related to fisheries and, due to cultural aspects, it is not possible to enforce regulations and apply sanctions. The low compliance with fisheries regulations is due to the lack of representativeness of regulations. Interventions in the island are based on western worldview that does not fit with social and ecological domains of social-ecological system. A flexible governance system, based on decision making at local level in line with local tradition is needed to navigate to a resource management and conservation in Easter Island.

TI  - Functional regression on remote sensing data in oceanography
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to propose the use of a functional data analysis approach as an alternative to the classical statistical methods most commonly used in oceanography and water quality management. In particular we consider the prediction of total suspended solids (TSS) based on remote sensing (RS) data. For this purpose several functional linear regression models and classical non-functional regression models are applied to 10 years of RS data obtained from medium resolution imaging spectrometer sensor to predict the TSS concentration in the coastal zone of the Guadalquivir estuary. The results of functional and classical approaches are compared in terms of their mean square prediction error values and the superiority of the functional models is established. A simulation study has been designed in order to support these findings and to determine the best prediction model for the TSS parameter in more general contexts.

TI  - Low Cloud Cover Sensitivity to Biomass-Burning Aerosols and Meteorology over the Southeast Atlantic
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Shortwave-absorbing aerosols seasonally cover and interact with an expansive low-level cloud deck over the southeast Atlantic. Daily anomalies of the MODIS low cloud fraction, fine-mode aerosol optical depth (AOD(f)), and six ERA-Interim meteorological parameters (lower-tropospheric stability, 800-hPa subsidence, 600-hPa specific humidity, 1000- and 800-hPa horizontal temperature advection, and 1000-hPa geopotential height) are constructed spanning July-October (2001-12). A standardized multiple linear regression, whereby the change in the low cloud fraction to each component's variability is normalized by one standard deviation, facilitates comparison between the different variables. Most cloud-meteorology relationships follow expected behavior for stratocumulus clouds. Of interest is the low cloud-subsidence relationship, whereby increasing subsidence increases low cloud cover between 10 degrees and 20 degrees S but decreases it elsewhere. Increases in AOD(f) increase cloudiness everywhere, independent of other meteorological predictors. The cloud-AOD(f) effect is partially compensated by accompanying increases in the midtropospheric moisture, which is associated with decreases in low cloud cover. This suggests that the free-tropospheric moisture affects the low cloud deck primarily through longwave radiation rather than mixing. The low cloud cover is also more sensitive to aerosol when the vertical distance between the cloud and aerosol layer is relatively small, which is more likely to occur early in the biomass burning season and farther offshore. A parallel statistical analysis that does not include AOD(f) finds altered relationships between the low cloud cover changes and meteorology that can be understood through the aerosol cross-correlations with the meteorological predictors. For example, the low cloud-stability relationship appears stronger if aerosols are not explicitly included.

TI  - Mapping Satellite Inherent Optical Properties Index in Coastal Waters of the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yucatan Peninsula hosts worldwide-known tourism destinations that concentrate most of the Mexico tourism activity. In this region, tourism has exponentially increased over the last years, including wildlife oriented tourism. Rapid tourism development, involving the consequent construction of hotels and tourist commodities, is associated with domestic sewage discharges from septic tanks. In this karstic environment, submarine groundwater discharges are very important and highly vulnerable to anthropogenic pollution. Nutrient loadings are linked to harmful algal blooms, which are an issue of concern to local and federal authorities due to their recurrence and socioeconomic and human health costs. In this study, we used satellite products from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) to calculate and map the satellite Inherent Optical Properties (IOP) Index. We worked with different scenarios considering both holiday and hydrological seasons. Our results showed that the satellite IOP Index allows one to build baseline information in a sustainable mid-term or long-term basis which is key for ecosystem-based management.

AB  - This study proposed a workflow for an optimized object-based analysis for vegetation mapping using integration of Quickbird and Sentinel-1 data. The method is validated on a set of data captured over a part of Selangor located in the Peninsular Malaysia. The method comprised four components including image segmentation, Taguchi optimization, attribute selection using random forest, and rule-based feature extraction. Results indicated the robustness of the proposed approach as the area under curve of forest; grassland, old oil palm, rubber, urban tree, and young oil palm were calculated as 0.90, 0.89, 0.87, 0.87, 0.80, and 0.77, respectively. In addition, results showed that SAR data is very useful for extracting rubber and young oil palm trees (given by random forest importance values). Finally, further research is suggested to improve segmentation results and extract more features from the scene.

TI  - Assessment of Irrigation Performance in Large River Basins under Data Scarce EnvironmentA Case of Kabul River Basin, Afghanistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kabul River basin (KRB) of Afghanistan, a lifeline of around 10 million people, has multiplicity of governance, management, and development-related challenges leading to inequity, inadequacy, and unreliability of irrigation water distribution. Prior to any uplifting intervention, there is a need to evaluate the performance of irrigation system on a long term basis to identify the existing bottlenecks. Although there are several indicators available for the performance evaluation of the irrigation schemes, we used the coefficient of variation (CV) of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) in space (basin, sub-basin, and provincial level), relative evapotranspiration (RET), and temporal CV of RET, to assess the equity, adequacy, and reliability of water distribution, respectively, from 2003 to 2013. The ETa was estimated through a surface energy balance system (SEBS) algorithm and the ETa estimates were validated using the advection aridity (AA) method with a R-2 value of 0.81 and 0.77 at Nawabad and Sultanpur stations, respectively. The global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products were used as main inputs to the SEBS. Results show that the mean seasonal sub-based RET values during summer (May-September) (0.37 +/- 0.06) and winter (October-April) (0.40 +/- 0.08) are below the target values (RET 0.75) during 2003-2013. The CV of the mean ETa, within sub-basins and provinces for the entire study period, has an equitable distribution of water from October-January (0.09 +/- 0.04), whereas the highest inequity (0.24 +/- 0.08) in water distribution is during early summer. The range of the CV of the mean ETa (0.04-0.06) on a monthly and seasonal basis shows the unreliability of water supplies in several provinces or sub-basins. The analysis of the temporal CV of mean RET highlights the unreliable water supplies across the entire basin. The maximum ETa during the study period was estimated for the Shamal sub-basin (552 +/- 43 mm) while among the provinces, Kunar experienced the highest ETa (544 +/- 39 mm). This study highlights the dire need for interventions to improve the irrigation performance in time and space. The proposed methodology can be used as a framework for monitoring and implementing water distribution plans in future.

TI  - Assessment of Shoreline and Associated Landuse/Land cover Changes along Part of Lagos Coastline, Nigeria
T2  - CONTEMPORARY TRENDS IN GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The city of Lagos, Nigeria has undergone rapid increase in population due to economic and commercial activities. As a result of this, there has been a persistent change in Land use/Land cover (LULC) of the city and shoreline through the years. This observation necessitated the use of multi-temporal satellite data to characterize shoreline changes between 1984 and 2016. Therefore, the study attempts to determine the shoreline change during the study period and the coastal land use and land cover (LULC) of the study area. Satellite data was acquired andsubjected to some image processing techniques such as image enhancement, supervised classification, and shoreline extraction. The digital shoreline analysis system (DSAS) in ArcGIS environment was utilized to cast transects and calculate statistical parameters for the shoreline and spatial data used was Landsat TM, ETM and OLI for the years 1984, 1990, 2000, 2004 and 2016 respectively. The results indicate that LULC changes in built-up areas increases rapidly during the years (1984-2015) from 12.2-36.2%, water bodies increased from (1984-1990-2000) from 52%, 54%, 52% and reduces to 47.4% in the year 2015 while vegetation cover reduces drastically through the year range from 36%, 33%, 29%, 24% and 16%. A total of 1034 transects were generated with 100m spacing and the average rate of change was calculated for the 32 year period (1984-2016). The linear regression rate (LRR) shoreline result shows a mean of -0.59m/year where 73.1% of transect fall under erosion and 61.8% accretion respectively. The end point rate (EPR) and net shoreline movement (NSM) analysis revealed mean shoreline change of -0.57m/year and -18.1m/period respectively from 1984-2016. The EPR and NSM results both revealed that 231 transect or 22.3% experienced erosion, and 805 transect or 77.9% with accretion. It was observed that significant accretion rate recorded along most sections of the shorelines is attributed to beach nourishment activities.

T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present study, the spatial-temporal distribution and estimation of trends of different aerosol optical properties, and related impact factors were investigated over three countries: Ghana, Togo, and Benin along the Gulf of Guinea Coast in Southern West Africa (SWA). For this purpose, long-term satellite derived aerosol optical properties (aerosol optical depth at 550 nm; AOD(550), Angstrom exponent at 470-660 nm; AE(470-660), and absorption aerosol index; AAI) retrieved from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) during January 2005 December 2015 were utilized. The annual mean spatial distribution of AOD(550) was found to be high (> 0.55) over the southern coastal area, moderate-to-high (0.35-0.55) over the central, and low (< 0.35) over northern parts of the study domain. The seasonal mean variations showed high (low) values of AOD(550) and AAI during the Hannattan or dry (wet) season. Whereas, low (high) AE(470.660) values were characterized during the Harmattan (wet) season. Linear trend analysis revealed a decreasing trend in AOD(550) and AM, and increasing trend in AE470-660. Further, an investigation on the potential drivers to AOD distribution over the SWA revealed that precipitation, NDVI, and terrain were negatively correlated with AOD. Finally, the HYSPLIT derived back trajectory analyses revealed diverse transport pathways originated from the North Atlantic Ocean, Sahara Desert, and Nigeria along with locally generated aerosols.

TI  - Investigating the current status of geospatial data and urban growth indicators in Jordan and Irbid municipality: implications for urban and environmental planning
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing levels of urbanization with intensive use of resources became a common problem across all countries. Jordan is a country with limited resources that require periodic assessment and frequent monitoring. The geospatial data, maps and urban growth indicators are fundamental requirements to monitor and evaluate cities expansion, development and resources use. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to investigate the availability and accessibility of geospatial data needed for city's urban planning research and calculate recent urban growth indicators for Greater Irbid Municipality (GIM). All National governmental institutions were visited and surveyed. Landsat-8 images, geographic information system, classification workflow in ENVI-5 and statistical methods were used to assess selected urban growth indicators for GIM. The results showed that only one-fourth of Jordan national authorities use spatial data for urban planning. Researchers are expected to face complexities in identifying the available national geospatial data, accessing and acquisition of the available data with sufficient accuracy and comprehensiveness. The GIM showed lack of certain geospatial data (land use categories, population and built-up densities). These data were calculated, and results showed that the green, urban, open space densities for the year 2015 were 49, 25 and 26%, respectively. The population and built-up densities relative to the urban area was 7879 capita/km(2) and 20%, respectively. Therefore, the GIM is a dense city and its land use categories need to be monitored. Funds are needed to develop complete, comprehensive and accurate national geodata infrastructure that are governed with policies and regulations to facilitate researchers' mission to support sustainability.

TI  - Retrievals of cloud droplet size from the research scanning polarimeter data: Validation using in situ measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present comparisons of cloud droplet size distributions (DSDs) retrieved from the research scanning polarimeter (RSP) data with correlative in situ measurements made during the North Atlantic Aerosols and Marine Ecosystems Study (NAAMES). The airborne portion of this field experiment was based out of St. John's airport, Newfoundland, Canada with the focus of this paper being on the deployment in May June 2016. RSP was onboard the NASA C-130 aircraft together with an array of in situ and other remote sensing instrumentation. The RSP is an along-track scanner measuring the polarized and total reflectance in 9 spectral channels. Its uniquely high angular resolution allows for characterization of liquid water droplet sizes using the rainbow structure observed in the polarized reflectance over the scattering angle range from 135 to 165. The rainbow is dominated by single scattering of light by cloud droplets, so its structure is characteristic specifically of the droplet sizes at cloud top (within unit optical depth into the cloud, equivalent to approximately 50 m). A parametric fitting algorithm applied to the polarized reflectance provides retrievals of the droplet effective radius and variance assuming a prescribed size distribution shape (gamma distribution). In addition to this, we use a non parametric method, the Rainbow Fourier Transform (RFT), which allows us to retrieve the droplet size distribution itself. The latter is important in the case of clouds with complex microphysical structure, or multiple layers of cloud, which result in multi-modal DSDs. During NAAMES the aircraft performed a number of flight patterns specifically designed for comparisons between remote sensing retrievals and in situ measurements. These patterns consisted of two flight segments above the same straight ground track. One of these segments was flown above clouds allowing for remote sensing measurements, while the other was near the cloud top where cloud droplets were sampled. We compare the DSDs retrieved from the RSP data with in situ measurements made by the Cloud Droplet Probe (CDP). The comparisons generally show good agreement (better than 1 pm for effective radius and in most cases better than 0.02 for effective variance) with deviations explainable by the position of the aircraft within the cloud, or by the presence of additional cloud layers between the cloud being sampled by the in situ instrumentation and the altitude of the remote sensing segment. In the latter case, the multi-modal DSDs retrieved from the RSP data were consistent with the multi-layer cloud structures observed in the correlative High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) profiles. The results of these comparisons provide a rare validation of polarimetric droplet size retrieval techniques, demonstrating their accuracy and robustness and the potential of satellite data of this kind on a global scale.

TI  - Following Policy: A Network Ethnography of the UK Character Education Policy Community
T2  - SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH ONLINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past 15 years, there has been a growing interest and investment in character' education across the UK political landscape. Alongside the activities of central government, character education has been promoted by a range of non-government actors in the UK and beyond, including philanthropic foundations, think tanks, education entrepreneurs, and academics. It is the presence of these actors and their relationship to, and influence on, UK government policy that we examine in this article. Investigating character education from a perspective of policy formation and influence, we trace the key policy actors who have contributed to the adoption of character education in the UK, and their international connections, identifying the resources, activities and relationships through which they have achieved policy influence. A central and original contribution of this article is in identifying the financial and ideological influence of US Christian neoconservative philanthropic foundation the John Templeton Foundation on social science research and policy in the UK. Our analysis identifies academics in the UK and US who, through considerable John Templeton Foundation funding, have provided an evidence base that authorises character education as a policy solution. We also locate policy entrepreneurs' as key nodal actors, whose social capital and elite membership helps to lubricate network relations and facilitate policy influence. Finally, we consider the motivations and vested interests of policy actors, including the John Templeton Foundation's particular model of philanthropy, and conclude that the character education agenda is underpinned by a set of ideas that promote a free-market, individualistic and socially conservative worldview.

TI  - Cases of suspected poisoning in small animal practice - a retrospective and prospective survey
T2  - TIERAERZTLICHE PRAXIS AUSGABE KLEINTIERE HEIMTIERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Systematic survey of data from cases of suspected poisoning in small animal practices. Material and methods: In 11 exemplary selected small animal practices, patient files from cases of suspected poisoning over 2006/2007, data entry forms of poisonings 2009-2010 and the contact group, which are all patients with at least one visit in 2007, were analysed. Results: In 2007, approximately 1 in 200 dog and 1 in 500 cat patients were presented with poisoning. More than 70% of cases concerned dogs. Some breeds of hunting dogs were more frequently affected than expected from their percentage in the practice population. Suspicion of poisoning was retrospective mainly founded in neutered dogs. In addition to numerous unspecific symptoms, bleeding was frequently observed. With central nervous system symptoms or a critical general condition a founded suspicion was observed more frequently. In cases of unfounded suspicion, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract was mostly present. Other frequently seen diseases were infections, tumours and autoimmune diseases. The main toxins in the retrospective evaluation were coumarin derivatives (37%), drugs (10%) and chocolate (7%). The prospective survey yielded a higher percentage of poisoning with drugs and plants. The diagnosis was mainly based on case history and clinical signs. Therapy was predominantly symptomatic. Conclusions: Poisoning with coumarin derivatives is the most frequent intoxication in dogs, but also cats. The risk from permethrin for cats remains current. In daily practice, therapy is mostly symptomatic without any specific toxicological evidence. Consequently, the causative toxin is frequently unknown. Therefore, additional methods for elimination (stomach/rectal lavage, medical coal, lipid therapy) should be included as therapeutical options. For a successful systematic prospective survey in daily practice a good collaboration between practice and investigator is necessary.

TI  - Sweetened beverages, snacks and overweight: findings from the Young Lives cohort study in Peru
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To determine the association between consumption of snacks and sweetened beverages and risk of overweight among children.Design: Secondary analysis of the Young Lives cohort study in Peru.Setting: Twenty sentinel sites from a total of 1818 districts available in Peru.Subjects: Children in the younger cohort of the Young Lives study in Peru, specifically those included in the third ( 2009) and the fourth ( 2013) rounds.Results: A total of 1813 children were evaluated at baseline; 49.2% girls and mean age 8.0 (SD 0.3) years. At baseline, 3.3 (95% CI 2.5, 4.2)% reported daily sweetened beverage consumption, while this proportion was 3.9 (95% CI 3.1, 4.9)% for snacks. Baseline prevalence of overweight was 22.0 (95% CI 20.1, 23.9) %. Only 1414 children were followed for 4.0 (SD 0.1) years, with an overweight incidence of 3.6 (95% CI 3.1, 4.1) per 100 person-years. In multivariable analysis, children who consumed sweetened beverages and snacks daily had an average weight increase of 2.29 (95% CI 0.62, 3.96) and 2.04 (95% CI 0.48, 3.60) kg more, respectively, than those who never consumed these products, in approximately 4 years of follow-up. Moreover, there was evidence of an association between daily consumption of sweetened beverages and risk of overweight (relative risk=2.12; 95% CI 1.05, 4.28).Conclusions: Daily consumption of sweetened beverages and snacks was associated with increased weight gain v. never consuming these products; and in the case of sweetened beverages, with higher risk of developing overweight.

TI  - Unsupervised Rapid Flood Mapping Using Sentinel-1 GRD SAR Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new methodology for rapid flood mapping exploiting Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. In particular, we propose the usage of ground range detected (GRD) images, i.e., preprocessed products made available by the European Space Agency, which can be quickly treated for information extraction through simple and poorly demanding algorithms. The proposed framework is based on two processing levels providing event maps with increasing resolution. The first level exploits classic co-occurrence texture measures combined with amplitude information in a fuzzy classification system avoiding the critical step of thresholding. The second level consists of a change-detection approach applied to the full resolution GRD product. The discussion is supported by several experiments demonstrating the potentiality of the proposed methodology, which is particularly oriented toward the end-user community.

TI  - Above-ground carbon dynamics in different arid urban green spaces
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban areas are proven sources of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, but urban greenery offers an opportunity to mitigate climate change impacts. Satellite remote sensing is valuable tool in assessing current and historical carbon stock dynamics. In this study, we estimated above-ground carbon (AGC) stock within four land use types including parks and gardens, avenue plantations, open greenery and institutional greenery in selected locations in Muscat Governorate through field measurement and satellite applications. Five different estimated spectral vegetative indices (VIs) acquired from Landsat 8 OLI were employed to develop linear and non-linear regression models between the spectral vegetative indices and the AGC stocks. The model with the highest coefficient of determination was used to estimate the AGC of the entire selected locations in Muscat Governorate for the year 2014 and 2017. The study results showed that both normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and ratio vegetative index correlate strongly with AGC in Parks and gardens with NDVI showing moderate correlation with AGC in Avenue plantations. The AGC in CO2 equivalence in Muscat Governorate, Oman, for 2014 and 2017 were estimated to be 5987 and 9591 tons, respectively, with an annual sequestration rate of 1201 tons. The social value of the current CO2 equivalent storage for 2017 was US $ 537,127.00 (OMR 206,802.85). Background turf grass and impervious surfaces might have affected the AGC-VIs correlations within the land use types. Urban greening projects involving plantation of high biomass trees may enhance urban carbon sequestrations.

TI  - Change detection of Bunaken Island coral reefs using 15 years of very high resolution satellite images: A kaleidoscope of habitat trajectories
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bunaken Island (Indonesia), a time-series of very high resolution (2-4 m) satellite imagery was used to draw the long-term dynamics of shallow reef flat habitats from 2001 to 2015. Lack of historical georeferenced ground-truth data oriented the analysis towards a scenario-approach based on the monitoring of selected unambiguously-changing habitat polygons characterized in situ in 2014 and 2015. Eight representative scenarios (coral colonization, coral loss, coral stability, and sand colonization by seagrass) were identified. All occurred simultaneously in close vicinity, precluding the identification of a single general cause of changes that could have affected the whole reef. Likely, very fine differences in reef topography, exposure to wind/wave and sea level variations were responsible for the variety of trajectories. While trajectories of reef habitats is a way to measure resilience and coral recovery, here, the 15-year time-series was too short to be able to conclude on the resilience of Bunaken reefs.

TI  - Coastline Detection with Gaofen-3 SAR Images Using an Improved FCM Method
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline detection is one of the main applications of the Gaofen-3 satellite in the ocean field. However, the capability of Gaofen-3 SAR image in coastline detection has not yet been validated. In this paper, two Gaofen-3 SAR images, acquired in 2016, were used to extract the coastlines of the regions of Bohai and Taihu in China, respectively. The classical Fuzzy C-means (FCM) method was used in the coastline detection, but had been improved by combining the Wavelet decomposition algorithm to better suppress the inherent speckle noises of SAR image. Coastline detection results obtained from two Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired on the same regions were compared with those of the Gaofen-3 images. By using the manually delineated coastlines as the standards in the qualitative evaluations, improvements of about 12.0%, 8.3%, 23.8%, and 9.4% can be achieved by the improved FCM method with respect to the indicators of mean, RMSE, PGSD, and P90%, respectively; demonstrating that the Gaofen-3 data is superior to the Sentinel-1 data in the detection of coastline.

TI  - Burned area detection based on time-series analysis in a cloud computing environment
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - There are large omission errors in the estimation of burned area in map products that are generated at a global scale. This error is then inherited by other models, for instance, those used to report Greenhouse Gas Emissions using a "bottom up" approach. This study evaluates temporal methods to improve burned area detection using Landsat 5-TM and 8-OLI. In this process, the normalized burn ratio (NBR) was used to highlight burned areas and thresholds to classify burned and non-burned areas. In order to maximize the burned area detection two alternatives to the temporal dNBR method were evaluated: the relative form of the temporal difference RdNBR and the use of time series metrics. The processing, algorithm development and access to Landsat data was made on the Google Earth Engine GEE platform. Three regions of Latin America with large fire occurrence were selected: The Amazon Forest in Colombia, the transition from Chiquitano to Amazon Forest in Bolivia, and El Chaco Region in Argentina. The accuracy assessment of these new products was based on burned area protocols. The best model classified 85% of burned areas in the Chiquitano Forests of Bolivia, 63% of the burned areas of the Amazon Forests of Colombia and 69% of burned areas in El Chaco of Argentina.

TI  - Field-Scale Assessment of Land and Water Use Change over the California Delta Using Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to accurately monitor and anticipate changes in consumptive water use associated with changing land use and land management is critical to developing sustainable water management strategies in water-limited climatic regions. In this paper, we present an application of a remote sensing data fusion technique for developing high spatiotemporal resolution maps of evapotranspiration (ET) at scales that can be associated with changes in land use. The fusion approach combines ET map timeseries developed using an multi-scale energy balance algorithm applied to thermal data from Earth observation platforms with high spatial but low temporal resolution (e.g., Landsat) and with moderate resolution but frequent temporal coverage (e.g., MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer)). The approach is applied over the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region in Californiaan area critical to both agricultural production and drinking water supply within the state that has recently experienced stresses on water resources due to a multi-year (2012-2017) extreme drought. ET datacubes with 30-m resolution and daily timesteps were constructed for the 2015-2016 water years and related to detailed maps of land use developed at the same spatial scale. The ET retrievals are evaluated at flux sites over multiple land covers to establish a metric of accuracy in the annual water use estimates, yielding root-mean-square errors of 1.0, 0.8, and 0.3 mm day(-1) at daily, monthly, and yearly timesteps, respectively, for all sites combined. Annual ET averaged over the Delta changed only 3 mm year(-1) between water years, from 822 to 819 mm year(-1), translating to an area-integrated total change in consumptive water use of seven thousand acre-feet (TAF). Changes were largest in areas with recorded land-use change between water yearsmost significantly, fallowing of crop land presumably in response to reductions in water availability and allocations due to the drought. Moreover, the time evolution in water use associated with wetland restorationan effort aimed at reducing subsidence and carbon emissions within the inner Deltais assessed using a sample wetland chronosequence. Region-specific matrices of consumptive water use associated with land use changes may be an effective tool for policymakers and farmers to understand how land use conversion could impact consumptive use and demand.

TI  - Vertical Growth Phase as a Prognostic Factor for Sentinel Lymph Node Positivity in Thin Melanomas: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis
T2  - PLASTIC AND RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: The 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer guidelines recommended consideration of sentinel lymph node biopsy for thin melanoma (Breslow thickness <1.0 mm) with aggressive pathologic features such as ulceration and/or high mitotic rate. The therapeutic benefit of biopsy-based treatment remains controversial. The authors conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the risk and outcomes of sentinel lymph node positivity in thin melanoma, and examined established and potential novel predictors of positivity.Methods: Three databases were searched by two independent reviewers for sentinel lymph node positivity in patients with thin melanoma. Study heterogeneity, publication bias, and quality were assessed. Data collected included age, sex, Breslow thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration, regression, Clark level, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and vertical growth phase. Positivity was estimated using a random effects model. Association of positivity and clinicopathologic features was investigated using meta-regression.Results: Ninety-three studies were identified representing 35,276 patients with thin melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy. Of these patients, 952 had a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy, for an event rate of 5.1 percent (95 percent CI, 4.1 to 6.3 percent). Significant associations were identified between positivity and Breslow thickness greater than 0.75 mm but less than 1.0 mm, mitotic rate, ulceration, and Clark level greater than IV. Seven studies reported on vertical growth phase, which was strongly associated with positivity (OR, 4.3; 95 percent CI, 2.5 to 7.7).Conclusions: To date, this is the largest meta-analysis to examine predictors of sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity in patients with thin melanoma. Vertical growth phase had a strong association with biopsy positivity, providing support for its inclusion in standardized pathologic reporting.

CP  - 17th WaterNet/WARFSA/GWPSA Symposium on Integrated Water Resources Management - Water Security, Sustainability and Development in Eastern and Africa Southern
CL  - Gaborone, BOTSWANA
AB  - Land use change is the second most important anthropogenic influence on climate beside the emission of greenhouse gases. Urbanization is leading to significant land use changes in Africa since the continent is undergoing rapid urbanization and population growth in recent decades. Addis Ababa is one of these fast growing cities in the continent. Therefore, detection of land use change is very important to identify its impact on climate and sustainable land use management of the city. The study used Landsat images to generate land use/land cover change map for the city. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used to detect the major changes of vegetation cover occurred between 1986 and 2011 as a result of land use and land cover change. Downscaled HadCM3 simulations under A2 and B2 emission scenarios is used to investigate future urban heat island (UHI) over the city of Addis Ababa. In the city, the analysis of Landsat images has shown that the built-up areas have increased by 121.88 km(2) within the last 25 years. This finding is consistent with NDVI images taken over the same period that reveal a decline in vegetation cover. The impact of the urbanization-driven land use/cover change has resulted in notable nocturnal urban heat island (UHI) as revealed from an average increase in minimum temperature of 1.5 degrees C at the centre of the city relative to rural site over the 1960-2001 period. The mean of the 2006-2010 spatial minimum temperature anomaly with respect to the base period mean of 1981-2005 is consistent with the observed UHI. The temperature in the central areas (both commercial and residential sectors) of Addis Ababa is warmer than the surrounding areas. The thermal gradient increase from about 1.44 degrees C at the centre (Arada, Addis Ketema, Lideta and Kirkos) to 0.21 degrees C at the peripheral parts of the city (Gulele, Bole, Nefasilk-Lafto, Kolfe Keranio and east of Yeka sub-cities) transecting across the hot (high-density urban) to moderately warm to cool (non-built-up) areas. However, the maximum temperature and rainfall exhibit variability that follows topographic differences. Future urban climate change projections of urban heat island formation under A2 and B2 emission scenarios show that the nocturnal UHI will be intense in winter or dry season episodes in the city. The highest urban warming is from October to December (2.5 degrees C to 3.2 degrees C) during 2050s and 2080s.

T2  - BUNSEKI KAGAKU
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes the variation of the fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and inorganic ion components (SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, Na+, Cl-, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) concentrations in particulate matters (PMs) from March 2013 to February 2017 in Sanyo Onoda, Yamaguchi, Japan. The yearly mean PM2.5 mass concentration decreased from 21.2 mu g m(-3) to 17.0 mu g m(-3) in Sanyo Onoda, and a similar decreasing trend was observed in Japan. The yearly mean total mass concentration of ion components also decreased from 19.6 mu g m(-3) to 13.8 mu g m(-3). The major components of PMs were SO42-, NO3-, and NH4+, which accounted for 72-76 % of the total ion components mass concentration. The relationship of the equivalent concentrations between anions and cations was linear with a slope of 1.01 (r = 0.745). During this period, in Beijing, China, the yearly mean PM2.5 mass concentration decreased from 99.1 mu g m(-3) in FY2013 to 79.9 mu g m(-3) in FY2016. Moreover, the SO2 and NO2 vertical column density in Beijing was dramatically reduced. Based on these results, it is likely that the decreasing trends of PM2.5 and the major components in PMs in Sanyo Onoda were related to an improvement of the air quality in China.

TI  - Land Use Change Assessment and Water Quality of Ephemeral Ponds for Irrigation in the North West Province, South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the semi-arid environments of the North West province of South Africa the amount, timing, and distribution of rainfall is irregular, while water accessibility is a key factor in production. In line with this, a study was conducted to assess the impact of land use change on water quality and water depth within the sub-catchment areas of ephemeral ponds. To determine land use dynamics, 2004 and 2013 Landsat images were classified using maximum likelihood algorithm. Pond water quality was analysed for physical, chemical, and microbiological parameters using standard the American Public Health Association (APHA) methods. Multiple linear regression models were computed to determine relationships between land use changes and water quality parameters. Results revealed a reduction in grass cover, whereas built-up areas increased at the expense of bare land. All the values for the physical characteristics were higher than the recommended Department of Water Affairs (DWAF) and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) limits, but chemical parameters, except cadmium, were within limits. Regression showed that bare areas have a positive effect on Escherichia coli (E. coli) in ephemeral pond water. The study highlights the suitability of pond water for irrigation to increase crop production and the effects of land use changes on ecosystems as critical for proper catchment planning, water resource management, and food security.

TI  - Applicability of Earth Observation chlorophyll-<i>a</i> data in assessment of water status via MERIS - With implications for the use of OLCI sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) offers spatially and temporally unique data for generating information required under various environmental regulations for assessing the status of surface waters. These requirements, which are laid down in, for example, European Union directives and the Clean Water Act in the United States, share two core elements with respect to status assessments: 1) the status assessment is done using discrete classes, typically for water bodies, sub-areas or critical sites representative for certain area of interest, and 2) phytoplankton chlorophyll a (chl-a) is one of the main variables considered. We analysed the benefits of using chl-a concentrations derived from EO data for the status assessments specified in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). Our study focused especially on EO observations' ability to capture extreme and transient events (such as instances of cyanobacteria blooms) more frequently than the monitoring-station data conventionally employs. The accuracy of EO-based chl-a assessment was studied for, in all, 129 Finnish water bodies in the area of the Baltic Sea, in Northern Europe. Natural conditions in this coastal area particularly its multitude of small bays, numerous estuaries, and mosaic of islands impose exceptionally strict requirements for an EO instrument's spatial resolution. The analysis revealed that an instrument with a 300 m resolution, such as the MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) or Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI), can be used to estimate the water quality in 62% of these water bodies. Processing of MERIS data into chl-a concentrations by means of a FUB inversion model demonstrated good accuracy relative to monitoring stations' measurements for the open-water season in 2003-2011. This extensive dataset showed a 23% difference in modal values between EO- and station sampling -based chl-a concentrations. The bias in EO chl-a estimates was found to increase with low Secchi disk depth, elevated turbidity, and the presence of intensive phytoplankton blooms. The monitoring-station and EO data showed similar distributions of chl-a observations for a given day and location, a finding that supports the comprehensive use of EO-derived chl-a concentrations in assessment. For determination of a water body's status, the EO data required but also allowed for statistical analysis that differs from what has typically been utilised with sparse measurements from monitoring-station data. The geometric mean or the mode of the EO observations was found to represent the main bulk of the chl-a concentrations well statistically. In contrast, the arithmetic mean of EO observations yields chl-a concentrations that are roughly 1.1-1.6 mu g/I higher and hence can lead to over-estimation in the associated status assessment. This paper also presents a new approach applicable for evaluating the validity of EO-based algorithms for any coastal water area requiring assessment. With this quality-grade (QG) method, the EO chl-a estimation accuracy is rated in terms of three grades, with water bodies taken as the evaluation units. For this, the method utilises statistical differences between EO and station-sampling chl-a concentrations and applies background information on optical properties obtained from measurements at routine-monitoring stations. The QG method showed the EO-based chl-a accuracy to suffice for assessing the status of 65% of the coastal water bodies examined. At concentrations representing the threshold for the target of "good status" under the WFD, the EO approach produced 0.6 mu g/I higher chl-a values than the stations' sampling did. The MERIS results point to clear benefits of using OLCI-based status assessment throughout the Sentinel-3 era.

TI  - Beyond RGB: Very high resolution urban remote sensing with multimodal deep networks
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigate various methods to deal with semantic labeling of very high resolution multi modal remote sensing data. Especially, we study how deep fully convolutional networks can be adapted to deal with multi-modal and multi-scale remote sensing data for semantic labeling. Our contributions are threefold: (a) we present an efficient multi-scale approach to leverage both a large spatial context and the high resolution data, (b) we investigate early and late fusion of Lidar and multispectral data, (c) we validate our methods on two public datasets with state-of-the-art results. Our results indicate that late fusion make it possible to recover errors steaming from ambiguous data, while early fusion allows for better joint-feature learning but at the cost of higher sensitivity to missing data.

TI  - Analysis of the Land Use and Cover Changes in the Metropolitan Area of Tepic-Xalisco (1973-2015) through Landsat Images
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and cover changes (LUCC) have been identified as one of the main causes of biodiversity loss and deforestation in the world. Fundamentally, the urban land use has replaced agricultural and forest cover causing loss of environmental services. Monitoring and quantifying LUCC are essential to achieve a proper land management. The objective of this study was to analyze the LUCC in the metropolitan area of Tepic-Xalisco during the period 1973-2015. To find the best fit and obtain the different land use classes, supervised classification techniques were applied using Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The results were validated with control points (ground truth) through cross tabulation. The best results were obtained from the SVMs method with kappa indices above 85%. The transition analysis infers that urban land has grown significantly during 42 years, increasing 62 km(2) and replacing agricultural areas at a rate of 1.48 km(2)/year. Forest loss of 5.78 km(2) annually was also identified. The results show the different land uses distribution and the dynamics developed in the past. This information may be used to simulate future LUCC and modeling different scenarios.

TI  - Moral economic axioms, preference formation and welfare in Islamic economics and business
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF BUSINESS ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Consumers and producers aim to maximize their welfare through economic transactions. Their welfare is determined by choices and preferences. Therefore, understanding social and economic welfare projected by conventional and Islamic economics requires exploring their underlying paradigms and axioms for preference formation, choices, and welfare maximization. Even though conventional economics assumes that preferences are given, it actually considers that they are driven by self-interest. It does not discuss preference formation along determining moral axioms. Rather, it starts from revealed preferences to understand choices of consumers and producers. Thus, preference formation is like a black box. This paper is an attempt to unlock this black box by exploring preference formation along its underlying moral axioms for good life. The paper discusses Islamic moral ideals within the Islamic worldview along the implications of those axioms for consumers, employees, and employers. The paper also explores the gap between those ideals and Muslim reality. It suggests how to empirically test the relationship between moral axioms and ethical behaviors of consumers, employers, and employees. It concludes that internalizing moral axioms would serve as an ethical compass necessary to establish formal and informal institutions for efficient and ethical business organizations.

TI  - The theme of Palestine in the creative dialogue of V. A. Zhukovsky and A. N. Muravyov
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the first attempt to study the creative dialogue of V. A. Zhukovsky and A. N. Muravyov on the subject of Palestine. The study clarifies the peculiarities of the poetics and genre-stylistic system of creativity of both writers, their spiritual, religious and aesthetic searches due to the originality of individual worldview and the general atmosphere of the era. The author reveals an unknown chapter in the history of cultural contacts of Palestine and Russia in the 19th century. The dialogue begins with the enthusiastic response of Zhukovsky to the tragedy of Muravyov "The Battle of Tiberias, or the fall of the crusaders in Palestine" (1827). Zhukovsky was also immersed in a chivalry theme. Like Muravyov, he unites the image of the knight with the mythologeme of fate. However, unlike Muravyov, Zhukovsky increasingly focuses not so much on religious as on philosophical interpretation of chivalry. The paper also considers the interpretations of the Palestine theme in prose and lyric-epic works of Zhukovsky of 18001840s and spiritual prose of Muravyov of 1830-1840s The typological nature of their convergence and divergence in the area of meaningful reception of the theme and search for forms of interaction between religious and artistic principles in its implementation is stated. The meaning of the works of Zhukovsky is concentrated around the question of freedom of moral choice of the first inhabitants of the Promised Land, painted with educational author's intentions. Whereas Muravyov focuses on superpersonal reality - the "great destiny" of Palestine and Jerusalem. In this regard, the emphasis is placed on the position of the author-narrator in the writings of Muravyov -position of "humble Christian". At the same time, attention is drawn to the fact that Muravyov combines in his works the image of mental and spiritual religious life of the author-narrator, taking place in the situation of execution of a vow to the Lord in Holy places, and historical-cultural, ethnographic, geographic and socio-political material. Paying tribute to, like Muravyov, the interest in ethnography, culture, history of Palestine in the early translations of "Journey to Jerusalem" by R. Chateaubriand, Zhukovsky is to show interest in the sociopolitical aspect of the Palestine theme, largely literally echoing the pathos of Muravyov. It is to be reflected in religious-philosophical prose, correspondence of Zhukovsky in the 1840s and the so-called Jerusalem project. The poem "Wandering Jew", the central image of which along with Ahasver is Jerusalem, located in the centre of the spiritual Muravyov's prose of 1830-1840s, will present the version of the synthesis of religious and artistic principles in the understanding of the Palestine theme, its substantive nature and forms of its embodiment.

TI  - An Experimental Method to Estimate Upper Limbs Inertial Parameters During Handcycling
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED BIOMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes an experimental method to estimate personalized inertial parameters of upper limbs during handcycling by using a planar dynamicmodel. The handle forces are expressed as a product of a matrix describing the kinematics terms and a vector of inertial parameters of arm and forearm. The parameters are estimated by measuring the handle forces during a suitable "passive test" and inverting the mentioned matrix. The data were acquired while an operator actuated the handle and the subject's muscles were relaxed. To validate the estimation procedure, it was applied to a custom-made artificial arm mechanism, and the results were compared with its known parameters. The method was then used to estimate the inertial parameters of 6 human subjects. The estimated parameters were used to compute the exchanged forces and compared with the measured ones obtaining an average error of 14% both for F-x and F-y. These errors are significantly smaller than those obtained using dynamic parameters extracted from the literature to compute the forces, which were 50% for F-x and 19% for F-y. An individual evaluation of inertial parameters better describes interaction forces during handcycling, especially for subjects whose body structures are different from the average population.

TI  - Can Nomograms Predict Preoperative Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients With Breast Cancer to Guide Second Look Ultrasonography?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectivesThe low sensitivity of ultrasonography (US) for diagnosing axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer has led to the development of multiple tools in an attempt to increase preoperative sensitivity, including second-look US. We compared axillary lymph node metastasis predictor scores with postsurgical findings, using the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC; New York, NY) and Evidencio () nomograms: 2 freely available online predictor tools.MethodsWe retrospectively evaluated 450 patients with breast cancer and analyzed data from 194 patients. Sonograms were evaluated to measure lymph node cortical thickness, transverse diameter, and hilum status. Patients were divided into 3 groups: namely 0, 1, and 2 based on the number of postoperative positive nodes (0, 1 and 2, respectively). One-way analysis of variance was used to analyze the differences in mean scores across the 3 nodal groups for both nomograms. P<.05 was considered statistically significant.ResultsThere were significant differences in mean scores across the 3 nodal groups when using MSKCC (P<.001) as well as Evidencio (P<.001). However, there was an overlap of scores across the 3 groups; thus, mutually exclusive values were not obtained. A strong positive correlation was found between MSKCC and Evidencio (P<0.001). Tumor size and the presence of lymphovascular invasion were significantly associated with axillary nodal disease (P<.001; P=.003, respectively).ConclusionsThe use of nomograms to predict axillary nodal involvement in patients with breast cancer can guide discussions, but in their present state, these scores cannot guide clinical decisions or direct second-look US of axilla.

TI  - Geostatistical estimation of forest biomass in interior Alaska combining Landsat-derived tree cover, sampled airborne lidar and field observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lidar provides critical information on the three-dimensional structure of forests. However, collecting wall-towall laser altimetry data at regional and global scales is cost prohibitive. As a result, studies employing lidar for large area estimation typically collect data via strip sampling, leaving large swaths of the forest unmeasured by the instrument. The goal of this research was to develop and examine the performance of a coregionalization modeling approach for combining field measurements, strip samples of airborne lidar and Landsat-based remote sensing products to predict aboveground biomass (AGB) in interior Alaska's Tanana Valley. The proposed modeling strategy facilitates mapping of AGB density across the domain. Additionally, the coregionalization framework allows for estimation of total AGB for arbitrary areal units within the study area a key advance to support diverse management objectives in interior Alaska. This research focuses on characterization of prediction uncertainty in the form of posterior predictive coverage intervals and standard deviations. Using the framework detailed here, it is possible to quantify estimation uncertainty for any spatial extent, ranging from point level predictions of AGB density to estimates of AGB stocks for the full domain. The lidar-informed coregionalization models consistently outperformed their counterpart lidar-free models in terms of point-level predictive performance and total (mean) AGB precision. Additionally, including a Landsat-derived forest cover covariate further improved precision in regions with lower lidar sampling intensity. Findings also demonstrate that model-based approaches not explicitly accounting for residual spatial dependence can grossly underestimate uncertainty, resulting in falsely precise estimates of AGB. The inferential capabilities of AGB posterior predictive distribution (PPD) products extend beyond simply mapping AGB density. We show how PPD products can provide insight regarding drivers of AGB heterogeneity in boreal forests, including permafrost and fire, highlighting the range of potential applications for Bayesian geostatistical methods to integrate field, airborne and satellite data.

TI  - Landslide inventory and susceptibility modelling using geospatial tools, in Hunza-Nagar valley, northern Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive landslide inventory and susceptibility maps are prerequisite for developing and implementing landslide mitigation strategies. Landslide susceptibility maps for the landslides prone regions in northern Pakistan are rarely available. The Hunza-Nagar valley in northern Pakistan is known for its frequent and devastating landslides. In this paper, we have developed a landslide inventory map for Hunza-Nagar valley by using the visual interpretation of the SPOT-5 satellite imagery and mapped a total of 172 landslides. The landslide inventory was subsequently divided into modelling and validation data sets. For the development of landslide susceptibility map seven discrete landslide causative factors were correlated with the landslide inventory map using weight of evidence and frequency ratio statistical models. Four different models of conditional independence were used for the selection of landslide causative factors. The produced landslides susceptibility maps were validated by the success rate and area under curves criteria. The prediction power of the models was also validated with the prediction rate curve. The validation results shows that the success rate curves of the weight of evidence and the frequency models are 82% and 79%, respectively. The prediction accuracy results obtained from this study are 84% for weight of evidence model and 80% for the frequency ratio model. Finally, the landslide susceptibility index maps were classified into five different varying susceptibility zones. The validation and prediction result indicates that the weight of evidence and frequency ratio model are reliable to produce an accurate landslide susceptibility map, which may be helpful for landslides management strategies.

TI  - Two-dimensional Velocity Measurements of Uversbreen Glacier in Svalbard Using TerraSAR-X Offset Tracking Approach
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global interest in climate change and sea level rise has led to active research on the velocities of glaciers. In studies about the velocity of glaciers, in-situ measurements can obtain the most accurate data but have limitations to acquire periodical or long-term data. Offset tracking using SAR is actively being used as an alternative of in-situ measurements. Offset tracking has a limitation in that the accuracy of observation is lower than that of other observational techniques, but it has been improved by recent studies. Recent studies in the Uversbreen glacier area have shown that glacier altitudes decrease at a rate of 1.5 m/year. The glacier displacement velocities in this region are heavily influenced by climate change and can be important in monitoring and forecasting long-term climate change. However, there are few concrete examples of research in this area. In this study, we applied the improved offset tracking method to observe the two-dimensional velocity in the Uversbreen glacier. As a result, it was confirmed that the glacier moved at a maximum rate of 133.7 m/year. The measruement precisions for azimuth and line-of-sight directions were 5.4 and 3.3 m/year respectively. These results will be utilized to study long-term changes in elevation of glaciers and to study environmental impacts due to climate change.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation of NDVI in Response to Climate Change and the Implication for Carbon Dynamics in Nepal
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nepal is a country of contrast, with varying altitude, climate and vegetation from the top of high mountains to the tropical forest in low lands. The terrestrial vegetation has rapidly been altered by climate change in Nepal. The spatial and temporal evolution of vegetation and its linkage to climatic variables were analyzed using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) obtained from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensors. A linear regression model and Sen's slope method were used to estimate NDVI trends and the Pearson correlation between NDVI and climatic variable, i.e., temperature and precipitation were calculated to identify the role of climate in vegetation changes. The carbon dynamics were also measured using a biomass carbon density estimation model. Results showed that NDVI experienced an overall increasing trend in Nepal from 1982-2015. The NDVI significantly increased at the rate of 0.0008 year(-1) (p < 0.05) with seasonal variation of 0.0004 year(-1), p > 0.05; 0.0007 year(-1), p < 0.05; 0.0008 year(-1), p < 0.05 and 0.0007 year(-1), p > 0.05 in winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons, respectively. The NDVI relative change ratio (RCR) was 6.29% during last 34 years in Nepal. The correlation between NDVI and temperature was significantly positive (r = 0.36, p = 0.03), but there was a negative correlation with precipitation (r = -0.21, p = 0.28). Altogether, 82.20% of the study areas showed a positive correlation with temperature in which 34.97% was significant and 69.23% of the area had a negative correlation (16.35% significant, p < 0.05) with precipitation. In addition, NDVI-based carbon estimation showed that Nepal's forest total carbon stock is 685.45 x 10(6) t C (i.e., an average of 115.392 t C/ha) with an annual carbon sequestration rate of 0.10 t C/ha from 1982-2015. The results suggest that NDVI variation is more sensitive to temperature than precipitation and it is valuable to measure carbon dynamics in Nepal.

TI  - Sentinel-MSI VNIR and SWIR Bands Sensitivity Analysis for Soil Salinity Discrimination in an Arid Landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Depending on the band position on the electromagnetic spectrum, optical and electronic characteristics, sensors collect the reflected energy by the Earth's surface and the atmosphere. Currently, the availability of the new generation of medium resolution, such as the Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) on board the Sentinel-2 satellite, offers new opportunities for long-term high-temporal frequency for Earth's surfaces observation and monitoring. This paper focuses on the analysis and the comparison of the visible, the near-infrared (VNIR), and the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of the MSI for soil salinity discrimination in an arid landscape. To achieve these, a field campaign was organized, and 160 soil samples were collected with various degrees of soil salinity, including non-saline soil samples. The bidirectional reflectance factor was measured above each soil sample in a goniometric laboratory using an ASD (Analytical Spectral Devices) spectroradiometer. In the laboratory work, pHs, electrical conductivity (EC-(Lab)), and the major soluble cations (Na+, K+, Ca2++, and Mg2+) and anions (CO32-, HCO3-, Cl-, and SO42-) were measured using extraction from a saturated soil paste, and the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) was calculated using a standard procedure. These parameters, in addition to the field observations, were used to interpret and investigate the spectroradiometric measurements and their relevant transformations using the continuum removed reflectance spectrum (CRRS) and the first derivative (FD). Moreover, the acquired spectra over all the soil samples were resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective spectral bands using the Canadian Modified Herman transfer radiative code (CAM5S) and the relative spectral response profiles characterizing the Sentinel-MSI band filters. The statistical analyses conducted were based on the second-order polynomial regression (p < 0.05) between the measured EC-(Lab) and the reflectances in the MSI convolved spectral bands. The results obtained indicate the limitation of VNIR bands and the potential of SWIR domain for soil salinity classes' discrimination. The CRRS and the FD analyses highlighted a serious spectral-signal confusion between the salt and the soil optical properties (i.e., color and brightness) in the VNIR bands. Likewise, the results stressed the independence of the SWIR domain vis-a-vis these soil artifacts and its capability to differentiate significantly among several soil salinity classes. Moreover, the statistical fit between each MSI individual spectral band and EC-(Lab) corroborates this trend, which revealed that only the SWIR bands were correlated significantly (R-2 of 50% and 64%, for SWIR-1 and SWIR-2, respectively), while the R-2 between the VNIR bands and EC-(Lab) remains less than 9%. According to the convergence of these four independent analysis methods, it is concluded that the Sentinel-MSI SWIR bands are excellent candidates for an integration in soil salinity modeling and monitoring at local, regional, and global scales.

TI  - Forest Cover Changes and Trajectories in a Typical Middle Mountain Watershed of Western Nepal
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - There have been drastic changes in resource use practices and land-use patterns in the middle mountains of Nepal as a result of human transformation processes of the environment. This study aimed at assessing land-use and land-cover changes, especially those related to forest cover changes, in Phewa Lake watersheda typical middle mountain watershed of western Nepalusing multi-temporal Landsat images from 1995, 2005 and 2017. Landsat images of each year were classified individually using object-based image classification into four land-use and land-cover types: agriculture and built-up, forest, waterbodies and other. Post-classification comparison was employed to quantify the extent and rate of changes, which was further extended to quantify the level of persistence, gains, losses, and swaps of forests. Furthermore, temporal trajectories of land-cover associated with forest cover changes were established, and their spatial pattern analyzed. The results show that, between 1995 and 2017, forest cover increased by 6.8% with a corresponding decrease in the extent of all other land-cover types. Dynamic transitions and internal trading among forest and agriculture and built-up category were observed, revealing more complex patterns than the commonly assumed linear and irreversible forest cover transformations in the mountains of Nepal. Our approach to assess major signals of forest cover transitions and change trajectories will help link patterns to the process of change including deforestation and forest regeneration. This would, in turn, form the basis for formulating practical conservation and management strategies for Phewa Lake watershed and other mountain watersheds of Nepal.

T2  - JCPSP-JOURNAL OF THE COLLEGE OF PHYSICIANS AND SURGEONS PAKISTAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease (KFD), also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a self-remitting, immune-mediated rare disorder having unique histopathological characteristics which is commonly seen in young Asian females, but can occur in all ethnicities. There is a strong association between KFD and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). We present a case of a young Pakistani boy who presented with cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, blackish discoloration of finger tips, and Raynaud's phenomenon. His lymph node biopsy was suggestive of KFD. The American Rheumatology Association diagnostic criteria were not met as no other features of SLE were present. His autoimmune workup including Anti-Nuclear Antibodies (ANA) and Anti-Double Stranded DNA (Anti-Ds DNA) antibodies were positive and supported the diagnosis of SLE. He improved clinically with steroid therapy and nifedipine with resolution of symptoms.

TI  - State of the Art Treatment of Spinal Metastatic Disease
T2  - NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Treatment paradigms for patients with spine metastases have evolved significantly over the past decade. Incorporating stereotactic radiosurgery into these paradigms has been particularly transformative, offering precise delivery of tumoricidal radiation doses with sparing of adjacent tissues. Evidence supports the safety and efficacy of radiosurgery as it currently offers durable local tumor control with low complication rates even for tumors previously considered radioresistant to conventional radiation. The role for surgical intervention remains consistent, but a trend has been observed toward less aggressive, often minimally invasive, techniques. Using modern technologies and improved instrumentation, surgical outcomes continue to improve with reduced morbidity. Additionally, targeted agents such as biologics and checkpoint inhibitors have revolutionized cancer care, improving both local control and patient survivals. These advances have brought forth a need for new prognostication tools and a more critical review of long-term outcomes. The complex nature of current treatment schemes necessitates a multidisciplinary approach including surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, interventionalists, and pain specialists. This review recapitulates the current state-of-the-art, evidence-based data on the treatment of spinal metastases, integrating these data into a decision framework, NOMS, which integrates the 4 sentinel decision points in metastatic spine tumors: Neurologic, Oncologic, Mechanical stability, and Systemic disease and medical co-morbidities.

TI  - Mosquito traps for urban surveillance: collection efficacy and potential for use by citizen scientists
T2  - JOURNAL OF VECTOR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases are a pervasive public health problem on a global scale, and effective management of them requires well-designed surveillance programs for both vectors and pathogens. Mosquito traps are a common component of such programs, and their reach can be expanded by engaging citizen scientists. In this study in a southern Australian city, we compared the mosquito collection efficacy of two types of traps and assessed their suitability for use in citizen science programs. BG Sentinels and BG Gravid Aedes Trap (BG-GAT) traps both collected Aedes and Culex species in similar proportions, albeit with the former collecting approximately nine times as many mosquitoes. However, BG Sentinels have a greater per unit cost than BG-GATs and are restricted to deployment near power outlets. Importantly, despite being devised for collection of Aedes (Stegomyia) dengue vectors (such as Aedes aegypti), both traps can be effectively used in temperate climates for collection of a range of mosquito species. These traps could conceivably be used in citizen science programs to enhance the reach of surveillance at reduced cost.

TI  - The <i>Oracle of the Potter</i> and the "Apocalyptic Worldview" in Egypt
T2  - EPHEMERIDES THEOLOGICAE LOVANIENSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article examines the contribution that can be derived from a preliminary analysis of the Egyptian Oracle of the Potter towards a better understanding of an ancient "apocalyptic worldview". Most recent scholarship has tended to exclude the Oracle from consideration alongside other Jewish and Christian apocalyptic texts on account of its generic peculiarities. However, if one adopts a more flexible and polythetic definition of "apocalyptic literature", it is possible to draw useful conclusions from an examination of this Egyptian writing. First, the Oracle displays a specific regime of temporality that can be fruitfully inserted within the trajectory of eschatologization and apocalyptization that leads from earlier Egyptian prophetic materials to later full-fledged apocalypses. Second, the Oracle lends itself quite well to a socio-cultural analysis of its readership that might illuminate also the parallel situation of Jewish and Christian materials. The circulation of the Oracle in the Egyptian chora and the absence of anti-Roman sentiments seems to indicate at least the possibility that it attracted the attention of "free readers" for its antiquarian or entertaining character.

TI  - Atmospheric forcing of upwelling along the south-eastern Baltic coast
T2  - BALTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The meteorological forcing on the occurrence of upwelling along the south-eastern Baltic Sea coast (Lithuanian-Latvian sector) is analysed in this study. The sea level pressure patterns and the locations of pressure centres inducing and inhibiting upwelling were identified. The research was performed for the years 1982-2017, for the months of May-September, when the sea waters are thermally stratified and the phenomenon is detectable. The frequency of upwelling is the highest in June (approximately 15%), July and August (11-13%) and the lowest in September (7%). The central and northern part of the Lithuanian-Latvian coast is most favourable for upwelling occurrence (frequency up to 20% in summer months). The main features of the sea level pressure patterns that induce upwelling in the research area are positive pressure anomalies spreading over Northern Europe and the Norwegian Sea, while negative anomalies encompass Southern Europe. Airflow around the anticyclonic centres gives a north-eastern component to the wind direction over the Lithuanian-Latvian shore. Two circulation types were recognized as inducing the occurrence of upwelling along the Lithuanian-Latvian coast. Both of them are characterized by the anticyclonic centres located west or northwest of the study area and intensify the northerly or north-easterly airflow over the research area. Different pressure patterns with the negative anomalies of sea level pressure spreading over the North Sea and the positive anomalies underlying Central Europe inhibit upwelling along the Lithuanian-Latvian coast. Such pressure conditions, bring about the western airflow component. More constant western winds restrain the upwelling process and bring about normal thermal stratification of coastal waters. A detailed analysis allowed the recognition of two circulation types inhibiting coastal upwelling in the study area. They reveal dipole patterns of sea level pressure anomalies, but the two inhibiting patterns differ substantially in the intensities and locations of the pressure centres and in wind conditions.

TI  - The role of sentinel lymph node mapping in small animal veterinary medicine: A comparison with current approaches in human medicine
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The relevance of regional lymph node (LN) assessment to quantify the metastatic spread of cancer is well recognized in veterinary oncology. Evaluation of LNs is critical for tumour staging. However, sampling the correct LN may not be possible without sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. Methods for diagnostic imaging and intraoperative detection of SLNs are well established in human medicine, in particular, the combination of lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative application of blue dyes. Nevertheless, alternative imaging techniques are available and have gained increasing interest. Successful implementation of these techniques in dogs have been reported in both clinical and experimental studies. This review aims to provide an overview of SLN mapping techniques in human and veterinary medicine.

TI  - Spatiotemporal shoreline dynamics of Namibian coastal lagoons derived by a dense remote sensing time series approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes the remote sensing time series approach WLMO (Water-Land MOnitor) to monitor spatiotemporal shoreline changes. The approach uses a hierarchical classification system based on temporal MNDWI-trajectories with the goal to accommodate typical uncertainties in remote sensing shoreline extraction techniques such as existence of clouds and geometric mismatches between images. Applied to a dense Landsat time series between 1984 and 2014 for the two Namibian coastal lagoons at Walvis Bay and Sandwich Harbour the WLMO was able to identify detailed accretion and erosion progressions at the sand spits forming these lagoons. For both lagoons a northward expansion of the sand spits of up to 1000 m was identified, which corresponds well with the prevailing northwards directed ocean current and wind processes that are responsible for the material transport along the shore. At Walvis Bay we could also show that in the 30 years of analysis the sand spit's width has decreased by more than a half from 750 m in 1984-360 m in 2014. This ongoing cross-shore erosion process is a severe risk for future sand spit breaching, which would expose parts of the lagoon and the city to the open ocean. One of the major advantages of WLMO is the opportunity to analyze detailed spatiotemporal shoreline changes. Thus, it could be shown that the observed long-term accretion and erosion processes underwent great variations over time and cannot a priori be assumed as linear processes. Such detailed spatiotemporal process patterns are a prerequisite to improve the understanding of the processes forming the Namibian shorelines. Moreover, the approach has also the potential to be used in other coastal areas, because the focus on MNDWI-trajectories allows the transfer to many multispectral satellite sensors (e.g. Sentinel-2, ASTER) available worldwide.

TI  - A critique of the principle of "respect for autonomy', grounded in African thought
T2  - DEVELOPING WORLD BIOETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - I give an account how the principle of respect for autonomy' dominates the field of bioethics, and how it came to triumph over its competitors, respect for persons' and respect for free power of choice'. I argue that respect for autonomy' is unsatisfactory as a basic principle of bioethics because it is grounded in too individualistic a worldview, citing concerns of African theorists and other communitarians who claim that the principle fails to acknowledge the fundamental importance of understanding persons within the nexus of their communal relationships. I defend the claim that respect for persons' is a more appropriate principle, as it is able to acknowledge both individual decision making and the essential relationality of persons. I acknowledge that my preference for respect for persons' is problematic because of the important debate around the definition of personhood' in bioethics discourse. Relying on Thaddeus Metz's conception of moral status, I propose a relational definition of personhood that distinguishes between persons with agency and persons without agency, arguing that we have different moral obligations to these distinct categories of persons. I claim that this conception ofpersonhood is better able to accommodate our moral intuitions than conventional approaches, and that it is able to do so without being speciesist or question-begging.

TI  - InSAR-Based Mapping to Support Decision-Making after an Earthquake
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It has long been recognized that earthquakes change the stress in the upper crust around the fault rupture and can influence the behaviour of neighbouring faults and volcanoes. Rapid estimates of these stress changes can provide the authorities managing the post-disaster situation with valuable data to identify and monitor potential threads and to update the estimates of seismic and volcanic hazard in a region. Here we propose a methodology to evaluate the potential influence of an earthquake on nearby faults and volcanoes and create easy-to-understand maps for decision-making support after large earthquakes. We apply this methodology to the Mw 7.8, 2016 Ecuador earthquake. Using Sentinel-1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continuous GPS data, we measure the coseismic ground deformation and estimate the distribution of slip over the fault rupture. We also build an alternative source model using the Global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) solution. Then we use these models to evaluate changes of static stress on the surrounding faults and volcanoes and produce maps of potentially activated faults and volcanoes. We found, in general, good agreement between our maps and the seismic and volcanic events that occurred after the Pedernales earthquake. We discuss the potential and limitations of the methodology.

TI  - Visual interpretation and time series modeling of Landsat imagery highlight drought's role in forest canopy declines
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing studies indicate that slow and subtle degradation of forest canopies, or forest canopy declines, has increased in extent during recent decades, possibly due to hotter and drier droughts. However, it is difficult to collect consistent, high-quality time series of forest canopy decline occurrence observations needed for examining multi-year drought contributions to forest canopy decline at an annual scale. In this research, we leveraged a tool for visual interpretation of annual Landsat satellite imagery (TimeSync) and a hierarchical Bayesian time series modeling approach (stochastic antecedent modeling, SAM) in five forest type groups located in the western United States to assess (1) what seasonal and inter-annual patterns in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and precipitation preceded forest canopy decline events, (2) how drought effects on forest canopy decline events differed by forest type group, and (3) whether or not drought effects on forest canopy decline events were uniform within forest type groups. We examined observations of forest canopy decline over three decades (1985-2013) at 126 plots where we collected annual TimeSync observations. Stochastic antecedent modeling indicated that January-March VPD and July-September precipitation anomalies for the current year and 1-3 yr in the past contributed to defining drought conditions in relation to forest canopy decline dynamics. The probability of forest canopy decline decreased with summer precipitation for all forest type groups and increased with winter VPD for the warmest and the coldest forest type groups. However, the magnitude and direction of forest canopy decline sensitivity to drought varied substantially within forest type groups. The ubiquitous, but not uniform, effects of drought on forest canopy decline dynamics implied that local biotic (e.g., forest structure and composition, tree genetics) and abiotic (e.g., topography and soils) factors act to mediate effects of drought on forest change. The integration of the TimeSync satellite image interpretation tool with SAM provides a promising approach to link ecological understanding of tree drought responses to forest and landscape responses at regional and continental scales.

TI  - Improved regional-scale Brazilian cropping systems' mapping based on a semi-automatic object-based clustering approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Cropping systems' maps at fine scale over large areas provide key information for further agricultural production and environmental impact assessments, and thus represent a valuable tool for effective land-use planning. There is, therefore, a growing interest in mapping cropping systems in an operational manner over large areas, and remote sensing approaches based on vegetation index time series analysis have proven to be an efficient tool. However, supervised pixel-based approaches are commonly adopted, requiring resource consuming field campaigns to gather training data. In this paper, we present a new object-based unsupervised classification approach tested on an annual MODIS 16-day composite Normalized Difference Vegetation Index time series and a Landsat 8 mosaic of the State of Tocantins, Brazil, for the 2014-2015 growing season. Two variants of the approach are compared: an hyperclustering approach, and a landscape-clustering approach involving a previous stratification of the study area into landscape units on which the clustering is then performed. The main cropping systems of Tocantins, characterized by the crop types and cropping patterns, were efficiently mapped with the landscape clustering approach. Results show that stratification prior to clustering significantly improves the classification accuracies for underrepresented and sparsely distributed cropping systems. This study illustrates the potential of unsupervised classification for large area cropping systems' mapping and contributes to the development of generic tools for supporting large-scale agricultural monitoring across regions.

TI  - Bringing Up Nones: Intergenerational Influences and Cohort Trends
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent polls show that an increasing number of young adults profess no religious affiliation. Prior research has suggested several explanations for this, among them older ages at marriage, higher education rates, reaction against the priest/pedophile scandal, and political backlash against the religious right, as well as the traditional explanation of youthful rebellion against religious parents. In this article, we propose another theory: intergenerational transmission, an increase in the number of parents and grandparents who have been explicitly socializing their children to a nonreligious worldview. We use a mixed methods approach with data from the 34-year Longitudinal Study of Generations to examine parents' and grandparents' influence on youth over several decades. The rate of nonreligious young persons in our sample tripled between 1971 and 2005. Though this undoubtedly reflects broader cohort trends, we can trace a significant portion of this growth to family intergenerational continuity brought about by explicitly nonreligious socialization by parents as well as grandparents. Qualitative data provide insight into processes of nonreligious influence over generations, seen in three types: multigenerational socialization of humanism, of atheism, and of the unintended socialization of religious rebels from highly religious parents.

The purpose is to reveal and describe the features of the individual concept SACRIFICE in some text works and the feature film "Sacrifice" by Tarkovsky. In spite of the high research interest in the work of Tarkovsky, his films and texts have not been studied from the viewpoint of the linguo-conceptology. The study deals with the texts representing the author's worldview: "Martiologist", "The Sealed Time", and the interviews of various years, as well as the film "Sacrifice" and its montage recording (the materials of the portal "Media-archive "Andrey Tarkovsky""). The paper considers the fragments of the film "Sacrifice" that correlate at visual or sound level with the concept SACRIFICE. Pictorial ("The Adoration of the Magi" by Leonardo da Vinci) and musical ("Erbarme dich, mein Gott" by Bach) quotations representing the concept SACRIFICE are analyzed. The relationship between the ideas of sacrifice and the attribute "donation" is established. Also, the contexts including the lexemes-representatives of the concept (root words of "victim") are analyzed, the structure scheme of the concept SACRIFICE in the individual worldview is offered, showing the distribution of conceptual attributes between the core and the periphery of the concept.The conclusions can be drawn that in the individual worldview of Tarkovsky, the concept SACRIFICE is especially significant; the concept SACRIFICE is closely related to other concepts of the spiritual sphere (LOVE, VERITY, etc.); the formation of the concept SACRIFICE takes place according to the principles of religious worldview; the core of the concept SACRIFICE involves the idea of self-sacrifice for the sake of love; the concept SACRIFICE contains an internal evaluation showing the idea of sacrifice as not corresponding to the "anomalous" worldview of a typical modern man; the idea of the film "Sacrifice" is a part of the structure of the concept SACRIFICE, revealing its content both in verbal and non-verbal ways.

TI  - Pregnancy and Melanoma: Recommendations for Clinical Scenarios.
T2  - International journal of women's dermatology
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Managing pregnant patients with a history of melanoma or with a melanoma diagnosis can be daunting and confusing for dermatologists. We present three clinical scenarios that raise questions about the safety of pregnancy in patients with a history of melanoma, skin biopsies during pregnancy, and excisions and sentinel lymph node biopsies during pregnancy. Our recommendations incorporate the most up-to-date clinical data to help guide clinicians when faced with pigmented lesions and melanoma in a pregnant patient.

TI  - SAR-Based Estimation of Above-Ground Biomass and Its Changes in Tropical Forests of Kalimantan Using L- and C-Band
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Kalimantan poses one of the highest carbon emissions worldwide since its landscape is strongly endangered by deforestation and degradation and, thus, carbon release. The goal of this study is to conduct large-scale monitoring of above-ground biomass (AGB) from space and create more accurate biomass maps of Kalimantan than currently available. AGB was estimated for 2007, 2009, and 2016 in order to give an overview of ongoing forest loss and to estimate changes between the three time steps in a more precise manner. Extensive field inventory and LiDAR data were used as reference AGB. A multivariate linear regression model (MLR) based on backscatter values, ratios, and Haralick textures derived from Sentinel-1 (C-band), ALOS PALSAR (Advanced Land Observing Satellite's Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar), and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 polarizations was used to estimate AGB across the country. The selection of the most suitable model parameters was accomplished considering VIF (variable inflation factor), p-value, R-2, and RMSE (root mean square error). The final AGB maps were validated by calculating bias, RMSE, R-2, and NSE (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency). The results show a correlation (R-2) between the reference biomass and the estimated biomass varying from 0.69 in 2016 to 0.77 in 2007, and a model performance (NSE) in a range of 0.70 in 2016 to 0.76 in 2007. Modelling three different years with a consistent method allows a more accurate estimation of the change than using available biomass maps based on different models. All final biomass products have a resolution of 100 m, which is much finer than other existing maps of this region (>500 m). These high-resolution maps enable identification of even small-scaled biomass variability and changes and can be used for more precise carbon modelling, as well as forest monitoring or risk managing systems under REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation, forest Degradation, and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks) and other programs, protecting forests and analyzing carbon release.

TI  - Estimating Fluoroscopic Peak Skin Dose Using Manual Calculations
T2  - HEALTH PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Not all healthcare providers can afford to purchase commercially available programs that can quickly and easily provide peak skin dose estimations for patients undergoing diagnostic and international fluoroscopic procedures. The air kerma reference point exposure, K-a,K-r, available on all equipment manufactured after 2006, may over or under estimate the patient's peak skin dose. The total air kerma reference point exposure provided at the end of a case might be on the order of 20 Gy for a patient, indicating that a Joint Commission "sentinel event" may have occurred. An investigation to determine whether a sentinel event has occurred becomes necessary. This article will introduce information available to the investigating health physicist for data mining, how to process that information, and then how best to interpret the results. I have used this system of data mining and analysis to effectively influence how physicians performing diagnostic and interventional fluoroscopic procedures use fluoroscopic equipment. Arriving at an answer is not simple; it is time consuming, and the methodologies are imperfect. Your effort can result in improved utilization of fluoroscopic equipment at your institution which in turn will lower patient and staff doses.

TI  - Predicting krill swarm characteristics important for marine predators foraging off East Antarctica
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Open ocean predator-prey interactions are often difficult to interpret because of a lack of information on prey fields at scales relevant to predator behaviour. Hence, there is strong interest in identifying the biological and physical factors influencing the distribution and abundance of prey species, which may be of broad predictive use for conservation planning and evaluating effects of environmental change. This study focuses on a key Southern Ocean prey species, Antarctic krill Euphausia superba, using acoustic observations of individual swarms (aggregations) from a large-scale survey off East Antarctica. We developed two sets of statistical models describing swarm characteristics, one set using underway survey data for the explanatory variables, and the other using their satellite remotely sensed analogues. While survey data are in situ and contemporaneous with the swarm data, remotely sensed data are all that is available for prediction and inference about prey distribution in other areas or at other times. The fitted models showed that the primary biophysical influences on krill swarm characteristics included daylight (solar elevation/radiation) and proximity to the Antarctic continental slope, but there were also complex relationships with current velocities and gradients. Overall model performance was similar regardless of whether underway or remotely sensed predictors were used. We applied the latter models to generate regional-scale spatial predictions using a 10-yr remotely-sensed time series. This retrospective modelling identified areas off east Antarctica where relatively dense krill swarms were consistently predicted during austral mid-summers, which may underpin key foraging areas for marine predators. Spatiotemporal predictions along Antarctic predator satellite tracks, from independent studies, illustrate the potential for uptake into further quantitative modelling of predator movements and foraging. The approach is widely applicable to other krill-dependent ecosystems, and our findings are relevant to similar efforts examining biophysical linkages elsewhere in the Southern Ocean and beyond.

TI  - The use of satellite observations of fire radiative power to estimate the availabilities (activity patterns) of pyrometallurgical smelters
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pyrometallurgical smelters consume significant amounts of fossil fuels. Notwithstanding emission abatement technologies, these smelters emit various gaseous pollutants and fine particulate matter, which are important from an air quality perspective. Additionally, carbon dioxide (CO2) and black carbon (BC), the two most important atmospheric climate forcing species, are also emitted. It is important to model the contribution, transport, and impact of pollutants emitted by pyrometallurgical smelters. In order to do this, atmospheric modellers require an accurate emission inventory, which indicates emissions (how much of what species by which processes), emission periods, stack/emission heights, and emission velocities (if emitted through stacks). However, in many countries atmospheric modellers do not have access to a proper emission inventory, or they are legally prohibited from obtaining such information. The current paper demonstrates how fire radiative power (FRP) observations by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) instruments on board the Aqua and Terra satellites can be used to estimate the availabilities of pyrometallurgical smelters. Such temporal activity patterns will assist modellers to re-create air quality scenarios for regions more accurately.

TI  - An analysis of satellite-derived chlorophyll and algal bloom indices on Lake Winnipeg
T2  - JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Winnipeg has experienced dramatic increases in nutrient loading and phytoplankton biomass over the last few decades, accompanied by a marked shift in community composition towards the dominance of cyanobacteria. Comprehensive lake-wide observations of algal blooms are critical to assessing the lake's health status, its response to nutrient management practices, and an improved understanding of the processes driving blooms. We present an analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of algal blooms on Lake Winnipeg using satellite-derived chlorophyll and indices for algal bloom intensity, spatial extent, severity, and duration over the period of ESA's MERIS mission (2002-2011). Imagery documented extensive blooms covering as much as 93% of the lake surface. Bloom conditions were analysed in the context of in-lake and watershed processes to gain further insight on the drivers of bloom events. Day to day bloom variability was driven primarily by intermittent wind mixing events, with quiescent periods leading to the formation of dense surface blooms. Seasonal bloom distribution was consistent with light limitation in the south basin and lake circulation transporting bloom material towards the north-east shore. Inter-annual variability in average bloom severity was related to both total phosphorus (TP) loadings and summer lake surface temperatures. Results provide a valuable historical time series of bloom conditions to which ongoing observations from Sentinel-3's OLCI sensor can be added for longer term monitoring and change detection.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing estimation of river discharge: Application to the Yukon River Alaska
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology based on general hydraulic relations for rivers has been developed to estimate the discharge (flow rate) of rivers using satellite remote sensing observations. The estimates of discharge, flow depth, and flow velocity are derived from remotely observed water surface area, water surface slope, and water surface height, and demonstrated for two reaches of the Yukon River in Alaska, at Eagle (reach length 34.7 km) and near Stevens Village (reach length 38.3 km). The method is based on fundamental equations of hydraulic flow resistance in rivers, including the Manning equation and the Prandtl-von Karman universal velocity distribution equation. The method employs some new hydraulic relations to help define flow resistance and height of the zero flow boundary in the channel. Estimates are made both with and without calibration. The water surface area of the river reach is measured by using a provisional version of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat based product named Dynamic Surface Water Extent (DSWE). The water surface height and slope measurements require a self-consistent datum, and are derived from observations from the Jason-2 satellite altimeter mission. At both reach locations, the Jason-2 radar altimeter non-winter heights consistently tracked the stage recorded at USGS streamgages with a standard deviation of differences (error) during the non-winter periods of less than 7%. Part of the error may be due to differences in the gage and altimeter crossing locations with respect to the range of stage change and the response to changes in discharge at the upstream and downstream locations. For the non winter periods, the radar derived slope estimates (mean = 0.0003) were constant over the mission lifetime, and in agreement with previously measured USGS water surface slopes and slopes determined from USGS topographic maps. The accuracy of the mean of the uncalibrated daily estimates of discharge varied between reaches, ranging from 13% near Stevens Village (N = 90) to 21% at Eagle (N = 246) based on the absolute error, and 5% to 6% based on the error of the log of the estimates. Calibrating to the mean of USGS daily discharge estimates from the streamflow rating for the same period of record at each streamgage resulted in mean absolute errors ranging from 1% to 2%, and log errors ranging from 1% or less. The error pattern of the estimates shows that without calibration, even though the mean is well simulated, the high and low end values over the range of estimates may have significant bias.

TI  - Application of Thermal and Phenological Land Surface Parameters for Improving Ecological Niche Models of <i>Betula utilis</i> in the Himalayan Region
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modelling ecological niches across vast distribution ranges in remote, high mountain regions like the Himalayas faces several data limitations, in particular nonavailability of species occurrence data and fine-scale environmental information of sufficiently high quality. Remotely sensed data provide key advantages such as frequent, complete, and long-term observations of land surface parameters with full spatial coverage. The objective of this study is to evaluate modelled climate data as well as remotely sensed data for modelling the ecological niche of Betula utilis in the subalpine and alpine belts of the Himalayan region covering the entire Himalayan arc. Using generalized linear models (GLM), we aim at testing factors controlling the species distribution under current climate conditions. We evaluate the additional predictive capacity of remotely sensed variables, namely remotely sensed topography and vegetation phenology data (phenological traits), as well as the capability to substitute bioclimatic variables from downscaled numerical models by remotely sensed annual land surface temperature parameters. The best performing model utilized bioclimatic variables, topography, and phenological traits, and explained over 69% of variance, while models exclusively based on remotely sensed data reached 65% of explained variance. In summary, models based on bioclimatic variables and topography combined with phenological traits led to a refined prediction of the current niche of B. utilis, whereas models using solely climate data consistently resulted in overpredictions. Our results suggest that remotely sensed phenological traits can be applied beneficially as supplements to improve model accuracy and to refine the prediction of the species niche. We conclude that the combination of remotely sensed land surface temperature parameters is promising, in particular in regions where sufficient fine-scale climate data are not available.

TI  - General Practice Care for Patients with Rare Diseases in Belgium. A Cross-Sectional Survey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - There are almost no studies about rare diseases in general practice. This study examined care characteristics of active rare disease patients in the Belgian Network of Sentinel General Practices (SGP) and the importance of rare diseases in general practice by its caseload, general practitioner (GP)-patient encounter frequency and nationwide prevalence. The SGP reported data about: (i) the number of active rare disease patients in 2015; and (ii) characteristics of one to three most recently seen patients. Rare diseases were matched against Orphanet (www.orpha.net). GP encounter frequency and patients' age were compared to the total general practice population. Details from 121 active patients (median age: 44, interquartile range (IQR) 24-60) showed that for 36.9% the GP had been the first caregiver for the rare disease and for 35.8% the GP established a diagnostic referral. GPs rated their knowledge about their patients' disease as moderate and used Orphanet for 14.9% of patients. Any active rare disease patients (median: 1, IQR 0-2) were reported by 66 of 111 SGP. Compared to the total general practice population, the mean GP encounter frequency was higher (7.3; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 6.1-8.5 versus 5.4; 95% CI 5.4-5.4). The prevalence of rare diseases in the Belgian general practice population was estimated at 12.0 (95% CI 10.3-13.9) per 10,000. This study acknowledges the important role of GPs in rare disease care. Knowledge and use of Orphanet by GPs could be improved.

TI  - Relevant effects of beta<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor autoantibodies in chronic heart failure
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIOSCIENCE-LANDMARK
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients suffering from chronic heart failure (CHF) caused or promoted by autoantibodies against cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic receptors (beta(1)AR) could benefit from specific therapies aimed at tolerance induction, removal or neutralisation of beta(1)AR autoantibodies, provided the patients can be selected for these therapies by reliable detection and quantitation of beta(1)AR autoantibodies in their circulation and by a valid assessment of the autoantibodies's putative cardio-pathogenic potential. Here, we discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of CHF-associated (auto)antibodies on beta(1)AR function and beta(1)AR-mediated signal tranduction and discuss the presumed role of these effects in the development and progression of CHF. Identification of disease-relevant functional autoantibody effects and their specific assessment in medical diagnostic will be a prerequesite for the implementation of novel specific therapies not only for CHF caused or promoted by beta(1)AR autoantibodies but alos for most other diseases involving autoantibodies that target G-protein coupled receptors.

TI  - Random Forest Variable Importance Spectral Indices Scheme for Burnt Forest Recovery Monitoring<i>Multilevel RF-VIMP</i>
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Burnt forest recovery is normally monitored with a time-series analysis of satellite data because of its proficiency for large observation areas. Traditional methods, such as linear correlation plotting, have been proven to be effective, as forest recovery naturally increases with time. However, these methods are complicated and time consuming when increasing the number of observed parameters. In this work, we present a random forest variable importance (RF-VIMP) scheme called multilevel RF-VIMP to compare and assess the relationship between 36 spectral indices (parameters) of burnt boreal forest recovery in the Great Xing'an Mountain, China. Six Landsat images were acquired in the same month 0, 1, 4, 14, 16, and 20 years after a fire, and 39,380 fixed-location samples were then extracted to calculate the effectiveness of the 36 parameters. Consequently, the proposed method was applied to find correlations between the forest recovery indices. The experiment showed that the proposed method is suitable for explaining the efficacy of those spectral indices in terms of discrimination and trend analysis, and for showing the satellite data and forest succession dynamics when applied in a time series. The results suggest that the tasseled cap transformation wetness, brightness, and the shortwave infrared bands (both 1 and 2) perform better than other indices for both classification and monitoring.

TI  - Describing the spatio-temporal variability of vines and soil by satellite-based spectral indices: A case study in Apulia (South Italy)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A time series of Landsat 8 OLI (L8 OLI) multispectral images acquired between May 2013 and February 2016 were used to investigate vigour, vine and soil water content in a vineyard of Moscato Reale (syn. Moscato Bianco) sited in the Castel del Monte DOCG area. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) were calculated and compared with vine midday stem water potential (Psi(MDstem)) and soil volume water content (VWC), to calibrate estimation models. Estimation models were calibrated using already existing ground observation datasets from previous ordinary vineyard management operations: Psi(MDstem) was measured at two different locations in vineyard at 6 different dates in summer 2014; VWC was continuously measured from June to October 2014 and from January to September 2015. Results showed that: a) vine stem water potential can be locally estimated with an accuracy ranging from +/- 0.046 (high vigour vines) to +/- 0.127 (low vigour vines) MPa; b) soil volume water content can be locally estimated with an accuracy of about +/- 1.7%. Medium resolution satellite imagery proved, therefore, to be effective, at vineyard level, to describe vigour, vine and soil water status and their seasonality. This is an important issue to focus on since, as Landsat 8 images are free, the entire process is economic enough to be consistent with cost and incoming of the farming system.

TI  - Assessing the effectiveness of Landsat 8 chlorophyll a retrieval algorithms for regional freshwater monitoring
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting algal blooms has become a priority for scientists, municipalities, businesses, and citizens. Remote sensing offers solutions to the spatial and temporal challenges facing existing lake research and monitoring programs that rely primarily on high-investment, in situ measurements. Techniques to remotely measure chlorophyll a (chl a) as a proxy for algal biomass have been limited to specific large water bodies in particular seasons and narrow chl a ranges. Thus, a first step toward prediction of algal blooms is generating regionally robust algorithms using in situ and remote sensing data. This study explores the relationship between in-lake measured chl a data from Maine and New Hampshire, USA lakes and remotely sensed chl a retrieval algorithm outputs. Landsat 8 images were obtained and then processed after required atmospheric and radiometric corrections. Six previously developed algorithms were tested on a regional scale on 11 scenes from 2013 to 2015 covering 192 lakes. The best performing algorithm across data from both states had a 0.16 correlation coefficient (R-2) and P <= 0.05 when Landsat 8 images within 5 d, and improved to R-2 of 0.25 when data from Maine only were used. The strength of the correlation varied with the specificity of the time window in relation to the in-situ sampling date, explaining up to 27% of the variation in the data across several scenes. Two previously published algorithms using Landsat 8's Bands 1-4 were best correlated with chl a, and for particular late-summer scenes, they accounted for up to 69% of the variation in in-situ measurements. A sensitivity analysis revealed that a longer time difference between in situ measurements and the satellite image increased uncertainty in the models, and an effect of the time of year on several indices was demonstrated. A regional model based on the best performing remote sensing algorithm was developed and was validated using independent in situ measurements and satellite images. These results suggest that, despite challenges including seasonal effects and low chl a thresholds, remote sensing could be an effective and accessible regional-scale tool for chl a monitoring programs in lakes.

TI  - Which DEM is best for analyzing fluvial landscape development in mountainous terrains?
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional studies of fluvial landforms and long-term (Quaternary) landscape development in remote mountain landscapes routinely use satellite-derived DEM data sets. The SRTM and ASTER DEMs are the most commonly utilised because of their longer availability, free cost, and ease of access. However, rapid technological developments mean that newer and higher resolution DEM data sets such as ALOS World 3D (AW3D) and TanDEM-X are being released to the scientific community. Geomorphologists are thus faced with an increasingly problematic challenge of selecting an appropriate DEM for their landscape analyses. Here, we test the application of four medium resolution DEM products (30 m = SRTM, ASTER, AW3D; 12 m = TanDEM-X) for qualitative and quantitative analysis of a fluvial mountain landscape using the Dades River catchment (High Atlas Mountains, Morocco). This landscape comprises significant DEM remote sensing challenges. notably a high mountain relief, steep slopes, and a deeply incised high sinuosity drainage network with narrow canyon/gorge reaches. Our goal was to see which DEM produced the most representative best fit drainage network and meaningful quantification. To achieve this, we used ArcGIS and Stream Profiler platforms to generate catchment hillshade and slope rasters and to extract drainage network, channel long profile and channel slope, and area data. TanDEM-X produces the clearest landscape representation but with channel routing errors in localised high relief areas. Thirty-metre DEMs are smoother and less detailed, but the AW3D shows the closest fit to the real drainage network configuration. The TanDEM-X elevation values are the closest to field-derived GPS measurements. Long profiles exhibit similar shapes but with minor differences in length, elevation, and the degree of noise/smoothing, with AW3D producing the best representation. Slope-area plots display similarly positioned slope-break knickpoints with modest differences in steepness and concavity indices, but again best represented by AW3D. Collectively, our study shows that despite the higher effective resolution of TanDEM-X (12 m), the AW3D (30 m) data performs strongly across all analyses suggesting that it currently offers the greatest potential for regional mountain geomorphological analyses.

TI  - A Method for Mapping Future Urbanization in the United States
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are poised to absorb additional people. Their sustainability, or ability to accommodate a population increase without depleting resources or compromising future growth, depends on whether they harness the efficiency gains from urban land management. Population is often projected as a bulk national number without details about spatial distribution. We use Landsat and population data in a methodology to project and map U.S. urbanization for the year 2020 and document its spatial pattern. This methodology is important to spatially disaggregate projected population and assist land managers to monitor land use, assess infrastructure and distribute resources. We found the U.S. west coast urban areas to have the fastest population growth with relatively small land consumption resulting in future decrease in per capita land use. Except for Miami (FL), most other U.S. large urban areas, especially in the Midwest, are growing spatially faster than their population and inadvertently consuming land needed for ecosystem services. In large cities, such as New York, Chicago, Houston and Miami, land development is expected more in suburban zones than urban cores. In contrast, in Los Angeles land development within the city core is greater than in its suburbs.

TI  - The Potential of Multisource Remote Sensing for Mapping the Biomass of a Degraded Amazonian Forest
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the agricultural frontiers of Brazil, the distinction between forested and deforested lands traditionally used to map the state of the Amazon does not reflect the reality of the forest situation. A whole gradient exists for these forests, spanning from well conserved to severely degraded. For decision makers, there is an urgent need to better characterize the status of the forest resource at the regional scale. Until now, few studies have been carried out on the potential of multisource, freely accessible remote sensing for modelling and mapping degraded forest structural parameters such as aboveground biomass (AGB). The aim of this article is to address that gap and to evaluate the potential of optical (Landsat, MODIS) and radar (ALOS-1 PALSAR, Sentinel-1) remote sensing sources in modelling and mapping forest AGB in the old pioneer front of Paragominas municipality (Para state). We derived a wide range of vegetation and textural indices and combined them with in situ collected AGB data into a random forest regression model to predict AGB at a resolution of 20 m. The model explained 28% of the variance with a root mean square error of 97.1 Mgha(-1) and captured all spatial variability. We identified Landsat spectral unmixing and mid-infrared indicators to be the most robust indicators with the highest explanatory power. AGB mapping reveals that 87% of forest is degraded, with illegal logging activities, impacted forest edges and other spatial distribution of AGB that are not captured with pantropical datasets. We validated this map with a field-based forest degradation typology built on canopy height and structure observations. We conclude that the modelling framework developed here combined with high-resolution vegetation status indicators can help improve the management of degraded forests at the regional scale.

TI  - Involving Patients and Families in the Analysis of Suicides, Suicide Attempts, and Other Sentinel Events in Mental Healthcare: A Qualitative Study in The Netherlands
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Involving patients and families in mental healthcare is becoming more commonplace, but little is known about how they are involved in the aftermath of serious adverse events related to quality of care (sentinel events, including suicides). This study explores the role patients and families have in formal processes after sentinel events in Dutch mental healthcare. We analyzed the existing policies of 15 healthcare organizations and spoke with 35 stakeholders including patients, families, their counselors, the national regulator, and professionals. Respondents argue that involving patients and families is valuable to help deal with the event emotionally, provide additional information, and prevent escalation. Results indicate that involving patients and families is only described in sentinel event policies to a limited extent. In practice, involvement consists mostly of providing aftercare and sharing information about the event by providers. Complexities such as privacy concerns and involuntary admissions are said to hinder involvement. Respondents also emphasize that involvement should not be obligatory and stress the need for patients and families to be involved throughout the process of treatment. There is no one-size-fits-all strategy for involving patients and families after sentinel events. The first step seems to be early involvement during treatment process itself.

TI  - Cheatgrass (<i>Bromus tectorum</i>) distribution in the intermountain Western United States and its relationship to fire frequency, seasonality, and ignitions
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is an invasive grass pervasive across the Intermountain Western US and linked to major increases in fire frequency. Despite widespread ecological impacts associated with cheatgrass, we lack a spatially extensive model of cheatgrass invasion in the Intermountain West. Here, we leverage satellite phenology predictors and thousands of field surveys of cheatgrass abundance to create regional models of cheatgrass distribution and percent cover. We compare cheatgrass presence to fire probability, fire seasonality and ignition source. Regional models of percent cover had low predictive power (34% of variance explained), but distribution models based on a threshold of 15% cover to differentiate high abundance from low abundance had an overall accuracy of 74%. Cheatgrass achieves >= 15% cover over 210,000 km(2) (31%) of the Intermountain West. These lands were twice as likely to burn as those with low abundance, and four times more likely to burn multiple times between 2000 and 2015. Fire probability increased rapidly at low cheatgrass cover (1-5%) but remained similar at higher cover, suggesting that even small amounts of cheatgrass in an ecosystem can increase fire risk. Abundant cheatgrass was also associated with a 10 days earlier fire seasonality and interacted strongly with anthropogenic ignitions. Fire in cheatgrass was particularly associated with human activity, suggesting that increased awareness of fire danger in invaded areas could reduce risk. This study suggests that cheatgrass is much more spatially extensive and abundant than previously documented and that invasion greatly increases fire frequency, even at low percent cover.

TI  - Decadal biomass and area changes in a multi-species meadow in Singapore: application of multi-resolution satellite imagery
T2  - BOTANICA MARINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the dearth of information regarding current and changing health of seagrass habitat in the IndoPacific region, prior research into global trends of seagrass habitat health has included little data from this region, even though it contains the highest abundance and species diversity of seagrass globally. This study evaluates the suitability of four satellite sensors [Worldview-2 (WV2), Advanced Land Imager (ALI), Enhanced Thematic -Mapper + (ETM+), Operational Land Imager (OLI)] for determining trends in seagrass habitat extent over the past decade in Singapore's largest seagrass meadow, and thus contributes incrementally to the data available for regional or global analyses of seagrass habitat health. Using all four sensors, we find that seagrass bed extent at Pulau Semakau, Singapore, declined 37% from 2001 to 2015 at an average rate of 3.9% year(-1). Using very high spatial resolution satellite images, we calculate that, although bed extent decreased 18% from April 2011 to June 2013, median meadow biomass increased, indicating that complex meadow dynamics may be mediating seagrass response to anthropogenic and environmental pressures. From a technological perspective, we find that, despite their lower spatial resolution, freely available satellite images can be used to measure the extent of a narrow, multi-species seagrass bed and to determine decadal trends reliably.

TI  - Spatio-temporal trends and trade-offs in ecosystem services: An Earth observation based assessment for Switzerland between 2004 and 2014
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and monitoring pressures on ecosystems and their consequences for ecosystem services (ES) is essential for management decisions and verification of progress towards national and international policies (e.g. Aichi Biodiversity Targets, Sustainable Development Goals). Remote sensing (RS) offers a unique capability to assess ES systematically and regularly across spatial and temporal scales. We aim to evaluate the benefits of RS to monitor spatio-temporal variations of ES by assessing several ES in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014. We coupled mechanistic ES models and RS data to estimate time series of three regulating (i.e. carbon dioxide regulation (CO2R), soil erosion prevention (SEP), and air quality regulation (AQR)) and one cultural ES (recreational hiking (RH)). The resulting ES were used to assess spatial and temporal changes, trade-offs and synergies of ES potential supply and flow in Switzerland between 2004 and 2014. Resulting ES trends showed diverse spatial patterns across Switzerlind with largest changes in CO2R and AQR. ES interactions revealed a scale and elevation dependency. We identified weak to strong synergies between all ES combinations except for trade-offs between CO2R AQR and AQR RH at Swiss scale. Spatially, all ES interactions revealed a heterogeneous mix of synergies and trade-offs within Switzerland.Our results demonstrate the strength of RS for systematic and regular spatio-temporal ES monitoring and contribute insights to the large potential of RS, which will be extended with future Earth observation missions. Derived spatially explicit ES information will facilitate decision-making in landscape planning and conservation and will allow examining progress towards environmental policies.

TI  - Pediatric patients with cutaneous melanoma: A European study
T2  - PEDIATRIC BLOOD & CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionCutaneous melanoma is rare in childhood and published studies have mainly been retrospective single-institution series or small case series. Given the absence of clinical protocols dedicated to pediatric melanoma, the treatment approach is generally extrapolated from the ones applied to adults.MethodsCoordinated by the European Cooperative Study Group for Pediatric Rare Tumors (EXPeRT), this study collected patients prospectively registered between 2002 and 2012 under national cooperative projects dedicated to rare pediatric tumors in Italy, Poland, Germany, and France. Additional cases were collected from dermatology registries in Germany and Israel.ResultsA total of 219 patients aged 0-18 years (median 14.4) were included in the analysis. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed in 112 patients (76% of those with Breslow thickness>0.75mm) and was positive in 37.5%. Systemic therapy was used in 33 cases. In stage III cases, survival rates were similar for patients who received (23 cases) or not (21 cases) adjuvant therapy. For the whole series, 3-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 91.4% and 84.0%, respectively (median follow-up 41.8 months). Tumor site, tumor stage, and ulceration influenced survival rates. Patients treated by pediatric oncologists (n=140) were more likely to have advanced disease than those treated by dermatologists (n=79).DiscussionThis study would suggest that the clinical history of melanoma in children and adolescents might resemble that of adult counterpart. Cooperative efforts are needed to make new drugs more readily available to pediatric patients to increase the outcome of patient with advanced disease.

TI  - Unit-level and area-level small area estimation under heteroscedasticity using digital aerial photogrammetry data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In many applications, estimates are required for small sub-populations with so few (or no) sample plots that direct estimators that do not utilize auxiliary variables (e.g. remotely sensed data) are not applicable or result in low precision. This problem is overcome in small area estimation (SAE) by linking the variable of interest to auxiliary variables using a model. Two types of models can be distinguished based on the scale on which they operate: i) Unit-level models are applied in the well-known area-based approach (ABA) and are commonly used in forest inventories supported by fine-resolution 3D remote sensing data such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) or digital aerial photogrammetry (AP); ii) Area-level models, where the response is a direct estimate based on a sample within the domain and the explanatory variables are aggregated auxiliary variables, are less frequently applied. Estimators associated with these two model types can make use of sample plots within domains if available and reduce to so-called synthetic estimators in domains where no sample plots are available. We used both model types and their associated model-based estimators in the same study area with AP data as auxiliary variables. Heteroscedasticity, i.e. for continuous dependent variables typically an increasing dispersion of residuals with increasing predictions, is often observed in models linking field- and remotely sensed data. This violates the model assumption that the distribution of the residual errors is constant. Complying with model assumptions is required for model-based methods to result in reliable estimates. Addressing heteroscedasticity in models had considerable impacts on standard errors. When complying with model assumptions, the precision of estimates based on unit-level models was, on average, considerably greater (29%-31% smaller standard errors) than those based on area-level models. Area-level models may nonetheless be attractive because they allow the use of sampling designs that do not easily link to remotely sensed data, such as variable radius plots.

TI  - Evaluating Operational AVHRR Sea Surface Temperature Data at the Coastline Using Benthic Temperature Loggers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The nearshore coastal ocean is one of the most dynamic and biologically productive regions on our planet, supporting a wide range of ecosystem services. It is also one of the most vulnerable regions, increasingly exposed to anthropogenic pressure. In the context of climate change, monitoring changes in nearshore coastal waters requires systematic and sustained observations of key essential climate variables (ECV), one of which is sea surface temperature (SST). As temperature influences physical, chemical and biological processes within coastal systems, accurate monitoring is crucial for detecting change. SST is an ECV that can be measured systematically from satellites. Yet, owing to a lack of adequate in situ data, the accuracy and precision of satellite SST at the coastline are not well known. In a prior study, we attempted to address this by taking advantage of in situ SST measurements collected by a group of surfers. Here, we make use of a three year time-series (2014-2017) of in situ water temperature measurements collected using a temperature logger (recording every 30 min) deployed within a kelp forest (approximate to 3 m below chart datum) at a subtidal rocky reef site near Plymouth, UK. We compared the temperature measurements with three other independent in situ SST datasets in the region, from two autonomous buoys located approximate to 7 km and approximate to 33 km from the coastline, and from a group of surfers at two beaches near the kelp site. The three datasets showed good agreement, with discrepancies consistent with the spatial separation of the sites. The in situ SST measurements collected from the kelp site and the two autonomous buoys were matched with operational Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) EO SST passes, all within 1 h of the in situ data. By extracting data from the closest satellite pixel to the three sites, we observed a significant reduction in the performance of AVHRR at retrieving SST at the coastline, with root mean square differences at the kelp site over twice that observed at the two offshore buoys. Comparing the in situ water temperature data with pixels surrounding the kelp site revealed the performance of the satellite data improves when moving two to three pixels offshore and that this improvement was better when using an SST algorithm that treats each pixel independently in the retrieval process. At the three sites, we related differences between satellite and in situ SST data with a suite of atmospheric variables, collected from a nearby atmospheric observatory, and a high temporal resolution land surface temperature (LST) dataset. We found that differences between satellite and in situ SST at the coastline (kelp site) were well correlated with LST and solar zenith angle; implying contamination of the pixel by land is the principal cause of these larger differences at the coastline, as opposed to issues with atmospheric correction. This contamination could be either from land directly within the pixel, potentially impacted by errors in geo-location, or possibly through thermal adjacency effects. Our results demonstrate the value of using benthic temperature loggers for evaluating satellite SST data in coastal regions, and highlight issues with retrievals at the coastline that may inform future improvements in operational products.

AB  - Vegetation response to flooding across large dryland areas such as Australia's Murray Darling Basin (MDB) is not understood synoptically and with locally relevant detail. We filled this knowledge gap by quantifying vegetation dynamics, defined here as greening and browning due to changing chlorophyll content and leaf area index, in response to flooding and rainfall across the floodplains of the entire MDB. We quantified vegetation and flooding dynamics using the same data source, namely 26 years of high resolution, wall-to-wall satellite data, in a top down statistical modeling approach, where we controlled for rainfall. Our time series (1986-2011) covered a period of extreme hydroclimatic variability, including the South East Australian Millennium Drought, thus providing a research opportunity to investigate how the relationship between vegetation and flooding changed during wet and dry periods. Our results showed that besides rainfall, flooding plays a key role in driving floodplain vegetation dynamics, yet the role of flooding varied across the MDB floodplains. We quantified a change in the relationship of how vegetation responds to rainfall and flooding with an unprecedented level of spatial detail. The change in the relationships coincided primarily with the onset of the Millennium Drought, yet local and regional differences in the timing of the change did occur, suggesting that the beginning of the Millennium Drought did not impact all floodplain areas at the same time. Our synoptic while locally relevant quantification of the changing response of vegetation to rainfall and flooding is a first step to help underpin Australia's investment into environmental water allocations.

TI  - Suitability Assessment of X-Band Satellite SAR Data for Geotechnical Monitoring of Site Scale Slow Moving Landslides
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work addresses the suitability of using X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data for operational geotechnical monitoring of site scale slow moving landslides, affecting urban areas and infrastructures. The scale of these studies requires high resolution data. We propose a procedure for the practical use of SAR data in geotechnical landslides campaigns, that includes an appropriate dataset selection taking into account the scenario characteristics, a visibility analysis, and considerations when comparing advanced differential SAR interferometry (A-DInSAR) results with other monitoring techniques. We have determined that Sentinel-2 satellite optical images are suited for performing high resolution land cover classifications, which results in the achievement of qualitative visibility maps. We also concluded that A-DInSAR is a very powerful and versatile tool for detailed scale landslide monitoring, although in combination with other instrumentation techniques.

TI  - Tracers for Fluorescence-Guided Surgery: How Elongation of the Polymethine Chain in Cyanine Dyes Alters the Pharmacokinetics of a Dual-Modality c[RGDyK] Tracer
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of receptor-mediated fluorescence-based imageguided surgery tracers is generally linked to the near-infrared emission profile and good-manufacturing-production availability of fluorescent dyes. Surprisingly, little is known about the critical interaction between the structural composition of the dyes and the pharmacokinetics of the tracers. In this study, a dual-modality tracer design was used to systematically and quantitatively evaluate the influence of elongation of the polymethine chain in a fluorescent cyanine dye on the imaging potential of a targeted tracer. Methods: As a model system, the integrin marker alpha(nu)beta(3) was targeted using arginylglycylaspartisc acid [RGD]-based vectors functionalized with a In-111-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) chelate and a fluorescent dye: (Cy3-(SO3) methyl-COOH [emission wavelength (lambda(em)), 580 nm], Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH [lambda(em), 680 nm], or Cy7-(SO3) methyl-COOH [lambda(em), 780 nm]). Tracers were analyzed for differences in photophysical properties, serum protein binding, chemical or optical stability, and signal penetration through tissue. Receptor affinities were evaluated using saturation and competition experiments. In vivo biodistribution (SPECT imaging and percentage injected dose per gram of tissue) was assessed in tumor-bearing mice and complemented with in vivo and ex vivo fluorescence images obtained using a clinical-grade multispectral fluorescence laparoscope. Results: Two carbon-atom-step variations in the polymethine chain of the fluorescent cyanine dyes were shown to significantly influence the chemical and photophysical characteristics (e. g., stability, brightness, and tissue penetration) of the hybrid RGD tracers. DTPA-Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] structurally outperformed its Cy3 and Cy7 derivatives. Radioactivity-based evaluation of in vivo tracer pharmacokinetics yielded the lowest nonspecific uptake and highest tumor-to-background ratio for DTPA-Cy5-(SO3) methyl-COOH-c[RGDyK] (13.2 +/- 1.7), with the Cy3 and Cy7 analogs trailing at respective tumor-to-background ratios of 5.7 +/- 0.7 and 4.7 +/- 0.7. Fluorescence-based assessment of tumor visibility revealed a similar trend. Conclusion: These findings underline that variations in the polymethine chain lengths of cyanine dyes have a profound influence on the photophysical properties, stability, and in vivo targeting capabilities of fluorescent imaging tracers. In a direct comparison, the intermediate-length dye (Cy5) yielded a superior c[RGDyK] tracer, compared with the shorter (Cy3) and longer (Cy7) analogs.

TI  - Ten Years of TerraSAR-X Operations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The satellite of the TerraSAR-X mission, called TSX, was launched on 15 June 2007 and its identically constructed twin satellite TDX, which is required by the mission TanDEM-X, launched on 21 June 2010. Together they supply high-quality radar data in order to serve two mission goals: Scientific observation of Earth and the provisioning of remote sensing data for the commercial market (TerraSAR-X mission) and the generation of a global digital elevation model (DEM) of Earth's surface (TanDEM-X mission). On the occasion of the 10th anniversary of the mission, the focus will be on the development of the TerraSAR-X system during this period, including the extension of the ground segment, the evolution of the product portfolio, dedicated mission campaigns, radar experiments, refinement of the satellite operations and orbit control, and the results of the performance monitoring. Despite numerous interventions in the overall system, we managed to incorporate new scientific and commercial requirements and to improve and enhance the overall system in order to fulfill the increasing demand for Earth observation data without noticeable interruptions to ongoing operations.

T2  - SEMINARS IN CUTANEOUS MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgery remains one of the key treatment modalities for melanoma. Wide excision of the primary site with sentinel lymph node biopsy for selected patients has been recognized as the standard surgical approach for patients with early-stage disease. Controversies persist regarding margin width, indications for sentinel lymph node biopsy, and surgical management of regional nodal basins. Additionally, new therapies such as intralesional therapies as well as new systemic therapies are changing the role for surgery in patients with recurrent local-regional as well as metastatic disease. In this article, we discuss the current recommendations as well as the topics of debate in the surgical management of melanoma.

AB  - Intercultural growth and development is of crucial importance for the church's future orientation. When faced with the challenges of globalisation, migration and demographic change, it demonstrates a worldview and genuine Christian approach to building communities through church life that is dynamic, courageous and meaningful. By creating space for collaboration and cooperation between a wide-range of peoples, diverse forms of living out faith, structures and approaches to problems, churches escape the paralysis of empty alternatives. To make intercultural growth and development work in practice, practical theology needs to systematically research the topic, debate church concepts and models, demonstrate the progress made, and then teach others what has been learnt.

TI  - Multi-platform assessment of turbidity plumes during dredging operations in a major estuarine system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Dredging activities in estuaries frequently cause deleterious environmental effects on the water quality which can impact flora, fauna, and hydrodynamics, among others. A medium- and high-resolution satellite-based procedure is used in this study to monitor turbidity plumes generated during the dredging operations in the Guadalquivir estuary, a major estuarine system providing important ecosystem services in southwest Europe. A multi-sensor scheme is evaluated using a combination of five public and commercial medium- and high-resolution satellites, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, WorldView-2, World View-3, and GeoEye-1, with pixel sizes ranging from 30 m to 0.3 m. Applying a multi-conditional algorithm after the atmospheric correction of the optical imagery with ACOLITE, Sen2Cor and QUAC processors, it is demonstrated the feasibility to monitoring suspended solids during dredging operations at a spatial resolution unachievable with traditional satellite-based ocean color sensors ( > 300 m). The frame work can be used to map on-going, post and pre-dredging activities and asses Total Suspended Solids (TSS) anomalies caused by natural and anthropogenic processes in coastal and inland waters. These promising results are suitable to effectively improve the assessment of features relevant to environmental policies for the challenging coastal management and might serve as a notable contribution to the Earth Observation Program.

TI  - A high-performance and in-season classification system of field-level crop types using time-series Landsat data and a machine learning approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely spatial classification of crop types based on remote sensing data is important for both scientific and practical purposes. Spatially explicit crop-type information can be used to estimate crop areas for a variety of monitoring and decision-making applications such as crop insurance, land rental, supply-chain logistics, and financial market forecasting. However, there is no publically available spatially explicit in-season crop-type classification information for the U.S. Corn Belt (a landscape predominated by corn and soybean). Instead, researchers and decision-makers have to wait until four to six months after harvest to have such information from the previous year. The state-of-the-art research on crop-type classification has been shifted from relying on only spectral features of single static images to combining together spectral and time-series information. While Landsat data have a desirable spatial resolution for field-level crop-type classification, the ability to extract temporal phenology information based on Landsat data remains a challenge due to low temporal revisiting frequency and inevitable cloud contamination. To address this challenge and generate accurate, cost-effective, and in-season crop-type classification, this research uses the USDA's Common Land Units (CLUs) to aggregate spectral information for each field based on a time-series Landsat image data stack to largely overcome the cloud contamination issue while exploiting a machine learning model based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and high-performance computing for intelligent and scalable computation of classification processes. Experiments were designed to evaluate what information is most useful for training the machine learning model for crop-type classification, and how various spatial and temporal factors affect the crop-type classification performance in order to derive timely crop type information. All experiments were conducted over Champaign County located in central Illinois, and a total of 1322 Landsat multi-temporal scenes including all the six optical spectral bands spanning from 2000 to 2015 were used. Computational experiments show the inclusion of temporal phenology information and evenly distributed spatial training samples in the study domain improves classification performance. The shortwave infrared bands show notably better performance than the widely used visible and near-infrared bands for classifying corn and soybean. In comparison with USDA's Crop Data Layer (CDL), this study found a relatively high Overall Accuracy (i.e. the number of the corrected classified fields divided by the number of the total fields) of 96% for classifying corn and soybean across all CLU fields in the Champaign County from 2000 to 2015. Furthermore, our approach achieved 95% Overall Accuracy by late July of the concurrent year for classifying corn and soybean. The findings suggest the methodology presented in this paper is promising for accurate, cost-effective, and in-season classification of field-level crop types, which may be scaled up to large geographic extents such as the U.S. Corn Belt.

TI  - Realistic Forest Stand Reconstruction from Terrestrial LiDAR for Radiative Transfer Modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biophysical variables derived from remote sensing observations are vital for climate research. The combination of structurally and radiometrically accurate 3D virtual forests with radiative transfer (RT) models creates a powerful tool to facilitate the calibration and validation of remote sensing data and derived biophysical products by helping us understand the assumptions made in data processing algorithms. We present a workflow that uses highly detailed 3D terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) data to generate virtual forests for RT model simulations. Our approach to forest stand reconstruction from a co-registered point cloud is unique as it models each tree individually. Our approach follows three steps: (1) tree segmentation; (2) tree structure modelling and (3) leaf addition. To demonstrate this approach, we present the measurement and construction of a one hectare model of the deciduous forest in Wytham Woods (Oxford, UK). The model contains 559 individual trees. We matched the TLS data with traditional census data to determine the species of each individual tree and allocate species-specific radiometric properties. Our modelling framework is generic, highly transferable and adjustable to data collected with other TLS instruments and different ecosystems. The Wytham Woods virtual forest is made publicly available through an online repository.

TI  - Suspended Particulate Matter in the Rio de la Plata: importance in its spatial and temporal variability of the Bermejo river
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal variability of Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) in the Rio de la Plata (RdlP) is analyzed from 2002-2014 of MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and explained in terms of its main tributaries flows. The monthly mean showed maximum during late summer to mid-autumn, and minimum in mid-winter to early summer. The Bermejo river (BeR), is the tributary that more sediment in suspension brings. This situation was reflected in the significant relationship between the mean monthly concentrations of SPM with the average monthly flow of BeR. Seasonal variation in SPM concentration, showed maximum values in fall, followed by summer, and minimum values in winter and spring, reflecting the monthly pattern of discharge of the BeR with one and two months of delay. The pattern of spatial variation differentiated threes regions: the inner, central and outer. The annual variability evidenced a marked seasonality in the spatial coverage pattern of the waters with the highest SPM. The pattern of the anomalies, appeared to be related to the influence of river discharge, what it showed the temporal pattern of SPM anomalies did not related to the ENSO (El Nino - Sourthen Oscillation) cycle. These results allowed us to denote the importance of BeR (not ENSO dependent) to explain the pattern of observed SPM anomaly in the RdlP region.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper will look at the Abra Network from the Early Historical to Historical Period (10th to Early 20th c) which encompasses areas of Ilocos Sur as well as the whole province of Abra. It is argued that this particular network features the migration by coastal peoples to the interior in order to fully control strategic "choke" points in the gold trade with the Lepanto and Angaqui networks as well as to control jump-off points to the leeward side of the Cordillera Mountains - the Cagayan valley. Analysis was done using data from GIS predictive modelling and WorldView3 satellite remote sensing, in conjunction with archaeological data from 2011 and 2012 field seasons as well as published primary and secondary ethnohistorical data. Several Spanish period maps provided important data on early settlements and trails, after georeferencing through GIS software.

TI  - Tracking crop phenological development using multi-temporal polarimetric Radarsat-2 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on crop phenological development stages such as emergence, flowering, fruiting, maturing and senescence is essential for crop production surveillance and yield prediction. It has long been related to optical spectral signatures such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) or spectral shifts in the red-edge range. In recent years, more efforts have been made to explore the sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), particularly polarimetric SAR signatures, to crop biophysical parameters or phenological stages. In this study, phenological metrics of canola (Brassica napus) and spring wheat (Triticum spp.) are related with temporal evolution of polarimetric SAR parameters derived from the C-band RADARSAT-2 full polarimetric SAR data. Both crops are very common in north eastern Ontario, Canada, but have very anatomically different development processes. From multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data acquired in three consecutive years (2012-2014), significant correlations were observed between a number of SAR polarimetric parameters and the growth parameters of both crops. Strong correlation was observed between plant height and the Alpha angle of the Cloude-Pottier decomposition, with the R-2 of 0.91 and 0.66 for canola and wheat, respectively. The R-2 increased when the polarimetric parameters were smoothed in the time domain (R-2 of 0.98 for canola and 0.88 for wheat). Strong correlation was also observed for the two crops between the effective leaf area index (LAIe) and the Beta angle, and between days-after-seeding (DAS) and a combination of the Alpha and the Beta angles. These findings show that multi-temporal C-band polarimetric SAR parameters could be used for tracking crop phonological development stages.

TI  - Operational Built-Up Areas Extraction for Cities in China Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain accurate information in a timely manner on built-up areas (BAs) is essential for urban planning and natural hazard (e.g., earthquakes) response strategies. In this paper, a new method for BAs extraction using the Sentinel-1 SAR is proposed, which includes two steps: (1) Candidate BAs are first selected as seeds from images that show high backscattering and obvious textural patterns, as characterized by image intensity, Getis-Ord index, and the variogram texture features; (2) region growing is iteratively implemented from these seed pixels to extract the BAs. Sentinel-1 data, with 5 x 20 m(2) resolution, are selected over eight cities with various environmental settings around China, to validate the robustness of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method achieves higher detection accuracy and fewer commission errors compared with the intensity-based region growing and thresholding methods. An averaged accuracy of 96.5% in validation points of eight cities was achieved, which outperforms the GlobCover urban product in both urban and rural area, while fewer commission errors were achieved compared to Landsat data-based methods. Moreover, two polarizations (VV/VH) and the averaged channel are compared for BAs extraction in areas with various environments. It turns out that improved results can be achieved using the averaged image of two polarizations in north China, while the VV image is better suited for BAs extraction in south. These findings indicate that operational BAs mapping over China, and even globally, is possible, since the Sentinel-1 data can provide images with global coverage.

TI  - Estimation of Water Level Changes of Large-Scale Amazon Wetlands Using ALOS2 ScanSAR Differential Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Differential synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (DInSAR) has been successfully used to estimate water level changes (h/t) over wetlands and floodplains. Specifically, amongst ALOS PALSAR datasets, the fine-beam stripmap mode has been mostly implemented to estimate h/t due to its availability of multitemporal images. However, the fine-beam observation mode provides limited swath coverage to study large floodplains and wetlands, such as the Amazon floodplains. Therefore, for the first time, this paper demonstrates that ALOS2 ScanSAR data can be used to estimate the large-scale h/t in Amazon floodplains. The basic procedures and challenges of DInSAR processing with ALOS2 ScanSAR data are addressed and final h/t maps are generated based on the Satellite with ARgos and ALtiKa (SARAL) altimetry's reference data. This study reveals that the local h/t patterns of Amazon floodplains are spatially complex with highly interconnected floodplain channels, but the large-scale (with 350 km swath) h/t patterns are simply characterized by river water flow directions.

TI  - Estimation of water quality parameters using Landsat 8 images: application to Playa Colorada Bay, Sinaloa, Mexico
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, empirical models were generated to estimate water quality parameters, with the objective of showing the benefits of the satellite remote sensing application in the characterization of coastal waters. The study area was Playa Colorada Bay, located in the northwest of Mexico, in the eastern part of the Gulf of California. In two seasons of the year, on-site and laboratory characterizations were carried out to determine the spatial and temporal variation of phosphates (PO4), electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity, and pH of water. Samplings were selected to match Landsat 8 satellite overpass in the study area. Radiometric and atmospheric corrections were applied to the images, prior to the generation of the models. The models were generated using the linear regression technique of successive steps; water quality parameters and their logarithms were used as dependent variables, and as independent variables were used corrected reflectance values of Landsat images. The results showed that the concentration of PO4 in the analyzed water samples were higher than those recommended in the Mexican ecological criteria of water quality, to protect the aquatic life of marine water in coastal areas. In autumn, PO4 was correlated with turbidity, T, pH, and TSS. The highest correlation coefficients were presented by TSS with PO4 (r = - 0.979) and pH (r = 0.958). The water quality models that were generated had coefficients of determination (R (2)) in the range of 0.637 to 0.955 and show the viability of the application of Landsat 8 images in the characterization of water quality parameters in Playa Colorada Bay. Models allowed the estimation of the distribution of water quality parameters over the whole bay instead of only at the sampling stations, favoring a better understanding of their spatial distribution.

TI  - Evaluation of two models using CERES data for reference evapotranspiration estimation
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration is the most important variable in the Pampas plain. Information provided by sensors onboard satellite missions allows represent the spatial and temporal variability of evapotranspiration, which cannot be achieved using only measurements of weather stations. In this work, the Priestley and Taylor (PT) and FAO Penman Monteith (FAO PM) equations were adapted to estimate the reference evapotranspiration, ET0, using only CERES satellite products (SYN1 and CldTypHist). In order to evaluate the reference evapotranspiration from CERES, a comparison with in situ measurements was conducted. We used ET data provided by the Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario, corresponding to 24 stations placed in the Pampean Region of Argentina (2001-2016). Results showed very good agreement between the estimates with CERES products and in situ values, with errors between +/- 0.8 and +/- 1.1 mm d(-1) and r(2) greater than 0.75 at daily scale, and errors between +/- 14 and +/- 19 mm month(-1) and r(2) greater than 0.9, at monthly scale better results were obtained with adapted model FAO PM than PT. Finally, ET 0 monthly maps for the Pampean Region of Argentina were elaborated, which allowed knowing the temporal-spatial variation in the validation area. In conclusion, the methods presented here are a suitable alternative to estimate the reference evapotranspiration without requiring ground measurements.

TI  - ANALYZING THE CLOUD MICRO- AND MACRO-PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE CYCLONE EYE WALL AND ITS SURROUNDING SPIRAL CLOUD BANDS BASED ON CLOUDSAT AND TRMM DATA
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the micro- and macro-physical properties, thermal structure and precipitation characteristics of cyclone eye walls and their surrounding spiral clouds were analysed with CloudSat and TRMM data for five tropical cyclones (TCs) in 2013. The results show that the ice-phase clouds of a mature TC are mainly above 5 km. With increasing altitude, the cloud droplet effective radius decreases, and the particle number concentration increases. Ice water content first increases and then decreases with increasing height. In the eye area, in addition to the well-known warm-core area, another warm core is also apparent around the eye at a height of 8 to 15 km. The horizontal distribution of precipitation is characterized by large-scale stratiform precipitation mixed with independent convective precipitation. The height of precipitation is mostly below 7.5 km, and the heavy rain is mainly below 5 km. When the peripheral convective clouds are strong enough, ice particles would be generated, thus providing conditions that are favourable for the formation of precipitation below.

TI  - Multisensor Satellite Image Fusion and Networking for All-Weather Environmental Monitoring
T2  - IEEE SYSTEMS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the advancements of remote sensing technology, large volumes of remotely sensed images with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions are available. To better monitor and understand the changing Earth's environment, fusion of remotely sensed images with different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions is critical for distinctive feature retrieval, interpretation, mapping, and decision analysis. A suite of methods have been developed to fuse multisensor satellite images for different purposes in the past few decades. This paper provides a thorough review of contemporary and classic image fusion methods and presents a summary of their phenomenological applications, with challenges and perspectives, for environmental systems analysis. Cross-mission satellite image fusion, networking, and missing value pixel reconstruction for environmental monitoring are described, and their complex integration is illustrated with a case study of Lake Nicaragua that elucidates the state-of-the-art remote sensing technologies for advancing water quality management.

TI  - A modified MOD16 algorithm to estimate evapotranspiration over alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term change of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for managing water resources in areas with extreme climates, such as the Tibetan Plateau (TP). This study proposed a modified algorithm for estimating ET based on the MOD16 algorithm on a global scale over alpine meadow on the TP in China. Wind speed and vegetation height were integrated to estimate aerodynamic resistance, while the temperature and moisture constraints for stomatal conductance were revised based on the technique proposed by Fisher et al, (2008). Moreover, Fisher's method for soil evaporation was adopted to reduce the uncertainty in soil evaporation estimation. Five representative alpine meadow sites on the TP were selected to investigate the performance of the modified algorithm. Comparisons were made between the ET observed using the Eddy Covariance (EC) and estimated using both the original and modified algorithms. The results revealed that the modified algorithm performed better than the original MOD16 algorithm with the coefficient of determination (R-2) increasing from 0.26 to 0.68, and root mean square error (RMSE) decreasing from 1.56 to 0.78 mm d(-1). The modified algorithm performed slightly better with a higher R-2 (0.70) and lower RMSE (0.61 mm d(-1)) for after-precipitation days than for non precipitation days at Suli site. Contrarily, better results were obtained for non-precipitation days than for after precipitation days at Arou, Tanggula, and Hulugou sites, indicating that the modified algorithm may be more suitable for estimating ET for non-precipitation days with higher accuracy than for after-precipitation days, which had large observation errors. The comparisons between the modified algorithm and two mainstream methods suggested that the modified algorithm could produce high accuracy ET over the alpine meadow sites on the TP.

TI  - Glacier variations and rising temperature in the Mt. Kenya since the Last Glacial Maximum
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution imagery can be used to reconstruct former glacier boundaries through the identification of glacial erosional and sedimentary geomorphology. We employed moraine mapping and the accumulation-area ratio method (AAR), in conjunction with Landsat, Google Earth, and SRTM imagery, to reconstruct glacier boundaries and equilibrium-line altitudes (ELAs) for Mt. Kenya in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), the Little Ice Age (LIA), and at present. Our results show that the areas of Lewis Glacier and the Tyndall-I glacier system were 0.678 km(2) and 0.390 km(2), respectively, during the maximum of LIA. Those mean that the both glaciers have shrunken by 87.0% and 88.7%, respectively since the LIA. Area change ratios for each glacier were significantly larger in the period of 2000 through 2015 than the former periods, indicating that glacier recession has accelerated. Continuous ice loss in this region has been driven by rising temperature and fluctuating precipitation. Linear regression data for Lewis glacier show that mass balance sensitivity to dry season temperature was-315 mm w.e./A degrees C, whereas the sensitivity to dry season precipitation was 5.2 mm w.e./mm. Our data also show that the ELA on the western slope of Mt. Kenya rose by 716-816 m from the LGM to the modern era, corresponding to that temperature rose by 5.2A degrees C -6.5A degrees C.

TI  - Mapping Urban Land Cover of a Large Area Using Multiple Sensors Multiple Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Concerning the strengths and limitations of multispectral and airborne LiDAR data, the fusion of such datasets can compensate for the weakness of each other. This work have investigated the integration of multispectral and airborne LiDAR data for the land cover mapping of large urban area. Different LiDAR-derived features are involoved, including height, intensity, and multiple-return features. However, there is limited knowledge relating to the integration of multispectral and LiDAR data including three feature types for the classification task. Furthermore, a little contribution has been devoted to the relative importance of input features and the impact on the classification uncertainty by using multispectral and LiDAR. The key goal of this study is to explore the potenial improvement by using both multispectral and LiDAR data and to evaluate the importance and uncertainty of input features. Experimental results revealed that using the LiDAR-derived height features produced the lowest classification accuracy (83.17%). The addition of intensity information increased the map accuracy by 3.92 percentage points. The accuracy was further improved to 87.69% with the addition multiple-return features. A SPOT-5 image produced an overall classification accuracy of 86.51%. Combining spectral and spatial features increased the map accuracy by 6.03 percentage points. The best result (94.59%) was obtained by the combination of SPOT-5 and LiDAR data using all available input variables. Analysis of feature relevance demonstrated that the normalized digital surface model (nDSM) was the most beneficial feature in the classification of land cover. LiDAR-derived height features were more conducive to the classification of urban area as compared to LiDAR-derived intensity and multiple-return features. Selecting only 10 most important features can result in higher overall classification accuracy than all scenarios of input variables except the feature of entry scenario using all available input features. The variable importance varied a very large extent in the light of feature importance per land cover class. Results of classification uncertainty suggested that feature combination can tend to decrease classification uncertainty for different land cover classes, but there is no one-feature-combination-fits-all solution. The values of classification uncertainty exhibited significant differences between the land cover classes, and extremely low uncertainties were revealed for the water class. However, it should be noted that using all input variables resulted in relatively lower classification uncertainty values for most of the classes when compared to other input features scenarios.

TI  - Sparse Representation over Shared Coefficients in Multispectral Pansharpening
T2  - TSINGHUA SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The pansharpening process is for obtaining an enhanced image with both high spatial and high spectral resolutions by fusing a panchromatic (PAN) image and a low spatial resolution multispectral (MS) image. Sparse Principal Component Analysis (SPCA) method has been proposed as a pansharpening method, which utilizes sparse coefficients and over-complete dictionaries to represent the remote sensing data. However, this method still has some drawbacks, such as the existence of the block effect. In this paper, based on SPCA, we propose the Sparse over Shared Coefficients (SSC), in which patches are extracted with a sliding distance of 1 pixel from a PAN image, and the MS image shares the sparse representation coefficients trained from the PAN image independently. The fused high-resolution MS image is reconstructed by K-SVD algorithm and iterations, and residual compensation is applied when the down-sampling constraint is not satisfied. The simulated experiment results demonstrate that the proposed SSC method outperforms SPCA and improves the overall effectiveness.

TI  - Impacts of heat stress on leaf area index and growth duration of winter wheat in the North China Plain
T2  - FIELD CROPS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Impact of high temperature stress on crop growth and productivity is one key concern with respect to crop production and food security under climate change. Due to the complexity and diversity of crop characteristics and farmers' management practices, as well as the difficulties in quantifying those agronomic management practices at reasonable temporal and spatial scales, crop responses to heat stress at a regional scale have not been properly assessed yet. In this study, we used remote-sensing data to investigate the responses of growth duration and leaf area index (LAI) of winter wheat to extreme high temperature during reproductive growing stage in the North China Plain from 2001 to 2008. Growing degree days above 0 degrees C (GDD) from heading to maturity was used to represent average temperature of growing environment, and the extreme temperature ( > 34 degrees C) degree days (EDD) was used as an indicator for heat stress. We detected statistically significant shortening of reproductive growing duration due to increase in GDD and EDD at both site and regional scales. We also found acceleration of leaf senescence under warmer environment, as well as considerable damages to leaf area by extremely high temperatures according to LAI values from remote-sensing data. Our results present the explicit patterns of crop responses to heat stress at different spatial scales and periods, indicating the complexity of the impacts of extreme events. Moreover, we highlighted that exposure, vulnerability and adaptation all should be considered in evaluating the impacts of extreme events. In addition, our findings suggest great potential for improving regional crop growth monitoring and yield prediction through assimilating remote-sensing data into mechanistic crop simulation models.

TI  - Accuracy of a nomogram to predict the survival benefit of surgical axillary staging in T1 breast cancer patients
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - T1 breast cancer patients have favorable clinical outcomes, so that whether axillary stating (AS) surgery can be omitted in these patients is still unclear. This retrospective cohort study developed a nomogram to predict the cancer-specific survival (CSS) of T1 breast cancer patients with and without AS and estimate the survival benefit of AS in these patients.We used surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) database to identify 232,195 breast cancer patients with T1 tumors diagnosed between 1990 and 2008. In the training cohort, we used the Kaplan-Meier method and the competing risk analysis, with non-CSS as the competing risk, to screen for prognostic factors for CSS. A nomogram to predict the CSS, with receiving AS or not as one of the predictors, was developed and externally validated, using the C-index and calibration plots. The survival benefit of AS can be estimated by the difference of 2 predicted CSS, when the patient was considered as having and not having AS.With a median follow-up of 109 months, the CSS of the study population were 96.3%, 92.3%, and 88.5% at 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. Significant predictors for CSS identified in the training cohort were used to develop a nomogram, which was validated internally [C-index = 0.707, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0,702-0.712] and externally (C-index = 0.704, 95% CI 0.698-0.710). The nomogram was well calibrated. With this nomogram, AS was predicted to have less than 2% benefit of 5-, 10-, and 15-year CSS in 60.6% (140,599/232,195), 15.5% (36,074/232,195), and 8.6% (20,043/232,195) of the entire study population, respectively.The new nomogram can accurately predict the CSS of T1 breast cancer patients, and also be able to estimate the survival benefit of AS in these patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.

TI  - Eco-environmental water requirements in Shuangtaizi Estuary Wetland based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - With rapid economic development and expansion of urban boundaries, increasingly damaged wetland resources have seriously threatened the ecosystem. The study of eco-environmental requirements of wetlands is not only the basis of water resources allocation in development and utilization, but also for creating a sustainable system to maintain and improve the overall ecosystem. In this study, we used the Shuangtaizi Estuary Wetland as our study area. The breakdown of wetland cover types was extracted based on multi-source remote sensing data, providing the graphic database for ecological water requirement calculation. According to the characteristics of the Shuangtaizi Estuary Wetland ecosystem, the methods of quantifying the components of ecological water requirements were determined. The results showed that the optimum ecological water requirement of the total wetland was 239 million m(3). The minimum, 75th percentile frequency, and 95th percentile frequency water requirements were 670 million m(3), 921 million m(3), and 1,078 million m(3), respectively.

TI  - An integrative modeling approach to mapping wetlands and riparian areas in a heterogeneous Rocky Mountain watershed
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate maps of wetlands and riparian areas are critical for targeting conservation and monitoring efforts. However, detailed inventories in mountain regions are largely non-existent, as conventional mapping approaches are hindered by high costs, remoteness, and landscape variability. Contemporary modeling techniques can circumvent many of these issues, but are often difficult to interpret and tend to rely on specialized datasets that prevent their wider application. In this study, we used machine learning, Landsat 8 imagery and geomorphometric indices to map the distribution of wetlands and riparian areas in the Cache la Poudre River watershed, Colorado, USA. We used a presence-background approach to develop and compare predictions from three popular algorithms: boosted regression trees, MaxEnt and random forests. In addition, we developed the models within three elevation-based life zones to account for altitudinal changes in ecohydrology and land use. Our results showed strong predictive performance, with top-performing models achieving area under the curve values as high as 0.98 and correctly classifying up to 95% of test data. Model performance varied by elevation zone, and no algorithm consistently outperformed the others. The boosted regression trees approach was uniquely able to differentiate wetlands from irrigated agriculture and residential areas in lower elevations. Multi-seasonal greenness and wetness indices were highly influential predictors in all models, underscoring the importance of capturing local phenological characteristics and hydrological regimes. Dissection and roughness terrain metrics were key predictors for identifying valley bottom meadows and emergent wetlands in high-elevation forests. We demonstrate how integrating ecological interpretation into the modeling workflow can inform conventional accuracy statistics and help bridge field-based and remote sensing perspectives. We also show how continuous model outputs can facilitate this process by depicting nuances of the wetland-upland continuum. Our approach requires only public data that are widely available, and can be easily adapted to other heterogeneous mountain settings.

AB  - In the context of climate change and global warming, a growing number of studies reported lengthening of the growing season for most of the Northern Hemisphere, which is associated with increase of air temperature. Evidences of the increase of the growing season length were noted through satellite data and phonological and meteorological observations. This article presents the studies on the temporal and spatial tendencies in the thermal growing season (TGS) length in north-eastern Poland in 1951-2015. The analyses were conducted using long-term and homogeneity daily data sets from 13 meteorological stations (fig. 1). The dates of beginning and end of the TGS were determined by Huculak-Makowiec method. Trends in the TGS length as well as start and end dates were analysed for the whole study period as well as for successive 30-years periods: 1951-1980,1961-1990,1971-2000 and 1981-2010. The results show a general increase of the length of the TGS in the north-eastern Poland in 1951-2015 period, however, there are spatial and temporal differences in TGS evolution. In the western and central part of the region, the growing season in the past 65 years became ca. 20 days longer, while in the eastern part the lengthening of TGS was weaker and amounted to 7-10 days. Most of this change is due to earlier onset of the TGS in spring (average for the western part =2.1 days/10 years, while for the eastern one - 1.2 days/10 years). The observed trends and tendencies show spatial and temporal variability in TGS evolution. Trends in parameters of TGS, calculated for 30-years period, varied directionally and spatially with no significant trends before 1980. In the period 1981-2010 the growing season was longer than in the previous years, the largest increases were found in the central part of the region (1.2 days/year), while the smallest in the south-eastern part (0.5 day/year). Since the 1980s the frequency of long growing seasons increased. A particularly large and steady increase of TGS occurred over the first 15 years of the 21st century. Length as well as start and end dates of the TGS displayed large inter-annual and decadal variability with tendencies for increased range of variability.

TI  - Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar flood mapping using change detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A change detection and thresholding methodology has been adapted from previous studies to determine the extent of flooding for 13 Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar images captured during the floods of winter 2015-2016 in Yorkshire, UK. Both available polarisations, VH and VV, have been processed to allow for a comparison of their respective accuracy for delineating surface water. Peak flood extents are found on 29 December 2015 during the aftermath of storms Eva and Frank. Results have been validated against a Sentinel-2 optical image, with both polarisations producing a total accuracy of 97%. Of the two polarisations, VV produces fewer misclassifications, mirroring the similar results reported in previous research. Mapped results are compared to the Environment Agency Flood Maps for Planning (EA FMP), with good correlation observed for inundation on the floodplains. Differences occur away from the floodplains, with the satellite data identifying pluvial flooding not highlighted by the EA FMP.

TI  - Phytoplankton Size Structure in Association with Mesoscale Eddies off Central-Southern Chile: The Satellite Application of a Phytoplankton Size-Class Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the influence of mesoscale and submesoscale features on the structure of phytoplankton is a key aspect in the assessment of their influence on marine biogeochemical cycling and cross-shore exchanges of plankton in Eastern Boundary Current Systems (EBCS). In this study, the spatio-temporal evolution of phytoplankton size classes (PSC) in surface waters associated with mesoscale eddies in the EBCS off central-southern Chile was analyzed. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) size-fractionated filtration (SFF) data from in situ samplings in coastal and coastal transition waters were used to tune a three-component (micro-, nano-, and pico-phytoplankton) model, which was then applied to total Chl-a satellite data (ESA OC-CCI product) in order to retrieve the Chl-a concentration of each PSC. A sea surface, height-based eddy-tracking algorithm was used to identify and track one cyclonic (sC) and three anticyclonic (ssAC1, ssAC2, sAC) mesoscale eddies between January 2014 and October 2015. Satellite estimates of PSC and in situ SFF Chl-a data were highly correlated (0.64 < r < 0.87), although uncertainty values for the microplankton fraction were moderate to high (50 to 100% depending on the metric used). The largest changes in size structure took place during the early life of eddies (similar to 2 months), and no major differences in PSC between eddy center and periphery were found. The contribution of the microplankton fraction was similar to 50% (similar to 30%) in sC and ssAC1 (ssAC2 and sAC) eddies when they were located close to the coast, while nanoplankton was dominant (similar to 60-70%) and picoplankton almost constant (<20%) throughout the lifetime of eddies. These results suggest that the three-component model, which has been mostly applied in oceanic waters, is also applicable to highly productive coastal upwelling systems. Additionally, the PSC changes within mesoscale eddies obtained by this satellite approach are in agreement with results on phytoplankton size distribution in mesoscale and submesoscale features in this region, and are most likely triggered by variations in nutrient concentrations and/or ratios during the eddies' lifetimes.

TI  - Processing Image to Geographical Information Systems (PI2GIS)-A Learning Tool for QGIS
T2  - EDUCATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Education, together with science and technology, is the main driver of the progress and transformations of a country. The use of new technologies of learning can be applied to the classroom. Computer learning supports meaningful and long-term learning. Therefore, in the era of digital society and environmental issues, a relevant role is provided by open source software and free data that promote universality of knowledge. Earth observation (EO) data and remote sensing technologies are increasingly used to address the sustainable development goals. An important step for a full exploitation of this technology is to guarantee open software supporting a more universal use. The development of image processing plugins, which are able to be incorporated in Geographical Information System (GIS) software, is one of the strategies used on that front. The necessity of an intuitive and simple application, which allows the students to learn remote sensing, leads us to develop a GIS open source tool, which is integrated in an open source GIS software (QGIS), in order to automatically process and classify remote sensing images from a set of satellite input data. The application was tested in Vila Nova de Gaia municipality (Porto, Portugal) and Aveiro district (Portugal) considering Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data.

TI  - The physiological effects of oil, dispersant and dispersed oil on the bay mussel, <i>Mytilus trossulus</i>, in Arctic/Subarctic conditions
T2  - AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing oil development around Alaska and other Arctic regions elevates the risk for another oil spill. Dispersants are used to mitigate the impact of an oil spill by accelerating natural degradation processes, but the reduced hydrophobicity of dispersed oil may increase its bioavailability to marine organisms. There is limited research on the effect of dispersed oil on cold water species and ecosystems. Therefore, spiked exposure tests were conducted with bay mussels (Mytilus trossulus) in seawater with non-dispersed oil, Corexit 9500 and oil dispersed with different concentrations of Corexit 9500. After three weeks of exposure, acute and chronic physiological impacts were determined. The majority of physiological responses occurred during the first seven days of exposure, with mussels exhibiting significant cytochrome P450 activity, superoxide dismutase activity and heat shock protein levels. Mussels exposed to non-dispersed oil also experienced immune suppression, reduced transcription and higher levels of mortality. After 21 days, mussels in all treatments exhibited evidence of genetic damage, tissue loss and a continued stress response. Bay mussels are useful as indicators of ecosystem health and recovery, and this study was an important step in understanding how non-dispersed oil, dispersant and dispersed oil affect the physiology of this sentinel species in Arctic/subarctic conditions.

TI  - Hybrid <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-magnetite tracer for dual modality sentinel lymph node mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accuracy of sentinel lymph node identification using radioactive tracers in non-superficial cancers can be limited by radiation shine through and low spatial resolution of detection systems such as intraoperative gamma probes. By utilising a dual radioactive/magnetic tracer, sensitive lymphoscintigraphy can be paired with high spatial resolution intraoperative magnetometer probes to improve the accuracy of sentinel node detection in cancers with complex multidirectional lymphatic drainage. Dextran-coated magnetite nanoparticles (33 nm mean hydrodynamic diameter) were labelled with Tc-99m and applied as a lymphotropic tracer in small and large animal models. The dual tracer could be radiolabelled with 98 +/- 2% efficiency after 10 min of incubation at room temperature. Biodistribution studies of the tracer were conducted in normal rats (subdermal and intravenous tail delivery, n = 3) and swine (subdermal hind limb delivery, n = 5). In rats the dual tracer migrated through four tiers of lymph node, 20 min after subdermal injection. Results from intravenous biodistribution test for radiocolloids demonstrated no aggregation in vivo, however indicated the presence of some lower-molecular weight radioactive impurities (Tc-99m-dextran). In swine, the dual tracer could be effectively used to map lymphatic drainage from hind hoof to popliteal and inguinal basins using intraoperative gamma and magnetometer probes. Of the eight primary nodes excised, eight were positively identified by gamma probe and seven by magnetometer probe. The high-purity dual tracer shows early promise for sentinel node identification in complex lymphatic environments by combining sensitive preoperative lymphoscintigraphy with a high-resolution intraoperative magnetometer probe.[GRAPHICS].

AB  - Involvement of the parathyroid glands by non-parathyroid neoplasia is an infrequent event. Rare cases of metastases to the parathyroid gland have been reported in parathyroidectomies and autopsies of patients with known solid or hematopoietic malignancies. Here, we present a case of atypical clonal plasma cells incidentally identified within a parathyroid adenoma resected for hyperparathyroidism and hypercalcemia, which served as the sentinel event for a subsequent diagnosis of plasma cell myeloma. To our knowledge, this is the only reported case of a hematopoietic malignancy involving a parathyroid adenoma and the only reported case of malignant hematopoietic cells initially detected in parathyroidectomy.

TI  - Lymph drainage of the upper limb and mammary region to the axilla: anatomical study in stillborns
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose We studied the lymphatic drainage of the upper limb and mammary region directing to the axilla to investigate whether independent pathways can be observed or whether anastomoses and shared drainage occur between them. This analysis aimed to assess the safety of axillary reverse mapping (ARM) in breast cancer treatment and to understand the development of lymphedema after sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone.Methods Seven unfixed stillborn fetuses were injected with a modified Gerota mass in the peri-areolar area, palm and dorsum of the hands, formalin fixed, and then submerged in 10% hydrogen peroxide solution. Microsurgical dissection was then performed on the subcutaneous cellular tissue of the upper limb, axillary region, and anterior thorax to expose the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes.Results The dye injected into the upper limb reached either the lateral axillary group, known to be exclusively responsible for upper limb drainage, or the anterior group, which is typically related to breast drainage. There was great proximity among the pathways and lymph nodes. Communicating lymphatic vessels among these groups of lymph nodes were also found in all studied cases.Discussion Lymphedema remains a challenging morbidity in breast cancer treatment. ARM and SLNB aim to avoid unnecessary damage to the lymphatic drainage of the upper limb. However, our anatomical study suggests that ARM may have potential oncological risks because preserved lymph nodes may harbor malignant cells due their proximity, overlapping drainage pathways, and connecting lymph vessels among lymph nodes.

T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Although much tropical ecology generally focuses on trees, grasses are fundamental for characterizing the extensive tropical grassy biomes (TGBs) and, together with the tree functional types, for determining the contrasting functional patterns of TGBs and tropical forests (TFs). To study the factors that determine African biome distribution and the transitions between them, we performed the first continental analysis to include grass and tree functional types.Location: Sub-Saharan Africa.Time period: 2000-2010.Major taxa studied: Savanna and forest trees and C-4 grasses.Methods: We combined remote-sensing data with a land cover map, using tree functional types to identify TGBs and TFs. We analysed the relationships of grass and tree cover with fire interval, rainfall annual average and seasonality.Results: In TGBs experiencing <630 mm annual rainfall, grass growth was water limited. Grass cover and fire recurrence were strongly and directly related over the entire subcontinent. Some TGBs and TFs with annual rainfall >1,200 mm had the same rainfall seasonality but displayed strongly different fire regimes.Main conclusions: Water limitation to grass growth was fundamental in the driest TGBs, acting alongside the well-known limitation to tree growth. Marked differences in fire regimes across all biomes indicated that fire was especially relevant for maintaining mesic and humid TGBs. At high rainfall, our results support the hypothesis of TGBs and TFs being alternative stable states maintained by a vegetation-fire feedback for similar climatic conditions.

TI  - Analyzing Spatiotemporal Patterns of Urbanization in Treasure Valley, Idaho, USA
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of spatiotemporal patterns of urbanization in terms of overall urban growth, growth forms (or types) and land use types contributes to an understanding of the consequences of urban growth on human health, biodiversity and natural resources, thereby providing guidance for formulating effective land use policies. In this study, we delineated spatial extent of urban area in Treasure Valley of Idaho for five different years with a decadal interval beginning in 1974 based on remote sensing data. The newly urbanized area during each change period was categorized into three growth forms: edge-expansion, infill and outlying development, and into two built-intensity classes: high and low intensity development. We applied ten class-level landscape metrics to the urban class as a whole. Results show that edge-expansion dominated the growth with more than 60% of new development for each of the four study periods. Infill and outlying growth witnessed a temporal oscillation with an alternating dominance. Despite some regularities observed in spatiotemporal patterns of urban class and urban growth forms, we concluded that diffusion and coalescence are two concurrently occurring processes of urban growth rather than two dichotomous temporal phases. Our study documented that a combined study involving patch dynamics, gradient analysis, and time-series analysis of new development, growth forms and built intensity was effective in identifying different spatiotemporal patterns and associate them to underlying processes.

TI  - Monitoring Highway Stability in Permafrost Regions with X-band Temporary Scatterers Stacking InSAR
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferograms with short wavelength (e.g., X-band) are usually prone to temporal decorrelation in permafrost regions, leading to the unavailability of sufficient high-coherence interferograms for performing conventional time series InSAR analysis. This paper proposes the utilization of temporary scatterers for the stacking InSAR method, thus enabling extraction of subsidence in a permafrost region with limited SAR images and limited high-coherence interferograms. Such method is termed as the temporary scatterers stacking InSAR (TSS-InSAR). Taking the Gonghe-Yushu highway (about 30 km), part of G214 National Highway in Qinghai province (in a permafrost region), as a case study, this TSS-InSAR approach was demonstrated in detail and implemented. With 10 TerraSAR-X images acquired during the period from May 2015 to August 2015, the subsidence along this highway was extracted. In this case the lack of a consistent number of SAR acquisitions limits the possibility to perform other conventional time series InSAR analysis. The results show that the middle part of this highway is in the thermokarst and seasonal frozen soil area, and its accumulated subsidence reach up to 10 cm in 110 days. The thawing phenomena is still the main reason for the instability of highway. The results demonstrate that the TSS-InSAR method can effectively extract the subsidence information in a challenging scenario with limited X-band SAR images and limited high-coherence interferograms, where other time series InSAR-based techniques cannot be applied in a simple way.

TI  - Spatial regression models of park and land-use impacts on the urban heat island in central Beijing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the relationship between urban land structure and land surface temperatures (LST) is important for mitigating the urban heat island (UHI). This paper explores this relationship within central Beijing, an area located within the 2nd Ring Road. The urban variables include the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized Difference Build-up Index (NDBI), the area of building footprints, the area of main roads, the area of water bodies and a gravity index for parks that account for both park size and distance. The data are captured over 8 grids of square cells (30 m, 60 m, 90 m, 120 m, 150 m, 180 m, 210 m, 240 m). The research involves: (1) estimating land surface temperatures using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, (2) building the database of urban variables, and (3) conducting regression analyses. The results show that (1) all the variables impact surface temperatures, (2) spatial regressions are necessary to capture neighboring effects, and (3) higher-order polynomial functions are more suitable for capturing the effects of NDVI and NDBI.

TI  - A game in the ritual event of the Mongolian peoples
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ritual events in each region have their own rules of a game and mythological characters, changing their functional and semantic appearance. This paper examines the rules of a "play" in modern ritual events of the Turkic-Mongolian peoples. The analysis of modern field materials in comparison with archival records for revealing a role of participants of a game in a ritual event is considered as actual and new.In ceremonial events, a ritual or sacred type of communication is realised. The depth of the sacral meaning of a sign in ritual events and accompanying texts is determined by the cultural tradition, by the nature of folklore thinking - thinking in complexes. The similarity between games and rituals was noted by many researchers. The plot of events in any rite unfolds according to a certain scenario, where game moments with scenic attributes of clothing and behaviour are agreed in advance. The whole action looks like a dramatic performance with the rules where mythological characters are of particular importance.The rite is always concerned with the establishment of links between the worlds by actualising the rules of behaviour causing an increase in semiotics. It is known that the idea of the dialogical nature of the relationship between a person and another world that is common for the folklore worldview is at the heart of the ceremonial events. The constant presence of "otherworldly" observers determines the symbolic "secret language" of shamanic texts and the game behaviour of the characters participating in the sacred event. Although there is no strict regulation of behaviour in the real space of the ritual, it is necessary to know "your place" in this situation and understand the accepted "game" codes when performing the ritual actions connected with sacral space.As a result of the study, the denotative meaning of the word is found to include the connotative semantics of the ritual complex. The ritual action episodes that were examined demonstrate that all events represent a conditional game of a magical character. These games constitute the essence of religious events that have a pragmatic function.

TI  - Geomorphology of the Al Wahbah crater at Harrat Kishb west of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this research is to conduct a geomorphic study of the Al Wahbah crater located in Harrat Kishb, west of Saudi Arabia. The crater is considered as one of the well-known national tourist places, which attracted many visitors a year. This study handles the geomorphic framework of the crater to draw a digital elevation model. It is a step to designate slopes of the crater and its surroundings, as well as other morphometric characteristics. The lithologic units of the crater and its surroundings have been updated using geologic maps and SPOT 5 (2.5 m) satellite image. The research aims also at analyzing the deposits of the crater floor through mechanical analysis of the field-collected samples. In this process, the circular floor of the crater had been classified into two halves. Then, field samples were collected from the radius of the crater at three places apart from each other. The lab analyses include porosity and hydraulic conductivity. The results of analyzing these samples disclosed high percentages of porosity. The porosity of all samples is homogeneous as well in the samples collected from the three profiles of different depths. As well the mechanical analysis indicates a regular and homogeneous grain size distribution. The current study elucidates the impact of the mutual interaction between the natural variable forming the Al Wahbah crater geomorphic system. The interaction resulted in a dynamic and complex geomorphic system along with distinctive associations of landforms and surficial deposits. The study is considered among the pioneer research efforts that tackled the Al Wahbah crater from different scientific and applications perspectives.

TI  - Assessment of the thermal response of variations in land surface around an urban area
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ancient city of Ibadan has experienced major development and this development has led to modifications of the land surface over the years. This study assessed the changes that have occurred in the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) of Ibadan city using satellite image from Landsat covering 1984, 2000 and 2016. Supervised classification scheme was done using the maximum likelihood classifier for classifying the images. The extent of change of the LULC classes was performed on the classified images using Land Change Modeller (LCM). The implication of the change in LULC on Land Surface Temperature (LST) and related indices was assessed. Over a period of 32 years (1984-2016), the area coverage of the built-up region of Ibadan increased from 11.23 to 54.64 hectares in thousands with a net change of 8%. Thick vegetation was identified as the major contributor to the increase in the built-up area thus indicating urban encroachment. The implication of this was observed in thermal hotspots distribution and increase in the average LST over Ibadan as there was a decrease in vegetated surfaces that dampen the LST and an increase in the impervious surface revealed by the impervious and built-up index. In general, this study showed the capability of impervious surface indices in depicting the variations in land use land cover around a region, majorly urban sprawl. Furthermore, the evaluation of the spectral indices showed Urban Index (UI) as the best predictor LST.

TI  - Intussusception in Young Children: Protocol for Multisite Hospital Sentinel Surveillance in India
T2  - METHODS AND PROTOCOLS
M3  - Article
AB  - India has recently introduced a rotavirus vaccine under a universal immunization program. There is limited information on intussusception, an adverse event, following immunization in children from India. We are conducting sentinel surveillance for intussusception in children aged under two years at 19 hospitals. The sentinel sites' selection followed a multistage process. The surveillance combines retrospective surveillance for 69 months and prospective surveillance for 18 months. The suspected intussusception cases shall be reviewed for capturing confirmed cases and detailed data collection and classification according to Brighton Collaboration criteria. Data shall be analysed to describe epidemiology, trends, regional and seasonal variations, clinical profiles, management modalities, and outcomes of intussusception. The combination of prospective and retrospective surveillance shall be informative about the trend of intussusception over the last seven years in India. At four sites where rotavirus vaccines have been introduced, the change in intussusception trends shall be documented. The potential association with rotavirus vaccines and other vaccines shall be assessed using case-control and self-controlled case series methodology. Results are forthcoming. The results shall support the national vaccine safety surveillance effort by providing baseline estimates of intussusception for continued monitoring. The surveillance protocol and site selection processes shall inform similar vaccine-safety surveillance in India and other developing countries.

TI  - EFFECT OF DUST AEROSOLS IN FORMING THE REGIONAL CLIMATE OF GEORGIA
T2  - SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of the dust on the climate in the Caucasus region, with a specific focus on Georgia, was investigated with a Regional Climate Model RegCM interactively coupled with a dust model. For this purpose we have executed sets of 30 years simulations (1985-2014) with and without dust effects by RegCM4.7 model with 16.7 km resolution over the Caucasus domain and with 50 km resolution encompassing most of the Sahara, the Middle East, and the Great Caucasus with adjacent regions. Results of calculations have shown that the dust aerosol is an active player in the climate system of Georgia. Mineral dust aerosol influences on temperature and aerosol optical depth spatial and temporally inhomogeneous distribution on the territory of Georgia and generally has been agreed with MODIS satellite data. Results of numerical calculations have shown that dust radiative forcing inclusion has improved simulated summer temperature. The mean annual temperature increased across the whole territory of Georgia in simulations when dust direct effect was considered.

TI  - Large scale climate oscillation impacts on temperature, precipitation and land surface phenology in Central Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Central Asia has been rapidly changing in multiple ways over the past few decades. Increases in temperature and likely decreases in precipitation in Central Asia as the result of global climate change are making one of the most arid regions in the world even more susceptible to large-scale droughts. Global climate oscillations, such as the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, have previously been linked to observed weather patterns in Central Asia. However, until now it has been unclear how the different climate oscillations act simultaneously to affect the weather and subsequently the vegetated land surface in Central Asia. We fit well-established land surface phenology models to two versions of MODIS data to identify the land surface phenology of Central Asia between 2001 and 2016. We then combine five climate oscillation indices into one regression model and identify the relative importance of each of these indices on precipitation, temperature, and land surface phenology, to learn where each climate index has the strongest influence. Our analyses illustrate that the North Atlantic Oscillation, the East Atlantic/West Russia pattern, and the AtlanticMulti-Decadal Oscillation predominantly influence temperature in the northern part of Central Asia. We also show that the Scandinavia index and the Multivariate ENSO index both reveal significant impacts on the precipitation in this region. Thus, we conclude that the land surface phenology across Central Asia is affected by several climate modes, both those that are strongly linked to far northern weather patterns and those that are forced by southern weather patterns, making this region a 'climate change hotspot' with strong spatial variations in weather patterns. We also show that regional climate patterns play a significant role in Central Asia, indicating that global climate patterns alone might not be sufficient to project weather patterns and subsequent land surface changes in this region.

TI  - Fire severity estimation in southern of the Buenos Aires province, Argentina, using Sentinel-2 and its comparison with Landsat-8
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of rural fire severity is fundamental to evaluate fire damages and to analyze recovery processes in a low-cost and efficient way. Burnt areas covering shrubs and grasslands were estimated in more than 30,000 km(2) in Argentina from December 2016 to January 2017. The study area presented in this work is located in the South of the Buenos Aires province, and it covers a semiarid area with the presence of xerophilous shrubs and grasslands. This is one of the most abundant ecosystem in Central and Southern Argentina. Field campaigns were carried out over the area affected by the fire in order to georreference the burnt plots and characterized the fire severity in 5 levels. The objective of this work is to analyze the feasibility of new satellites Sentinel-2 for fire studies, as well as provide a comparison to Landsat-8 derived results, because this mission has been one of the most used in it. Pre-fire and post-fire Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery were used to analyze different band combinations to compute a Normalized Difference Spectral Index (NDSI), as well as the difference of this index before and after the fire (dNDSI). Results show a significant correlation (R-2=0.72 and estimation error of 0.77) between dNDSI derived from Sentinel-2 and the severity levels obtained in the field campaign using bands 8a and 12 (NIR and SWIR), the same bands as used in the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). Moreover, results derived from Sentinel-2 are better than results derived from Landsat-8 (R-2=0.63 and estimation error of 0.92). Furthermore, it is observed that the correlation is improved when Sentinel-2 bands 6 and 5 (located in the Red-Edge region) are considered (R-2=0.74 and estimation error of 0.76). An inverse correlation has been observed between the recovery of vegetation four months after the fire and the fire severity level.

TI  - Fouling of ultrafiltration membranes by organic matter generated by marine algal species
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Controlling fouling in seawater reverse osmosis and ultrafiltration systems is a major challenge during algal blooms. This study investigates UF fouling potential of four marine algae and their algal organic matter (AOM): Chaetoceros affinis (Ch), Rhodomonas balthica (Rh), Tetraselmis suecica (Te), and Phaeocystis globulosa (Ph). Batch culture monitoring of the four different marine algal species showed remarkable differences in their production of biopolymers, transparent exopolymer particles (TEP) and their membrane fouling potential (MFI-UF10 kDa). MFI-UF10 kDa was linearly related to biopolymer concentration, and TEP during the growth and stationary/death phase of all four algal species. But the linear relation of MFI-UF10 kDa with algal cell density and chlorophyll-a concentration did not continue during the stationary/death phase. In experiments with capillary UF membranes, non-backwashable fouling of UF membranes varied strongly for the four different AOM solutions tested, and was linked to the presence of polysaccharides (stretching-OH) and sugar ester (stretching (SO)-O-=) groups in the AOM. The non-backwashable fouling coincided with MFI-UF150 kDa and TEP concentration. Therefore, determination of these parameters (MFI and TEP) and correlating with MODIS satellite data may generate useful information about the fouling potential of seawater at different locations during an algal bloom.

TI  - A single institute's experience on melanoma prognosis: a long-term follow-up
T2  - GIORNALE ITALIANO DI DERMATOLOGIA E VENEREOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prognosis of cutaneous melanoma is correlated to histopathologic parameters such as Breslow thickness, the presence of mitosis, ulceration and lymphatic involvement at the moment of the diagnosis. On the other hand, the prognostic value of parameters such as age, sex, and tumor localization are still a matter of debate. We evaluated herein the prognostic factors in melanoma patients during a long-term follow-up (60 months).METHODS: Melanoma patients presenting stage IB-III at diagnosis were included. Breslow thickness, ulceration, lymphatic involvement, patients' age, sex and tumor localization were correlated to patients' prognosis. Univariate Cox regressions and multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression were performed. Successively, Kaplan-Meier was used for variables significantly associated with overall melanoma survival.RESULTS: A total of 115 melanoma patients were included in this study. During follow-up 82 (72.17%) patients survived and 33 (28.7%) died. In our dataset, Breslow thickness >2 mm (P=0.0007), patients age >50 years (P=0.005) and positive sentinel lymph node (P=0.0003) seem to be the most important variables correlated with the presence of metastases at 5 years follow-up. However distant metastases were also observed during follow-up in 14/26 patients presenting negative sentinel lymph node at diagnosis.CONCLUSIONS: Given the vital importance of target drugs and the newly introduced immunotherapies in cutaneous melanoma management, we would suggest that mutational analyses should also be extended to the subgroup of patients presenting microstaging parameters related to a poor prognosis in a long-term follow-up of 60 months.

TI  - Comparison of SNAP-Derived Sentinel-2A L2A Product to ESA Product over Europe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 is a constellation of two satellites launched by the European Space Agency (ESA), respectively on 23 June 2015 and 7 March 2017, to map geophysical parameters over land surfaces. ESA provides Level 2 bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance (BOA) products (ESA-L2A) for Europe, with plans for operational global coverage, as well as the Sen2Cor (S2C) offline processor. In this study, aerosol optical thickness (AOT), precipitable water vapour (WVP) and surface reflectance from ESA-L2A products are compared with S2C output when using identical input Level 1 radiance products. Additionally, AOT and WVP are validated against reference measurement. As ESA and S2C share the same input and atmospheric correction algorithm, it was hypothesized that they should show identical validation performance and that differences between products should be negligible in comparison to the uncertainty of retrieved geophysical parameters due to radiometric uncertainty alone. Validation and intercomparison was performed for five clear-sky growing season dates for each of three ESA-L2A tiles selected to span a range of vegetation and topography as well as to be close to the AERONET measurement site. Validation of S2C (ESA) products using AERONET site measurements indicated an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.06 (0.07) and a bias of 0.05 (0.09) for AOT and 0.20 cm (0.22 cm) and the bias was -0.02 cm (-0.10 cm) for WVP. Intercomparison of S2C-L2A and ESA-L2A showed an overall agreement higher than 99% for scene classification (SCL) maps and negligible differences for WVP (RMSE under 0.09 and R-2 above 0.99). Larger disagreement was observed for aerosol optical thickness (AOT) (RMSE up to 0.04 and R-2 as low as 0.14). For BOA reflectance, disagreement between products depends on vegetation cover density, topography slope and spectral band. The largest differences were observed for red-edge and infrared bands in mountainous vegetated areas (RMSE up to 4.9% reflectance and R-2 as low as 0.53). These differences are of similar magnitude to the radiometric calibration requirements for the Sentinel 2 imager. The differences had minimal impact of commonly used vegetation indices (NDVI, NDWI, EVI), but application of the Sentinel Level 2 biophysical processor generally resulted in proportional differences in most derived vegetation parameters. It is recommended that the consistency of ESA and S2C products should be improved by the developers of the ESA and S2C processors.

TI  - Malignant melanoma-early recognition, diagnostics and aftercare
T2  - ONKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Malignant melanoma is a frequent form of skin cancer with a very high mortality. In Europe approximately 22,000 people die each year due to melanoma, of which 2700 patients in Germany alone. The incidence has shown an increasing tendency for years. Significant risk factors for the emergence of a malignant melanoma are the number of melanocytic naevi on the body, a positive family history for melanomas and a genetic predisposition.The aim of this article is to give an overview for non-dermatologists on the diagnostics, treatment, stage classification and aftercare of malignant melanoma.A selective literature search was carried out in Medline via PubMed and supplemented by personal experiences of the authors.A differentiation can be made between four clinical types of melanoma: superficial spreading melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) and nodular melanoma (NM). These types can be differentiated by the clinical phenotype, the localization and development of primaries and finally in the prognosis, which is most unfavorable for ALM and NM. For confirmation of the diagnosis and for clinical and pathological stage classification, an initial operative treatment of cutaneous melanomas is essential. The diagnostic excision of sentinal lymph nodes is recommended for a tumor thickness according to Breslow over 1mm. In cases of involvement of the sentinel lymph nodes spread diagnostics with sectional imaging should first be carried out. When an excision and follow-up excision and if necessary a sentinal lymph node biopsy have been carried out, stage-conform distribution diagnostics are recommended. The recommended aftercare of malignant melanoma is stage adapted and conforms to the current guidelines.

TI  - Remote sensing, hydrological modeling and in situ observations in snow cover research: A review
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Snow is an important component of the hydrological cycle. As a major part of the cryosphere, snow cover also represents a valuable terrestrial water resource. In the context of climate change, the dynamics of snow cover play a crucial role in rebalancing the global energy and water budgets. Remote sensing, hydrological modeling and in situ observations are three techniques frequently utilized for snow cover investigations. However, the uncertainties caused by systematic errors, scale gaps, and complicated snow physics, among other factors, limit the usability of these three approaches in snow studies. In this paper, an overview of the advantages, limitations and recent progress of the three methods is presented, and more effective ways to estimate snow cover properties are evaluated. The possibility of improving remotely sensed snow information using ground-based observations is discussed. As a rapidly growing source of volunteered geographic information (VGI), web-based geotagged photos have great potential to provide ground truth data for remotely sensed products and hydrological models and thus contribute to procedures for cloud removal, correction, validation, forcing and assimilation. Finally, this review proposes a synergistic framework for the future of snow cover research. This framework highlights the cross-scale integration of in situ and remotely sensed snow measurements and the assimilation of improved remote sensing data into hydrological models.

TI  - A modified version of the kernel-driven model for correcting the diffuse light of ground multi-angular measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - When using the kernel-driven bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to process multiangular measurements, the input multi-angular measurements must be corrected for atmospheric effects. However, in current databases, a significant number of ground-based multi-angular measurements contain either no corrections or only approximate corrections for atmospheric effects. Thus, the blended diffuse light in the total incident irradiance will result in considerable smoothing of the reflectance anisotropy retrieved by the kernel-driven model unless an atmospheric correction process is conducted. In this study, we propose a diffuse light correction (DLC) form of the kernel-driven model that improves its ability to process multi-angular measurements blended with hemispherical diffuse light. The DLC form of the kernel-driven model can be used to retrieve the intrinsic reflectance anisotropy of the observed target from atmospheric-uncorrected multi-angular measurements. This study used multi-angular data simulated by the PROSAIL and Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual objects (RAPID) BRDF model, atmospheric-corrected Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER), Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) multi-angular measurements and their simulated data based on the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S) tools to validate the effectiveness of the DLC form of the kernel-driven model. The results indicated that the reflectance factors directly retrieved by the kernel-driven model are considerably smoothed by the blended diffuse light, especially in hotspot regions. Even under clear and cloudless sky conditions, the retrieved hotspot reflectance in the red band is still underestimated by an average of 9.25%, 7.72%, 11.0% and 13.8% for the PROSAIL, RAPID, POLDER and CAR data, respectively. In contrast, the hotspot reflectance retrieved by the DLC form of the kernel-driven model is very close to the intrinsic reflectance anisotropy of the targets; the average relative by the of the DLC form of the kernel-driven model is only 1.99%, 1.50%, 4.57% and 3.42%, respectively. Although the reflectance reconstructed by the DLC form of the kernel-driven model in the hotspot region represents a considerable improvement compared with the reflectance retrieved by the original kernel-driven model, its improvement on the root mean square error (RMSE) and the bias of the entire datasets is not very apparent. Using the DLC form of the kernel-driven model can significantly improve the ability of the kernel-driven model to process multi-angular measurements blended with hemispherical diffuse irradiance.

TI  - Validation of Global Evapotranspiration Product (MOD16) Using Flux Tower Data from Panjin Coastal Wetland, Northeast China
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent advances in remote sensing technology and methods have resulted in the development of an evapotranspiration (ET) product from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16). The accuracy of this product however has not been tested for coastal wetland ecosystems. The objective of this study therefore is to validate the MOD16 ET product using data from one eddy covariance flux tower situated in the Panjin coastal wetland ecosystem within the Liaohe River Delta, Northeast China. Cumulative ET data over an eight-day period in 2005 from the flux tower was calculated to coincide with the MOD16 products across the same period. Results showed that data from the flux tower were inconsistent with that gained form the MOD16 ET. In general, results from Panjin showed that there was an underestimation of MOD16 ET in the spring and fall, with Biases of -2.27 and -3.53 mm/8d, respectively (-40.58% and -49.13% of the observed mean). Results for Bias during the summer had a range of 1.77 mm/8d (7.82% of the observed mean), indicating an overestimation of MOD16 ET. According to the RMSE, summer (6.14 mm/8d) achieved the lowest value, indicating low accuracy of the MOD16 ET product. However, RMSE (2.09 mm/8d) in spring was the same as that in the fall. Relationship between ET and its relevant meteorological parameters were analyzed. Results indicated a very good relationship between surface air temperature and ET. Meanwhile a significant relationship between wind speed and ET also existed. The inconsistent comparison of MOD16 and flux tower-based ET are mainly attributed to the parameterization of the Penman-Monteith model, flux tower measurement errors, and flux tower footprint vs. MODIS pixels.

TI  - Application of biosensors to detection of epidemic diseases in animals
T2  - RESEARCH IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Epidemic diseases are the leading cause of animal mortality, resulting in significant losses to the agricultural economy. These economic impacts have generated a strong interest in advancing methods for the diagnosis and control of epidemic diseases in animals. Conventional methods are often time-consuming (typically result is available in 2-10 days), expensive, and require both large-scale equipment and experienced personnel. However, the advent of biosensor technology has ushered in a new and promising approach for the diagnosis of animal diseases. With advantages that include simplicity, real time analysis, high sensitivity, miniaturization, rapid detection time, and low cost, biosensor technologies are under active development for the diagnosis of epidemic diseases in animals. Here, we summarize recent developments in biological sensing technologies used to detect infectious viral, bacterial, and parasitic diseases. Additionally, we discuss research challenges and future prospects for this field of study.

TI  - Diurnal Cycle of Rainfall and Winds near the South Coast of China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The characteristics and mechanisms of diurnal rainfall and winds near the south coast of China are explored using satellite data (CMORPH), long-term hourly WRF Model data (Du model data), a simple 2D linear model, and 2D idealized simulations. Both the CMORPH and Du model data indicate that the diurnal cycle of rainfall has two propagation modes near the coast: onshore and offshore. The diurnally periodic winds (vertical motions) also show a similar propagation feature. Analysis of the rainfall budget indicates that vertically integrated vertical vapor advection plays a key role in the diurnal cycle of rainfall and thus provides a physical connection between winds and rainfall in the diurnal cycle. It was found that a simple 2D linear land-sea breeze model with a background wind can well capture the two propagation modes, which are associated with inertia-gravity waves, in terms of speed and phase. The background wind changes the pattern of the inertia-gravity waves and further affects the diurnal propagation. The effect of the background wind on the diurnal propagation was verified through idealized simulations using a simplified version of the WRF Model that can also capture the diurnal features.

AB  - Accurate and reliable soil organic carbon stock estimation is critical in understanding forest role to regional carbon cycles. So far, the total carbon pool in dry Miombo ecosystems is often under-estimated. In that regard this study sought to model the relationship between the aboveground woody carbon pool and the soil carbon pool, using both ground-based and remote sensing methods. To achieve this objective, the Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) computed from the newly launched Landsat 8 OLI satellite data were used. Correlation and regression analysis were used to relate Soil Organic Carbon (S.O.C), aboveground woody carbon and remotely sensed vegetation indices. Results showed a soil organic carbon in the upper soil layer (0-15 cm) was positively correlated with aboveground woody carbon and this relationship was significant (r = 0.678; P < 0.05) aboveground carbon. However, there were no significant correlations (r = -0.11, P > 0.05) between SOC in the deeper soil layer (15-30 cm) and aboveground woody carbon. These findings imply that (relationship between aboveground woody carbon and S.O.C) aboveground woody carbon stocks can be used as a proxy to estimate S.O.C in the top soil layer (0-15 cm) in dry Miombo ecosystems. Overall, these findings underscore the potential and significance of remote sensing data in understanding savanna ecosystems contribution to the global carbon cycle.

TI  - Axillary surgery in breast cancer: the beginning of the end
T2  - MINERVA CHIRURGICA
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary surgery in breast cancer patients has shifted from more extensive to minimalist approaches with re-evaluation of the risks versus benefits of available treatment options which are increasingly tailored to individual patient characteristics. A radical axillary node dissection is rarely indicated nowadays due to several factors including screening with detection of small node negative cancers, introduction of targeted node sampling, less reliance on information from nodal staging for adjuvant therapy decision making and evidence that non-surgical treatments such as systemic therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, biological therapy) together with radiotherapy can safely treat low burden axillary disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone with omission of further axillary surgery for nodal macrometastases (> 2 mm) might be sufficiently extirpative to achieve local control when combined with adjuvant treatments. There remain unanswered questions on the safety of SLNB post chemotherapy in patients with biopsy-proven nodal disease at presentation and whether omission of axillary node dissection is feasible in selected cases. Emerging evidence suggests that a complete radiological response with removal of at least 3 nodes (including clipped nodes at time of biopsy) can yield false negative rates of < 10% and be a safe option.New technologies involving percutaneous biopsy of sentinel nodes under radiological guidance are under investigation and could potentially replace surgical staging of the axilla in the future. Moreover, omission of any type of node biopsy might be a potential option in more favorable tumors and could herald the beginning of the end for histological axillary sampling in selected cases.

TI  - Monitoring the eutrophication using Landsat 8 in the Boka Kotorska Bay
T2  - ACTA ADRIATICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a methodology for monitoring concentrations of chlorophyll a (Chl-a) and the state of eutrophics in small bays or in the immediate vicinity of the coast. This kind of monitoring is of interest since such areas have not been addressed well using the usual satellite methods (such as MODIS) due to inadequate spatial resolution. We present an estimation approach for Chl-a concentration based on Landsat 8 (L8) satellite images using the ground truth (GT) data for the day of overflight. Additionally, two classifiers (daily and yearly) of the state of eutrophication, that use the Chl-a estimated values, are presented. The accuracy of the proposed method is evaluated using the leave-one-out cross validation, and it is within limits theoretically expected of an L8-based approach. The results from the classifiers are compared with the GT data and it is shown that daily classifier is able to classify the area of interest with an incidence of false positives less than 2%.

TI  - Gordon Brown, Alistair Darling, and the Great Financial Crisis: Leadership traits and policy responses
T2  - BRITISH POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Gordon Brown's management of the Great Financial Crisis was one of the few successes of his premiership and was seen as a distinctly personal triumph. Yet, in the aftermath of the crisis, Brown's leadership led to a damaging split on economic policy with his Chancellor, Alistair Darling. To explain the role of Brown and Darling in the crisis and its aftermath, this article uses quantitative content analysis of speech to develop leadership trait profiles of both men. Both leaders score high in proactive beliefs; Brown especially had great faith in his ability to shape economic matters. Brown scores consistently higher than Darling in the use of power imagery, whilst the Chancellor maintained a significantly more complex worldview than the Prime Minister. Although many factors contributed to the turmoil and ultimate demise of the Brown government, the personality of the Prime Minister, and the clash of policy beliefs and decision-making style with his Chancellor, played a key role. This indicates that explanations of economic crises should include analysis of the policy preferences and decision-making styles of the leaders who manage them. Further, studies of the leadership styles of political leaders, which usually focus solely on the predominant leader, should instead examine interactions and conflicts amongst the several personalities at the top of a government.

TI  - CD8<SUP>+</SUP>CXCR5<SUP>+</SUP> T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes are highly activated and predict better prognosis in colorectal cancer
T2  - HUMAN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are the primary sites of tumor antigen presentation, as well as the origin of metastasis in most cases. Hence, the type and function of immune cells in TDLNs are critical to the micro environment and potentially affect the clinical outcome of the malignancy. CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells are recently described to present high effector functions in infectious diseases, but their role in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. In forty-four Stage III CRC patients, we examined the CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells in blood, tumor, and TDLN. CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells represented lass than 2% of CD3(+) T cells in blood, but a much larger population in tumor. In TDLN, the CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells represented the vast majority of CD8(+) T cells and between 9.3% and 32.9% of CD3(+) T cells. The prevalence of CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells in tumor was not associated with their frequency in peripheral blood, but was positively correlated with their frequency in TDLN. The transcription of effector genes, including IFNG, TNF, IL2, PRF1, and GZMB, and exhaustion markers, including PD1, TIM3, 2B4, and LAG3, were examined in CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells and CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells. With a few exceptions, CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cell presented significantly higher effector gene expression, and significantly lower exhaustion marker expression than their CXCR5(-) counterparts. In addition, the prognosis of CRC patients was positively associated with the frequency of TDLN CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells, and with the expression of IFNG, PRF1, and GZMB expression by tumor and TDLN CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells. Together, these results demonstrated that CD8(+)CXCR5(+) T cells were significant participants of CRC-associated immunity and could potentially serve as therapeutic options.

TI  - Wheat yield prediction in Andalucia using MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) time series
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a relationship between net primary production of wheat and vegetation indices obtained from satellite imaging. Most wheat production studies use the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to estimate the production and yield of wheat and other crops. On the one hand, few studies use the MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) to determine crop yield and production on a regional level. This is possibly due to a lack of continuity of MERIS. On the other hand, the emergence of Sentinel 2 open new possibilities for the research and application of MTCI. This study has built two empirical models to estimate wheat production and yield in Andalusia. To this end, the study used the complete times series (weekly images from 2006-2011) of the MTCI vegetation index from the Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) sensor associated with the Andalusian yearbook for agricultural and fishing statistics (AEAP-Anuario de estadisticas agrarias y pesqueras de Andalucia). In order to build these models, the optimal development period for the plant needed to be identified, as did the time-based aggregation of MTCI values using said optimal period as a reference, and relation with the index, with direct observations of production and yield through spatial aggregation using coverage from the Geographic Information System for Agricultural Parcels (SIGPAC-Sistema de informacion geografica de parcelas agricolas) and requests for common agricultural policy (CAP) assistance. The obtained results indicate a significant association between the MTCI index and the production and yield data collected by AEAP at the 95% confidence level (R-2=0.81 and R-2=0.57, respectively).

TI  - Value and best way for detection of Sentinel lymph node in early stage endometrial cancer: Selective lymphadenectomy algorithm
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The cornerstone of treatment for endometrial carcinoma is total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophoprectomy. Pelvic lymphadenectomy, with or without para-aortic lymphadenectomy, plays an important role in the surgical staging of endometrial carcinoma, and provides more accurate prognostic information.Aims: We aimed to evaluate the value and techniques for SLN mapping in early stage endometrial cancer with low risk for lymph node metastasis and whether selective or systematic lymphadenectomy is needed according to the results of proposed algorithm.Method: Between June 2016 and June 2017, 120 patients with early stage endometrial cancer with low risk for nodal metastasis underwent surgical staging. Patients were classified equally according to SLN mapping technique used for injecting the methylene blue dye. Group A included hysteroscopic guided methylene blue injection, Group B included transcervical injection, Group C included subserosal uterine injection and Group D included combined transcervical and subserosal injection. Blue lymph nodes and enlarged suspicious whether stained or non stained ones were dissected for frozen section evaluation done then bilateral pelvic node dissection was done and tissues were sent for pathological examination.Results: Clinical and pathological SLN detection were more with hysteroscopic technique than others and pathological detection was lower than clinical detection in all techniques. Metastatic disease was more common in nodes with suspicious appearance. About 10% of negative suspicious and mapped nodes were associated with positive other nodes for metastasis.Conclusion: SLN in endometrial cancer has a role in staging of endometrial cancer with best technique for detection, hysteroscopic guided blue dye injection. SLN can be used in patients with low risk for lymph node metastasis for selective lymphadenectomy. Blue dye labelling using methylene blue dye is good in low resource countries as it is cheap. We recommended the following algorithm for surgical staging in early endometrial cancer with better results than using SLN alone. Stage I type 1, grade 1,2 endometrial cancer should undergo surgical staging with initial evaluation of the peritoneum which if affected, it is stage III with no need for lymphadenectomy. Then, dissection of the blue and suspicious nodes which if any is positive on frozen section, selective same side pelvic and paraaortic nodal dissection should be done. If they are negative, no need for lymphadenectomy. This approach can help patients to avoid the side effects associated with a complete lymphadenectomy. The higher rate of detection using this algorithm is related to combining the suspicions nodes with the stained ones. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pediatric sudden death is a devastating problem worsened by the fact that the death may have been preventable. Sudden cardiac death (SCD) defined as unexplained death within 1 hour after the onset of witnessed symptoms or within 24 hours from the moment when the decedent was last seen alive in the absence of symptoms or any obvious non-cardiac causes. Pediatric sudden cardiac arrest can result from a variety of cardiac conditions such as genetic/heritable, trauma, or use of medications/drugs. The sentinel event can be fatal. Fortunately, not all cases are fatal and suspicion may be evoked by symptoms, known family history, or findings on physical examination. Understanding these features and appropriate referral can improve survival. Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is a highly malignant inheritable cardiac channelopathy associated with the potentially life-threatening catecholamine-mediated ventricular arrhythmias triggered by stress or exertion. CPVT constitutes a substantial portion of pediatric SCD, therefore recognition and correct management are of vital importance. The past decade and a half has provided exciting new discoveries elucidating the genetic etiology and pathophysiology of CPVT. This knowledge improves our approach to diagnosis and management of the disease. In this article we bring the tragic story of a little girl who died suddenly due to CPVT. We try to summarize our understanding of the genetic etiology, the molecular pathogenesis and the current approach to diagnosis and management of CPVT.

M3  - Article
AB  - The TerraSAR-X (TSX) mission provides a distinguished collection of high resolution satellite images that shows great promise for a global monitoring of human settlements. Hence, the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed the Urban Footprint Processor (UFP) that represents an operational framework for the mapping of built-up areas based on a mass processing and analysis of TSX imagery. The UFP includes functionalities for data management, feature extraction, unsupervised classification, mosaicking, and post-editing. Based on >180.000 TSX StripMap scenes, the UFP was used in 2016 to derive a global map of human presence on Earth in a so far unique spatial resolution of 12 m per grid cell: the Global Urban Footprint (GUF). This work provides a comprehensive summary of the major achievements related to the Global Urban Footprint initiative, with dedicated sections focusing on aspects such as UFP methodology, basic product characteristics (specification, accuracy, global figures on urbanization derived from GUF), the user community, and the already initiated future roadmap of follow-on activities and products. The active community of >250 institutions already working with the GUF data documents the relevance and suitability of the GUF initiative and the underlying high-resolution SAR imagery with respect to the provision of key information on the human presence on earth and the global human settlements properties and patterns, respectively.

M3  - Article
AB  - The use of routinely recorded data for research purposes and disease surveillance is an attractive proposition. However, this requires that the validity and reliability of the data be evaluated for the purpose for which they are to be used. This manuscript reports an evaluation of milk shipment data for evaluating their usefulness in disease monitoring and the resilience of organic and conventional dairy herds in Sweden. A large number of inconsistencies were observed in the data, necessitating substantial efforts to "clean" the data. Given that the selection of rules used in the cleaning process was subjective in nature, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine if different cleaning routines produced substantially different results. Despite the cleaning efforts we observed far more large residuals at the shipment level than expected. Thus, it was concluded that the data were too "noisy" to be used for identification of short term impacts on milk production.Resilience was evaluated by examining the residual variance in milk shipped per cow per day under the assumption that herds with high resilience would have lower residual variance. The effects on residual variance of organic status or whether or not the herd used an automatic milking system were evaluated in models in which the residual variance was stratified or not by these factors. We did not find consistent evidence to suggest that organic herds had higher resilience than conventional herds, but this could be partly due to using residual variance as the measure indicating resilience.

TI  - Analysis of volatile aroma components from Mantou fermented by different starters
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOD PROCESSING AND PRESERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This work determines the aroma components in the Mantou fermented by different starters, which were extracted by solid-phase microextraction and then detected by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC-MS). These volatile components were also measured by electroinc nose. The GC-MS results indicated that 21, 48, 39, 38, 47, and 42 kinds of volatile compounds were detected from Mantou made by Angel low-sugar high-activity dry yeast (DY1), Angel high-sugar-intolerance high-activity dry yeast (DY2), high-activity fresh yeast Angel (FY), baking powder (BP), sourdough starter (SS), and mixed starter (MIX). Esters and heterocyclic benzene were the major substances which contributed to the flavor of Mantou. Ethanol and octadecyl vinyl ether, were found only in DY1 and DY2, respectively. Linoleic acid was detected only in the SS and MIX samples, whereas anethole was found only in SS and MIX samples. Ethyl palmitate was observed from Mantou processed with three starters of DY2, SS, and MIX. Mantou made with baking powder and other types of starters can be distinguished in terms of their obviously different aroma components by principal component analysis method.Practical applicationsIn this work, the flavor compounds and principal component analysis in Mantou made by five different types of starters were compared with that of sourdough starter. The results showed that Mantou made by different starters yield very different flavor characteristics. This work would lay a theoretical foundation for the production of novel starters in the future.

TI  - Spatial Dynamics and Structure of Human Disturbed Mangrove Forests in Contrasting Coastal Communities in Eastern Africa
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial dynamics and structure of mangrove forests in peri-urban, rural and rural island settings in Mozambique was investigated to test the hypothesis that peri-urban forests are more impacted. LandSat images from 1991, 2002 and 2013 were analysed for changes in area cover and forest structural data were collected in the field. At the peri-urban site, mangrove cover increased by 22.7%, while at the rural site 23.2% were lost. The small area of the rural island was not assessed, but losses are expected given the high density of stumps. All forests are structurally small, with height and diameter of species varying significantly among sites (p < 0.001). The forest complexity index varied from 1.61 (rural island), to 0.90 (peri-urban) and 0.39 (rural). The communities harvested all diameter classes at the rural island, while class 5.1-8 cm was preferred at the peri-urban and rural sites. The proportion of stumps:live trees were 1:11 (peri-urban site); 1:9 (rural) and 1:4 (rural island). The proportions of regenerating classes were 16:4:1 (peri-urban); 76:16:1 (rural) and 8:1:0 (rural island). This study provided important insights to mangrove forest structure and uses in an understudied region and showed that management plans are required at all sites for sustainable use.

TI  - Impact of satellite imagery spatial resolution on land use classification accuracy and modeled water quality
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing offers an increasingly wide array of imagery with a broad variety of spectral and spatial resolution, but there are relatively few comparisons of how different sources of data impact the accuracy, cost, and utility of analyses. We evaluated the impact of satellite image spatial resolution (1m from Digital Globe; 30m from Landsat) on land use classification via ArcGIS Feature Analyst, and on total suspended solids (TSS) load estimates from the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Camboriu watershed in Southeastern Brazil. We independently calibrated SWAT models, using both land use map resolutions and short-term daily streamflow (discharge) and TSS load data from local gauge stations. We then compared the predicted TSS loads with monitoring data outside the model training period. We also estimated the cost difference for land use classification and SWAT model construction and calibration at these two resolutions. Finally, we assessed the value of information (VOI) of the higher-resolution imagery in estimating the cost-effectiveness of watershed conservation in reducing TSS at the municipal water supply intake. Land use classification accuracy was 82.3% for 1m data and 75.1% for 30m data. We found that models using 1m data better predicted both annual and peak TSS loads in the full study area, though the 30m model did better in a sub-watershed. However, the 1m data incurred considerably higher costs relative to the 30m data ($7000 for imagery, plus additional analyst time). Importantly, the choice of spatial resolution affected the estimated return on investment (ROI) in watershed conservation for the municipal water company that finances much of this conservation, although it is unlikely that this would have affected the company's decision to invest in the program. We conclude by identifying key criteria to assist in choosing an appropriate spatial resolution for different contexts.

TI  - Modelling hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes in basins with large semi-arid wetlands
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological and hydrodynamic models are core tools for simulation of large basins and complex river systems associated to wetlands. Recent studies have pointed towards the importance of online coupling strategies, representing feedbacks between floodplain inundation and vertical hydrology. Especially across semi-arid regions, soil-floodplain interactions can be strong. In this study, we included a two-way coupling scheme in a large scale hydrological-hydrodynamic model (MGB) and tested different model structures, in order to assess which processes are important to be simulated in large semi-arid wetlands and how these processes interact with water budget components. To demonstrate benefits from this coupling over a validation case, the model was applied to the Upper Niger River basin encompassing the Niger Inner Delta, a vast semi-arid wetland in the Sahel Desert. Simulation was carried out from 1999 to 2014 with daily TMPA 3B42 precipitation as forcing, using both in-situ and remotely sensed data for calibration and validation. Model outputs were in good agreement with discharge and water levels at stations both upstream and downstream of the Inner Delta (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) > 0.6 for most gauges), as well as for flooded areas within the Delta region (NSE = 0.6; r = 0.85). Model estimates of annual water losses across the Delta varied between 20.1 and 30.6 km(3)/yr, while annual evapotranspiration ranged between 760 mm/yr and 1130 mm/yr. Evaluation of model structure indicated that representation of both floodplain channels hydrodynamics (storage, bifurcations, lateral connections) and vertical hydrological processes (floodplain water infiltration into soil column; evapotranspiration from soil and vegetation and evaporation of open water) are necessary to correctly simulate flood wave attenuation and evapotranspiration along the basin. Two-way coupled models are necessary to better understand processes in large semi-arid wetlands. Finally, such coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic modelling proves to be an important tool for integrated evaluation of hydrological processes in such poorly gauged, large scale basins. We hope that this model application provides new ways forward for large scale model development in such systems, involving semi-arid regions and complex floodplains.

TI  - High immunogenicity of red blood cell antigens restricted to the population of African descent in a cohort of sickle cell disease patients
T2  - TRANSFUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDSickle cell disease (SCD) patients undergo multiple red blood cell (RBC) transfusions and are regularly exposed to low-prevalence (LP) antigens specific to individuals of African descent. This study evaluated the prevalence of antibodies against LP antigens in SCD patients and the need to identify these antibodies in everyday practice.STUDY DESIGN AND METHODSPlasma from 211 SCD patients was tested with RBCs expressing the following LP antigens: RH10 (V), RH20 (VS), RH23 (D-W), RH30 (Go(a)), KEL6 (Js(a)), and MNS6 (He).RESULTSNine LP antibodies were found in eight patients (3.8%): five anti-RH23, two anti-RH30, and two anti-MNS6. The exposure risk, calculated for each LP antigen, was below 3% per RBC unit, for all antigens tested. Thus, in this cohort of transfused SCD patients, the prevalence of LP antibodies was similar to that of antibodies against antigens of the FY, JK, and MNS blood group systems. These findings also reveal the occurrence of anti-RH23 in SCD patients. No anti-RH20 or anti-KEL6 were found, despite the high frequency of mismatch situations.CONCLUSIONThese results highlight the immunogenicity of these LP antigens, and the evanescence of antibodies against LP antigens. They also highlight the importance of appropriate pretransfusion testing for patients frequently transfused, who are likely to be exposed to multiple types of blood group antigens.

TI  - Climate Sensitivity of High Arctic Permafrost Terrain Demonstrated by Widespread Ice-Wedge Thermokarst on Banks Island
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice-wedge networks underlie polygonal terrain and comprise the most widespread form of massive ground ice in continuous permafrost. Here, we show that climate-driven thaw of hilltop ice-wedge networks is rapidly transforming uplands across Banks Island in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Change detection using high-resolution WorldView images and historical air photos, coupled with 32-year Landsat reflectance trends, indicate broad-scale increases in ponding from ice-wedge thaw on hilltops, which has significantly affected at least 1500 km(2) of Banks Island and over 3.5% of the total upland area. Trajectories of change associated with this upland ice-wedge thermokarst include increased micro-relief, development of high-centred polygons, and, in areas of poor drainage, ponding and potential initiation of thaw lakes. Millennia of cooling climate have favoured ice-wedge growth, and an absence of ecosystem disturbance combined with surface denudation by solifluction has produced high Arctic uplands and slopes underlain by ice-wedge networks truncated at the permafrost table. The thin veneer of thermally-conductive mineral soils strongly links Arctic upland active-layer responses to summer warming. For these reasons, widespread and intense ice-wedge thermokarst on Arctic hilltops and slopes contrast more muted responses to warming reported in low and subarctic environments. Increasing field evidence of thermokarst highlights the inherent climate sensitivity of the Arctic permafrost terrain and the need for integrated approaches to monitor change and investigate the cascade of environmental consequences.

TI  - The evolution of mastectomy surgical technique: from mutilation to medicine
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast surgeries for cancer and tumors were first described approximately 3,000 years ago, and since that time the standard of management has changed dramatically. From Egyptian papyri to Hippocratic theory, from Galen's dissections to Halsted's radical mastectomy, and from sentinel lymph node mapping to the development of nipple-sparing mastectomies, this review starts at the beginning and highlights breakthroughs and innovation in technique and medicine that have fundamentally changed the way breast cancer is managed. The progression depicted in this review acts as a proxy to the management of other complex diseases. Breast cancer was initially managed with operative extirpation alone, but now requires a multidisciplinary team across various surgical, medical, psychological, and social specialties in order to produce the best outcomes for our patients.

TI  - Ischemic Stroke Risk in Medicare Beneficiaries with Central Retinal Artery Occlusion: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - OPHTHALMOLOGY AND THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: To determine the incidence of ischemic cerebral stroke in the 6-month periods preceding and following acute central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) among Medicare beneficiaries.Methods: A retrospective cohort study with comparison group conducted for calendar year 2013. Patients with CRAO were identified through National Medicare limited inpatient and institutional outpatient datasets for emergency services using ICD-9-CM code for CRAO (362.31). Patients with hip fractures (ICD-9-CM 820-820.9) during the same time period served as controls. Interval incident rates of ischemic stroke were determined from time-coded diagnoses of CRAO and hip fracture (index date zero) to date of principal discharge diagnosis of ischemic stroke (ICD-9-CM 434) recorded in the Medicare inpatient dataset. Risk of stroke was examined by comparing incidence among the two cohorts preceding and following the sentinel events.Results: There were 3338 patients with CRAOs during 2013. The incidence of ischemic stroke peaked the second week following CRAO relative to patients with hip fracture (relative incidence = 33.1 [95% confidence interval 9.8-84.6]).Conclusions: Medicare beneficiaries who present to emergency rooms with CRAO or are hospitalized directly for this condition were at highest risk of ischemic stroke in the first 2 weeks following the ocular diagnosis. Patients with acute CRAO should be promptly evaluated for stroke and stroke prevention.

T2  - ISIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Translations between languages that are grammatically and culturally distant reveal that translated texts are not the source but, rather, the result of an already ongoing process of conceptual transformation. Looking at the processes behind early nineteenth-century Japanese translations of Dutch works on barometers and thermometers, this essay argues that a translator's task is first and foremost to construct a conceptual world that makes space for radically different forms of knowledge. The essay explores the processes that occur before the appearance of textual translation by tracing Japanese translators' attempts to interpret foreign devices according to a worldview rooted in Chinese natural philosophy, as well as their experimentation with devices and their exploration of European concepts described in Jesuit writings in Classical Chinese. The essay argues that these processes brought about changes to the conceptual world of early nineteenth-century Japan and subsequently transformed the Japanese and Chinese languages.

TI  - Evolution in Europe of African swine fever genotype II viruses from highly to moderately virulent
T2  - VETERINARY MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since its arrival in the Caucasus and Russia in 2007, African swine fever virus (ASFV) has spread widely and has now affected the EU countries of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and, more recently, the Czech Republic and Romania. The ever-increasing evidence of seropositive wild boar in certain areas suggests that some animals may be surviving for some time or could even be recovering from the disease. This could be due to acquired immunity after the primary infection and/or the presence of related viruses of reduced virulence. To assess these hypotheses, two ASFV field strains from Estonia were studied in vivo in two groups of domestic pigs. After an incubation period of 4 +/- 1.6 days, the pigs inoculated intramuscularly with Es15/WB-Tartu 14 ASFV (group 2) developed clinical signs associated with acute disease and succumbed 7 and 11 days post infection (dpi). Pigs inoculated with Es15/WB-Valga-14 ASFV (group 1) had longer incubation times (8 days) than those in group 2 and developed variable clinical signs and lesions compatible with subacute and chronic forms of ASF; they succumbed at 11 and 25 dpi. The in-contact pigs in both groups became infected 7-14 days after exposure and exhibited variable clinical manifestations and pathological findings ranging from acute to chronic disease. Two animals per group recovered completely after infection and were protected against a subsequent homologous virus challenge-exposure performed at 78 dpi. Under experimental conditions, no transmission occurred from the survivors to susceptible sentinel pigs housed together with the survivors 137 days after the primary infection.

TI  - Embolic protection devices for transcatheter aortic valve replacement
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CARDIO-THORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a major advancement in the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis in elderly high-risk patients. Implementing TAVR also in younger intermediate-or low-risk patients increases interest in the possibility of further lowering the risk of perioperative cerebrovascular events. To this aim, some embolic protection devices (EPDs) have been developed, some of which have already been approved for clinical use. Nevertheless, the cause of cerebrovascular events after TAVR is multifactorial, and selection of patients who would benefit from EPD is crucial to further improve outcomes, survival rate and quality of life. We reviewed the available literature in order to assess the incidence of and the mechanisms responsible for neurological events that can occur during TAVR, and we analysed clinical results and imaging findings following EPD use. Clinical trials for Embrella, TriGuard, Sentinel and Embol-X devices were designed to test their safety and their ability to prevent neurological complications in patients having TAVR. So far, published results showed that EPD may help in reducing the volume and size of periprocedural silent ischaemic brain lesions identified on magnetic resonance images but not in reducing the incidence of new lesions and new neurological events. The clinical impact of EPD in lowering the number of transient ischaemic attacks/strokes during TAVR needs to be further investigated in randomized trials.

TI  - A New Single-Band Pixel-by-Pixel Atmospheric Correction Method to Improve the Accuracy in Remote Sensing Estimates of LST. Application to Landsat 7-ETM+
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring Land Surface Temperature (LST) from satellite remote sensing requires an accurate correction of the atmospheric effects. Although thermal remote sensing techniques have advanced significantly over the past few decades, to date, single-band pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction of full thermal images is unsolved. In this work, we introduce a new Single-Band Atmospheric Correction (SBAC) tool that provides pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction parameters regardless of the pixel size. The SBAC tool uses National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP) profiles as inputs and, as a novelty, it also accounts for pixel elevation through a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Application of SBAC to 19 Landsat 7-ETM+ scenes shows the potential of the proposed pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction to capture terrain orography or atmospheric variability within the scene. LST estimation yields negligible bias and an RMSE of +/- 1.6 K for the full dataset. The Landsat Atmospheric Correction Tool (ACT) is also considered for comparison. SBAC-ACT LST deviations are analyzed in terms of distance to the image center, surface elevation, and spatial distribution of the atmospheric water content. Differences within 3 K are observed. These results give us the first insight of the potential of SBAC for the operational pixel-by-pixel atmospheric correction of full thermal images. The SBAC tool is expected to help users of satellite single-channel thermal sensors to improve their LST estimates due to its simplicity and robustness.

TI  - Determining spatio-temporal variations of ecological water consumption by natural oases for sustainable water resources allocation in a hyper-arid endorheic basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural oases, including desert riparian vegetation and terminal lakes, play an important role in maintaining the stability and development of endorheic river systems in arid areas. Determining the ecological water consumption (EWC) of natural oases is a critical task for achieving sustainable ecosystem restoration and services in endorheic basins. In this study, the evapotranspiration of natural vegetation, evaporation of water area, and seepage in lakes and rivers were considered in the EWC. The Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) model was combined with Landsat-8 images and eddy covariance flux measurements to calculate the daily EWC of natural oases in the lower Heihe River Basin (northwest China) during 2014 and 2015. The spatio-temporal variations of EWC were investigated in detail. The SEBS model could satisfactorily simulate the evapotranspiration (ET) of forest, shrub, mixed forest and water body with R-2 value greater than 0.84 and RMSE value less than 0.9 mm/day. The total EWC in 2014 and 2015 was 6.59 x 10(8 )m(3) and 7.65 x 10(8) m(3) , respectively, and the EWC of the Ejina Oasis accounted for approximately 50% of total value in the study area. The cumulative EWC increased gradually with the distance away from the riverbank as an exponential function and reached the plateau at certain distance. The monthly variation of EWC followed a unimodal curve with the peak in June and July, accounting for 42.16% and 36.28% of annual EWC in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The water balance analysis indicated that the river flow was not sufficient to provide the EWC of natural oases and water requirements of agriculture and social economy, and additional 1.23 x 10(8 )m(3) and 2.09 x 10(8) m(3) of groundwater needed to be exploited in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Several strategies for sustainable water resources allocation and ecosystem management in the study area were provided. Overall, this study provides an integrated approach with combinations of multiple techniques and high-resolution data for EWC calculation, which is useful for water footprint analysis and water resources management on the basin scale in arid areas.

TI  - Adaptive Unscented Kalman Filter Phase Unwrapping Method and Its Application on Gaofen-3 Interferometric SAR Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Phase unwrapping (PU) is a key step in the reconstruction of digital elevation models (DEMs) and the monitoring of surface deformation from interferometric synthetic aperture radar (SAR, InSAR) data. In this paper, an improved PU method that combines an amended matrix pencil model, an adaptive unscented kalman filter (AUKF), an efficient quality-guided strategy based on heapsort, and a circular median filter is proposed. PU theory and the existing UKFPU method are covered. Then, the improved method is presented with emphasis on the AUKF and the circular median filter. AUKF has been well used in other fields, but it is for the first time applied to interferometric images PU, to the best of our knowledge. First, the amended matrix pencil model is used to estimate the phase gradient. Then, an AUKF model is used to unwrap the interferometric phase based on an efficient quality-guided strategy based on heapsort. Finally, the key results are obtained by filtering the results using a circular median. The proposed method is compared with the minimum cost network flow (MCF), statistical cost network flow (SNAPHU), regularized phase tracking technique (RPTPU), and UKFPU methods using two sets of simulated data and two sets of experimental GF-3 SAR data. The improved method is shown to yield the greatest accuracy in the interferometric phase maps compared to the methods considered in this paper. Furthermore, the improved method is shown to be the most robust to noise and is thus most suitable for PU of GF-3 SAR data in high-noise and low-coherence regions.

TI  - Estimation of Burned Area in the Northeastern Siberian Boreal Forest from a Long-Term Data Record (LTDR) 1982-2015 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A Bayesian classifier mapped the Burned Area (BA) in the Northeastern Siberian boreal forest (70 degrees N 120 degrees E-60 degrees N 170 degrees E) from 1982 to 2015. The algorithm selected the 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km) Long-Term Data Record (LTDR) version 3 and 4 data sets to generate 10-day BA composites. Landsat-TM scenes of the entire study site in 2002, 2010, and 2011 assessed the spatial accuracy of this LTDR-BA product, in comparison to Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD45A1 and MCD64A1 BA products. The LTDR-BA algorithm proves a reliable source to quantify BA in this part of Siberia, where comprehensive BA remote sensing products since the 1980s are lacking. Once grouped by year and decade, this study explored the trends in fire activity. The LTDR-BA estimates contained a high interannual variability with a maximum of 2.42 million ha in 2002, an average of 0.78 million ha/year, and a standard deviation of 0.61 million ha. Going from 6.36 in the 1980s to 10.21 million ha BA in the 2010s, there was a positive linear BA trend of approximately 1.28 million ha/decade during these last four decades in the Northeastern Siberian boreal forest.

TI  - Field evidences showing rapid frontal degeneration of the Kangriz glacier, western Himalayas, Jammu & Kashmir
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Life cycle of glaciers in the Himalayan region has notably changed due to the climatic variability since last few decades. Glaciers across the world and specially the Himalayan glaciers have shown large scale degeneration in the last few decades. Himalayan glaciers serve as an important fresh water resource for the downstream communities, who are dependent on this water for domestic and other purposes. Therefore, glacier shrinkage and the associated hydrological changes pose a significant problem for regional-scale water budgets and resource management. These issues necessitate the regular and rigorous monitoring of the wastage pattern of the Himalayan glaciers in field and using satellite remote sensing data. In this work, we report rapid and enhanced degeneration of the frontal part of the Kangriz glacier, Jammu and Kashmir (J & K), in terms of surface melting, debris cover, snout characteristics and meltwater discharge. Ablation data acquired during 2016-2017 shows the average lowering of the frontal part of the glacier to be similar to 148 +/- 34 cm, one-third of which was found to have occurred within a 13 day time period in September, 2017. Also, the quantum of ice melt was found to be inversely influenced (r = -0.84) by the debris thickness. 15 day meltwater discharge measurement revealed its strong relationship with snout disintegration pattern, evidenced twice during the said time period. Volume of water discharged from the glacier was estimated to be 7.91x10(6) m(3) for the measurement duration. Also, mean daily discharge estimated for the 15 days interval showed good positive correction (r = 0.78) with temperature indicating the direct dependency of the former on land surface temperature conditions of the region. Besides the lowering and discharge observations, the frequent ice-block break-offs at the glacier snout further enhance its overall drastic degeneration. The study suggests that, being the largest glacier in the Suru basin, the Kangriz glacier needs to be continuously monitored in order to understand its glacio-hydrological conditions.

TI  - Estimating the impacts of land use/land cover changes on Ecosystem Service Values: The case of the Andassa watershed in the Upper Blue Nile basin of Ethiopia
T2  - ECOSYSTEM SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) changes in Ecosystem Service Values (ESV) is indispensable to provide public awareness about the status of ESV, and to help in policy-making processes. This study was intended to estimate the impacts of LULC changes on ESV in the Andassa watershed of the Upper Blue Nile basin over the last three decades (1985-2015), and to predict the ESV changes in 2045. The hybrid land use classification technique for classifying Landsat images, the Cellular-Automata Markov (CA-Markov) model for LULC prediction, and the modified ecosystem service value coefficients for estimating ESV were employed. Our findings revealed that there was a continues expansions of cultivated land and built-up area, and withdrawing of forest, shrubland and grassland during the 1985-2015 periods, which are expected to continue for the next three decades. Consequently, the total ESV of the watershed has declined from US$26.83 x 10(6) in 1985 to US$22.58 x 10(6) in 2000 and to US $21.00 x 10(6) in 2015 and is expected to further reduce to US$17.94 x 10(6) in 2030 and to US$15.25 x 10(6) in 2045. The impacts of LULC changes on the specific ecosystem services are also tremendous. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Ghost City Extraction and Rate Estimation in China Based on NPP-VIIRS Night-Time Light Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ghost city phenomenon is a serious problem resulting from the rapid urbanization process in China. Estimation of the ghost city rate (GCR) can provide information about vacant dwellings. This paper developed a methodology to quantitatively evaluate GCR values at the national scale using multi-resource remote sensing data. The Suomi National Polar-Orbiting Partnership-Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (NPP-VIIRS) night-time light data and moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover data were used in the evaluation of the GCR values in China. The average ghost city rate (AGCR) was 35.1% in China in 2013. Shanghai had the smallest AGCR of 21.7%, while Jilin has the largest AGCR of 47.27%. There is a significant negative correlation between both the provincial AGCR and the per capita disposable income of urban households (R = -0.659, p < 0.01) and the average selling prices of commercial buildings (R = -0.637, p < 0.01). In total, 31 ghost cities are mainly concentrated in the economically underdeveloped inland provinces. Ghost city areas are mainly located on the edge of urban built-up areas, and the spatial pattern of ghost city areas changed in different regions. This approach combines statistical data with the distribution of vacant urban areas, which is an effective method to capture ghost city information.

TI  - A comprehensive geospatial assessment of seagrass distribution in India
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study deals with the first comprehensive spatial distribution and area estimate of seagrass patches of India with a standardized methodology. Seagrass patches are mainly located in Palk Bay - Gulf of Mannar (Tamil Nadu), Gulf of Kachchh (Gujarat), Chilika Lake (Odisha) and Islands of Andaman & Nicobar and Lakshadweep. Medium resolution satellite images of Landsat 8 OLI were subjected to radiometric, atmospheric and water column correction prior to digital classification and contextual editing. Total estimated seagrass area amounts to 516.59 km(2) of which Palk Bay and Gulf of Mannar of Tamil Nadu together contribute to 398.81 km(2). Overall classification accuracy for the six sites studied, ranged between 64% (Lakshadweep Islands) and 83.5% (Palk Bay). This suggests that for surveillance studies of homogeneous seagrass meadows with low interspersion of other benthic units such as corals, seaweeds etc., digital mapping using medium resolution data sets with mandatory attenuation correction procedures is suitable. The results of this study and the related area statistics were accepted as a baseline at national level for the delineation of Ecologically Sensitive Areas (ESA) and in the formulation of its conservation strategies. For a cursory appraisal of the status of major seagrass regions, a matrix representation of its locational occurrence and habitat characteristics is provided.

TI  - An adaptive semi-Lagrangian advection model for transport of volcanic emissions in the atmosphere
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The dispersion of volcanic emissions in the Earth atmosphere is of interest for climate research, air traffic control and human wellbeing. Current volcanic emission dispersion models rely on fixed-grid structures that often are not able to resolve the fine filamented structure of volcanic emissions being transported in the atmosphere. Here we extend an existing adaptive semi-Lagrangian advection model for volcanic emissions including the sedimentation of volcanic ash. The advection of volcanic emissions is driven by a precalculated wind field. For evaluation of the model, the explosive eruption of Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 is chosen, which was one of the largest eruptions in the 20th century. We compare our simulations of the climactic eruption on 15 June 1991 to satellite data of the Pinatubo ash cloud and evaluate different sets of input parameters. We could reproduce the general advection of the Pinatubo ash cloud and, owing to the adaptive mesh, simulations could be performed at a high local resolution while minimizing computational cost. Differences to the observed ash cloud are attributed to uncertainties in the input parameters and the course of Typhoon Yunya, which is probably not completely resolved in the wind data used to drive the model. The best results were achieved for simulations with multiple ash particle sizes.

TI  - A hybrid AHP-VIKOR approach for prospectivity modeling of porphyry Cu deposits in the Varzaghan District, NW Iran
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying highly favorable areas related to a particular mineralization type is the main objective of mineral prospectivity modeling (MPM). The northwestern portion of Ahar-Arasbaran porphyry copper belt (AAPCB) is situated within the Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic belt (UDMB). Because of owning many worthwhile Cu-Mo and Cu-Au porphyry deposits, this area is entitled to incorporate diverse spatial evidence layers for the MPM. In this paper, a hybrid AHP-VIKOR, as an improved knowledge-driven MPM procedure has been proposed for integration of various exploration evidence layers. For this, the AHP is used to calculate important weights of spatial criteria while the VIKOR is applied to outline ultimate prospectivity model. Six effective spatial evidence layers pertaining to the Varzaghan District are selected: (1) multi-elemental geochemical layer of Cu-Mo-Bi-Au; (2) remotely sensed data of argillic, phyllic, and iron oxide alteration layers; and (3) geological and structural layers of Oligo-Miocene intrusions and fault. In addition, a fuzzy prospectivity model (gamma = 0.9) is implemented to assess the AHP-VIKOR approach. Two credible validation methods comprising normalized density index and success rate curve are adapted for quantitative evaluation of predictive models and enhancing the probability of exploration success. The achieved results proved the higher accuracy of the AHP-VIKOR model compared with the fuzzy model in delimiting the favorable areas.

TI  - Self-adaptive differential evolutionary extreme learning machines for long-term solar radiation prediction with remotely-sensed MODIS satellite and Reanalysis atmospheric products in solar-rich cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing predictive models of global solar radiation can be an effective renewable energy feasibility studies approach to resolve future problems associated with the supply, reliability and dynamical stability of consumable energy demands generated by solar-powered electrical plants. In this paper we design and present a new approach to predict the monthly mean daily solar radiation (GSR) by constructing an extreme learning machine (ELM) model integrated with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-based satellite and the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data for solar rich cities: Brisbane and Townsville, Australia. A self-adaptive differential evolutionary ELM (i.e., SaDE-ELM) is proposed, utilizing a swarm-based ant colony optimization (ACO) feature selection to select the most important predictors for GSR, and the SaDE-ELM is then benchmarked with nine different data-driven models: a basic ELM, genetic programming (GP), online sequential ELM with fixed (OS-ELM) and varying (OSVARY-ELM) input sizes, and hybridized model including the particle swarm optimized-artificial neural network model (PSO-ANN), genetic algorithm optimized ANN (GA-ANN), PSO-support vector machine model (PSO-SVR), genetic algorithm optimized-SVR model (GA-SVR) and the SVR model optimized with grid search (GS-SVR). A comprehensive evaluation of the SaDE-ELM model is performed, considering key statistical metrics and diagnostic plots of measured and forecasted GSR. The results demonstrate excellent forecasting capability of the SaDE-ELM model in respect to the nine benchmark models. SaDE-ELM outperformed all comparative models for both tested study sites with a relative mean absolute and a root mean square error (RRMSE) of 2.6% and 2.3% (for Brisbane) and 0.8% and 0.7% (for Townsville), respectively. Majority of the forecasted errors are recorded in the lowest magnitude frequency band, to demonstrate the preciseness of the SaDE-ELM model. When tested for daily solar radiation forecasting using the ECMWF Reanalysis data for Brisbane study site, the performance resulted in an RRMSE approximate to 10.5%. Alternative models evaluated with the input data classified into El Nino, La Nifia and the positive and negative phases of the Indian Ocean Dipole moment (considering the impacts of synoptic-scale climate phenomenon), confirms the superiority of the SaDE-ELM model (with RRMSE 13%). A seasonal analysis of all developed models depicts SaDE-ELM as the preferred tool over the basic ELM and the hybridized version of ANN, SVR and GP model. In accordance with the results obtained through MODIS satellite and ECMWF Reanalysis data products, this study ascertains that the proposed SaDE-ELM model applied with ACO feature selection, integrated with satellite-derived data is adoptable as a qualified tool for monthly and daily GSR predictions and long-term solar energy feasibility study especially in data sparse and regional sites where a satellite footprint can be identified.

TI  - Rimaal: A Sand Buried Structure of Possible Impact Origin in the Sahara: Optical and Radar Remote Sensing Investigation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work communicates the discovery of a sandy buried 10.5 km diameter near-circular structure in the eastern part of the Great Sahara in North Africa. Rimaal, meaning sand in Arabic, is given as the name for this structure since it is largely concealed beneath the Sahara Aeolian sand. Remote sensing image fusion and transformation of multispectral data (from Landsat-8) and synthetic aperture radar (from Sentinel-1 and ALOS PALSAR), of dual wavelengths (C and L-bands) and multi-polarization (HV, VV, HH, and HV), were adopted in this work. The optical and microwave hybrid imagery enabled the combining of surface spectral properties and subsurface roughness information for better understanding of the Rimaal structure. The long wavelength of the radar, in particular, enabled the penetration of desert sands and the revealing of the proposed structure. The structure exhibits a clear outer rim with traces of concentric faults, an annular flat basin and an inner ring surrounding remnants of a highly eroded central peak. Radar imagery clearly shows the interior wall of the structure is incised with radial pattern gullies that originate at or near the crater periphery, implying a much steeper rim wall in the past. In addition, data reveals a circumferential of a paleoriver course that flows along a curved path parallel to the crater's western margin indicating the plausible presence of a concentric ring graben related to the inferred structure. The defined crater boundary is coincident with a shallow semi-circular-like basin in the SRTM elevation data. The structure portrays considerable modifications by extensive long-term Aeolian and fluvial erosion. Residing in the Cretaceous Nubian Sandstone formation suggests an old age of 65 Ma for the structure. If proven to be of an impact origin, the Rimaal structure could help in understanding the early evolution of the landscape of the Eastern Sahara and holds promise for hosting economically valuable ore deposits and hydrocarbon resources in the region.

TI  - Regenerative Development as an Integrative Paradigm and Methodology for Landscape Sustainability
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the integration of sustainability, ecology, and design has been recognized as necessary by scientists and practitioners, most transdisciplinary frameworks are not inclusive of the worldviews, paradigms, aims, processes, and components necessary for sustainability. Landscape sustainability science helps to focus scientist, scholar, practitioner, and stakeholder efforts toward sustainability at a pivotal level; however, collaboration and progress have been slow. Significant potential exists for design to be an integrative and transformational methodology toward landscape sustainability, yet it has not fulfilled this ambitious role. In this paper, we first build a case for regenerative development, a development and design methodology based on an ecological worldview, as an integrative platform for a new paradigm. This new paradigm, which we call regenerative landscape development, has the potential to thoroughly catalyze a shift toward regenerative sustainability. We then detail this new paradigm as a process that could continually enhance the capacities of living systems to increase health, well-being, and happiness. Next, to illustrate regenerative development in practice, we provide brief case studies of projects in Vina del Mar, Chile and Juluchuca, Guerrero, Mexico. Finally, we propose future recommendations and precautions in the construction of regenerative landscape development as a new paradigm. If fully understood, embraced, and realized, regenerative development holds incredible potential for a sustainable future.

TI  - Forest Loss and Economic Inequality in the Solomon Islands: Using Small-Area Estimation to Link Environmental Change to Welfare Outcomes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To study welfare effects of environmental change, data from household surveys may be linked to remote sensing data. Using spatial aggregation to link risks ecological fallacy, since surveys are usually representative for areas larger than the spatial scale of decision-making units. This paper uses survey-to-census imputation to estimate welfare indicators for small areas to study the effect of deforestation on subsequent inequality in the rural Solomon Islands. This country depends on logging for almost half of foreign exchange and one-sixth of government revenue, and most forested land remains under customary ownership. A sharp increase in log exports, to seven times the sustainable yield, and a major shift in export destinations as other countries withdrew from the tropical log trade represents an exogenous shock that helps to identify effects of deforestation on inequality rather than the reverse relationship. A standard deviation increase in the rate of forest loss over 2000 to 2012 raises the Gini index of inequality in 2013 by one-third of a standard deviation. Mean incomes and poverty rates are also higher, implying that deforestation makes some households richer while others become poorer. These precisely estimated effects would be obscured using more spatially aggregated data.

TI  - Predictions of future meteorological drought hazard (∼2070) under the representative concentration path (RCP) 4.5 climate change scenarios in Raya, Northern Ethiopia
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There are very few scientific studies on the predictions of future drought hazard and its effects on economic, social, and environmental under the existing global climate change scenarios. This study, aims to predict the future meteorological drought hazard (2016-2070) under the representative concentration path 4.5 climate change scenarios in Raya and its environs, Northern Ethiopia. The study also investigates the onset, end set, duration, magnitude, intensity, frequency, severity and spatial coverage of future drought occurrences. Monthly tropical applications of meteorology using satellite data and ground-based observations and daily AgMERRA daily climatic data were used from 19 meteorological stations. A robust interpolation technique called Inverse distance weighted was also applied to assess the spatial-temporal distribution of rainfall. Then, the temporal seasonal rainfall variability was analyzed using the coefficient of variation. A standardized precipitation index at 3 months time scale was applied to measure the precipitation deficit and characterize drought properties. The results reveal an increasing and worsening drought event in the future than the last three decades. Hence, the study area will be stricken for about 30-39 times with mild to extreme droughts. The rate of drought recurrence will also be once in every 1.8-2.3 years. The duration (1-5 years) of drought will be similar in all districts, but the magnitude and intensity will vary due to the level of precipitation deficit. It is, therefore, recommended that policy or decision makers and smallholder farmers should improve the existing water management and agricultural practices to cope up with the climate extremes and boost agricultural productivity.

TI  - GIS Multi-Criteria Analysis for Identifying and Mapping Forest Fire Hazard: Nevesinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina
T2  - TEHNICKI VJESNIK-TECHNICAL GAZETTE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire risk management starts with an assessment of the most flammable places. In this paper, identification, classification and mapping of forest fire risk is completed with an aim of reducing the ratio and ecological damage caused by the fire. Suggested model is based on the combination of Geographical Information Systems and multi-criteria decision analysis using Analytic Hierarchy Process for mapping and assessment of forest fire risk in the area of Municipality Nevesinje, Bosnia and Herzegovina. The process was developed with an aid of 8 criteria grouped in four clusters. The weights are determined using AHP. Final map of forest fire risk is classified in 5 categories, from very low to very high risk, and indicates that 13.2% of Municipality area is in very high forest fire risk zone. The proposed method and the results of this study can be used for a policy of sustainable development at all levels of government.

TI  - Data on spatiotemporal land use land cover changes in peri-urban West Arsi Zone, Ethiopia: Empirical evidences from Shashemene peri-urban areas
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Urban expansion is one of the major problems in Ethiopia resulting in displacement of the rural people inhabiting areas bordering the cities/towns. It is also resulting in land use land cover (LULC) changes affecting the livelihoods of the people and the ecosystems (Messay et al., 2017; Ganamo, 2013) [1,2]. The data presented in this article, therefore shows the spatiotemporal LULC changes of peri-urban expansion areas of Shashemene City. The data were generated from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) images (with path/row numbers 168/055) from EarthExplorer.usgs.gow and the data was classified, interpreted and cross-tabulated using ERDAS IMAGIN 2013 and ArcGIS 10.4.1 software packages. The accuracy of the image classification was verified by geo-location data collected from ground control points by using Geo Positioning System (GPS) receiver and the spatial resolution (1 m) and very recent (2016) Imagery downloaded from Google Earth. The result indicates that the built-up areas have increased by 1938.71 ha (19.3871 km(2)) with 73.4%, and 17.6% decline in forest land and grassland respectively between 1973 and 2016.

TI  - Midwest agriculture and ENSO: A comparison of AVHRR NDVI3g data and crop yields in the United States Corn Belt from 1982 to 2014
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were compared to National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) corn yield data in the United States Corn Belt from 1982 to 2014. The main objectives of the comparison were to assess 1) the consistency of regional Corn Belt responses to El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection signals, and 2) the reliability of using NDVI as an indicator of crop yield.Regional NDVI values were used to model a seasonal curve and to define the growing season May to October. Seasonal conditions in each county were represented by NDVI and land surface temperature (LST) composites, and corn yield was represented by average annual bushels produced per acre. Correlation analysis between the NDVI, LST, corn yield, and equatorial Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies revealed patterns in land surface dynamics and corn yield, as well as typical impacts of ENSO episodes.It was observed from the study that growing seasons coincident with La Nina events were consistently warmer, but El Nino events did not consistently impact NDVI, temperature, or corn yield data. Moreover, the El Nino and La Nina composite images suggest that impacts vary spatially across the Corn Belt. While corn is the dominant crop in the region, some inconsistencies between corn yield and NDVI may be attributed to soy crops and other background interference. The overall correlation between the total growing season NDVI anomaly and detrended corn yield was 0.61(p = 0.00013), though the strength of the relationship varies across the Corn Belt.

TI  - Automatic Measurement of Water Height in the As Conchas (Spain) Reservoir Using Sentinel 2 and Aerial LiDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology for the measurement of height in water reservoirs is developed. It is based on Sentinel 2 imagery and aerial LiDAR data. The methodology is automatized using Matlab software and focused on image processing techniques (equalization, binarization, and edge detection) combined with LiDAR data processing (near neighbour search and height averaging). It is applied in a region of interest selected by the user characterized by a water-land interface. Results are validated in the As Conchas water reservoir (Spain) using an in situ sensing system provided by the Hydrographic Mino-Sil Confederation. The duration of the experiment was one year. The Sentinel 2 bands B2, B3, B4, and B8 were tested during this study. The best results for water height evaluation were obtained for band B8 (842 nm) with an error of 0.20 m and a standard deviation of 0.17 m. The time resolution of the technique depends on the Sentinel 2 revisit time. The time resolution and height accuracy could be improved using complementary satellite systems.

TI  - Absence of Nosocomial Transmission of Imported Lassa Fever during Use of Standard Barrier Nursing Methods
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Nosocomial transmission of Lassa virus (LASV) is reported to be low when care for the index patient includes proper barrier nursing methods. We investigated whether asymptomatic LASV infection occurred in healthcare workers who used standard barrier nursing methods during the first 15 days of caring for a patient with Lassa fever in Sweden. Of 76 persons who were defined as having been potentially exposed to LASV, 53 provided blood samples for detection of LASV IgG. These persons also responded to a detailed questionnaire to evaluate exposure to different body fluids from the index patient. LASV-specific IgG was not detected in any of the 53 persons. Five of 53 persons had not been using proper barrier nursing methods. Our results strengthen the argument for a low risk of secondary transmission of LASV in humans when standard barrier nursing methods are used and the patient has only mild symptoms.

TI  - Spatial regression with an informatively missing covariate: Application to mapping fine particulate matter
T2  - ENVIRONMETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The United States Environmental Protection Agency has established a large network of stations to monitor fine particulate matter of <2.5 mu m (PM2.5) that is known to be harmful to human health. Unfortunately, the network has limited spatial coverage, and stations often only measure PM2.5 every few days. Satellite-measured aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a low-cost surrogate with greater spatiotemporal coverage, and spatial regression models have established that including AOD as a covariate improves the spatial interpolation of PM2.5. However, AOD is often missing, and our analysis reveals that the conditions that lead to missing AOD are also conducive to high AOD. Therefore, naive interpolation that ignores informative missingness may lead to bias. We propose a joint hierarchical model for PM2.5 and AOD that accounts for informatively missing AOD. We conduct a simulation study of the effects of ignoring informative missingness in the covariate and evaluate the performance of the proposed model. We apply the method to map daily PM2.5 in the Southeastern United States. Our analysis reveals statistically significant informative missingness and relationships between PM2.5 and AOD in many seasons after accounting for meteorological and land-use variables.

TI  - Sclerosing melanocytic lesions (sclerosing melanomas with nevoid features and sclerosing nevi with pseudomelanomatous features) - an analysis of 90 lesions
T2  - RADIOLOGY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Sclerosing melanocytic lesions, which are characterized by either focal or diffuse sclerosis in the dermal component and atypical proliferation of predominantly nevoid melanocytes, remain poorly defined. Our aim was to analyze systematically their morphologic spectrum, especially the distinction between sclerosing melanocytic nevus and sclerosing melanoma, which has not been well documented.Patients and methods. We collected 90 sclerosing melanocytic lesions, occurring in 82 patients (49 male, 33 female; age range from 21 to 89 years). A four probe fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay was performed in 41 lesions to substantiate the diagnosis of sclerosing melanomas.Results. A prominent full-thickness pagetoid spread of melanocytes was identified in 44 (48%) lesions, and a melanoma in situ adjacent to the sclerosis in 55 (61%) lesions. In the intrasclerotic component, maturation was absent in 40 (44%) and mitotic figures were identified in 18 (20%) lesions. Of the 90 lesions, 26 (29%) were diagnosed morphologically as nevi and 64 (71%) as melanomas (Breslow thickness from 0.4 to 1.8 mm), including 45 (50%) melanomas with an adjacent nevus. A four-probe FISH assay was positive in the sclerotic component in 14 of 25 lesions diagnosed morphologically as melanomas and none of 16 nevi. A sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed for 17 lesions and was negative in all cases.Conclusions. Sclerosing melanocytic lesions form a morphologic spectrum and include both nevi and melanomas. The pathogenesis of sclerosis remains obscure but seems to be induced by melanocytes or an unusual host response in at least a subset of lesions.

TI  - Evaluation of TanDEM-X DEMs on selected Brazilian sites: Comparison with SRTM, ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A first assessment of the TanDEM-X DEMs over Brazilian territory is presented through a comparison with SRTM, ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 DEMs in seven study areas with distinct geomorphological contexts, vegetation coverage, and land use. Visual analysis and elevation histograms point to a finer effective spatial (i.e., horizontal) resolution of TanDEM-X compared to SRTM and ASTER GDEM. In areas of open vegetation, TanDEM-X lower elevations indicate a deeper penetration of the radar signal. DEMs of differences (DoDs) allowed the identification of issues inherent to the production methods of the analyzed DEMs, such as mast oscillations in SRTM data and mismatch between adjacent scenes in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30. A systematic difference in elevations between TanDEM-X 12 m, TanDEM-X 30 m, and SRTM was observed in the steep slopes of the coastal ranges, related to the moving-window process used to resample the 12 m data to a 30 m pixel size. It is strongly recommended to produce a DoD with SRTM before using ASTER GDEM or ALOS AW3D30 in any analysis, to evaluate if the area of interest is affected by these problems. The DoDs also highlighted changes in land use in the time span between the acquisition of SRTM (2000) and TanDEM-X (2013) data, whether by natural causes or by human interference in the environment. The results show a high level of detail and consistency for TanDEM-X data, indicate that the effective horizontal resolution of SRTM is coarser than the nominal 30 m, and highlight the errors in ASTER GDEM and ALOS AW3D30 due to mismatch between adjacent scenes in the photogrammetric process.

TI  - Uncertainties in tree cover maps of Sub-Saharan Africa and their implications for measuring progress towards CBD Aichi Targets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The growing access to Earth Observations and processing capabilities have stimulated the production of global and regional products that are commonly used to assess tree-covered habitats and their changes. The popularity of these products has led to their use for defining baselines and to assess progress in conserving natural habitats, in particular, in the context of the conservation targets to 2020 set by the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. In this paper, we reviewed three tree cover products commonly used over Sub-Saharan Africa: (1) MODIS Vegetation Continuous Field percent tree cover map, (2) Global Forest Change map and (3) TREES product. Over a systematic sample of 2045 map subsets, each having a size of 10x10km(2), we calculated the extent and change of tree cover from each product for the period between 2000 and 2010. Our statistical and spatial comparison shows noticeable discrepancies between the three products, which lead to uncertainties when assessing tree cover across varying ecosystems. These differences are highest in habitats where tree cover is fragmented or reaches medium density levels and overlap with areas of high economic development potential, where habitat changes are likely to occur in the near future. We discuss these findings in the context of using these remotely sensed tree cover products to support current global biodiversity conservation policies.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Assessment of Particulate Matter Using AOD Data from MODIS and Surface Measurements in the Ambient Air of Colombia
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) measurements are important in air quality, public health, epidemiological studies and decision making for short and long-term policies implementation. However, only few cities in the word have advance air quality-monitoring networks able to provide reliable information of PM leaves in the ambient air, trends and extent of the pollution. In Colombia, only major cities measure PM concentrations. Available measurements from Bogota, Medellin and Bucaramanga show that PM concentration are well above World Health Organization guidelines, but up to now levels and trends of PM in other cities and regions of the country are not well known. Satellite measurements serve as an alternative approach to study air quality in regions were surface measurements are not available. The aim of this study is to perform a spatial and temporal assessment of PM in the ambient air of Colombia. We used Aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrieved by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite of NASA and surface measurements from the air quality networks of Bogota, Medellin and Bucaramanga. In a first step, we estimated the correlation between MODIS-AOD and monthly average surface measurements (2000 to 2015) from these three cities, obtaining correlation coefficient R values over 0.4 for the cities under study. After, we used AOD and PM10 measurements to study the temporal evolution of PM in different cities and regions. Finally, we used AOD measurements to identify cities and regions with the highest AOD levels in Colombia. All the methods presented in this paper may serve as an example for other countries or regions to identify and prioritize locations that require the implementation of more accurate air quality measurements.

TI  - Long-term exposure to ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> associated with fall-related injury in six low- and middle-income countries
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to ambient air pollution has been linked with adverse health outcomes of the circulatory and nervous systems. Given that falls are closely related to circulatory and nervous health, we hypothesize that air pollution may adversely affect fall-related injury. We employed Wave 1 data from 36,662 participants aged >= 50 years in WHO's Study on Global AGEing and Adult Health in six low- and middle income countries. Ambient annual concentration of PM2.5 was estimated using satellite data. A three level logistic regression model was applied to examine the long-term association between ambient PM2.5 and the prevalence of fall-related injury, and associated disease burden, as well as the potential effect modification of consumption of fruit and vegetables. Ambient PM2.5 was found to be significantly associated with the risk of fall-related injury. Each 10 mu g/m(3) increase corresponded to 18% (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.28) increase in fall-related injury after adjusting for various covariates. The association was relatively stronger among participants with lower consumption of fruit (OR = 1.22, 95% Cl: 1.12, 1.33) than higher consumption (OR = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.23), and among those with lower vegetable consumption (OR = 1.18, 95% Cl: 1.08, 1.28) than higher consumption (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.91, 1.27). Our study suggests that ambient PM2.5 may be one risk factor for fall-related injury and that higher consumption of fruit and vegetables could alleviate this effect. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The explosive availability of remote sensing images has challenged supervised classification algorithms such as support vector machines (SVM), as training samples tend to be highly limited due to the expensive and laborious task of ground truthing. The temporal correlation and spectral similarity between multitemporal images have opened up an opportunity to alleviate this problem. In this paper, a SVM-based sequential classifier training (SCT-SVM) approach is proposed for multitemporal remote sensing image classification. The approach leverages the classifiers of previous images to reduce the required number of training samples for the classifier training of an incoming image. For each incoming image, a rough classifier is first predicted based on the temporal trend of a set of previous classifiers. The predicted classifier is then fine-tuned into a more accurate position with current training samples. This approach can be applied progressively to sequential image data, with only a small number of training samples being required from each image. Experiments were conducted with Sentinel-2A multitemporal data over an agricultural area in Australia. Results showed that the proposed SCT-SVM achieved better classification accuracies compared with two state-of-the-art model transfer algorithms. When training data are insufficient, the overall classification accuracy of the incoming image was improved from 76.18% to 94.02% with the proposed SCT-SVM, compared with those obtained without the assistance from previous images. These results demonstrate that the leverage of a priori information from previous images can provide advantageous assistance for later images in multitemporal image classification.

TI  - Impact of California Fires on Local and Regional Air Quality: The Role of a Low-Cost Sensor Network and Satellite Observations
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5, or fine particulate matter, is a category of air pollutant consisting of particles with effective aerodynamic diameter equal to or less than 2.5 mu m. These particles have been linked to human health impacts as well as regional haze, visibility, and climate change issues. Due to cost and space restrictions, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency monitoring network remains spatially sparse. To increase the spatial resolution of monitoring, previous studies have used satellite data to estimate ground-level PM concentrations, despite these estimates being associated with moderate to large uncertainties when relating a column measure of aerosol (aerosol optical depth) with surface measurements. To this end, we discuss a low-cost air quality monitor (LCAQM) network deployed in California. In this study, we present an application of LCAQM and satellite data for quantifying the impact of wildfires in California during October 2017. The impacts of fires on PM2.5 concentration at varying temporal (hourly, daily, and weekly) and spatial (local to regional) scales have been evaluated. Comparison between low-cost air quality sensors and reference-grade air quality instruments shows expected performance with moderate to high uncertainties. The LCAQM measurements, in the absence of federal equivalent method data, were also found to be very useful in developing statistical models to convert aerosol optical depth into PM2.5 with performance of satellite-derived PM2.5, similar to that obtained using the federal equivalent method data. This paper also highlights challenges associated with both LCAQM and satellite-based PM2.5 measurements, which require further investigation and research.

TI  - Application of drone for landslide mapping, dimension estimation and its 3D reconstruction
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dimension estimation of landslides is a major challenge while preparing the landslide inventory map, for which very high-resolution satellite data/aerial photography is required, which is very expensive. An alternative is the application of drones for such mapping. This study presents the utility of drone/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for mapping and 3D reconstruction of two landslides near IIT Mandi, Himachal Pradesh. In this study, we used DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone to collect high-resolution images of landslides. Features in the images were automatically detected, described, and matched among photographs using scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) technique. The 3D position and orientation of the cameras and the XYZ location of each feature in the photographs was estimated using bundle block adjustment. This resulted in sparse 3D point cloud, which was densified using Clustering View for Multi-View Stereo (CMVS) algorithm. Finally, surface reconstruction was done using Poisson Surface Reconstruction method, which was visualised in open source software CloudCompare. The 3D model, generated from drone images, was validated using field measurements of some objects, and 3D surface created from total station. Various quantities i.e. width (length), height and perimeter were measured in the 3D drone model and verified with total station data. The differences among all the measured quantities for both the landslides are less than 5% keeping the measurements of total station as reference. The 3D reconstructed from the sets of photographs is very accurate giving the measurements up to cm level and even small objects could be easily identified. In addition, digital elevation model (DEM) of sub meter resolution could be easily generated and used for various applications. Hence drone-based imagery in combination with 3D scene reconstruction algorithms provide flexible and effective tools to map and monitor landslide apart from accurately assessing the dimensions of the landslides.

TI  - Surveying shrimp aquaculture pond activity using multitemporal VHSR satellite images - case study from the Perancak estuary, Bali, Indonesia
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - From the 1980's, Indonesian shrimp production has continuously increased through a large expansion of cultured areas and an intensification of the production. As consequences of diseases and environmental degradations linked to this development, there are currently 250,000 ha of abandoned ponds in Indonesia. To implement effective procedure to undertake appropriate aquaculture ecosystem assessment and monitoring, an integrated indicator based on four criteria using very high spatial optical satellite images, has been developed to discriminate active from abandoned ponds. These criteria were: presence of water, aerator, feeding bridge and vegetation. This indicator has then been applied to the Perancak estuary, a production area in decline, to highlight the abandonment dynamic between 2001 and 2015. Two risk factors that could contribute to explain dynamics of abandonment were identified: climate conditions and pond locations within the estuary, suggesting that a spatial approach should be integrated in planning processes to operationalize pond rehabilitation.

TI  - DASEIN'S "POTENTIALITY-FOR-BEING" IN A WASTELAND: THE CASE OF AUSTER'S <i>IN THE COUNTRY OF LAST THING</i>
T2  - ANAFORA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a reading of Paul Auster's novel In the Country of Last Things (1987) through the conceptual lens of Heidegger's theory of Dasein. It focuses on Heidegger's definition of human nature as Dasein by discussing the range of existential possibilities that the German philosopher outlined for human beings in order to make authentic sense of their being and life before death. The progression from birth to death constitutes Dasein's state of being or its existence. However, not many individuals are conscious of this process, being lost in the limiting situation of their everydayness. Accordingly, inauthentic lives without understanding one's true possibilities take place. A fictional visualization of Dasein's attempts at an authentic existence within its limiting situation or, we could say, within its typical society, can concretize Heidegger's points in a better way. Concerning Paul Auster's existential outlook on life, In the Country of Last Things is a portrayal of such a struggle for an authentic existence in a dystopian predicament where humankind is thrown into the lowest possible situation. Allegorically, the novel is a laboratory for experimenting with human potentiality for being in the face of severely lacking conditions for the fulfilment of biological needs, with death always in the background. In such a thrown state of life, the protagonist, Anna Blume, is called to authenticity against others' inauthenticity and life-threatening situations, highlighting the possibility of living in a dystopia through authentic selfhood. The paper thus argues that Auster's existentialism in this novel is not alien to Heidegger's worldview on human existence.

TI  - Rainfall-Runoff modeling and hydrological regime analysis of a semi-arid snow-influenced catchment Case of the Rheraya river (High Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU
M3  - Article
AB  - River flow and groundwater recharge in the Marrakech region are closely linked to the hydrological dynamics in the High Atlas Mountains. To anticipate the effects of climate change in this area where the pressure on water resources is increasing, it is essential to quantify the contribution of snowmelt and rainfall to runoff. This study aims to modeling the runoff of the Rheraya River in the Moroccan High Atlas (225 km(2), elevations ranging between 1030 and 4165 m.a.s.l.) taking into account its snow component. For this purpose, the GR4J conceptual and lumped model was applied over the period 1989-2009, coupling it with the CemaNeige module for semi-distributed snow dynamics. This work allows for an improved characterization of the hydrologic regime of this watershed.The daily snow coverage simulated by CemaNeige is in good agreement with that extracted from the MODIS snow product in the period 2000-2009 (R-2 = 0,64). In addition, the simulated daily snow water equivalent is consistent with that measured at a weather station (2004-2006, R-2 = 0,81). Finally, the runoff simulation reproduces quite well the strong seasonal and inter-annual variability. However, the low Nash value obtained as compared to standards (0,45), can be linked to the low quality of runoff measurements (unstable riverbed).In conclusion, the hydrological regime of the Rheraya River is pluvio-nival with an unimodal distribution whose maximum in April is linked with snowmelt. It is at this time of the year that downstream populations are most vulnerable to the flow deficit because irrigated crops come into their growth period.

TI  - Neural network cloud top pressure and height for MODIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top height retrieval from imager instruments is important for nowcasting and for satellite climate data records. A neural network approach for cloud top height retrieval from the imager instrument MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) is presented. The neural networks are trained using cloud top layer pressure data from the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization) dataset.Results are compared with two operational reference algorithms for cloud top height: the MODIS Collection 6 Level 2 height product and the cloud top temperature and height algorithm in the 2014 version of the NWC SAF (EUMETSAT (European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites) Satellite Application Facility on Support to Nowcasting and Very Short Range Forecasting) PPS (Polar Platform System). All three techniques are evaluated using both CALIOP and CPR (Cloud Profiling Radar for CloudSat (CLOUD SATellite)) height.Instruments like AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) contain fewer channels useful for cloud top height retrievals than MODIS, therefore several different neural networks are investigated to test how infrared channel selection influences retrieval performance. Also a network with only channels available for the AVHRR1 instrument is trained and evaluated. To examine the contribution of different variables, networks with fewer variables are trained. It is shown that variables containing imager information for neighboring pixels are very important.The error distributions of the involved cloud top height algorithms are found to be non-Gaussian. Different descriptive statistic measures are presented and it is exemplified that bias and SD (standard deviation) can be misleading for non-Gaussian distributions. The median and mode are found to better describe the tendency of the error distributions and IQR (interquartile range) and MAE (mean absolute error) are found to give the most useful information of the spread of the errors.For all descriptive statistics presented MAE, IQR, RMSE (root mean square error), SD, mode, median, bias and percentage of absolute errors above 0.25, 0.5, 1 and 2 km the neural network perform better than the reference algorithms both validated with CALIOP and CPR (CloudSat). The neural networks using the brightness temperatures at 11 and 12 mu m show at least 32% (or 623 m) lower MAE compared to the two operational reference algorithms when validating with CALIOP height. Validation with CPR (CloudSat) height gives at least 25% (or 430 m) reduction of MAE.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of mosquitoes and risk of malaria infection in Rwanda
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, the Republic of Rwanda has not systematically reported on distribution, diversity and malaria infectivity rate of mosquito species throughout the country. Therefore, we assessed the spatial and temporal variation of mosquitoes in the domestic environment, as well as the nocturnal biting behavior and infection patterns of the main malaria vectors in Rwanda. For this purpose, mosquitoes were collected monthly from 2010 to 2013 by human landing catches (HLC) and pyrethrum spray collections (PSC) in seven sentinel sites. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological characteristics and PCR. Plasmodium falciparum sporozoite infection rates were determined using ELISA. A total of 340,684 mosquitoes was collected by HLC and 73.8% were morphologically identified as culicines and 26.2% as anophelines. Of the latter, 94.3% were Anopheles gambiae s.l., 0.4% Anopheles funestus and 5.3% other Anopheles species. Of An. gambiae s.l., An. arabiensis and An. gambiae s.s. represented 84.4% and 15.6%, respectively. Of all An. gambiae s.l. collected indoor and outdoor, the proportion collected indoors was 51.3% in 2010 and 44.9% in 2013. A total of 17,022 mosquitoes was collected by PSC of which 20.5% were An. gambiae s.l. and 79.5% were culicines. For the seven sentinel sites, the mean indoor density for An. gambiae s.l. varied from 0.0 to 1.0 mosquitoes/house/night. P. falciparum infection rates in mosquitoes varied from 0.87 to 4.06%. The entomological inoculation rate (EIR) ranged from 1.0 to 329.8 with an annual average of 99.5 infective bites/person/year. This longitudinal study shows, for the first time, the abundance, species composition, and entomological inoculation rate of malaria mosquitoes collected throughout Rwanda.

TI  - Hapke mixture modeling applied to VNIR spectra of mafic mineral mixtures and shergottites: Implications for quantitative analysis of satellite data
T2  - METEORITICS & PLANETARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mineralogy of Mars is well understood on a qualitative level at a global scale due to satellite data. Quantitative analysis of visible and near-infrared (VNIR) satellite data is a desirable but nontrivial task, due partly to the nonlinearity of VNIR reflectance spectra from the mineral mixtures of the Martian surface. In this study, we investigated the use of the Hapke radiative transfer model to generate linearly mixed single scattering albedo data from nonlinearly mixed VNIR reflectance data and then quantitatively analyzed them using the linear spectral mixture model. Simplifications to the Hapke equationwere tested accounting for variables that would be unknown when using satellite data. Mineral mixture spectra from the RELAB spectral library were degraded to test the robustness of the unmixing technique in the face of data that mimic some of the complexities of satellite spectral data collected at Mars. A final test was performed on spectra from shergottite meteorites to assess the technique against real Martian mineral mixtures. The simplified Hapke routine produced robust abundance estimates within 5-10% accuracy when applied to laboratory standard spectra from the synthetic mixtures of igneous minerals in agreement with previous studies. The results of tests involving degraded data to mimic the low spectral contrast of the Martian surface and the lack of a priori knowledge of the constituent mineral spectral endmembers, however, were less encouraging, with errors in abundance estimation greater than 25%. These results cast doubt on the utility of Hapke unmixing for the quantitative analysis of VNIR data of the surface of Mars.

TI  - Runoff sensitivity to climate change in the Nile River Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In data scarce basins, such as the Nile River Basin (NRB) in Africa, constraints related to data availability, quality, and access often complicate attempts to estimate runoff sensitivity using conventional methods. In this paper, we show that by integrating the concept of the aridity index (AI) (derived from the Budyko curve) and climate elasticity, we can obtain the first order response of the runoff sensitivity using minimal data input and modeling expertise or experience. The concept of runoff elasticity relies on the fact that the energy available for evapotranspiration plays a major role in determining whether the precipitation received within a drainage basin generates runoff. The approach does not account for human impacts on runoff modification and or diversions. By making use of freely available gauge-corrected satellite data for precipitation, temperature, runoff, and potential evapotranspiration, we derived the sensitivity indicator (beta) to determine the runoff response to changes in precipitation and temperature for four climatic zones in the NRB, namely, tropical, subtropical, semiarid and arid zones. The proposed sensitivity indicator can be partitioned into different elasticity components i.e: precipitation (epsilon(p)), potential evapotranspiration (epsilon(ETp)), temperature (epsilon(T)) and the total elasticity (epsilon(tot)). These elasticities allow robust quantification of the runoff response to the potential changes in precipitation and temperature with a high degree of accuracy. Results indicate that the tropical zone is energy-constrained with low sensitivity, (beta < 1.0), implying that input precipitation exceeds the amounts that can be evaporated given the available energy. The subtropical zone is subdivided into two distinct regions, the lowland (Machar and Sudd marshes), and the highland area (Blue Nile Basin), where each area has a unique sensitivity. The lowland area has high sensitivity, (beta > 1.0). The subtropical-highland zone moves between energy-limited to water-limited conditions during periods of wet and dry spells with varying sensitivity. The semiarid and arid zones are water limited, with high sensitivity, (beta > 1.0). The calculated runoff elasticities show that a 10% decrease in precipitation leads to a decrease in runoff of between 19% in the tropical zone and 30% in the arid zones. On the other hand, a 10% precipitation increase leads to a runoff increase of 14% in the tropical zone and 22% in the arid zone. The estimated runoff changes are consistent with the result obtained using other methods. Thus, the elasticity approach combines data parsimony and analytical simplicity to produce results that are practically useful for most purposes while facilitating communication with stakeholders with different levels of scientific knowledge. More research is needed to extend the application of the method to incorporate the effects of human activities, and land use change.

TI  - A COMPARISON OF THE RETRIEVAL OF ATMOSPHERIC TEMPERATURE PROFILES USING OBSERVATIONS OF THE 60 GHZ AND 118.75 GHZ ABSORPTION LINES
T2  - JOURNAL OF TROPICAL METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Microwave Temperature Sounder-II (MWTS-II) and Microwave Humidity and Temperature Sounder (MWHTS) onboard the Fengyun-3C (FY-3C) satellite can be used to detect atmospheric temperature profiles. The MWTS-II has 13 temperature sounding channels around the 60 GHz oxygen absorption band and the MWHTS has 8 temperature sounding channels around the 118.75 GHz oxygen absorption line. The data quality of the observed brightness temperatures can be evaluated using atmospheric temperature retrievals from the MWTS-II and MWHTS observations. Here, the bias characteristics and corrections of the observed brightness temperatures are described. The information contents of observations are calculated, and the retrieved atmospheric temperature profiles are compared using a neural network (NN) retrieval algorithm and a one-dimensional variational inversion (1D-var) retrieval algorithm. The retrieval results from the NN algorithm show that the accuracy of the MWTS-II retrieval is higher than that of the MWHTS retrieval, which is consistent with the results of the radiometric information analysis. The retrieval results from the 1D-var algorithm show that the accuracy of MWTS-II retrieval is similar to that of the MWHTS retrieval at the levels from 850-1,000 hPa, is lower than that of the MWHTS retrieval at the levels from 650-850 hPa and 125-300 hPa, and is higher than that of MWHTS at the other levels. A comparison of the retrieved atmospheric temperature using these satellite observations provides a reference value for assessing the accuracy of atmospheric temperature detection at the 60 GHz oxygen band and 118.75 GHz oxygen line. In addition, based on the comparison of the retrieval results, an optimized combination method is proposed using a branch and bound algorithm for the NN retrieval algorithm, which combines the observations from both the MWTS-II and MWHTS instruments to retrieve the atmospheric temperature profiles. The results show that the optimal combination can further improve the accuracy of MWTS-II retrieval and enhance the detection accuracy of atmospheric temperatures near the surface.

Thus, forest patches grow due to tree propagation and shrink by fires in surrounding grasslands. The interplay between these competing edge effects is unknown, but critical in determining the shape and stability of individual forest patches, as well the landscape-level spatial distribution and stability of forests. We analyze high-resolution remote-sensing data from protected Brazilian Cerrado areas and find that forest shapes obey a robust perimeter-area scaling relation across climatic zones. We explain this scaling by introducing a heterogeneous fire propagation model of tropical forest-grassland ecotones. Deviations from this perimeter-area relation determine the stability of individual forest patches. At a larger scale, our model predicts that the relative rates of tree growth due to propagative expansion and long-distance seed dispersal determine whether collapse of regional-scale tree cover is continuous or discontinuous as fire frequency changes.

TI  - Continent-level drivers of African pyrodiversity
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pyrodiversity, which describes fire variability over space and time, is believed to increase habitat heterogeneity and thereby promote biodiversity. However, to date there is no standardised metric for quantifying pyrodiversity, and so broad geographic patterns and drivers of pyrodiversity remain unexplored. We present the first generalizable method to quantify pyrodiversity, and use it to address the fundamental questions of what drives pyrodiversity, which fire attributes constrain pyrodiversity under different conditions, and whether pyrodiversity is spatial grain-dependent. We linked the MODIS burned area and active fire products to measure fire size, seasonal timing, return interval, and intensity for 2.2 million individual fires in sub-Saharan Africa from 2000-2015. We then quantified pyrodiversity as a four-dimensional hypervolume described by fire attributes within a grid cell, for any spatial grain of analysis. Environmental (rainfall, vegetation, soils, and topography) and human-associated (cattle biomass, cropland area, and human population density) variables were assessed as potential drivers of pyrodiversity. Rainfall was the main environmental driver of pyrodiversity, with higher pyrodiversity in drier regions (< 650 mm yr(-1)). Pyrodiversity was not strongly associated with human-associated variables across Africa. Rainfall and a human influence index had clear but contrasting effects on the variability of fire size, seasonal timing, return interval, and intensity. Our analyses show that fire size and seasonal timing constrain pyrodiversity in wetter regions, whereas none of the fire attributes pose a strong constraint in drier regions. We found no evidence that pyrodiversity was spatial grain-dependent when recalculated at 5-minute grain increments from 15 to 120 minutes. We hypothesise that the strongest positive effect of pyrodiversity on biodiversity in all its forms will occur at intermediate precipitation (650-1300 mm yr(-1)), where fire plays an important role in shaping vegetation structure and where pyrodiversity is still quite high.

T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential indicator of the Earth's surface energy budget. It is essential for urban micro-climate change studies and acts as a controlling variable in climatic models. The present study, LST retrieves with the improved mono-window algorithm from the Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor Band 10. The proportion of vegetation cover coupled with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) used for the estimation of emissivity. The derived emissivity and surface temperature over different ground features have compared with field observation as well as those in the literature and found in an accepted range (error of around 1-2%). Herein, results show that the spatial distribution of surface temperature was significantly affected by landscape characteristics. The built-up and commercial/industrial areas display higher surface temperature in comparison with surrounding other vegetated lands. Whereas, the cooling effect towards the surrounding urban built-up area are found increasing in the vegetated area, and inside the green zones. A strong correlation is observed between the LST with NDVI over different land cover and land use (LCLU) classes. The Geoinformation technique provides a practical-based theoretical model of the land characterization of an urban thermal environment which assists in regional planning and decision-making process.

TI  - Simulating and understanding the gap outflow and oceanic response over the Gulf of Tehuantepec during GOTEX
T2  - DYNAMICS OF ATMOSPHERES AND OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tehuantepecer is a strong mountain gap wind traveling through Chivela Pass into eastern Pacific coast in southern Mexico, most commonly between October and February and brings huge impacts on local and surrounding meteorology and oceanography. Gulf of Tehuantepec EXperiment (GOTEX) was conducted in February 2004 to enhance the understanding of the strong offshore gap wind, ocean cooling, vertical circulations and interactions among them. The gap wind event during GOTEX was simulated using the U.S. Navy Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS (R)). The simulations are compared and validated with the observations retrieved from several satellites (GOES 10-12, MODIS/Aqua/Terra, TMI, and QuikSCAT) and Airborne EXpendable BathyThermograph (AXBT). The study shows that the gap wind outflow has a fanlike pattern expending from the coast and with a strong diurnal variability. The surface wind stress and cooling along the axis of the gap wind outflow caused intense upwelling and vertical mixing in the upper ocean; both contributed to the cooling of the ocean mixed layer under the gap wind. The cooling pattern of sea surface temperature (SST) also reflects temperature advection by the nearby ocean eddies to have a crescent shape.Two sensitivity experiments were conducted to understand the relative roles of the wind stress and heat flux on the ocean cooling. The control has more cooling right under the gap flow region than either the wind-stress-only or the heat-flux-only experiment. Overall, the wind stress has a slightly larger effect in bringing down the ocean temperature near the surface and plays a more important role in local ocean circulations beneath the mixed layer. The impact of surface heat flux on the ocean is more limited to the top 30 m within the mixed layer and is symmetric to the gap flow region by cooling the ocean under the gap flow region and reducing the warming on both sides. The effect of surface wind stress is to induce more cooling in the mixed layer under the gap wind through upwelling associated with Ekman divergence at the surface. Its effect deeper down is antisymmetric related to the nearby thermocline dome by inducing more upwelling to the east side of the gap flow region and more downwelling on the west side. Diagnostics from the mixed layer heat budget for the control and sensitivity experiments confirm that the surface heat flux has more influence on the broader area and the wind stress has more influence in a deeper region.

TI  - Biological data assimilation for parameter estimation of a phytoplankton functional type model for the western North Pacific
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem models are used to understand ecosystem dynamics and ocean biogeochemical cycles and require optimum physiological parameters to best represent biological behaviours. These physiological parameters are often tuned up empirically, while ecosystem models have evolved to increase the number of physiological parameters. We developed a three-dimensional (3-D) lower-trophic-level marine ecosystem model known as the Nitrogen, Silicon and Iron regulated Marine Ecosystem Model (NSI-MEM) and employed biological data assimilation using a micro-genetic algorithm to estimate 23 physiological parameters for two phytoplankton functional types in the western North Pacific. The estimation of the parameters was based on a one-dimensional simulation that referenced satellite data for constraining the physiological parameters. The 3-D NSI-MEM optimized by the data assimilation improved the timing of a modelled plankton bloom in the subarctic and subtropical regions compared to the model without data assimilation. Furthermore, the model was able to improve not only surface concentrations of phytoplankton but also their subsurface maximum concentrations. Our results showed that surface data assimilation of physiological parameters from two contrasting observatory stations benefits the representation of vertical plankton distribution in the western North Pacific.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING

AB  - We discuss enhanced processing methods for high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) to monitor small landslides with difficult spatial characteristics, such as very steep and rugged terrain, strong spatially heterogeneous surface motion, and coherence-compromising factors, including vegetation and seasonal snow cover. The enhanced methods mitigate phase bias induced by atmospheric effects, as well as topographic phase errors in coherent regions of layover, and due to inaccurate blending of high resolution discontinuous with lower resolution background Digital Surface Models (DSM). We demonstrate the proposed methods using TerraSAR-X (TSX) Staring Spotlight InSAR data for three test sites reflecting diverse challenging landslide-prone mountain terrains in British Columbia, Canada. Comparisons with corresponding standard processing methods show significant improvements with resulting displacement residuals that reveal additional movement hotspots and unprecedented spatial detail for active landslides/rockfalls at the investigated sites.

TI  - Daily Retrieval of NDVI and LAI at 3 m Resolution via the Fusion of CubeSat, Landsat, and MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Constellations of CubeSats are emerging as a novel observational resource with the potential to overcome the spatiotemporal constraints of conventional single-sensor satellite missions. With a constellation of more than 170 active CubeSats, Planet has realized daily global imaging in the RGB and near-infrared (NIR) at similar to 3 m resolution. While superior in terms of spatiotemporal resolution, the radiometric quality is not equivalent to that of larger conventional satellites. Variations in orbital configuration and sensor-specific spectral response functions represent an additional limitation. Here, we exploit a Cubesat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM) to optimize the utility and quality of very high-resolution CubeSat imaging. CESTEM represents a multipurpose data-driven scheme for radiometric normalization, phenology reconstruction, and spatiotemporal enhancement of biophysical properties via synergistic use of CubeSat, Landsat 8, and MODIS observations. Phenological reconstruction, based on original CubeSat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data derived from top of atmosphere or surface reflectances, is shown to be susceptible to large uncertainties. In comparison, a CESTEM-corrected NDVI time series is able to clearly resolve several consecutive multicut alfalfa growing seasons over a six-month period, in addition to providing precise timing of key phenological transitions. CESTEM adopts a random forest machine-learning approach for producing Landsat-consistent leaf area index (LAI) at the CubeSat scale with a relative mean absolute difference on the order of 4-6%. The CubeSat-based LAI estimates highlight the spatial resolution advantage and capability to provide temporally consistent and time-critical insights into within-field vegetation dynamics, the rate of vegetation green-up, and the timing of harvesting events that are otherwise missed by 8- to 16-day Landsat imagery.

TI  - Combining a Two Source Energy Balance Model Driven by MODIS and MSG-SEVIRI Products with an Aggregation Approach to Estimate Turbulent Fluxes over Sparse and Heterogeneous Vegetation in Sahel Region (Niger)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of turbulent fluxes (i.e., sensible and latent heat fluxes H and LE) over heterogeneous surfaces is not an easy task. The heterogeneity caused by the contrast in vegetation, hydric and soil conditions can generate a large spatial variability in terms of surface-atmosphere interactions. This study considered the issue of using a thermal-based two-source energy model (TSEB) driven by MODIS (Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and MSG (Meteosat Second Generation) observations in conjunction with an aggregation scheme to derive area-averaged H and LE over a heterogeneous watershed in Niamey, Niger (Wankama catchment). Data collected in the context of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) program, including a scintillometry campaign, were used to test the proposed approach. The model predictions of area-averaged turbulent fluxes were compared to data acquired by a Large Aperture Scintillometer (LAS) set up over a transect about 3.2 km-long and spanning three vegetation types (millet, fallow and degraded shrubs). First, H and LE fluxes were estimated at the MSG-SEVIRI grid scale by neglecting explicitly the subpixel heterogeneity. Moreover, the impact of upscaling the model's inputs was investigated using in-situ input data and three aggregation schemes of increasing complexity based on MODIS products: a simple averaging of inputs at the MODIS resolution scale, another simple averaging scheme that considers scintillometer footprint extent, and the weighted average of inputs based on the footprint weighting function. The H and LE simulated using the footprint weighted method were more accurate than for the two other aggregation rules despite the heterogeneity of the landscape. The statistical values are: correlation coefficient (R) = 0.71, root mean square error (RMSE) = 63 W/m(2) and mean bias error (MBE) = -23 W/m(2) for H and an R = 0.82, RMSE = 88 W/m(2) and MBE = 45 W/m(2) for LE. This study opens perspectives for the monitoring of convective and evaporative fluxes over heterogeneous landscape based on medium resolution satellite products.

TI  - The Impact of Hurricane Maria on the Vegetation of Dominica and Puerto Rico Using Multispectral Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the worst natural disaster on record in Dominica and Puerto Rico, Hurricane Maria in September 2017 had a large impact on the vegetation of these islands. In this paper, multitemporal Landsat 8 OLI and Sentinel-2 data are used to investigate vegetation damage on Dominica and Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria, and related influencing factors are analyzed. Moreover, the changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the year 2017 are compared to reference years (2015 and 2016). The results show that (1) there is a sudden drop in NDVI values after Hurricane Maria's landfall (decreased about 0.2) which returns to near normal vegetation after 1.5 months; (2) different land cover types have different sensitivities to Hurricane Maria, whereby forest is the most sensitive type, then followed by wetland, built-up, and natural grassland; and (3) for Puerto Rico, the vegetation damage is highly correlated with distance from the storm center and elevation. For Dominica, where the whole island is within Hurricane Maria's radius of maximum wind, the vegetation damage has no obvious relationship to elevation or distance. The study provides insight into the sensitivity and recovery of vegetation after a major land-falling hurricane, and may lead to improved vegetation protection strategies.

TI  - Characterization of Hydrogeological Properties in Salt Lake Valley, Utah, using InSAR
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Charactering subsurface aquifer systems is important not only to managing their long-term viability as a stable water source but also to protecting the residences and infrastructures. In particular, understanding how aquifer skeletons deform in response to hydraulic head changes requires hydrogeological parameters such as decay coefficient, storage coefficient, and bulk compressibility. Quantifying these key aquifer properties often requires the analysis of limited water gauge and drilling data. Here we investigate the spatiotemporal correlation between the vertical ground deformation derived by ENVISAT Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) and Sentinel-1A data sets and available hydrological records in order to improve the aquifer characterization under Salt Lake Valley, Utah. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar results show a clear long-term and seasonal correlation between surface uplift/subsidence and groundwater recharge/discharge, with evidence for the net uplift of 15mm/year of an area southwest of Salt Lake City for six years. The long-term uplift, bounded by faults and contained within the water discharge area, reflects a net increase in pore pressure associated with prolonged water recharge probably decades ago. The distribution of both previously mapped faults and newly mapped faults within the fields of deformation and the decay coefficient suggests that the faults disrupt the groundwater flow and partition the hydrological units. We also characterize human- and hydrological-triggered deformation by the features of seasonality and the deviation from the exponentially decaying model. By improving our ability to characterize aquifer structures, interferometric synthetic aperture radar analysis of surface deformation in combination with traditional hydrological monitoring data presents an opportunity to recognize and mitigate potential hazards.

TI  - Axillary ultrasound and fine needle aspiration biopsy in the preoperative diagnosis of axillary metastases in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - ONCOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The efficacy of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) following sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been questioned. The present study was performed to determine the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of axillary ultrasound (US) and fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) in the diagnosis of axillary metastases in patients with early breast cancer. A total of 214 patients with stage I and II breast cancer between June 2015 and January 2017 were included. All of the patients received axillary US as a primary investigation for lymph node status. US-guided FNAB was performed on suspicious lymph nodes. Those with non-suspicious and FNAB-negative axillary nodes proceeded to SLNB at the time of primary breast surgery. ALND was performed when the result of the US-guided FNAB was positive. The results of US and cytology were compared to histopathological results to determine their sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value and accuracy. A total of 76 out of 214 patients (35.5%) had axillary lymph node metastases at final histology. The sensitivity and specificity of axillary US alone were 59.2% (45/76) and 78.3% (108/138), respectively. Axillary US with FNAB identified 32 patients with positive lymph node metastases, and increased the sensitivity and specificity to 71.1% (32/45) and 100.0% (30/30). Combined with FNAB, the positive and negative predictive values were 100.0% (32/32) and 69.8% (30/43), respectively. Axillary US-alone or combined US/FNAB had a high accuracy rate and a satisfactory result as they cost less and it is easy to assess the status of axillary lymph nodes. Thus, axillary US with FNAB may avoid unnecessary SLNB in a significant number of patients.

TI  - Detecting, Extracting, and Monitoring Surface Water From Space Using Optical Sensors: A Review
T2  - REVIEWS OF GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Observation of surface water is a functional requirement for studying ecological and hydrological processes. Recent advances in satellite-based optical remote sensors have promoted the field of sensing surface water to a new era. This paper reviews the current status of detecting, extracting, and monitoring surface water using optical remote sensing, especially progress in the last decade. It also discusses the current status and challenges in this field, including spatio-temporal scale issues, integration with in situ hydrological data and elevation data, obscuration caused by clouds and vegetation, and the growing need to map surface water at a global scale. Historically, sensors have exhibited a contradiction in resolutions. Techniques including pixel unmixing and reconstruction, and spatio-temporal fusion have been developed to alleviate this contradiction. Spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water have been modeled by combining remote sensing data with in situ river flow. Recent studies have also demonstrated that the river discharge can be estimated using only optical remote sensing imagery, providing valuable information for hydrological studies in ungauged areas. Another historical issue for optical sensors has been obscuration by clouds and vegetation. An effective approach of reducing this limitation is to combine with synthetic aperture radar data. Digital elevation model data have also been employed to eliminate cloud/terrain shadows. The development of big data and cloud computation techniques makes the increasing demand of monitoring global water dynamics at high resolutions easier to achieve. An integrated use of multisource data is the future direction for improved global and regional water monitoring.Plain Language Summary Observing surface water is essential for ecological and hydrological studies. This paper reviews the current status of detecting, extracting, and monitoring surface water using optical remote sensing, especially progress in the last decade. It also discusses the current status and challenges in this field. For example, it was found that pixel unmixing and reconstruction, and spatio-temporal fusion are two common and low-cost approaches to enhance surface water monitoring. Remote sensing data have been integrated with in situ river flow to model spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water. Recent studies have also proved that the river discharge can be estimated using only optical remote sensing imagery. This will be a breakthrough for hydrological studies in ungauged areas. Optical sensors are also easily obscured by clouds and vegetation. This limitation can be reduced by integrating optical data with synthetic aperture radar data and digital elevation model data. There is increasing demand of monitoring global water dynamics at high resolutions. It is now easy to achieve with the development of big data and cloud computation techniques. Enhanced global or regional water monitoring in the future requires integrated use of multiple sources of remote sensing data.

And it remains unclear whether there was a change in emissivity during the rock loading process. Therefore, based on the spectral radiance observations in this paper, an experimental study involving the emissivity variation in the 8.0-13.0 m range for elastic loaded quartz sandstone under outdoor conditions was conducted. The experiments yield the following results. First, a variation in the stress condition led to the emissivity change in addition to the temperature change. The spectral radiance change was the combined result of the temperature changes and emissivity changes. Second, the emissivity changes linearly with the stress change, and the amplitude is relatively large in the 8.0-10.0 m range. The waveband features of emissivity variation are the main factor leading to the waveband features of stress-induced radiance change. Third, the explanations for the changes in temperature and emissivity during loading process are analyzed. And the significance and difficulty for further satellite remote sensing purpose is discussed. The experimental results provide an experimental foundation for crustal stress field monitoring.

TI  - No upward shift of alpine grassland distribution on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau despite rapid climate warming from 2000 to 2014
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The distributions of many species show climate-driven shifts towards higher elevations, but evidence for elevational shifts is scarce for the alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The upward shift of alpine grassland distribution from 2000 to 2014 was assessed with field measurements and satellite remote sensing data obtained across six elevational transects on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The aboveground biomass (AGB) of alpine grasslands varied with altitude and its data produced a bell-shaped curve. This was mainly due to the elevational dependency of climate change at the surface (i.e., producing drier climate at low elevations and wetter climate at middle elevations). The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro radiometer (MODIS) exhibited a positive exponential relationship with the AGB of alpine grasslands. Overall, MODIS NDVI initially increased, then peaked at median altitude sites, then decreased with altitude on each elevational transect. MODIS NDVI at the upper limit of alpine grassland distribution did not show a significant increasing trend from 2000 to 2014, even though land surface temperature increased and precipitation remained approximately constant. High spatial resolution Landsat data supported this result. Further analyses of MODIS NDVI at all other sites found no general increase in AGB towards higher elevations. The results suggest that the distribution of alpine grasslands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau did not show an upward shift despite rapid climate warming having occurred from 2000 to 2014.

TI  - Impact of same day vs day before pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy for sentinel lymph node biopsy for early breast cancer (local Australian experience)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING AND RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionTo assess the impact of delayed vs immediate pre-operative lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) for sentinel lymph node biopsy in a single Australian tertiary breast cancer centre.MethodsRetrospective cohort study analysing patients with breast cancer or DCIS who underwent lumpectomy or mastectomy with pre-operative LSG and intra-operative sentinel lymph node biopsy from January 2015 to June 2016.ResultsA total of 182 LSG were performed. Group A patients had day before pre-operative LSG mapping (n=79) and Group B had LSG mapping on the day of surgery (n=103). The overall LSG localisation rate was 97.3% and no statistical difference was detected between the two groups. The overall sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLN) were identified in 99.6% of patients. The number of nodes excised was slightly higher in Group A (1.90 vs 1.72); however, this was not statistically significant. In addition, the number of nodes on histopathology and the incidence of second echelon nodal detection were also similar between the two groups without statistical significance.ConclusionIn conclusion, the 2-day LSG protocol had no impact on overall SLNB and LSG detection rates although slightly higher second tier nodes but this did not translate to any difference between the number of harvest nodes between the two groups. The 2-day LSG allows for greater flexibility in theatre planning and more efficient use of theatre time. We recommend a dose of 40Mbq of Tc99m pertechnetate-labelled colloid be given day prior to surgery within a 24-hour timeframe.

TI  - The Impact of Death-Related Media Information on Consumer Value Orientation and Scope Sensitivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This research examines how incidental exposure to death-related information in the media affects consumers' value orientation and scope sensitivity to marketing stimuli. Five studies demonstrate that, in contrast to thoughts about one's own mortality, exposure to death-related information in the media can shift consumers' focus from extrinsic to intrinsic values. This leads them to pay less attention to the marketing stimuli, which are generally associated with extrinsic values, and consequently results in lower sensitivity to the magnitude of products and services. These effects are reversed when the marketing stimuli are associated with intrinsic values. Moreover, we found that exposure to death-related media information will generate effects similar to those of mortality salience when the information is perceived to be self-relevant and thus could induce death anxiety. The authors discuss implications and possible extensions.

AB  - In this review, I look at three recent publications from the University of Oklahoma Press by Joshua B. Nelson, David J. Carlson, and Julie L. Reed, whose respective monographs demonstrate novel critical approaches to the study of Indigenous literature and history in the US context. I outline the contours of these critics' respective interventions into the scholarly paradigms that have come to dominate Indigenous literary studies (Nelson), the emergent discourse of sovereignty at the intersection of law and literature (Carlson), and the value of analyzing historical documents from within a tribal worldview (Reed). Read together, these three texts provide a glimpse into some of the most current debates in the field of Indigenous studies in the humanities and social sciences.Cet article passe en revue trois publications recentes des Presses de l'Universite de l'Oklahoma, signees par Joshua B. Nelson, David J. Carlson et Julie L. Reed. Chacune de ces monographies illustre une approche critique originale de la litterature et de l'histoire autochtones en contexte etatsunien. Je situe les interventions respectives de ces auteurs par rapport aux paradigmes qui en sont venus a dominer les etudes litteraires autochtones a l'universite (Nelson), au discours sur la souverainete qui emerge actuellement a l'intersection du droit et de la litterature (Carlson), et a la valeur des analyses de documents historiques fondees sur une vision du monde tribale (Reed). Lus ensemble, ces trois ouvrages sont une fenetre ouverte sur certains des debats les plus actuels dans le domaine des etudes autochtones, en sciences humaines et sociales.

TI  - Utilization of drugs with pregnancy exposure registries during pregnancy
T2  - PHARMACOEPIDEMIOLOGY AND DRUG SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTo describe the utilization of drugs with pregnancy exposure registries by trimester during pregnancy, in comparison with matched nonpregnant episodes and a pre-pregnancy period.MethodsWe identified live-born deliveries from women aged 10 to 54years and matched the pregnancies 1:1 with nonpregnant episodes from a comparator cohort not delivering live-born infants, using data from 2001 to 2013 in the Sentinel Distributed Database. We evaluated the utilization of 34 drugs with pregnancy exposure registries, comparing utilization during pregnancy to the matched nonpregnant episodes, and to the 90days before pregnancy.ResultsWe identified 1895597 pregnancies ending in live births in 1598697 women and 1895597 matched nonpregnant episodes in 1582581 women. We observed a lower prevalence of use for most drugs during pregnancy compared with the matched nonpregnant episodes, and the 90-day pre-pregnancy period. The median (interquartile range) prevalence ratio of use, at any time during pregnancy, for all products was 0.2 (0.1-0.3) comparing pregnant to nonpregnant episodes. Overall, there was a decrease in drug utilization by trimester; from 2.6% in the 90days preceding pregnancy to 2.1% in the first trimester, 1.1% in the second trimester, and 0.9% in the third trimester.ConclusionsAmong drugs with pregnancy exposure registries, use was less during pregnancy compared with before pregnancy and to the matched nonpregnant episodes. The lower utilization during pregnancy suggests that women may be avoiding these drugs to minimize potentially harmful exposure during pregnancy. This lower utilization may increase the challenges of further studying the safety of these drugs using pregnancy exposure registries.

TI  - How to Identify the Research Abilities That Instructors Anticipate Students Will Develop in a Biochemistry Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE)
T2  - CBE-LIFE SCIENCES EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) have been described in a range of educational contexts. Although various anticipated learning outcomes (ALOs) have been proposed, processes for identifying them may not be rigorous or well documented, which can lead to inappropriate assessment and speculation about what students actually learn from CUREs. In this essay, we offer a user-friendly and rigorous approach based on evidence and an easy process to identify ALOs, namely, a five-step Process for Identifying Course-Based Undergraduate Research Abilities (PICURA), consisting of a content analysis, an open-ended survey, an interview, an alignment check, and a two-tiered Likert survey. The development of PICURA was guided by four criteria: 1) the process is iterative, 2) the overall process gives more insight than individual data sources, 3) the steps of the process allow for consensus across the data sources, and 4) the process allows for prioritization of the identified abilities. To address these criteria, we collected data from 10 participants in a multi-institutional biochemistry CURE. In this essay, we use two selected research abilities to illustrate how PICURA was used to identify and prioritize such abilities. PICURA could be applied to other CUREs in other contexts.

TI  - Assessing Single-Polarization and Dual-Polarization TerraSAR-X Data for Surface Water Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data classification methodologies were used to assess the ability of single-polarization and dual-polarization TerraSAR-X (TSX) data to classify surface water, including open water, ice, and flooded vegetation. Multi-polarization SAR observations contain more information than single-polarization SAR, but the availability of multi-polarization data is much lower, which limits the temporal monitoring capabilities. The study area is a principally natural landscape centered on a seasonally flooding river, in which four TSX dual-co-polarized images were acquired between the months of April and June 2016. Previous studies have shown that single-polarization SAR is useful for analyzing surface water extent and change using grey-level thresholding. The H-Alpha-Wishart decomposition, adapted to dual-polarization data, and the Kennaugh Element Framework were used to classify areas of water and flooded vegetation. Although grey-level thresholding was able to identify areas of water and non-water, the percentage of seasonal change was limited, indicating an increase in water area from 8% to 10%, which is in disagreement with seasonal trends. The dual-polarization methods show a decrease in water over the season and indicate a decrease in flooded vegetation, which agrees with expected seasonal variations. When comparing the two dual-polarization methods, a clear benefit of the Kennaugh Elements Framework is the ability to classify change in the transition zones of ice to open water, open water to marsh, and flooded vegetation to land, using the differential Kennaugh technique. The H-Alpha-Wishart classifier was not able to classify ice, and misclassified fields and ice as water. Although single-polarization SAR was effective in classifying open water, the findings of this study confirm the advantages of dual-polarization observations, with the Kennaugh Element Framework being the best performing classification framework.

TI  - Soil erosion assessment on hillslope of GCE using RUSLE model
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A new method for obtaining the C factor (i.e., vegetation cover and management factor) of the RUSLE model is proposed. The method focuses on the derivation of the C factor based on the vegetation density to obtain a more reliable erosion prediction. Soil erosion that occurs on the hillslope along the highway is one of the major problems in Malaysia, which is exposed to a relatively high amount of annual rainfall due to the two different monsoon seasons. As vegetation cover is one of the important factors in the RUSLE model, a new method that accounts for a vegetation density is proposed in this study. A hillslope near the Guthrie Corridor Expressway (GCE), Malaysia, is chosen as an experimental site whereby eight square plots with the size of and m are set up. A vegetation density available on these plots is measured by analyzing the taken image followed by linking the C factor with the measured vegetation density using several established formulas. Finally, erosion prediction is computed based on the RUSLE model in the Geographical Information System (GIS) platform. The C factor obtained by the proposed method is compared with that of the soil erosion guideline Malaysia, thereby predicted erosion is determined by both the C values. Result shows that the C value from the proposed method varies from 0.0162 to 0.125, which is lower compared to the C value from the soil erosion guideline, i.e., 0.8. Meanwhile predicted erosion computed from the proposed C value is between 0.410 and compared to 9.367 to range based on the C value of 0.8. It can be concluded that the proposed method of obtaining a reasonable C value is acceptable as the computed predicted erosion is found to be classified as a very low zone, i.e. less than whereas the predicted erosion based on the guideline has classified the study area as a low zone of erosion, i.e., between 10 and .

TI  - Soil salinity assessment through satellite thermography for different irrigated and rainfed crops
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of canopy thermography is an innovative approach for salinity stress detection in plants. But its applicability for landscape scale studies using satellite sensors is still not well investigated. The aim of this research is to test the satellite thermography soil salinity assessment approach on a study area with different crops, grown both in irrigated and rainfed conditions, to evaluate whether the approach has general applicability. Four study areas in four different states of Australia were selected to give broad representation of different crops cultivated under irrigated and rainfed conditions. The soil salinity map was prepared by the staff of Geoscience Australia and CSIRO Land and Water and it is based on thorough soil sampling together with environmental modelling. Remote sensing data was captured by the Landsat 5 TM satellite. In the analysis we used vegetation indices and brightness temperature as an indicator for canopy temperature. Applying analysis of variance and time series we have investigated the applicability of satellite remote sensing of canopy temperature as an approach of soil salinity assessment for different crops grown under irrigated and rainfed conditions. We concluded that in all cases average canopy temperatures were significantly correlated with soil salinity of the area. This relation is valid for all investigated crops, grown both irrigated and rainfed. Nevertheless, crop type does influence the strength of the relations. In our case cotton shows only minor temperature difference compared to other vegetation classes. The strongest relations between canopy temperature and soil salinity were observed at the moment of a maximum green biomass of the crops which is thus considered to be the best time for application of the approach.

TI  - Flow-induced horizontal and vertical vibration of sluice gates
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on out-of-plane and in-plane vibrations of sluice gates due to the fluid-structure interaction based on numerical modelling, using the finite-element method. Primarily, the vibration of the gate was restricted to a single direction, detaching the horizontal and vertical vibrations of the gate so as to exclude their interaction. Results indicated that, if the edge of the gate is bevelled at an angle of 45 degrees, the lowest amplitudes of horizontal vibrations are obtained. Whereas the maximum horizontal vibrations are associated with the uppermost values of the reduced velocities, for example v(r) > 3.5, as well as the gate's normalised opening height delta/d of about 0.8, the maximum vertical vibrations are attained for intermediate values of v(r), at about 3, and delta/d = 0.8. If both the horizontal and vertical vibrations are mutually considered, the two-dimensional reduced velocities v(rx) and v(ry) and the structural natural frequencies f(x) and f(y) become relatively different compared to these of single-way vibrations. Results also indicated that the amplitudes of the horizontal vibrations in the authors' previous analyses were considerably greater than those of single-way horizontal vibrations. The maximum amplitude of the horizontal vibrations was observed to be close to the out-of-plane natural frequency, when 3.5 < v(rx) < 7 and v(ry) > 10. For vibration frequencies close to the vertical natural frequency f(y), however, the dominant vertical vibrations occur for 2 < v(ry)< 4.

TI  - Mapping wetlands in Nova Scotia with multi-beam RADARSAT-2 Polarimetric SAR, optical satellite imagery, and Lidar data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland maps currently in use by the Province of Nova Scotia, namely the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) wetland inventory map and the swamp wetland classes of the DNR forest map, need to be updated. In this study, wetlands were mapped in an area southwest of Halifax, Nova Scotia by classifying a combination of multi date and multi-beam RADARSAT-2 C-band polarimetric SAR (poISAR) images with spring Lidar, and fall QuickBird optical data using the Random Forests (RF) classifier. The resulting map has five wetland classes (open-water/marsh complex, open bog, open fen, shrub/treed fen/bog, swamp), plus lakes and various upland classes. Its accuracy was assessed using data from 156 GPS wetland sites collected in 2012 and compared to the one obtained with the current wetland map of Nova Scotia. The best overall classification was obtained using a combination of Lidar, RADARSAT-2 HH, HV, VH, VV intensity with polarimetric variables, and QuickBird multispectral (89.2%). The classified image was compared to GPS validation sites to assess the mapping accuracy of the wetlands. It was first done considering a group consisting of all wetland classes including lakes. This showed that only 69.9% of the wetland sites were correctly identified when only the QuickBird classified image was used in the classification. With the addition of variables derived from lidar, the number of correctly identified wetlands increased to 88.5%. The accuracy remained the same with the addition of RADARSAT-2 (88.5%). When we tested the accuracy for identifying wetland classes (e.g. marsh complex vs. open bog) instead of grouped wetlands, the resulting wetland map performed best with either QuickBird and Lidar, or QuickBird, Lidar, and RADARSAT-2 (66%). The Province of Nova Scotia's current wetland inventory and its associated wetland classes (aerial-photo interpreted) were also assessed against the GPS wetland sites. This provincial inventory correctly identified 62.2% of the grouped wetlands and only 18.6% of the wetland classes. The current inventory's poor performance demonstrates the value of incorporating a combination of new data sources into the provincial wetland mapping.

AB  - We audited whether F-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography ((18)FDG PET-CT) imaging could discriminate between different diagnoses in HIV-infected patients presenting with lymphadenopathy, with or without fever and/or splenomegaly. Maximum standardised uptake (SUVmax) values were similar in lymphoma and mycobacterial and fungal infections and were lower but similar in those with human herpesvirus (HHV) 8-associated disease and HIV-associated reactive lymphadenopathy. Nodal (18)FDG avidity, with SUVmax 10, excluded diagnoses of HHV 8-associated disease and miscellaneous conditions, and HIV-associated reactive lymphadenopathy was additionally excluded in those who had undetectable plasma HIV viral loads. This audit suggests (18)FDG PET-CT imaging did not permit discrimination between specific diagnoses but has utility in identifying lymph nodes with increased avidity that could be targeted for biopsy and in ruling out significant pathology.

TI  - Assessment of spatio-temporal changes in terrestrial carbon sequestration due to Kochi metro rail project in India
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Major infrastructure projects can cause sizeable reduction in the urban tree cover thereby affecting terrestrial carbon sequestration potential of cities. This study investigated the spatio-temporal changes occurred in terrestrial carbon sequestration due to the metro rail project at Kochi city in India during the years 2013 to 2015. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) estimated from IRS-P6 LISS IV satellite sensor data was used to detect the tree cover change and for the quantification of carbon stock. An urban carbon storage equation was used to estimate the carbon content from NDVI values. Stock difference approach was used to estimate the change in carbon sequestration due to the construction of metro rail. Results indicated reduction of 14.51 ha of tree cover area within a distance of 60 m from the center-line of metro rail during the study period. Study found that 2316 tCO2e was emitted as a result of cutting urban trees for the metro rail. Such an emission was overlooked while estimating the emission reduction due to the promotion of public transport. This study points to the need for estimating the impacts of major urban infrastructure projects to the global climate in addition to assessing their mostly localized environmental impacts.

T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - The interpretation of classes and change detection in the vegetation cover of large areas are activities that are made possible by the use of technologies and methods associated to Remote Sensing. Satellite images of medium and high spatial and spectral resolution are fundamental tools for the execution of projects with objectives of classification of vegetal cover and detection of its temporal variations. To exploit the use of digital information of territory recovered by the satellite images, and in order to optimize the resources invested in the tasks of classification and interpretation, it is necessary to have tools and methods that allow the automation of the processes involved and prove to be the Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) an adequate mechanism for the execution of these processes. The main objective of this work is to validate a methodology for the identification of changes in the vegetation cover of an area located in the Ecuadorian Amazon. The applied methodology seeks the change detection in the coverage of native forests prevailing in the study region.

TI  - Estimation of Surface Solar Radiation using Ground-based Remote Sensing Data on the Seoul Metropolitan Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Solar energy is calculated using meteorological (14 station), ceilometer (2 station) and microwave radiometer (MWR, 7 station)) data observed from the Weather Information Service Engine (WISE) on the Seoul metropolitan area. The cloud optical thickness and the cloud fraction are calculated using the back-scattering coefficient (BSC) of the ceilometer and liquid water path of the MWR. The solar energy on the surface is calculated using solar radiation model with cloud fraction from the ceilometer and the MWR. The estimated solar energy is underestimated compared to observations both at Jungnang and Gwanghwamun stations. In linear regression analysis, the slope is less than 0.8 and the bias is negative which is less than -20 W/m(2). The estimated solar energy using MWR is more improved (i.e., deterministic coefficient (average R-2=0.8) and Root Mean Square Error (average RMSE=110 W/m(2))) than when using ceilometer. The monthly cloud fraction and solar energy calculated by ceilometer is greater than 0.09 and lower than 50 W/m(2) compared to MWR. While there is a difference depending on the locations, RMSE of estimated solar radiation is large over 50 W/m(2) in July and September compared to other months. As a result, the estimation of a daily accumulated solar radiation shows the highest correlation at Gwanghwamun (R-2=0.80, RMSE=2.87 MJ/day) station and the lowest correlation at Gooro (R-2=0.63, RMSE=4.77 MJ/day) station.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of sea surface temperature (SST) on spatial distribution of chlorophyll-α concentration in the East China Sea
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we analyze spatial and temporal sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophylla (Chl-a) concentration in the East China Sea (ECS) during the period 2003-2016. Level 3 (4 km) monthly SST and Chl-a data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Satellite (MODIS-Aqua) were reconstructed using the data interpolation empirical orthogonal function (DINEOF) method and used to evaluated the relationship between the two variables. The approaches employed included correlation analysis, regression analysis, and so forth. Our results show that certain strong oceanic SSTs affect Chl-a concentration, with particularly high correlation seen in the coastal area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. The mean temperature of the high correlated region was 18.67 degrees C. This finding may suggest that the SST has an important impact on the spatial distribution of Chl-a concentration in the ECS.

TI  - Nonlocal Tensor Completion for Multitemporal Remotely Sensed Images' Inpainting
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed images may contain some missing areas because of poor weather conditions and sensor failure. Information of those areas may play an important role in the interpretation of multitemporal remotely sensed data. This paper aims at reconstructing the missing information by a nonlocal low-rank tensor completion method. First, nonlocal correlations in the spatial domain are taken into account by searching and grouping similar image patches in a large search window. Then, low rankness of the identified fourth-order tensor groups is promoted to consider their correlations in spatial, spectral, and temporal domains, while reconstructing the underlying patterns. Experimental results on simulated and real data demonstrate that the proposed method is effective both qualitatively and quantitatively. In addition, the proposed method is computationally efficient compared with other patch-based methods such as the recently proposed patch matching-based multitemporal group sparse representation method.

TI  - Changes in the Lake Area of Tonle Sap: Possible Linkage to Runoff Alterations in the Lancang River?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tonle Sap Lake is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia. Water development infrastructures are increasingly being constructed in the Lancang-Mekong River Basin, which is a major concern considering its potential impact on Tonle Sap Lake. This study aimed to investigate variations in the area of the lake and discuss their possible linkage to runoff alterations in the Lancang River (Upper Mekong) by comparing runoff at the Yunjinghong hydrological station before and after significant changes in runoff trends that occurred in 2008. First, four commonly used water body extraction methods (MNDWI, NDWI, NDVI, and EVI) were compared and MNDWI was found to provide a better and more stable performance. Based on MOD09A1 data, MNDWI was used to extract the water area of the lake from 2000 to 2014, and characteristics of variations in the area before and after 2008 were analyzed. The water area of Tonle Sap Lake displayed an overall decreasing trend, and specifically decreased by 8.3% during the flood season and by 1.5% on average during the dry season after 2008. Seasonal variations in the water area of Tonle Sap Lake were dominantly influenced by runoff from the Mekong River. Compared with the period 2000-2007, runoff at Yunjinghong station were increased during the dry season (20.74%) and decreased during the flood season (34.25%) between 2008 and 2014. Changes in upstream runoff contributed to runoff at the Stung Treng station in the lower Mekong River by 6.17% (dry season) and -2.41% (flood season). Evidently, the operation of dams in the Lancang River does not primarily account for the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake during the flood season. In contrast, runoff increase during the dry season mitigates the area decrease of Tonle Sap Lake to a certain extent.

TI  - Multi-Scale Residual Convolutional Neural Network for Haze Removal of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Haze removal is a pre-processing step that operates on at-sensor radiance data prior to the physically based image correction step to enhance hazy imagery visually. Most current haze removal methods focus on point-to-point operations and utilize information in the spectral domain, without taking consideration of the multi-scale spatial information of haze. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale residual convolutional neural network (MRCNN) for haze removal of remote sensing images. MRCNN utilizes 3D convolutional kernels to extract spatial-spectral correlation information and abstract features from surrounding neighborhoods for haze transmission estimation. It takes advantage of dilated convolution to aggregate multi-scale contextual information for the purpose of improving its prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, residual learning is utilized to avoid the loss of weak information while deepening the network. Our experiments indicate that MRCNN performs accurately, achieving an extremely low validation error and testing error. The haze removal results of several scenes of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data show that the visibility of the dehazed images is significantly improved, and the color of recovered surface is consistent with the actual scene. Quantitative analysis proves that the dehazed results of MRCNN are superior to the traditional methods and other networks. Additionally, a comparison to haze-free data illustrates the spectral consistency after haze removal and reveals the changes in the vegetation index.

TI  - Estimation of Daily Evapotranspiration Using Instantaneous Decoupling Coefficient From the MODIS and Field Data
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Fort Worth, TX
AB  - Daily evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance among various practical applications including water management, drought monitoring, and climate change study. The ET estimations from remotely sensed models are usually instantaneous values. Various upscaling methods have been developed to extrapolate the instantaneous ET to daily scale. In the applications of these methods, the accuracy of daily ET estimation relies on both the accuracy of instantaneous ET calculation and the upscaling methods. This paper used the decoupling model to estimate daily ET directly, according to the constancy of the decoupling coefficient (Omega) in the model in a diurnal cycle, without the calculation of instantaneous ET. The estimated daily ET was compared with the Eddy covariance measurements which were corrected by the Bowen ratio method to close the energy imbalances. The result from field data alone showed that the coefficient of determination (R-2) of daily ET estimation was 0.860, with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 18.2 W/m(2), and a bias of -4.7 W/m(2). Combining MODIS data and field data, the estimated daily ET had a R2 of 0.860, a RMSE of 21.6 W/m(2), and a bias of -5.0 W/m(2). Therefore, it is feasible and effective to obtain daily ET using remote-sensing based instantaneous Omega to replace daily value in the decoupling model.

TI  - Geometric Positioning Accuracy Improvement of ZY-3 Satellite Imagery Based on Statistical Learning Theory
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing demand for high-resolution remote sensing images for mapping and monitoring the Earth's environment, geometric positioning accuracy improvement plays a significant role in the image preprocessing step. Based on the statistical learning theory, we propose a new method to improve the geometric positioning accuracy without ground control points (GCPs). Multi-temporal images from the ZY-3 satellite are tested and the bias-compensated rational function model (RFM) is applied as the block adjustment model in our experiment. An easy and stable weight strategy and the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding (FIST) algorithm which is widely used in the field of compressive sensing are improved and utilized to define the normal equation matrix and solve it. Then, the residual errors after traditional block adjustment are acquired and tested with the newly proposed inherent error compensation model based on statistical learning theory. The final results indicate that the geometric positioning accuracy of ZY-3 satellite imagery can be improved greatly with our proposed method.

TI  - Deriving temporally continuous soil moisture estimations at fine resolution by downscaling remotely sensed product
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface soil moisture (SSM) has important roles in the energy balance of the land surface and in the water cycle. Downscaling of coarse-resolution SSM remote sensing products is an efficient way for producing fine resolution data. However, the downscaling methods used most widely require full-coverage visible/infrared satellite data as ancillary information. These methods are restricted to cloud-free days, making them unsuitable for continuous monitoring. The purpose of this study is to overcome this limitation to obtain temporally continuous fine-resolution SSM estimations. The local spatial heterogeneities of SSM and multiscale ancillary variables were considered in the downscaling process both to solve the problem of the strong variability of SSM and to benefit from the fusion of ancillary information. The generation of continuous downscaled remote sensing data was achieved via two principal steps. For cloud-free days, a stepwise hybrid geostatistical downscaling approach, based on geographically weighted area-to-area regression Icriging (GWATARK), was employed by combining multiscale ancillary variables with passive microwave remote sensing data. Then, the GWATARK-estimated SSM and China Soil Moisture Dataset from Microwave Data Assimilation SSM data were combined to estimate fine-resolution data for cloudy days. The developed methodology was validated by application to the 25-km resolution daily AMSR-E SSM product to produce continuous SSM estimations at 1-km resolution over the Tibetan Plateau. In comparison with ground-based observations, the downscaled estimations showed correlation (R >= 0.7) for both ascending and descending overpasses. The analysis indicated the high potential of the proposed approach for producing a temporally continuous SSM product at fine spatial resolution.

TI  - Indicator-based assessment of post-fire recovery dynamics using satellite NDVI time-series
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire disturbance severely modifies ecosystem structure and functioning, and therefore predicting post-fire responses is pivotal to improve land management. Indicators that efficiently link post-fire recovery with a timely decision on landscape management can play a key role in the governance of fire risk. We describe a framework to evaluate post-fire recovery based on remotely-sensed measures of relative vegetation recovery, calculated from satellite NDVI time-series. Three indicators are proposed: the novel Cumulative Relative Recovery Index (CRRI), measuring the (mid-long term) extent and completeness of recovery; the Recovery Trend Index (RTI), measuring the steepness of the mid-term post-fire recovery trend; and the Half Recovery Time index (HRT), a measure of the short-term recovery rate. We used Random Forest (RF) models to predict the observed recovery patterns and ranked the predictive importance of several candidate explanatory factors. The performance of RF models ranged from good (CRRI, RTI) to moderate (HRT). Three sets of predictive variables consistently ranked higher: fire traits, landscape composition, and post-fire climatic conditions. The relative contribution of individual variables was different across recovery indicators. These results show that proposed indicators seem to capture different facets of the post-fire recovery process. The short-term recovery indicator (HRT) was linked to landscape composition and post-fire climate. Thus, HRT expresses the speed of initial recovery, related to differences in fire-response traits of vegetation and to climatic conditions immediately following fire. The mid-term recovery indicator (RTI) was mainly influenced by fire traits and post-fire climatic conditions. This indicator captures multiple interacting effects that shape the recovery process related to fire severity, vegetation type and post-fire conditions. Finally, the long-term recovery indicator (CRRI) was clearly more influenced by fire attributes related to severity than by vegetation type and structure or by post-fire climatic conditions. Overall, our results suggest that a combination of biotic processes (driven by plant life-history traits) and abiotic filters (e.g., post fire climate) determine the early post-fire recovery process. Conversely, the mid to long-term recovery response (expressing its completeness) is driven by the depletion of resilience capacity and by the amount of change in vegetation structure and functioning modulated by spatial differences in fire severity. Our results strongly suggest that an indicator-based approach grounded on satellite time-series of vegetation indices can effectively cover various facets of post-fire recovery. This will improve the monitoring and prediction of post-fire recovery dynamics, with valuable applications in fire hazard management and post-fire ecosystem restoration and monitoring.

TI  - Evaluating the portability of satellite derived chlorophyll-<i>a</i> algorithms for temperate inland lakes using airborne hyperspectral imagery and dense surface observations
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the performances of twenty-nine algorithms that use satellite-based spectral imager data to derive estimates of chlorophyll-a concentrations that, in turn, can be used as an indicator of the general status of algal cell densities and the potential for a harmful algal bloom (HAB). The performance assessment was based on making relative comparisons between two temperate inland lakes: Harsha Lake (7.99 km(2)) in Southwest Ohio and Taylorsville Lake (11.88 km(2)) in central Kentucky. Of interest was identifying algorithm-imager combinations that had high correlation with coincident chlorophyll-a surface observations for both lakes, as this suggests portability for regional HAB monitoring. The spectral data utilized to estimate surface water chlorophyll-a concentrations were derived from the airborne Compact Airborne Spectral Imager (CASI) 1500 hyperspectral imager, that was then used to derive synthetic versions of currently operational satellite-based imagers using spatial resampling and spectral binning. The synthetic data mimics the configurations of spectral imagers on current satellites in earth's orbit including, WorldView-2/3, Sentinel-2, Landsat-8, Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS). High correlations were found between the direct measurement and the imagery-estimated chlorophyll-a concentrations at both lakes. The results determined that eleven out of the twenty-nine algorithms were considered portable, with r(2) values greater than 0.5 for both lakes. Even though the two lakes are different in terms of background water quality, size and shape, with Taylorsville being generally less impaired, larger, but much narrower throughout, the results support the portability of utilizing a suite of certain algorithms across multiple sensors to detect potential algal blooms through the use of chlorophyll-a as a proxy. Furthermore, the strong performance of the Sentinel-2 algorithms is exceptionally promising, due to the recent launch of the second satellite in the constellation, which will provide higher temporal resolution for temperate inland water bodies. Additionally, scripts were written for the open-source statistical software R that automate much of the spectral data processing steps. This allows for the simultaneous consideration of numerous algorithms across multiple imagers over an expedited time frame for the near real-time monitoring required for detecting algal blooms and mitigating their adverse impacts.

TI  - The advective origin of an under-ice spring bloom in the Arctic Ocean using multiple observational platforms
T2  - POLAR BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Under-ice blooms of phytoplankton in the Chukchi Sea have been observed, with strong implications for our understanding of the production regimes in the Arctic Ocean. Using a combination of satellite remote sensing of phytoplankton biomass, in situ observations under sea ice from an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), and in vivo photophysiology, we examined the composition, magnitude and origin of a bloom detected beneath the sea ice Northwest of Svalbard (Southern Yermak Plateau) in May 2010. In situ concentration of up to 20 mg chlorophyll a [Chl a] m(-3), were dominated by the northern planktonic spring species of diatoms, Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii, T. antarctica var. borealis, Chaetoceros socialis species complex and Fragilariopsis oceanica. These species were also found south of the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Cells in the water column under the sea ice were typically high-light acclimated, with a mean light saturation index (E (k) ) of 138 mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1) and a ratio between photoprotective carotenoids (PPC) and Chl a (w:w) of 0.2. Remotely sensed data of [Chl a] showed a 32,000 km(2) bloom developing south of the MIZ. In effect, our data suggest that the observed under-ice bloom was in fact a bloom developed in open waters south of the ice edge, and that a combination of northward-flowing water masses and southward drifting sea ice effectively positioned the bloom under the sea ice. This have implications for our general understanding of under-ice blooms, suggesting that their origin and connection with open water may be different in different regions of the Arctic.

TI  - Tyrosine hydroxylase as a sentinel for central and peripheral tissue responses in Parkinson's progression: Evidence from clinical studies and neurotoxin models
T2  - PROGRESS IN NEUROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. While the typical motor symptoms of PD are well known, the lesser known non-motor symptoms can also greatly impact the patient's quality of life. These symptoms often appear before motor impairment, therefore identifying biomarkers that may predict PD risk or pathology has been a major and challenging endeavour. Given that the loss of dopamine, and its rate limiting enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) occurs in PD, the expression and accompanying post-translational changes in TH during PD progression could yield insight into the disruption of cellular signalling occurring in the CNS, and also in peripheral tissues wherein catecholamine function plays a role. Furthermore, changes in expression and phosphorylation of TH in the brain and periphery can potentially reveal how TH stability and function are compromised in PD. As such, these changes can reveal how catecholamine synthesis capacity is gradually compromised and how changes in cellular signalling may govern the functional status of remaining catecholaminergic neurons. This review summarises the findings of clinical PD and neurotoxin models of PD that assessed TH expression or phosphorylation in catecholaminergic pathways in the brain and relevant peripheral tissues. We propose that establishing similar changes in TH expression and function in the CNS and periphery of established neurotoxin models can be a potential reference for comparison to changes in TH in human peripheral tissues. These changes in TH expression and phosphorylation may have predictive validity to estimate risk of PD progression before motor impairment is evident.

TI  - Consistent pan-sharpening based on multistage joint and dual bilateral filters
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A pan-sharpening method using joint and dual bilateral filters (DBFs) has been proposed. This approach is based on a consistent combination of large- and small-scale features obtained from the decomposition of high spectral resolution multispectral (MS) and high spatial resolution panchromatic (PAN) images. In the decomposition process, MS and PAN images are used to extract the features using joint and DBFs, respectively. These filters accommodate the relationship between MS and PAN images and decompose them into a base layer (large-scale) and a detail layer (small-scale). Since the joint bilateral filter (JBF) preserves the edges of an auxiliary image, it is used for decomposition of MS images where different layers are estimated using the PAN image as an auxiliary image. Similarly, different layers of the PAN image are obtained from a DBF which preserves the edges of both (MS and PAN) input images. This process is further extended to multistage decomposition to obtain a bilateral image pyramid. The base and detail layers of both MS and PAN images obtained at various stages are combined using a weighted sum. Finally, the estimated weighted sum of detail layer (small-scale) of the PAN image is fused separately to the weighted base layers (large-scale) of the MS images. Performance of the proposed method is evaluated by conducting the experiments on degraded as well as undegraded datasets, captured using different satellites such as Quickbird, Ikonos-2, and Worldview-2. The noise rejection capabilities of the proposed method are also tested by conducting experiments on the noisy data. The results are compared with the widely popular methods and the recently proposed fusion approaches based on a bilateral filter. Along with qualitative evaluation, the quantitative performance of the proposed fusion technique has also been verified by estimating different measures for degraded and undegraded experiments. The experimental results and quantitative measures demonstrate that the proposed method performs better in degraded and undegraded conditions along with noisy situations when compared to other state-of-art methods.

TI  - On the Use of CALIPSO Land Surface Returns to Retrieve Aerosol and Cloud Optical Depths
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of aerosol and cloud radiative properties, optical depth (OD), and phase function is of high importance to quantify the human impact on climate. Several approaches now exist based on both active (lidar) and passive (spectroradiometers) sensors. However, passive space observations over land are hindered by the important contribution of the surface to the total reflectance. Retrievals of OD from backscatter lidars do not face this issue but are usually based on the use of an a priori value of the so-called lidar ratio, which may lead to a significant uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to analyze a possible path for the space borne backscatter lidar onboard the Cloud Aerosol Lidar Pathfinder Observations satellite to overcome those issues. We will discuss the space-borne retrievals of ODs based on the land surface returns, either in combination with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer or as a stand-alone lidar method. Analyses will be presented for a few cases on different surface types. The different error sources are discussed and further solutions to reduce them are explored. We show that the surface types have different polarization and multispectral properties, which can open new research areas based on space lidars. Using such an approach, we show that a retrieval technique based on the use of lidar land surface returns can be used to directly retrieve OD of aerosols and semitransparent cloud.

TI  - TISSBERT: A benchmark for the validation and comparison of NDVI time series reconstruction methods
T2  - REVISTA DE TELEDETECCION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces the Time Series Simulation for Benchmarking of Reconstruction Techniques (TISSBERT) dataset, intended to provide a benchmark for the validation and comparison of time series reconstruction methods. Such methods are routinely used to estimate vegetation characteristics from optical remotely sensed data, where the presence of clouds decreases the usefulness of the data. As for their validation, these methods have been compared with previously published ones, although with different approaches, which sometimes lead to contradictory results. We designed the TISSBERT dataset to be generic so that it could simulate realistic reference and cloud-contaminated time series at global scale. To that end, we estimated both cloud-free and cloud-contaminated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) statistics for randomly selected control points and each day of the year from the Long Term Data Record Version 4 (LTDR-V4) dataset by assuming different statistical distributions. The best approach was then applied to the whole dataset, and validity of the results were estimated through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic. The dataset elaboration is described thoroughly along with how to use it. The advantages and drawbacks of this dataset are then discussed, which emphasize the realistic simulation of the cloud-contaminated and reference time series. This dataset can be obtained from the authors upon demand. It will be used in a next paper to compare widely used NDVI time series reconstruction methods.

TI  - Characteristics of Ethiopia Air Chemistry and Its Meteorological Context
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The concentration of trace gases and aerosols in Ethiopia is poorly characterized due to a limited history of surface measurements. Here, satellite measurements and model estimates of atmospheric composition are employed to understand space-time distributions in the period 2000-16. Methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) display high concentrations over the highlands and provide a focus for analysis of monthly and daily data. CH4 emissions from livestock peak at the beginning of the dry season, while CO from biomass burning rises at the end of the dry season. The seasonal cycle of dust, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and CO2 is inversely related with CH4, while CO closely follows sensible heat flux, thus linking drying and rural biomass burning. Stable easterly flow in the dry season accumulates local emissions, so near-surface concentrations of CO and CH4 are high then. The weather pattern underlying an episode of high nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations was studied. In addition to a stable lapse rate and dry anticyclonic weather, midtropospheric subsidence was related to intrusion of the northern subtropical jet stream on 24-26 December 2010. The wind shadow was cast by the Rift Escarpment limited dispersion, particularly with the dry, stable weather conditions. A key outcome of this work is that CH4 concentrations over Ethiopia are high in global context and have increased >0.1 ppm from 2002 to 2016; hence, there is a need to improve livestock management and production efficiency.

TI  - Numerical simulations to quantify the diurnal contrast in local climate trend induced by desert urbanization
T2  - Environment Systems & Decisions
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of urbanization on local climate is quantified by numerical simulations for five desert cities that represent a wide range of urban size, climate zone, and composition of land cover. Land-use land cover maps generated from Landsat data for 1985 and 2010, chosen as the start and end of a period of rapid urbanization, are used to constrain the surface boundary conditions for the numerical model. In this manner, this study focuses on the particular aspect of the effect of land-use changes on local climate. Within this scope, the results reveal a pattern of the climatic effect of desert urbanization with nighttime warming and weaker, but significant daytime cooling. This effect is confined to the urban area and is not sensitive to the size of the city or the detailed land cover types in the surrounding areas. The pattern is identified in both winter and summer. Exceptions to this pattern are found in a small number of cases when the noisiness of local circulation, specifically monsoon and land-sea breeze, overwhelms the climatic signal induced by land-use changes. The inter-cities' differences in the temperature response to land-use change are also discussed.

TI  - Outcomes of Node-positive Breast Cancer Patients Treated With Accelerated Partial Breast Irradiation Via Multicatheter Interstitial Brachytherapy <i>The Pooled Registry of Multicatheter Interstitial Sites</i> <i>(PROMIS) Experience</i>
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY-CANCER CLINICAL TRIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: To report outcomes for breast-conserving therapy using adjuvant accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) with interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy in node-positive compared with node-negative patients.Materials and Methods: From 1992 to 2013, 1351 patients (1369 breast cancers) were treated with breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant APBI using interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy. A total of 907 patients (835 node negative, 59 N1a, and 13 N1mic) had > 1 year of data available and nodal status information and are the subject of this analysis. Median age (range) was 59 years old (22 to 90 y). T stage was 90% T1 and ER/PR/Her2 was positive in 87%, 71%, and 7% Mean number of axillary nodes removed was 12 (SD, 6). Cox multivariate analysis for local/regional control was performed using age, nodal stage, ER/PR/Her2 receptor status, tumor size, grade, margin, and adjuvant chemotherapy/antiestrogen therapy.Results: The mean (SD) follow-up was 7.5 years (4.6). The 5-year actuarial local control (95% confidence interval) m node-negative versus node-positive patients was 96.3% (94.5-97.5) versus 95.8% (87.6-98.6) (P= 0.62). The 5-year actuarial regional control in node-negative versus node-positive patients was 98.5% (97.3-99.2) versus 96.7% (87.4-99.2) (P= 0.33). The 5-year actuarial freedom from distant metastasis and cause-specific survival were significantly lower in node-positive versus node-negative patients at 92.3% (82.4-96.7) versus 97.8% (96.3-98.7) (P=0.006) and 91.3% (80.2-96.3) versus 98.7% (97.3-99.3) (P = 0.0001). Overall survival was not significantly different. On multivariate analysis age 50 years and below, Her2 positive, positive margin status, and not receiving chemotherapy or antiestrogen therapy were associated with a higher risk of local/ regional recurrence.Conclusions: Patients who have had an axillary lymph node dissection and limited node-positive disease may be candidates for treatment with APBI. Further research is ultimately needed to better define specific criteria for APBI in node-positive patients.

TI  - Object-Based Multipass InSAR via Robust Low-Rank Tensor Decomposition
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The most unique advantage of multipass synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) is the retrieval of long-term geophysical parameters, e.g., linear deformation rates, over large areas. Recently, an object-based multipass InSAR framework has been proposed by Kang, as an alternative to the typical single-pixel methods, e.g., persistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), or pixel-cluster-based methods, e.g., SqueeSAR. This enables the exploitation of inherent properties of InSAR phase stacks on an object level. As a follow-on, this paper investigates the inherent low rank property of such phase tensors and proposes a Robust Multipass InSAR technique via Object-based low rank tensor decomposition. We demonstrate that the filtered InSAR phase stacks can improve the accuracy of geophysical parameters estimated via conventional multipass InSAR techniques, e.g., PSI, by a factor of 10-30 in typical settings. The proposed method is particularly effective against outliers, such as pixels with unmodeled phases. These merits, in turn, can effectively reduce the number of images required for a reliable estimation. The promising performance of the proposed method is demonstrated using high-resolution TerraSAR-X image stacks.

TI  - Simplifying Logistics and Avoiding the Unnecessary in Patients With Breast Cancer Undergoing Sentinel Node Biopsy. A Prospective Feasibility Trial of the Preoperative Injection of Super Paramagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Sentinel node is routinely localized with the intraoperative use of a radioactive tracer, involving challenging logistics. Super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle is a non-radioactive tracer with comparable performance that could allow for preoperative localization, would simplify the procedure, and possibly be of value in axillary mapping before neoadjuvant treatment. The current trial aimed to determine the a priori hypothesis that the injection of super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the preoperative period for the localization of the sentinel node is feasible.Methods: This is a prospective feasibility trial, conducted from 9 September 2014 to 22 October 2014 at Uppsala University Hospital. In all, 12 consecutive patients with primary breast cancer planned for resection of the primary and sentinel node biopsy were recruited. Super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were injected in the preoperative visit in the outpatient clinic. The radioactive tracer ((99)mTc) and the blue dye were injected perioperatively in standard fashion. A volunteer was injected with super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles to follow the decline in the magnetic signal in the sentinel node over time. The primary outcome was successful sentinel node detection.Results: Super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles' detection after preoperative injection (3-15days) was successful in all cases (100%). In the volunteer, axillary signal was presented for 4weeks. No adverse effects were noted.Conclusion and relevance: Preoperative super paramagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles' injection is feasible and leads to successful detection of the sentinel node. That may lead to simplified logistics as well as the identification, sampling, and marking of the sentinel node in patients planned for neoadjuvant treatment.

AB  - The article aims at a critical analysis of a thesis that science satisfies solely human biological needs through its technical applications beginning with its rise in the 17th-century Europe, while the cultural and spiritual development remains primarily the function of religion and morality. In contrast to this, the author demonstrates the limits of the utilitarian interpretation of science and technology which disregards their role in shaping the modern worldview. The article justifies an opposite understanding of science and technology as a valuable source of the general worldview and even the common sense features (the sphere of unquestioned foundations) of the contemporary generation. In this context, the sharp division between the biological (animal) and cultural (specifically human) needs appears obsolete for the modern society currently determines and even construes both of them. Science and technology receive here a particular and paradigmatic function. They serve as advanced cultural practices: selected and elaborated designs for the development of the individual and society based on the values of rationality, tolerance, reflexivity.

TI  - Development of GNSS Buoy for a Synthetic Geohazard Monitoring System
T2  - JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The GNSS buoy system for early tsunami warnings has been under development for about 20 years. A small prototype buoy was first deployed in Sagami Bay, Japan, in 1997. Then, after a series of experiments aiming for operational use, the system was implemented as a part of national wave monitoring system NOWPHAS. The NOWPHAS system had set up more than 10 GNSS buoys around Japan by 2011, and it recorded the tsunami caused by the 11 March 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. The records were used to update the tsunami warning at the time of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake. However, the buoys were placed less than 20 km from the coast, as the system used the baseline mode RTK-GPS algorithm, which was not far enough for effective evacuation of people. Thus, we began trying to improve the system by putting the buoys much farther from the coast. The new system employs a newly developed positioning algorithm, Precise Point Positioning with Ambiguity Resolution (PPP-AR), together with satellite data transmission. A series of experiments involving the new system successfully indicated changes in sea level with an accuracy of a few centimeters. Given the success of the experiments, we are trying to use the GNSS buoys not only to provide early tsunami warnings but also to monitor various other geohazards. For example, we are trying to use the GNSS-Acoustic system to continuously monitor crustal movements on the ocean floor, to monitor the ionosphere, and to monitor the atmosphere. Ancillary sensors on the buoys will be utilized for oceanographic monitoring as well.

TI  - Can next-generation soil data products improve soil moisture modelling at the continental scale? An assessment using a new microclimate package for the R programming environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate models of soil moisture are vital for solving core problems in meteorology, hydrology, agriculture and ecology. The capacity for soil moisture modelling is growing rapidly with the development of high-resolution, continent-scale gridded weather and soil data together with advances in modelling methods. In particular, the GlobalSoilMap.net initiative represents next-generation, depth-specific gridded soil products that may substantially increase soil moisture modelling capacity. Here we present an implementation of Campbell's infiltration and redistribution model within the NicheMapR microclimate modelling package for the R environment, and use it to assess the predictive power provided by the GlobalSoilMap.net product Soil and Landscape Grid of Australia (SLGA, similar to 100 m) as well as the coarser resolution global product SoilGrids (SG, similar to 250 m). Predictions were tested in detail against 3 years of root-zone (3-75 cm) soil moisture observation data from 35 monitoring sites within the OzNet project in Australia, with additional tests of the finalised modelling approach against cosmic-ray neutron (CosmOz, 0-50 cm, 9 sites from 2011 to 2017) and satellite (ASCAT, 0-2 cm, continent-wide from 2007 to 2009) observations. The model was forced by daily 0.05 degrees (similar to 5 km) gridded meteorological data. The NicheMapR system predicted soil moisture to within experimental error for all data sets. Using the SLGA or the SG soil database, the OzNet soil moisture could be predicted with a root mean square error (rinse) of similar to 0.075 m(3) m(-3) and a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.65 consistently through the soil profile without any parameter tuning. Soil moisture predictions based on the SLGA and SG datasets were approximate to 17% closer to the observations than when using a chloropleth-derived soil data set (Digital Atlas of Australian Soils), with the greatest improvements occurring for deeper layers. The CosmOz observations were predicted with similar accuracy (r = 0.76 and rise of similar to.085 m(3) m(-3)). Comparisons at the continental scale to 0-2 cm satellite data (ASCAT) showed that the SLGA/SG datasets increased model fit over simulations using the DAAS soil properties (r similar to 0.63 & rinse 15% vs. r 0.48 & rise 18%, respectively). Overall, our results demonstrate the advantages of using GlobalSoilMap.net products in combination with gridded weather data for modelling soil moisture at fine spatial and temporal resolution at the continental scale.

TI  - Avian preparedness: simulations of bird diseases and reverse scenarios of extinction in Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL ANTHROPOLOGICAL INSTITUTE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article describes relations between humans, animals, artefacts, and pathogens in simulations of disasters, taking bird diseases in three Chinese sentinel posts as ethnographic cases. Drawing on distinctions between simulation, ritual, and play, it shows that the engagement of actors in the imaginary of simulations, which they describe as realism', reflectively reverses the oppositions between humans and nonhumans, active and passive, fiction and reality that shape ordinary life. Borrowing from the anthropology of hunting societies, it argues that simulations of bird diseases, considered as signs of future species extinction, rely on cynegetic techniques of power, in which humans and animals symmetrically shift perspectives, and not only on pastoralist techniques, in which humans are above the population they monitor and sometimes sacrifice.

TI  - Using Google Earth Engine to Map Complex Shade-Grown Coffee Landscapes in Northern Nicaragua
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shade-grown coffee (shade coffee) is an important component of the forested tropics, and is essential to the conservation of forest-dependent biodiversity. Despite its importance, shade coffee is challenging to map using remotely sensed data given its spectral similarity to forested land. This paper addresses this challenge in three districts of northern Nicaragua, here leveraging cloud-based computing techniques within Google Earth Engine (GEE) to integrate multi-seasonal Landsat 8 satellite imagery (30 m), and physiographic variables (temperature, topography, and precipitation). Applying a random forest machine learning algorithm using reference data from two field surveys produced a 90.5% accuracy across ten classes of land cover, with an 82.1% and 80.0% user's and producer's accuracy respectively for shade-grown coffee. Comparing classification accuracies obtained from five datasets exploring different combinations of non-seasonal and seasonal spectral data as well as physiographic data also revealed a trend of increasing accuracy when seasonal data were included in the model and a significant improvement (7.8-20.1%) when topographical data were integrated with spectral data. These results are significant in piloting an open-access and user-friendly approach to mapping heterogeneous shade coffee landscapes with high overall accuracy, even in locations with persistent cloud cover.

TI  - An algorithm for optically-deriving water depth from multispectral imagery in coral reef landscapes in the absence of ground-truth data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although numerous approaches for deriving water depth from bands of remotely-sensed imagery in the visible spectrum exist, digital terrain models for remote tropical carbonate landscapes remain few in number. The paucity is due, in part, to the lack of in situ measurements of pertinent information needed to tune water depth derivation algorithms. In many cases, the collection of the needed ground-truth data is often prohibitively expensive or logistically infeasible. We present an approach for deriving water depths up to 15 m in Case 1 waters, whose inherent optical properties can be adequately described by phytoplankton, using multi-spectral satellite imagery without the need for direct measurement of water depth, bottom reflectance, or water column properties within the site of interest. The reliability of the approach for depths up to 15 m is demonstrated for ten satellite images over five study sites. For this depth range, overall RMSE values range from 0.89 m to 2.62 m when using a chlorophyll concentration equal to 0.2 mg m(-3) and a generic seafloor spectrum generated from a spectral library of common benthic constituents. Accuracy of water depth predictions drastically decreases beyond these depths. Sensitivity analyses show that the model is robust to selection of bottom reflectance inputs and sensitive to parameterization of chlorophyll concentration.

TI  - Riverine flood assessment in Jhang district in connection with ENSO and summer monsoon rainfall over Upper Indus Basin for 2010
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pakistan has experienced severe floods over the past decades due to climate variability. Among all the floods, the flood of 2010 was the worst in history. This study focuses on the assessment of (1) riverine flooding in the district Jhang (where Jhelum and Chenab rivers join, and the district was severely flood affected) and (2) south Asiatic summer monsoon rainfall patterns and anomalies considering the case of 2010 flood in Pakistan. The land use/cover change has been analyzed by using Landsat TM 30 m resolution satellite imageries for supervised classification, and three instances have been compared, i.e., pre-flooding, flooding, and post-flooding. The water flow accumulation, drainage density and pattern, and river catchment areas have been calculated by using Shutter Radar Topography Mission digital elevation model 90 m resolution. The standard deviation of south Asiatic summer monsoon rainfall patterns, anomalies and normal (1979-2008) has been calculated for July, August, and September by using rainfall data set of Era interim (0.75 degrees x 0.75 degrees resolution). El Nio Southern Oscillation has also been considered for its role in prevailing rainfall anomalies during the year 2010 over Upper Indus Basin region. Results show the considerable changing of land cover during the three instances in the Jhang district and water content in the rivers. Abnormal rainfall patterns over Upper Indus Basin region prevailed during summer monsoon months in the year 2010 and 2011. The El Nio (2009-2010) and its rapid phase transition to La Nia (2011-2012) may be the cause of severity and disturbances in rainfall patterns during the year 2010. The Geographical Information System techniques and model based simulated climate data sets have been used in this study which can be helpful in developing a monitoring tool for flood management.

TI  - Characterization of maximum land surface temperatures in 16 years from MODIS in Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of maximum diurnal LST is demanding for many studies. In this research, the time series of MODIS daily LST observations for both Terra and Aqua were analyzed from 2002 to 2016 in Iran. The relation of maximum observed LSTs in the study area was investigated with environmental variables of aspect, elevation, slope, latitude, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and soil type. Two methods of correlation analysis, as linear approach, and Random Forest (RF) statistical approach, as a nonlinear approach, were used to analyze the effect and importance of mentioned variables on the occurrence of high LSTs. In correlation analysis, the results showed that NDVI and elevation had the highest correlations (- 0.66 and - 0.51) with maximum observed LSTs. In RF, the elevation showed higher importance than other variables. The bare and low lands in central part of Iran (deserts) had high maximum LSTs and the south part of Lut Desert, especially Rigzar, had the highest LSTs (80 A degrees C extracted from Aqua platform) among all pixels in the study area. Unique aspects of environmental condition and sand dune soil type in this region could be the reason for recording highest LSTs. Finally, to estimate maximum diurnal LSTs, diurnal temperature model (DTC) was applied under clear-sky condition over Rigzar area. The estimated parameters of DTC model from MODIS were compared with INSAT3-D geostationary satellite.

TI  - Monitoring and assessment of seasonal land cover changes using remote sensing: a 30-year (1987-2016) case study of Hamoun Wetland, Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of Landsat data allows improving the monitoring and assessment of large-scale areas with land cover changes in rapid developing regions. Thus, we pretend to show a combined methodology to assess land cover changes (LCCs) in the Hamoun Wetland region (Iran) over a period of 30-year (1987-2016) and to quantify seasonal and decadal landscape and land use variabilities. Using the pixel-based change detection (PBCD) and the post-classification comparison (PCC), four land cover classes were compared among spring, summer, and fall seasons. Our findings showed for the water class a higher correlation between spring and summer (R (2) = 0.94) than fall and spring (R (2) = 0.58) seasons. Before 2000, similar to 50% of the total area was covered by bare soil and 40% by water. However, after 2000, more than 70% of wetland was transformed into bare soils. The results of the long-term monitoring period showed that fall season was the most representative time to show the inter-annual variability of LCCs monitoring and the least affected by seasonal-scale climatic variations. In the Hamoun Wetland region, land cover was highly controlled by changes in surface water, which in turn responded to both climatic and anthropogenic impacts. We were able to divide the water budget monitoring into three different ecological regimes: (1) a period of high water level, which sustained healthy extensive plant life, and approximately 40% of the total surface water was retained until the end of the hydrological year; (2) a period of drought during high evaporation rates was observed, and a mean wetland surface of about 85% was characterized by bare land; and (3) a recovery period in which water levels were overall rising, but they are not maintained from year to year. After a spring flood, in 2006 and 2013, grassland reached the highest extensions, covering till more than 20% of the region, and the dynamics of the ecosystem were affected by the differences in moisture. The Hamoun wetland region served as an important example and demonstration of the feedbacks between land cover and land uses, particularly as pertaining to water resources available to a rapidly expanding population.

TI  - Exploring the ambient environment for charland formation in Rajmahal downstream Ganga river of Eastern India in post Farakka barrage Period
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Up to 2005, more than 700,000 people and 53 villages of Malda and Murshidabad districts have been displaced and wiped out due to bank erosion of river Ganga. Population displacement due to massive river bank erosion and rehabilitation for them with livelihood options are the emerging challenge in both up and downstream of Farakka barrage. This paper also wants to find out potential areas of charland formation along with exploring existing charland over the selected phases. Normalized differences water index (NDWI) from 55 Landsat images is used for flow and charland mapping. Water presence frequency (WPF) and NDWI map are taken as parameters for mapping new habitat for chaland. Total existing charland area in phase 3 is 463.58 km(2) and potential habitat for charland is 117.59 km(2). Out of this potential area, in post monsoon season, 35.26% comes under highly potential zone where both depth of flow is very low and frequency of flow is irregular. Highly suitable area has been increased over the recent phases. Potential charland maps in 1st and 2nd phases are validated in reference to the appeared charland area in the successive phases. New charlands expectedly would be the resource hunting ground of the displaced people.

TI  - THE PROJECT OF THE DICTIONARY OF PERCEPTUAL IMAGES USED IN B. PASTERNAK'S POETIC WORKS
T2  - VOPROSY LEKSIKOGRAFII-RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF LEXICOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the article, the project of the dictionary of perceptual images used in B.L. Pasternak's poetic works is represented. The main objective of the creation of the dictionary is a detailed and multidimensional description of a significant fragment of the author's individual worldview taking into account the features of Pasternak's imagery and the text production potential of perceptual units. Perceptual units are defined as linguistic means of representation of perceptual images which can be systematized by the perception mode: vision, audio perception, tactile sense, sense of smell and taste. In the context of the offered research, perceptual imagery is considered as a subordinate concept in relation to verbal imagery. The bases for separating perceptual units is their ability: 1) "to create" perceptual imagery (the aesthetic basis); 2) "to mark" a perception proposition in the text (a proposition as a linguistic model of a situation) (the semantic basis).The study material is 499 original poems written by Pasternak in which 2 512 utterances representing semantics of all types of sensory perception were revealed. In the course of work, the following methods are used: the method of semantic and contextual analysis of linguistic units of different levels, the lexicographical method, and elements of the linguistic and stylistic analysis of literary texts.The presented variant of the dictionary entry (the perceptual image "silence") includes four zones: 1) the head word (names the perceptual image); 2) the zone of ways of linguistic representation (taking into account morphological features, with the indication of the number of contexts); 3) the zone of contexts which shows all uses of the unit in Pasternak's poetic texts with the indication of the name, the year and the line of the poem; 4) the zone of commentaries and the author's imagery in which language-poetical remarks of dictionary makers are given. The zone includes the most exemplary instances of expressive means verbalization, for example, "metaphor", "reification", "comparison", etc. The dictionary of perceptual images mandatorily contains the frequency parameter, and demonstrates the contextual uses of words for determining the author's individual semantic accretions.The dictionary of perceptual images reflects the author's individual features of poetics and can be qualified as an ideographic dictionary systematized by perception types. The key perceptual images observed in all the periods of Pasternak's poetic creativity can represent one or several types of sensory perception and be presented by the means of various linguistic levels.The visual presentation of perceptual imagery in the form of the author's dictionary gives a chance to trace traditions and innovations in Pasternak's poetic texts and opens opportunities for the comparative analysis of linguistic means of representation of separate perceptual images in works of different authors.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the article, the role of the Canadian pianist Glenn Gould (1932-1982) in modern musical culture is interpreted. It is shown that he has implemented a new approach to performing art. The basic principle of his art is that the performer must create a new interpretation. For the sake of its realization, he left the concert hall at the peak of his artistic glory in the recording studio, where, as he believed, the ideal conditions for a new reading of the musical classics were created. Prior to Gould, sound recording was thought of as a means of preserving the creative achievements of performing musicians. Thanks to Gould, sound recording has become a relatively independent type of performing art. He abandoned the existing tradition of creativity "in front of the public and with it", opened the inspiring possibilities of the studio and microphone.The most clearly new style of performance created by Gould was manifested in his interpretation of the transcription of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Specific properties of Liszt's piano transcriptions and the formed tradition of their performance are analyzed. It is shown that Gould refuses from the orchestral, multicolored interpretation of the piano. He plays emphatically precisely - like Beethoven. The text treats objectively. A comparative analysis of interpretations has shown that he has the most objective of all the readings of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, sparingly painted, graphically strict, like the outline of a Christian cathedral.At the end of the article socio-cultural reasons were analyzed, as a result of which such original reading of the symphony appeared. Gould is a Canadian. Judging by his articles, he was not a deeply religious person, but he was raised in a Protestant school, he spoke of himself - "my Protestant soul" - he possessed a Protestant worldview. The Protestant worldview is quite definitely manifested in the culture of Canada. The orderliness, thoughtfulness of life and everyday life and at the same time modesty - there is no wealth that screams about itself. Protestant churches - service, decoration and appearance - are significantly different from Orthodox and Catholic churches. Orthodox and Catholic in the church service and decoration is present not only a mystical, but also an aesthetic element: the mystical grows into an aesthetic and vice versa. In Protestants, the aesthetic element goes to the background - faith, prayer appear in an almost purified form. In the Catholic church, the beauty is baroque, luxurious. In Protestant - modest. Aesthetics here Pythagorean, mathematical, rational - aesthetics of the right proportions. Pythagorean beauty is present in Catholic and Orthodox churches, but it "hides" behind the beauty and expressiveness of the picturesque, sculptural (the Catholics) decoration. Symphonies of Beethoven can be likened to a Cathedral in the sounds. Gould discovered Protestant beauty of the symphony-cathedral.

TI  - Improved Hourly Estimates of Aerosol Optical Thickness Using Spatiotemporal Variability Derived From Himawari-8 Geostationary Satellite
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a scheme to improve hourly estimates of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8, the Japan Meteorological Agency's latest geostationary satellite. Taking advantage of the sampling characteristics of the AHI (10-min temporal and sub-kilometer spatial resolution), we quantify temporal and spatial variability of AOT from the observations (AOT(original)) and utilize this information to develop an hourly algorithm that produces two sets of derived AOTs: AOT(pure), derived by the application of strict cloud screening to AOT(original), and AOT(merged), derived from spatial and temporal interpolations of AOT(pure). The AOTs thus obtained from the hourly algorithm were validated against measurements from the aerosol robotic network. The root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the AOT(pure) and AOT(merged) products were 0.14 and 0.11, respectively, providing improvement over an RMSE of 0.20 for AOT(original).

TI  - Associations Between Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy and Complications for Patients with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To examine the associations between sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and complications among older patients who underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS) for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).We identified women from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare dataset aged 67-94 years diagnosed during 1998-2011 with DCIS who underwent BCS as initial treatment. We assessed incidence of complications, including lymphedema, wound infection, seroma, or pain, within 9 months of diagnosis. We used Mahalanobis matching and generalized linear models to estimate the associations between SLNB and complications.Our sample consisted of 15,515 beneficiaries, 2409 (15.5%) of whom received SLNB. Overall, 16.8% of women who received SLNB had complications, compared with 11.3% of women who did not receive SLNB (p < 0.001). Use of SLNB was associated with subsequent mastectomy but not radiotherapy. Multivariate analyses of the matched sample showed that, compared with no SLNB, SLNB use was significantly associated with incidence of any complication [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.39; 99% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.63], lymphedema (AOR 4.45; 99% CI 2.27-8.75), wound infection (AOR 1.24; 99% CI 1.00-1.54), seroma (AOR 1.40; 99% CI 1.03-1.91), and pain (AOR 1.31; 99% CI 1.04-1.65). Sensitivity analyses excluding patients who underwent mastectomy yielded qualitatively similar results regarding the associations between SLNB and complications.Among older women with DCIS who received BCS, SLNB use was associated with higher risks of short-term complications. These findings support consensus guidelines recommending against SLNB for this population and provide empirical information for patients.

TI  - Sensitivity Test of the Parameterization Methods of Cloud Droplet Activation Process in Model Simulation of Cloud Formation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-KOREA
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud droplet activation process is well described by Kohler theory and several parameterizations based on Kohler theory are used in a wide range of models to represent this process. Here, we test the two different method of calculating the solute effect in the Kohler equation, i.e., osmotic coefficient method (OSM) and kappa-Kohler method (KK). To do that, each method is implemented in the cloud droplet activation parameterization module of WRF-CHEM (Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry) model. It is assumed that aerosols are composed of five major components (i.e., sulfate, organic matter, black carbon, mineral dust, and sea salt). Both methods calculate similar representative hygroscopicity parameter values of 0.2 similar to 0.3 over the land, and 0.6 similar to 0.7 over the ocean, which are close to estimated values in previous studies. Simulated precipitation, and meteorological variables (i.e., specific heat and temperature) show good agreement with reanalysis. Spatial patterns of precipitation and liquid water path from model results and satellite data show similarity in general, but on regional scale spatial patterns and intensity show some discrepancy. However, meteorological variables, precipitation, and liquid water path do not show significant differences between OSM and KK simulations. So we suggest that the relatively simple KK method can be a good alternative to the OSM method that requires various information of density, molecular weight and dissociation number of each individual species in calculating the solute effect.

T2  - ATMOSPHERE-KOREA
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to assimilate MHS satellite data into the convective scale model at KMA, ATOVS data are reprocessed to utilize the original high-resolution data. And then to improve the preprocessing experiments for cloud detection were performed and optimized to convective-scale model. The experiment which is land scattering index technique added to Observational Processing System to remove contaminated data showed the best result. The analysis fields with assimilation of MHS are verified against with ECMWF analysis fields and fit to other observations including Sonde, which shows improved results on relative humidity fields at sensitive level (850-300 hPa). As the relative humidity of upper troposphere increases, the bias and RMSE of geopotential height are decreased. This improved initial field has a very positive effect on the forecast performance of the model. According to improvement of model field, the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) of precipitation prediction of 1 similar to 20 mm hr(-1) was increased and this impact was maintained for 27 hours during experiment periods.

TI  - Combining Survey and Non-survey Data for Improved Sub-area Prediction Using a Multi-level Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL STATISTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining information from different sources is an important practical problem in survey sampling. Using a hierarchical area-level model, we establish a framework to integrate auxiliary information to improve state-level area estimates. The best predictors are obtained by the conditional expectations of latent variables given observations, and an estimate of the mean squared prediction error is discussed. Sponsored by the National Agricultural Statistics Service of the US Department of Agriculture, the proposed model is applied to the planted crop acreage estimation problem by combining information from three sources, including the June Area Survey obtained by a probability-based sampling of lands, administrative data about the planted acreage and the cropland data layer, which is a commodity-specific classification product derived from remote sensing data. The proposed model combines the available information at a sub-state level called the agricultural statistics district and aggregates to improve state-level estimates of planted acreages for different crops. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations in the Water Use Efficiency and its Drought Signal on the Korean Peninsula using MODIS-derived Products
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is the amount of carbon uptake per unit of water use, which is a key measure of the functions of terrestrial ecosystems, as it is related to both the hydrologic and carbon cycles. Furthermore, it can vary with many factors, such as climate conditions and land cover characteristics, in different regions. In this study, we aim to understand the spatial and temporal variations in WUE on the Korean Peninsula as well as the associated response to drought. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) datasets and climate data were used to derive a drought index. Based on the monthly WUE, we found that WUE decreased during the monsoon summer in all regions and for all vegetation types. Furthermore, the annual WUE was negatively correlated with the drought index, with increasing correlation coefficients from the northern region to the southern region of the Korean Peninsula.

TI  - Benefits of the Next Generation Geostationary Meteorological Satellite Observation and Policy Plans for Expanding Satellite Data Application: Lessons from GOES-16
T2  - ATMOSPHERE-KOREA
M3  - Article
AB  - Benefits of the next generation geostationary meteorological satellite observation (e.g., GEO-KOMPSAT-2A) are qualitatively and comprehensively described and discussed. Main beneficial phenomena for application can be listed as tropical cyclones (typhoon), high impact weather (heavy rainfall, lightning, and hail), ocean, air pollution (particulate matter), forest fire, fog, aircraft icing, volcanic eruption, and space weather. The next generation satellites with highly enhanced spatial and temporal resolution images, expanding channels, and basic and additional products are expected to create the new valuable benefits, including the contribution to the reduction of socioeconomic losses due to weather-related disasters. In particular, the new satellite observations are readily applicable to early warning and very-short time forecast application of hazardous weather phenomena, global climate change monitoring and adaptation, improvement of numerical weather forecast skill, and technical improvement of space weather monitoring and forecast. Several policy plans for expanding the application of the next generation satellite data are suggested.

TI  - Grounding Line of Campbell Glacier in Ross Sea Derived from High-Resolution Digital Elevation Model
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grounding line is used as evidence of the mass balance showing the vulnerability of Antarctic glaciers and ice shelves. In this research, we utilized a high resolution digital elevation model of glacier surface derived by recently launched satellites to estimate the position of grounding line of Campbell Glacier in East Antarctica. TanDEM-X and TerraSAR-X data in single-pass interferometry mode were acquired on June 21, 2013 and September 10, 2016 and CryoSat-2 radar altimeter data were acquired within 15 days from the acquisition date of TanDEM-X. The datasets were combined to generate a high resolution digital elevation model which was used to estimate the grounding line position. During the 3 years of observation, there weren't any significant changes in grounding line position. Since the average density of ice used in estimating grounding line is not accurately known, the variations of the grounding line was analyzed with respect to the density of ice. There was a spatial difference from the grounding line estimated by DDInSAR whereas the estimated grounding line using the characteristics of the surface of the optical satellite images agreed well when the ice column density was about 880 kg/m(3). Although the reliability of the results depends on the vertical accuracy of the bathymetry in this study, the hydrostatic ice thickness has greater influence on the grounding line estimation.

TI  - Reliability of Self-reported Treatment Data by Patients With Breast Cancer Compared With Medical Record Data
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - The reliability of self-reported treatment data is unclear. Therefore 350 (58% response) breast cancer patients completed a questionnaire to compare self-reported data with data from medical records. Agreement was good for type of surgery, receiving chemotherapy, endocrine and radiation therapy. Only moderate agreement was seen for sentinel node biopsy, pathological results an axillary lymph node dissection.Objectives: Medical records are considered the gold standard for accurate treatment information. However, treatment data are increasingly obtained from questionnaires. It can be questioned whether self-reported treatment data are reliable, particularly because patients have to process a lot of information during their diagnosis and treatment process. The present study assesses the reliability of self-reported treatment data compared with medical records. Methods: All patients with stage I, II, and III breast cancer (n = 606) in 5 hospitals in the west of the Netherlands were invited to complete a questionnaire 9 to 18 months after surgery. We calculated kappa statistics, proportion correct, sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values to assess agreement. Results: Three hundred fifty patients completed the questionnaire (58%). Agreement was good for type of surgery and receiving chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and radiation therapy, with sensitivity and specificity of 95% or higher and kappa above 0.90. However, only moderate agreement was seen for sentinel node biopsy, including the pathologic results and axillary lymph node dissection (kappa between 0.60 and 0.80). Lack of agreement was more often found for patients who had received endocrine therapy (odds ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-3.10) but not influenced by age (odds ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-1.02). Conclusion: Accuracy of self-reported data is high for type of surgery, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and radiation therapy, but much lower for sentinel node biopsy including the pathologic results and axillary lymph node dissection. This is relevant for clinicians given the time spent explaining these procedures, and for researchers to help decide what information to obtain from patients or medical records. (C) 2017 The Authors.

M3  - Review
AB  - Background Squamous cell carcinoma of the nasal vestibule is a rare entity. In consequence disagreement in etiology, staging system and therapy of primary tumor with or without adjuvant treatment of regional lymph nodes are apparent.Methods Pubmed-Recherche of relevant literature concerning: lymphatic drainage, metastases, incidence, risk factors (leather, nickel, nicotine, human papillomavirus, Staging system (UICC, AJCC, Wang's system), therapy of the primary tumor, regional lymph nodes and immunohistochemistry. Results Fifty-five studies were found and analyzed. Results are inconsistent.Conclusion The Wang-classification is recommended. Radiation and surgery are the treatment of choice for small lesions. Larger lesions (T3-Wang) should be treated with a combined approach. In cT1-cT2cN0-situation after accurate diagnostic, an elective therapy of regional lymph nodes is not necessary.

TI  - Ambient Particulate Matter Concentration Levels and their Origin During Dust Event Episodes in the Eastern Mediterranean
T2  - AEROSOL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Mediterranean region is strongly influenced by long-range transported particulate matter such as desert dust from northern Africa. To investigate the dynamics of Saharan dust events and their origin, satellite images from the MODIS spectroradiometer of NASA's satellites Terra and Aqua, and back trajectories analysis of the HYSPLIT model were combined together with continuous ground-based field data. Field PM10 and PM2.5 measurements were performed in the period 2003-2013 at the Akrotiri monitoring station on the island of Crete (Greece). Furthermore, the mineralogical composition of a small number of samples was determined by X-ray powder diffraction, whereas elemental particle composition analysis was performed on the dust samples collected using the ICP-MS technique for a series of elements. The annual average percentage of days with Sahara dust outbreaks in the region of western Crete (Akrotiri station) was 9.3% for the period 2003-2013. Excluding the PM10 exceedances caused by Sahara dust events, the average PM10 monthly concentrations are decreased by 20.5% during the 8-month period November-June, with higher PM10 concentration reduction (29.9%) in the period February-April. Mineralogical analysis showed that illite was the most abundant mineral identified in all samples, followed by quartz and calcite. Gypsum was detected only in the dry sample. Moreover, the elemental particle composition analysis showed that collected dust originated from Africa deserts.

TI  - Fast and Automatic Data-Driven Thresholding for Inundation Mapping with Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data offer the opportunity for monitoring the temporal flooding dynamics of seasonal wetlands, a parameter that is essential for the ecosystem services these areas provide. This study introduces an unsupervised approach to estimate the extent of flooded areas in a satellite image relying on the physics of light interaction with water, vegetation and their combination. The approach detects automatically thresholds on the Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) band and on a Modified-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MNDVI), derived from radiometrically-corrected Sentinel-2 data. Then, it combines them in a meaningful way based on a knowledge base coming out of an iterative trial and error process. Classes of interest concern water and non-water areas. The water class is comprised of the open-water and water-vegetation subclasses. In parallel, a supervised approach is implemented mainly for performance comparison reasons. The latter approach performs a random forest classification on a set of bands and indices extracted from Sentinel-2 data. The approaches are able to discriminate the water class in different types of wetlands (marshland, rice-paddies and temporary ponds) existing in the Donana Biosphere Reserve study area, located in southwest Spain. Both unsupervised and supervised approaches are examined against validation data derived from Landsat satellite inundation time series maps, generated by the local administration and offered as an online service since 1983. Accuracy assessment metrics show that both approaches have similarly high classification performance (e.g., the combined kappa coefficient of the unsupervised and the supervised approach is 0.8827 and 0.9477, and the combined overall accuracy is 97.71% and 98.95, respectively). The unsupervised approach can be used by non-trained personnel with a potential for transferability to sites of, at least, similar characteristics.

TI  - Hyperspectral satellite data analysis for pure pixels extraction and evaluation of advanced classifier algorithms for LULC classification
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The study was carried out for Indian capital city Delhi using Hyperion sensor onboard EO-1 satellite of NASA. After MODTRAN-4 based atmospheric correction, MNF, PPI and n-D visualizer were applied and endmembers of 11 LCLU classes were derived which were employed in classification of LULC. To incur better classification accuracy, a comparative study was also carried out to evaluate the potential of three classifier algorithms namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM). The results of this study reemphasize the utility of satellite borne hyperspectral data to extract endmembers and also to delineate the potential of random forest as expert classifier to assess land cover with higher classification accuracy that outperformed the SVM by 19% and SAM by 27% in overall accuracy. This research work contributes positively to the issue of land cover classification through exploration of hyperspectral endmembers. The comparison of classification algorithms' performance is valuable for decision makers to choose better classifier for more accurate information extraction.

TI  - Improving spatial prediction of <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> prevalence in southern Ghana through new remote sensors and local water access profiles
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSchistosomiasis is a water-related neglected tropical disease. In many endemic low-and middle-income countries, insufficient surveillance and reporting lead to poor characterization of the demographic and geographic distribution of schistosomiasis cases. Hence, modeling is relied upon to predict areas of high transmission and to inform control strategies. We hypothesized that utilizing remotely sensed (RS) environmental data in combination with water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) variables could improve on the current predictive modeling approaches.MethodologySchistosoma haematobium prevalence data, collected from 73 rural Ghanaian schools, were used in a random forest model to investigate the predictive capacity of 15 environmental variables derived from RS data (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Global Digital Elevation Model) with fine spatial resolution (10 +/- 30 m). Five methods of variable extraction were tested to determine the spatial linkage between school-based prevalence and the environmental conditions of potential transmission sites, including applying the models to known human water contact locations. Lastly, measures of local water access and groundwater quality were incorporated into RS-based models to assess the relative importance of environmental and WASH variables.Principal findingsPredictive models based on environmental characterization of specific locations where people contact surface water bodies offered some improvement as compared to the traditional approach based on environmental characterization of locations where prevalence is measured. A water index (MNDWI) and topographic variables (elevation and slope) were important environmental risk factors, while overall, groundwater iron concentration predominated in the combined model that included WASH variables.Conclusions/SignificanceThe study helps to understand localized drivers of schistosomiasis transmission. Specifically, unsatisfactory water quality in boreholes perpetuates reliance on surface water bodies, indirectly increasing schistosomiasis risk and resulting in rapid reinfection (up to 40% prevalence six months following preventive chemotherapy). Considering WASH-related risk factors in schistosomiasis prediction can help shift the focus of control strategies from treating symptoms to reducing exposure.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The drainage basin of the Kalyani river, a tributary of Gomati river has been mapped and delineated using Survey of India toposheets (1:50,000 scale) and remote sensing satellite data. The digitization, slope map preparation and statistical calculations have been carried out with the help of geographical information system (Arc GIS 10). Kalyani a fifth order river exhibits meandering behavior having 2.45 sinuosity index (SI). The Kalyani river basin has about 1235 km(2)area with NW-SE sloping trend. The total number of first, second, third, and fourth order streams are 373, 71, 12 and 2 respectively, showing dominance of first order streams in the basin. The mean bifurcation ratio (Rb) of the entire basin is 4.8, which indicates that the drainage is not much influenced by geological structures and exhibits dendritic drainage pattern. Relief ratio (Rr) indicates low to medium surface run-off, and low stream power for erosion. The analysis of river bank height 'r' (escarpment) and longitudinal profile of the river closely reveals neotectonic activity at some locations in the basin. To prepare a comprehensive watershed development and management plan, it is important to understand the topography and drainage characteristics of the region.

TI  - Influence of nutrient fluxes on phytoplankton community and harmful algal blooms along the coastal waters of southeastern Arabian Sea
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal variation in phytoplankton composition as well as the influencing factors on phytoplankton community were examined for the coastal waters of Kochi, southeastern Arabian Sea during 2015. The elevated flux of total nitrogen (TN) and silica (Si) during the summer monsoon (SM) induced the harmful algal blooms (HABs) of Scrippsiella trochoidea (11.9 x 10(5) cellsL(-1)) and Karenia mikimotoi (6 x 10(5) cellsL(_1)) near the inlets of Kochi estuary. Blooms of S. trochoidea were recorded for the first time in the Indian waters. The satellite data of chlorophyll-a showed the significant correlation with insitu observations of phytoplankton abundance and provided a better understanding of the spatio-temporal distribution. The canonical correspondence analysis indicates that the increased TN and Si fluxes and lower temperature induced the HABs during the SM. The reduction in the load of N and Si in the coastal waters of southeastern Arabian Sea is essential for controlling the HABs.

TI  - Lymphatic Drainage from Renal Tumors In Vivo: A Prospective Sentinel Node Study Using SPECT/CT Imaging
T2  - JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Lymphatic drainage from renal tumors is unpredictable. In vivo drainage studies of primary lymphatic landing sites may reveal the variability and dynamics of lymphatic connections. The purpose of this study was to investigate the lymphatic drainage pattern of renal tumors in vivo with single photon emission/computerized tomography after intratumor radiotracer injection.Materials and Methods: We performed a phase II, prospective, single arm study to investigate the distribution of sentinel nodes from renal tumors on single photon emission/computerized tomography. Patients with cT1-3 (less than 10 cm) cN0M0 renal tumors of any subtype were enrolled in analysis. After intratumor ultrasound guided injection of 0.4 ml Tc-99m-nanocolloid we performed preoperative imaging of sentinel nodes with lymphoscintigraphy and single photon emission/computerized tomography. Sentinel and locoregional non sentinel nodes were resected with a gamma probe combined with a mobile gamma camera. The primary study end point was the location of sentinel nodes outside the locoregional retroperitoneal templates on single photon emission/computerized tomography. Using a Simon minimax 2-stage design to detect a 25% extra-locoregional retroperitoneal template location of sentinel nodes on imaging at alpha = 0.05 and 80% power at least 40 patients with sentinel node imaging on single photon emission/computerized tomography were needed.Results: Of the 68 patients 40 underwent preoperative single photon emission/computerized tomography of sentinel nodes and were included in primary end point analysis. Lymphatic drainage outside the locoregional retroperitoneal templates was observed in 14 patients (35%). Eight patients (20%) had supra diaphragmatic sentinel nodes.Conclusions: Sentinel nodes from renal tumors were mainly located in the respective locoregional retroperitoneal templates. Simultaneous sentinel nodes were located outside the suggested lymph node dissection templates, including supradiaphragmatic sentinel nodes in more than a third of the patients.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - It is shown that the criticism of science and its achievements from the standpoint of the worldview which seeks answers to "meaningful" questions - why a person lives and what one should strive for - is incorrect. Alexander Nikiforov keeps a seemingly biased account of the losses and gains of the humankind in connection with the formation and development of modern science, but his conclusions are too radical: people have not become better in the moral dimension. What is more, science has contributed to the development of hedonism and consumer sentiment; hence, science is inhuman and immoral. The initiator of the discussion also states that philosophy of science, which built the image of the researcher living in an ivory tower (i.e. as beings that are objective, not interested in the financial "customer", generously presenting results of achievements for the general good), made the grossest error. The modern scientific picture of the world, especially cosmological, which completely banished the traces of any anthropocentrism, deprives people of courage and dignity. The modern worldview, based on the achievements of science, does not give humanity a moral point of support. These objections, from the author's point of view, recall the famous article "Dilettantism in Science" by A. I. Herzen. The great writer and philosopher visibly warned that the development of scientific knowledge would force to revise the usual everyday ideas and values. It is this adjustment that takes time, because in the face of the huge dangers that threaten the earthly existence of man (monstrous diseases, natural and man-made disasters, hard and hopeless work, etc.) only the development of science and technological progress allow us to hope for the best. The modern answer to the traditional question of Christian theology "What can I hope for?" can only be searched for in this intellectual space. Science, as now understood, is not supposed to interfere in religious matters, to touch the emotions of a believer. Polymorphism of culture is a challenge and an imperative of our time.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a new approach to measure tropospheric wind vectors from space that has significant advantages over current methods and borders on a breakthrough capability. We report on the results of simulations of observations from a geostationary microwave sounder and, briefly, from a small cluster of low-earth-orbiting CubeSats. The geostationary simulations show a precision of better than 2 m/s for wind speed and 15 degrees for direction. Wind speed bias is about -1 m/s. The transfer function is largely linear. Our studies show that this methodology will meet wind measurement requirements specified by the World Meteorological Organization.

TI  - Temporal Variability of MODIS Phenological Indices in the Temperate Rainforest of Northern Patagonia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Western Patagonia harbors unique and sparsely studied terrestrial ecosystems that are threatened by land use changes and exposure to basin-scale climatic variability. We assessed the performance of two satellite vegetation indices derived from MODIS-Terra, EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), over the northern and southern sectors of the Chiloe Island System (CIS) to advance our understanding of vegetation dynamics in the region. Then we examined their time-varying relationships with two climatic indices indicative of tropical and extratropical influence, the ENSO (El Nino-Southern Oscillation) and the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) index, respectively. The 17-year time series showed that only EVI captured the seasonal pattern characteristic of temperate regions, with low (high) phenological activity during Autumn-Winter (Spring-Summer). NDVI saturated during the season of high productivity and failed to capture the seasonal cycle. Temporal patterns in productivity showed a weakened seasonal cycle during the past decade, particularly over the northern sector. We observed a non-stationary association between EVI and both climatic indices. Significant co-variation between EVI and the Nino-Southern Oscillation index in the annual band persisted from 2001 until 2008-2009; annual coherence with AAO prevailed from 2013 onwards and the 2009-2012 period was characterized by coherence between EVI and both climate indices over longer temporal scales. Our results suggest that the influence of large-scale climatic variability on local weather patterns drives phenological responses in the northern and southern regions of the CIS. The imprint of climatic variability on patterns of primary production across the CIS may be underpinned by spatial differences in the anthropogenic modification of this ecosystem, as the northern sector is strongly modified by forestry and agriculture. We highlight the need for field validation of satellite indices around areas of high biomass and high endemism, located in the southern sector of the island, in order to enhance the utility of satellite vegetation indices in the conservation and management of austral ecosystems.

TI  - Improving Patient Outcomes Through Closed-Claims Analysis: Salient Characteristics and Patterns Associated With Respiratory Events.
T2  - AANA journal
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - A retrospective, exploratory research design was used to analyze salient characteristics and patterns associated with closed claims involving Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs) in which a respiratory event caused the adverse outcome. Alleged malpractice acts found in these claims occurred between 2003 and 2012. Respiratory events were the most frequent cause of adverse outcomes in the current database (34%). The respiratory adverse outcomes often resulted in mortality or significant and permanent morbidity (69%) and were largely preventable (81%). Of these respiratory outcomes, inadequate ventilation and oxygenation associated with respiratory depressant medications accounted for 37% of the adverse outcomes (hypoventilation = 27.4%; respiratory arrest = 9.5%). In every hypoventilation claim, regardless of the type of anesthetic technique, a failure to optimally monitor the patient's ventilation was identified as a sentinel, contributory practice pattern. Payouts for CRNAs were made in 55% of respiratory claims and averaged $282,840. Claims judged to have an AANA standard-of-practice guideline violation that directly contributed to the adverse outcome were more likely to result in a payout vs those involving no violation (P <.01). Costs to defend against the malpractice allegation for all respiratory event claims averaged $51,996 (SD = $52,658) and ranged from $525 to $227,153.

TI  - Variations in the long-term uplift rate due to the Altiplano-Puna magma body observed with Sentinel-1 interferometry
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present new Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations of surface deformation in the Altiplano-Puna region (South America) where previous studies documented a broad uplift at an average rate of similar to 10 mm/yr. We use data from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission to produce high-resolution velocity maps and time series of surface displacements between years 2014-2017. The data reveal that the uplift has slowed down substantially compared to the 1992-2010 epoch and is characterized by short-term fluctuations on time scales of months to years. The observed variations in uplift rate may indicate a non-steady supply of melt and/or volatiles from the partially molten Altiplano-Puna Magma Body (APMB) into an incipient diapir forming in the roof of the APMB.

TI  - COSMO-SkyMed potential to detect and monitor Mediterranean maquis fires and regrowth: a pilot study in Capo Figari, Sardinia, Italy
T2  - IFOREST-BIOGEOSCIENCES AND FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean maquis is a complex and widespread ecosystem in the region, intrinsically prone to fire. Many species have developed specific adaptation traits to cope with fire, ensuring resistance and resilience. Due to the recent changes in socio-economy and land uses, fires are more and more frequent in the urban-rural fringe and in the coastlines, both now densely populated. The detection of fires and the monitoring of vegetation regrowth is thus of primary interest for local management and for understanding the ecosystem dynamics and processes, also in the light of the recurrent droughts induced by climate change. Among the main objectives of the COSMO-SkyMed radar constellation mission there is the monitoring of environmental hazards; the very high revisiting time of this mission is optimal for post-hazard response activities. However, very few studies exploited such data for fire and vegetation monitoring. In this research, Cosmo-SkyMed is used in a Mediterranean protected area covered by maquis to detect the burnt area extension and to conduct a mid-term assessment of vegetation regrowth. The positive results obtained in this research highlight the importance of the very high-resolution continuous acquisitions and the multi-polarization information provided by COSMO-SkyMed for monitoring fire impacts on vegetation.

TI  - Evaluation and Assimilation of the Microwave Sounder MWHS-2 Onboard FY-3C in the ECMWF Numerical Weather Prediction System
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an evaluation of the quality of data from the MicroWave Humidity Sounder-2, flown on the FY-3C polar orbiting satellite, and first results of trials assimilating the data in all-sky conditions in the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts' assimilation system. This instrument combines traditional microwave humidity sounding capabilities at 183 GHz with new channels at 118 GHz, which have never before been available from space. The aim of this paper is twofold: to contribute to the calibration/validation of this satellite by evaluating the data and to test for the first time the impact of assimilating 118-GHz sounding channels in a global numerical weather prediction system. MWHS-2 was first evaluated by comparing observation minus short-range forecast statistics to similar instruments, which indicated that the quality was generally similar. Adding the 118- and 183-GHz channels to the full operational observing system led to small improvements in the short-range (similar to 12 h) forecast accuracy for both sets of channels, and improvements in the 2-4-day wind forecast accuracy for the 183-GHz channels. Short-range forecasts were improved for global humidity in particular when assimilating the 183-GHz channels (0.5% improvement) and for cloud and low-level wind in the Southern Hemisphere extra-tropics when assimilating the 118-GHz channels (by, respectively, 0.5% and 0.2%). In the absence of other atmospheric observations, assimilating the 118-GHz channels improved the global forecast accuracy, but the overall impact was less than for the 183-GHz channels, or for equivalent Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A channels.

TI  - Framework for Buddhist Environmentalism: The Horizontal and Vertical Dimensions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BUDDHIST THOUGHT & CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Resorting to Buddhism to advance a form of religious environmentalism has been done by many scholars both from inside and outside the tradition because Buddhism holds a worldview and a number of teachings often perceived as environmentally friendly. This paper contributes to this effort by proposing a framework that is faithful to the Buddhist pedagogical approach. It asserts that this approach comprises two overarching and integral dimensions-a horizontal (relational) and a vertical (developmental) dimension. In establishing Buddhist environmentalism, the horizontal dimension is employed to assess the root cause of the environmental crisis and the state of human-nature relationship. The horizontal dimension also helps to provide a corrective to the abnormalities in this relationship is proposing a vision of harmonious human-nature relationship characterized by solidarity, responsibility, accountability, service and gratitude. These relationships can be established by resorting to Buddhist cosmogony and fundamental teachings such as the Principle of Dependent Origination and the Three Characteristics of Existence. The vertical dimension constitutes the prescriptive aspect of Buddhist environmentalism, which insists that self-cultivation aimed at emancipation from mundane existence is part and parcel of the effort to promote self and environmental well-being. It asserts that human-nature relationship must be added to the total number of relationships in one's life, and it must be held in view in the process of self-cultivation so that it becomes an indicator of a person's spiritual progress. Virtues such as loving kindness, gentleness, moderation and generosity developed through the Noble Eightfold Path not only go towards promoting interpersonal relationship but also promote environmental well-being and flourishing. Consequently, this paper is critical of any Buddhist environmentalism that fails to give due attention to both dimensions, and it emphasizes that both the relational and developmental dimensions must be held in balance in order for a genuine Buddhist environmentalism to be possible.

TI  - Faith-Based Mentoring of Ex-Felons in Higher Education: Colson Scholars Reflect on Their Transitions
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This qualitative study employs the framework of Schlossberg's Transition Theory to offer readers an introduction into recently-conducted research on ex-felons transitioning into, through, and out of higher education within the context of the Colson Scholarship program at Wheaton College1, in Wheaton, Illinois. Through the material gathered from personal interviews of six completed Colson Scholars, faith-based mentors were consistently seen as significant sources of support in each stage of the college-going transition. Faith-based mentors played an important role in the outcomes of, specifically, faith-worldview development and emotional development. This article seeks to illuminate the problem of the lack of supportive mentors for ex-offender populations in our communities, and to illustrate how those mentors might be found in faith-based organizations, institutions, and houses of worship, as Johnson (Johnson 2011) asserted and also what gains could result from the involvement of faith-based mentors in the lives of correctional populations post-release.

TI  - HEGEL BETWEEN THE PHILOSOPHY OF REALITY AND PHILOSOPHY OF ACTUALITY
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the introductory part of the article, we briefly examine the crisis of the Hegelian system that took place in the middle and second half of the 19th century, and its subsequent, revival. as a kind of reflection of the turbulent processes of modern European history. In the next part, we substantiate a seemingly paradoxical idea that Hegel's philosophy is the first and, perhaps, the deepest experience of self-understanding of the modernity. It was in Hegel's philosophy that the radical overcoming of Cartesian dualism was initiated on which the scientist worldview of the early Modern Age was based. In the sections of the article with the titles, From nature to culture. and, From reality to actuality', we offer a methodological substantiation of the radical change created by Hegel. The shift of philosophical attention from the world of natural givenness to the world of cultural values created by humans resulted in a turn from the interpretation of motionless objects and entities to the world of activity. In the ontological sense, this meant a turn from, 'reality' to 'actuality' (that is, to the interpretation of the, world. as a result of action). In the, Conclusion. section we emphasize that it is this turn that gives Hegelian philosophy an inexhaustible topicality.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Variability of the Habitat Suitability Index for Chub Mackerel (<i>Scomber Japonicus</i>) in the East/Japan Sea and the South Sea of South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate-induced decrease in fish catches in South Korea has been a big concern over the last decades. The increase in sea surface temperature (SST) due to climate change has led to not only a decline in fishery landings but also a shift in the fishing grounds of several fish species. The habitat suitability index (HSI), a reliable indicator of the capacity of a habitant to support selected species, has been widely used to detect and forecast fishing ground formation. In this study, the catch data of the chub mackerel and satellite-derived environmental factors were used to calculate the HSI for the chub mackerel in the South Sea, South Korea. More than 80% of the total catch was found in areas with an SST of 14.72-25.72 degrees C, chlorophyll-a of 0.30-0.92 mg m(-3), and primary production of 523.7-806.46 mg C m(-2) d(-1). Based on these results, the estimated climatological monthly HSI from 2002 to 2016 clearly showed that the wintering ground of the chub mackerel generally formed in the South Sea of South Korea, coinciding with the catch distribution during the same period. This outcome implies that our estimated HSI can yield a reliable prediction of the fishing ground for the chub mackerel in the East/Japan Sea and South Sea of South Korea.

TI  - Detection and Classification of Major Aerosol Type Using the Himawari-8/AHI Observation Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF KOREAN SOCIETY FOR ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to high spatio-temporal variability of amount and optical/microphysical properties of atmospheric aerosols, satellite-based observations have been demanded for spatiotemporal monitoring the major aerosols. Observations of the heavy aerosol episodes and determination on the dominant aerosol types from a geostationary satellite can provide a chance to prepare in advance for harmful aerosol episodes as it can repeatedly monitor the temporal evolution. A new geostationary observation sensor, namely the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), onboard the Himawari-8 platform, has been observing high spatial and temporal images at sixteen wavelengths from 2016. Using observed spectral visible reflectance and infrared brightness temperature (BT), the algorithm to find major aerosol type such as volcanic ash (VA), desert dust (DD), polluted aerosol (PA), and clean aerosol (CA), was developed. RGB color composite image shows dusty, hazy, and cloudy area then it can be applied for comparing aerosol detection product (ADP). The CALIPSO level 2 vertical feature mask (VFM) data and MODIS level 2 aerosol product are used to be compared with the Himawari-8/AHI ADP The VFM products can deliver nearly coincident dataset, but not many match-ups can be returned due to presence of clouds and very narrow swath. From the case study, the percent correct (PC) values acquired from this comparisons are 0.76 for DD, 0.99 for PA, 0.87 for CA, respectively. The MODIS L2 Aerosol products can deliver nearly coincident dataset with many collocated locations over ocean and land. Increased accuracy values were acquired in Asian region as POD=0.96 over land and 0.69 over ocean, which were comparable to full disc region as POD=0.93 over land and 0.48 over ocean. The Himawari-8/AHI ADP algorithm is going to be improved continuously as well as the validation efforts will be processed by comparing the larger number of collocation data with another satellite or ground based observation data.

TI  - A decision support system for scientists by processing large-scale satellite images on a distributed computing environment
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Data-driven research strategy has been widely accepted in many scientific areas. In the strategy, which consists of several processing steps including data collection, processing, analysis and discovery, data processing step is so time-consuming that it delays the overall time of scientific discovery. This also happens in the field of satellite remote sensing. As SeaDAS, a popular software package used for processing satellite remote sensing images, has been initially devised to work on a single site; it is inevitable to take unendurable time for processing massive remote sensing images. To rectify this issue, this article introduces a data-driven analysis system that rapidly processes a massive volume satellite remote sensing images. Unlike the conventional program for remote sensing images, our system is developed by virtue of both a distributed array-based DBMS and a high-throughput computing facility in order to process massive remote sensing images in a parallel and distributed manner. Consequently, it allows scientists to perform their analysis workloads more quickly and efficiently. Through extensive experiments performed with real-world dataset on 10 computing nodes, we show that our system is up to 27.5 times faster than the conventional SeaDAS package.

TI  - Sea-land segmentation for infrared remote sensing images based on superpixels and multi-scale features
T2  - INFRARED PHYSICS & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-land segmentation is a key step for the information processing of ocean remote sensing images Traditional sea-land segmentation algorithms ignore the local similarity prior of sea and land, and thus fail in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new sea-land segmentation method for infrared remote sensing images to tackle the problem based on superpixels and multi-scale features. Considering the connectivity and local similarity of sea or land, we interpret the sea-land segmentation task in view of superpixels rather than pixels, where similar pixels are clustered and the local similarity are explored. Moreover, the multi-scale features are elaborately designed, comprising of gray histogram and multi-scale total variation. Experimental results on infrared bands of Landsat-8 satellite images demonstrate that the proposed method can obtain more accurate and more robust sea-land segmentation results than the traditional algorithms.

TI  - Annual phytoplankton blooming using satellite-derived chlorophyll-<i>a</i> data around the Vitoria-Trindade Chain, Southeastern Brazil
T2  - DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART I-OCEANOGRAPHIC RESEARCH PAPERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the influence that four seamounts of the Vitoria-Trindade Chain (VTC): the Vitoria (VB), Jaseur (JB), Davis (DB) and Dogaressa (DoB) Banks, located on the western South Atlantic Ocean, potentially exert on the annual variability of the chlorophyll-a concentration [Chla] over their summits and surrounding regions. Nine years (January 2003 to December 2011) of monthly and weekly (8-days composite) satellite derived chlorophyll-a concentration, with 4 km spatial resolution were obtained for the study area using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. For comparison purposes, different time-series were analyzed for both the region over the seamounts and the surrounding waters. A Gaussian model was adjusted to each of the time series of monthly mean chlorophyll-a concentration, and the curve parameters were used in order to objectively characterize the blooms. The results showed that the entire study area (both above and beyond the seamounts) underwent seasonal blooms, with peak of chlorophyll-a occurring around the austral winter (June, July and August), when due to surface cooling the deepening of the surface mixed layer is observed, enriching the photic zone with nutrients. Nevertheless, the peak chlorophyll-a concentration over the shallow seamounts was twice higher than that over deep seamounts or in the adjacent deep ocean. Our results suggest that the presence of these seamounts and their morphological characteristics can significantly impact the primary productivity observed in this region. Thus, the VTC can be divided into areas of diffuse [Chla] (VB and JB), with lower zonal scattering and higher phytoplankton concentrations (DB), and areas distant from the continental shelf and the mesoscale processes that develop there, hence with lower [Chla] (DoB). The profound impact that these seamounts have on the oceanic ecosystem may turn them into becoming true oasis in the oligotrophic deep ocean, supporting higher trophic levels, as well as important fisheries in this region.

TI  - A macrophysiology approach to watershed science and management
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwaters are among the most imperiled ecosystems on the planet such that much effort is expended on environmental monitoring to support the management of these systems. Many traditional monitoring efforts focus on abiotic characterization of water quantity or quality and/or indices of biotic integrity that focus on higher scale population or community level metrics such as abundance or diversity. However, these indicators may take time to manifest in degraded systems and delay the identification and restoration of these systems. Physiological indicators manifest rapidly and portend oncoming changes in populations that can hasten restoration and facilitate preventative medicine for degraded habitats. Therefore, assessing freshwater ecosystem integrity using physiological indicators of health is a promising tool to improve freshwater monitoring and restoration. Here, we discuss the value of using comparative, longitudinal physiological data collected at a broad spatial (i.e. watershed) scale (i.e. macrophysiology) as a tool for monitoring aquatic ecosystem health within and among local watersheds to develop timely and effective management plans. There are emerging tools and techniques available for rapid, cost-effective, and non-lethal physiological sampling and we discuss how these can be integrated into management using fish as sentinel indicators in freshwater. Although many examples of this approach are relatively recent, we foresee increasing use of macrophysiology in monitoring, and advocate for the development of more standard tools for consistent and reliable assessment.

TI  - ICESat/GLAS-derived changes in the water level of Hulun Lake, Inner Mongolia, from 2003 to 2009
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Hulun Lake is the largest freshwater lake in northern Inner Mongolia and even minor changes in its level may have major effects on the ecology of the lake and the surrounding area. In this study, we used high-precision elevation data for the interval from 2003-2009 measured by the Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) on board the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) to assess annual and seasonal water level variations of Hulun Lake. The altimetry data of 32 satellite tracks were processed using the RANdom SAmple Consensus algorithm (RANSAC) to eliminate elevation outliers, and subsequently the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to delineate the area of the lake. From 2003-2009, the shoreline of Hulun Lake retreated westwards, which was especially notable in the southern part of the lake. There was only a small decrease in water level, from 530.72 m to 529.22 m during 2003-2009, an average rate of 0.08 m/yr. The area of the lake decreased at a rate of 49.52 km(2)/yr, which was mainly the result of the shallow bathymetry in the southern part of the basin. The decrease in area was initially rapid, then much slower, and finally rapid again. Generally, the lake extent and water level decreased due to higher temperatures, intense evaporation, low precipitation, and decreasing runoff. And their fluctuations were caused by a decrease in intraannual temperature, evaporation, and a slight increase in precipitation. Overall, a combination of factors related to climate change were responsible for the variations of the water level of Hulun Lake during the study interval. The results improve our understanding of the impact of climate change on Hulun Lake and may facilitate the formulation of response strategies.

TI  - Intrusions of Kuroshio and Shelf Waters on Northern Slope of South China Sea in Summer 2015
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - The northern slope region of the South China Sea (SCS) is a biological hot spot characterized by high primary productivity and biomasses transported by cross-shelf currents, which support the spawning and growth of commercially and ecologically important fish species. To understand the physical and biogeochemical processes that promote the high primary production of this region, we conducted a cruise from June 10 and July 2, 2015. In this study, we used fuzzy cluster analysis and optimum multiparameter analysis methods to analyze the hydrographic data collected during the cruise to determine the compositions of the upper 55-m water masses on the SCS northern slope and thereby elucidate the cross-slope transport of shelf water (SHW) and the intrusions of Kuroshio water (KW). We also analyzed the geostrophic currents derived from acoustic Doppler current profiler measurements and satellite data. The results reveal the surface waters on the northern slope of the SCS to be primarily composed of waters originating from South China Sea water (SCSW), KW, and SHW. The SCSW dominated a majority of the study region at percentages ranging between 60% and 100%. We found a strong cross-slope current with speeds greater than 50 cm s(-1) to have carried SHW into and through the surveyed slope area, and KW to have intruded onto the slope via mesoscale eddies, thereby dominating the southwestern section of the study area.

TI  - Integration of fuzzy theory and particle swarm optimization for high-resolution satellite scene recognition
T2  - PROGRESS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of satellite imaging technology, large amounts of satellite images with high spatial resolutions are now available. High-resolution satellite imagery provides rich texture and structure information, which in the meantime poses a great challenge for automatic satellite scene recognition. In this study, a novel integration method of fuzzy theory and particle swarm optimization (IFTPSO) is proposed to achieve an increased accuracy of satellite scene recognition (SSR) in high-resolution satellite imagery. The particle encoding, fitness function and swarm search strategy are designed for IFTPSO-SSR. The IFTPSO-SSR method was evaluated using the satellite scenes from QuickBird, IKONOS and ZY-3. IFTPSO-SSR outperformed three traditional recognition methods with the highest recognition accuracy. The parameter sensitivity of IFTPSO-SSR was also discussed. The proposed method of this study can enhance the performance of satellite scene recognition in high-resolution satellite imagery, and thereby advance the research and applications of artificial intelligence and satellite image analysis.

CP  - 3rd International Conference on Water Resource and Environment (WRE)
CL  - Qingdao, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Utilizing simultaneous measurements of sea surface wind speed from the Chinese HY-2 satellite scatterometer and significant wave height from its altimeter, the wind-sea and swell in the South China Sea (SCS) for the period 2012-2013 were characterized, based on a statistical-based swell probability (SP) index and a physical-based wave age (WA) index. The two indexes were higher in the central sea (SP > 0.5, WA > 1.4), where mixed wave conditions dominate, while the wind-sea was more common (SP < 0.3, and WA < 1.2) in offshore regions, which include the Beibu Gulf, the area southwest of Taiwan island and the region between Vietnam and the Nansha islands. Seasonally, the indexes showed maximum values in spring, and the seasonal variabilities in the northern (latitude > 17 degrees N) and southern SCS (latitude < 12 degrees N) were more prominent than in the middle SCS. These results may have practical applications in coastal engineering design, wave forecasting and various sea going activities.

TI  - Monitoring groundwater storage variations in the Guanzhong area using GRACE satellite gravity data
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Guanzhong is one of the important industrial and agricultural developed areas in 'One Road and One Belt'. It is necessary to monitor and analyze groundwater storage (GWS) variations in this area to reveal the characteristics of GWS, which is of great importance for economic and social development. Firstly, based on the gravity field model from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data from 2003 to 2014, the combined filter and method of single-scale factor are applied to invert the terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations in the Guanzhong area. Then by subtracting the results of GLDAS average surface water from TWS, GWS variations in this area are determined. Finally, the correlation between TWS and GLDAS is analyzed, and the GWS variations are compared with that from the WGHM groundwater model and well observations. The results show that (1) the TWS variations in the Guanzhong area have a strong correlation with the GLDAS model (VIC, NOAH, CLM, and MOSIC). The most correlation coefficients between them are greater than 0.7, whereas the correlation coefficient between the model average and TWS is up to 0. 8. (2) During 2003 to 2008, GWS in the Guanzhong area showed a positive growth trend, and the increase rate was 0. 25 cm . a(-1), which is consistent with the trend of well observations in the same period. However, there was a long-term depletion of GWS from 2003 to 2013, and the depletion rate is -0. 37 cm . a(-1), which agrees well with the WGHM estimation result of -0. 35 cm . a(-1) for the same period. (3) There are obvious annual variation characteristics of GWS in the Guanzhong area. The rate of GWS depletion during 2003 to 2014 was -0. 44 cm . a(-1), which was in good agreement with the rainfall in this area, while during the drought years, i. e., 2008, 2012 and 2013, GWS also decreased significantly.

AB  - To improve the early detection of geographically dispersed common-source foodborne outbreaks, a national foodborne disease molecular tracing network (TraNet) was launched in 2013 based on the existing laboratory-based foodborne disease surveillance system in China. TraNet consists of 32 provincial and many municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that conduct molecular sub typing using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) on foodborne pathogens submitted by sentinel hospitals within their jurisdictions, and submit these PFGE profiles to a national database for further analysis. Currently, TraNet plays a significant role in the identification of etiologic causes and tracks contaminated food during foodborne outbreaks. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Fort Worth, TX
AB  - This work addresses the intercalibration of infrared channels 7 to 16 of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) aboard Himawari-8 against the hyperspectral channels of the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) on board Metop-B using the hyperspectral convolution method. The matching measurements in January, March, July, and November 2016 are collected over a tropical intercalibration area (100 degrees E similar to 180 degrees E, 10 degrees S similar to 10 degrees N) under the conditions of collocation, absolute observation time difference of less than 5 min (vertical bar Delta time vertical bar < 5'), absolute viewing azimuth angle difference of less than 10 degrees (vertical bar Delta VAA vertical bar < 10 degrees), and vertical bar cos theta(1)/cos theta(2) -1 vertical bar < 0.015, where theta(1) and theta(2) are the viewing zenith angles of AHI and IASI measurements, respectively. The daytime matching measurements in the channel 7 (centered at about 3.88 mu m) contaminated by strong and fast changing specular reflected solar irradiance have weak correlation and consequently are excluded from the intercalibration. The results show that the AHI and IASI matching measurements have strong linear correlation, and the intercalibration coefficients (slope and intercept) are obtained through linear regression on the qualified matching measurements. The linear fit results indicate that the in-orbit calibration of the AHI infrared channels is stable in the four months; however, more or less calibration biases exist against IASI/Metop-B hyperspectral channels. The intercalibration results in this work are basically consistent with that of the Meteorological Satellite Center of Japan Meteorological Agency.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Estimation of Bamboo Forest Aboveground Carbon Storage Based on Landsat Data in Zhejiang, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China is one of the countries with the most abundant bamboo forest resources in the world, and Zhejiang province is among the top-3 Chinese provinces with richest bamboo forests. For rational bamboo forests management, it is of great significance to study the spatiotemporal dynamic changes of Aboveground Carbon (AGC) stocks of bamboo forest in Zhejiang. In this study, remote sensing variables, such as spectral, vegetation indices and texture features of bamboo forest in Zhejiang, were extracted from 32 Landsat TM and OLI images got from four different years (2000, 2004, 2008 and 2014). These variables were subsequently selected with stepwise regression method to build an estimation model of AGC of the bamboo forests. The results showed that (1) the accuracy of bamboo forest remote sensing information extracted from the four different years was high with a classification accuracy of >76.26% and an accuracy of users of >91.62%. The classification area of bamboo forest was highly consistent with the area from forest resource inventory, and the area accuracy was over 96.50%; (2) the estimation model performed well in predicting the AGC in Zhejiang for different years. The correlation coefficient for estimated and measured AGC was between 63% and 72% with low root mean square error; (3) the derived AGC of the bamboo forests in Zhejiang province increased gradually from 2000 to 2014, with the AGC density of 6.75 Mgha(-1), 10.95 Mgha(-1), 15.25 Mgha(-1) and 19.07 Mgha(-1) respectively, and the average annual growth of 0.88 Mgha(-1). The spatiotemporal evolution of bamboo forest AGC in Zhejiang province had a close relationship with the gradual expansion of bamboo forest in the province and the differentiation of management levels in different regions.

CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)

AB  - Surface reflectance can be derived from satellite measurements for the top of atmosphere and provides an important dataset for monitoring land change reliably. In this study, the Sentinel-2A surface reflectance was generated using the Sentinel-2 atmospheric correction (Sen2Cor) processor. To evaluate this dataset, surface data at 40 sites of the aerosol robotic network over North America from January 2016 to August 2017 were collected and processed. The surface reflectance reference was derived from the second simulation of the satellite signal in the solar spectrum-vector (6SV) code. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT), water vapor, surface reflectance, and three spectral indices generated by Sen2Cor were evaluated using the metrics including the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty (A, P, and U). The results show that due to the limitations of Sen2Cor aerosol retrieval algorithm, the Sentinel-2A AOT was significantly overestimated, with the relative accuracy over 160%. The Sen2Cor surface reflectance is generally overestimated, especially for the bright pixels, except for the cirrus band. For the 12 Sentinel-2A bands, the mean values of relative A, P, and U are 4.15%, 13.44%, and 14.92%, respectively. Among the three spectral indices, the normalized difference vegetation index performs best, with a correlation coefficient of 0.973 against the surface data. Furthermore, the Sen2Cor surface reflectance was compared with other satellite products. The mean correlation coefficient between Sentinel-2A and Landsat 8 surface reflectance is found to be 0.761. This study suggests that a better AOT retrieval is critical for improvement of Sen2Cor in the future.

TI  - The impact of cultivated land spatial shift on food crop production in China, 1990-2010
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultivated land has been undergoing significant spatial shift during the last 2 decades in China, according to land-use data derived from the Landsat Thematic Mapper. Based on soil organic matter data and yield data at county level, we developed a constant crop yield dataset at pixel level with a resolution of 1 km. Using this dataset, this paper quantitatively evaluates average crop yield change due to cultivated land spatial shift at national and regional levels. The results show that (a) at national level, the average crop yield per unit area decreased by 1.99% during the period 1990-2010. The main reason for this is that built-up areas occupied a significant amount of high-yield cultivated land whereas low-yield land converted in ecologically vulnerable areas. (b) In spite of 77.2 thousand km(2) cultivated land was converted to built-up areas, especially in areas with high economic value, such as Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, 329.4 thousand km(2) land was converted to cultivated land, especially in Northeastern and Northwestern China. (c) The quality gap between cultivated land converted to built-up areas nationally and new cultivated land regionally suggests that the loss of 1 km(2) of cultivated land converted to built-up area would, to achieve equivalency, need to be compensated by 1.54 km(2) of new land in Xinjiang, or more in Northeastern China. However, cultivated land expansion in these areas may cause land degradation and a series of ecological environment problems.

TI  - Investigation of the ice surface albedo in the Tibetan Plateau lakes based on the field observation and MODIS products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau (TP) lakes are sensitive to climate change due to ice-albedo feedback, but almost no study has paid attention to the ice albedo of TP lakes and its potential impacts. Here we present a recent field experiment for observing the lake ice albedo in the TP, and evaluate the applicability of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products as well as ice-albedo parameterizations. Most of the observed lake ice albedos on TP are <0.12, and the clear blue ice albedo is only 0.075, much lower than reported in the previous studies. Even that of ice covered with snow patches is only 0.212. MOD10A1 albedo product has the best agreement with observations, followed by those of MYD10A1. MCD43A3 product is consistently higher than the observations. Due to an error of snow flag and inconsistent time windows in MCD43A2 and MCD43A3, at certain times, the albedo of the ice without snow is even higher than that covered with snow. When the solar zenith angle is not considered, there is no significant correlation between the albedo and the ice surface temperature. None of the existing ice-albedo parameterizations can reproduce well the observed relationship of the albedo and surface temperature.

TI  - Multi-scale effects of urban landscape pattern on plant diversity in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - The changes of urban surface landscape will lead to damage, fragmentation, and losses of biodiversity, resulting in urban biodiversity decline. In order to explore the responses of urban plant diversity to the changes of landscape pattern, we chose the urban area surrounded by round-city highway as research object, set 36 plots in different directions with the Gupeng Square as the center, investigated the plant group in each of the plots through coverage rank method of Braun-Blanquet , and examined the features of plant species diversity in Xuzhou' s greenlands. Meanwhile, we divided the landscape of the research area into seven categories: buildings, grasslands, forest lands, waste lands , water areas , roads and farmlands with the help of Erdas, GIS software and Landsat TM remote sensing images from 2005 to 2015 as basic data source. The features of landscape pattern in the research area were analyzed by Fragstats software. We set nine different buffer districts within each of the sample plot by applying the space analyzing function of GIS , calculated 39 landscape pattern metrics using Fragstats, and explored the features of how plant diversity responsed to landscape pattern. After that, the landscape pattern metrics with significant influence on the plant diversity of urban greenlands under different extents were selected by redundant analysis (RDA). The results showed that the plant diversity had obvious temporal and spatial scale effects in responses to landscape pattern and landscape elements. In 2005 , the patch area and shape metrics of unused land and farmland could better explain plant diversity in 800 m buffer zone. The patch fragmentation and connectivity metrics of construction land had significant impacts on plant diversity within the extent of 800 - 2000 m. In 2015 , grassland and forest landscapes better explained plant diversity in the 800 m buffer zone while construction sites and unused land had a remarkable impact on plant diversity in the extent of 1000-2000 m. The current plant diversity was more strongly influenced by the 2005 landscape type metrics , indicating that the plant diversity lagged in its response to the changes of landscape pattern. The pattern metrics of landscape level were more consistent with the landscape-class level metrics , indicating that the interaction between species and spatial scale was more dependent on the landscape type. This study would provide effective decision-making information for Xuzhou City planning and construction as well as effective protection of urban green space biodiversity.

TI  - Measurement of vegetation parameters and error analysis based on Monte Carlo method
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we bring up a Monte Carlo theory based method to measure the ground vegetation parameters, and make quantitative description of the error. The leaf area index is used as the example in the study. Its mean and variance stability at different scales or in different time is verified using both the computer simulation and the statistics of remotely sensed images. And the error of Monte Carlo sampling method is analyzed based on the normal distribution theory and the central-limit theorem. The results show that the variance of leaf area index in the same area is stable at certain scales or in the same time of different years. The difference between experimental results and theoretical ones is small. The significance of this study is to establish a measurement procedure of ground vegetation parameters with an error control system.

M3  - Article
AB  - The full-genome sequence of bluetongue virus serotype 15 (BTV-15) strain B105/YN/1996 isolated in China was determined for the first time. The virus was isolated from sentinel cattle in Yunnan Province, China, in 1996. The total size of the BTV-15 strain B105/YN/1996 genome is 19,161 bp in length. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that it belongs to the major eastern BTV topotype. This work is the first to document the complete genomic sequence of a BTV-15 strain from China. The sequence information will help determine the geographic origin of Chinese BTV-15 and provide data to facilitate future analyses of the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships of BTV strains.

TI  - A Multivariate Analysis Framework to Detect Key Environmental Factors Affecting Spatiotemporal Variability of Chlorophyll-a in a Tropical Productive Estuarine-Lagoon System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Here, we demonstrate how a combination of three multivariate statistic techniques can identify key environmental factors affecting the seasonal and spatial variability of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in a productive tropical estuarine-lagoon system. Remote estimation of Chl-a was carried out using a NIR-Red model based on MODIS bands, which is highly consistent with the in situ measurement of Chl-a with root mean square error (RMSE) of 15.24 mg m(-3) and 13.43 mg m(-3) for two independent datasets used for the model's calibration and validation, respectively. Our findings suggest that the river discharges and hydraulic residence time of the lagoons promote a stronger effect on the spatial variability of Chl-a in the coastal lagoons, while wind, solar radiation and temperature have a secondary importance. The results also indicate a slight seasonal variability of Chl-a in Mundau lagoon, which are different the from Manguaba lagoon. The multivariate approach was able to fully understand the relative importance of key environmental factors on the spatiotemporal variability of Chl-a of the aquatic ecosystem, providing a powerful tool for reducing dimensionality and analyzing large amounts of satellite-derived Chl-a data.

TI  - LINEAMENT CONTROL ON SPRING CHARACTERISTICS AT CENTRAL WEST PROGO HILLS, INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The research area is located at the central of West Progo Hills, in Yogyakarta and Central Java Province, Indonesia. It is hard water area, but there are some springs appearing from Jonggrangan and Old Andesite Formations. These formations consist of hard, compacted Tertiary rocks which have dissected by some lineaments of structure or morphology. The lineaments may control to springs characteristics, involve their appearance, frequency and discharge. Field observation has been done to collect springs data. The small discharge has been measured by water gauge and stopwatch directly, while the big ones have been measured by river channeling measurements. On the other hands, lineaments were determined from Landsat image, SRTM and topographic map as well as from field. The result shows that lineaments in Old Andesite Formation develop in many directions followed by spring appearance, in random location. Springs in Jonggrangan Formation mainly appear in NE-SW direction in accordance with the azimuth of lineaments almost in SW -NE direction. The springs of both formations usually appear controlled by individual lineaments, indicated by coefficient correlation of 84% for the relationship between distance of spring lineament and the numbers of springs. The density of lineaments also control of springs appearance (r = 62% for cross dots of fractures and r = 51% for length). The distance between lineament and spring to discharge rate of springs seems no influence indicated by r(2) = 0.0495. It means that lineaments influence to spring occurrence in their density and distance characteristics.

TI  - Evapotranspiration management based on the application of SWAT for balancing water consumption: A case study in Guantao, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid social and economic development results in increased demand for water resources. This can lead to the unsustainable development and exploitation of water resources which in turn causes significant environmental problems. Conventional water resource management approaches, such as supply and demand management strategies, frequently fail to restore regional water balance. This paper introduces the concept of water consumption balance, the balance between actual evapotranspiration (ET) and target ET, and establishes a framework to realize regional water balance. The framework consists of three stages: (1) determination of target ET and actual ET; (2) quantification of the water-saving requirements for the region; and (3) reduction of actual ET by implementing various water saving management strategies. Using this framework, a case study was conducted for Guantao County, China. The SWAT model was utilized to aid in the selection of the best water saving management strategy by comparing the ET of different irrigation methods and crop pattern adjustments. Simulation results revealed that determination of SWAT model parameters using remote sensing ET is feasible and that the model is a valuable tool for ET management. Irrigation was found to have a greater influence on the ET of winter wheat as compared to that of maize, indicating that reduction in winter wheat cultivation is the most effective way to reduce regional ET. However, the effect of water-saving irrigation methods on the reduction of ET was not obvious. This indicates that it would be difficult to achieve regional ET reduction using water-saving irrigation methods only. Furthermore, selecting the best water saving management strategy by relying solely on the amount of reduced ET was insufficient, because it ignored the impact of water conservation measures on the livelihood of the agricultural community. Incorporating these considerations with our findings, we recommend changing the current irrigation method to sprinkler irrigation and replacing 20% of the winter wheat-maize cultivated area with cotton, as the best strategy to achieve water balance in the study area.

TI  - Spatial identification of land use multifunctionality at grid scale in farming-pastoral area: A case study of Zhangjiakou City, China
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use mutilfunctionality (LUMF) has recently received increasing attention in scientific and policy contexts because its capacity to bridge the connections between mutilfunctionality and land uses, as well as to integrate production, living and ecology approaches in policy development. This study established a conceptual framework for identifying and evaluating LUMF in spatial grid context from the perspective of structure, function, and well-being. Embedded in the spatial reference framework, a set of spatialization models were applied to quantify and visualize land use functions (LUFs), e.g. production, living, and ecology functions, by using multi-source and multi-scale data (land use data, remote sensing data, meteorological data, and statistical data, etc.) in Zhangjiakou City. The interactions of LUFs were measured, and on this basis, land use zoning was proposed. The results showed that the functionality indexes of production, living, and ecology ranged from 0 to 0.500, 0 to 0.994, and 0 to 0.998, respectively. The high production and living functions, and the low ecology function mainly occurred in well-developed regions, especially in the city center, where existed the strong synergies between production and living functions, as well as the strong trade-offs between the above two functions and ecology function. The low production and living functions, and the high ecology function were mainly distributed in mountain and hilly areas, located in the eastern and southern parts, where existed the weak synergies between production and living functions, and the strong trade-offs among production, living, and ecology functions. Four categories of land use zones were divided at town-level, namely, ecological preservation zones, urbanization development zones, agricultural production zones, and countryside improvement zones, mainly based on the spatial distribution of the synergies and trade-offs among LUFs. This study provides a pathway for quantitatively evaluating LUMF, and making land use zoning division, which provides quantitative information for policy-makers to implement land use optimization, economic development, and ecological protection in the light of the interactions of LUFs.

TI  - A method for coastal oil tank detection in polarimetric SAR images based on recognition of T-shaped harbor
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS ENGINEERING AND ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To automatically detect oil tanks in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, a coastal oil tank detection method is proposed based on recognition of T-shaped harbor. First of all, the T-shaped harbor is detected to locate the region of interest (ROI) of oil tanks. Then all suspicious targets in the ROI are extracted by the segmentation of strong scattering targets and the classifier of H/alpha. The template targets are selected from the suspicious targets by the combination of a proposed circular degree parameter and the similarity parameter (SP) of the polarimetric coherency matrix. Finally, oil tanks are detected according to the statistics of the similarity parameter between each suspicious target and template targets in ROI. Polarimetric SAR data acquired by RADARSAT-2 over Berkeley and Singapore areas are used for testing. Experiment results show that most of the targets are correctly detected and the overall detection rate is close to 80%. The false rate is effectively reduced by the proposed algorithm compared with the method without T-shaped harbor recognition.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Features of Urban Heat Island and Its Relationship with Land Use/Cover in Mountainous City: A Case Study in Chongqing
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) becomes more and more serious with the acceleration of urbanization. Many researchers have shown interest in studying the UHI by using remote sensing data, but these studies rarely examine the mountainous cities. Studies on UHI in mountainous cities often used empirical parameters to estimate the land surface temperature (LST), and lacked satellite-ground synchronous experiments to test the accuracy. This paper revised the parameters in the mono-window algorithm used to retrieve the LST according to the characteristics of mountainous cities. This study examined the spatial and temporal patterns of the UHI intensity in Chongqing, a typical mountainous city, and its relationship with land cover from 2007 to 2016 based on the Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 TIRS data and the improved method. The accuracy of the LST derivation increased by about 1 degrees C compared to the traditional method. The high LST areas increased and extended from the downtown to suburban area each year, but the rate of change decreased. The UHI is dramatically impacted by the rivers. There is a good relationship between the urban sprawl and the UHI. The LST was reduced by about 1 degrees C within a 300 m distance from large urban fringe green spaces. The urban landscape parks had a strong effect relieving the UHI at a 100 m distance. The LST was reduced by about 0.5 degrees C. This study greatly improves the accuracy of LST derivation, and provides reliable parameters for the UHI researched in mountainous cities.

TI  - Measurement and distribution of urban light pollution as day changes to night
T2  - LIGHTING RESEARCH & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Light pollution has a serious impact on astronomical observations and ecological balance. So far, most scholars have carried out field measurements of urban sky glow luminance using satellite data. However, measurement of the light environment of an entire city is insufficient. This paper presents measurements of the sky within the city of Dalian and examines the changes in the distribution of luminance and colour temperature of the sky. It was found that over the transition from day to night the colour temperature of the sky decreases by approximately 2000 K-3000 K and the light spectrum transforms from a relatively uniform distribution to one with an obvious peak. Additionally, the zenith luminance is up to 0.01cd/m(2), more than 50 times the standard dark sky luminance. Dalian experiences serious light pollution.

TI  - Zonation and Directional Dynamics of Mangrove Forests Derived from Time-Series Satellite Imagery in Mai Po, Hong Kong
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove deforestation is occurring globally at a rapid rate, and is causing serious ecological and economic losses on all scales. Monitoring mangrove changes is the first important step for mangrove management and conservation. Zonation of mangrove species (ZMS) is the predictable and discrete ordering of mangrove species caused by a unique, intertidal environment. Mapping the ZMS is critical to understanding the mangrove community at a species level. In this paper, the Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) was proposed as a method to evaluate mangrove species from a new dimension of directional changes. Three dominant mangrove species, Kandelia obovata (KO), Avicennia marina (AM), and Acanthus ilicifolius (AI), in Mai Po, Hong Kong were analyzed using SDEs based on the time series Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT) and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite images. The SDE results demonstrated that in the past 25 years: (1) The overall spatial extent of the mangroves in Mai Po expanded significantly, approximately from 150 to 350 Ha, and show a zonation pattern with a clear sequence of species perpendicular to the shoreline; (2) KO was the dominant species in most years, showing the strongest directional characteristic; (3) All three species zones have moved toward the north and west, as observed by the SDE centers. The SDE was proved to be a useful tool for understanding the temporal and spatial changes of mangrove zonation.

TI  - Risk assessment of storm surge disaster based on numerical models and remote sensing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Storm surge is one of the most serious ocean disasters in the world. Risk assessment of storm surge disaster for coastal areas has important implications for planning economic development and reducing disaster losses. Based on risk assessment theory, this paper uses coastal hydrological observations, a numerical storm surge model and multi-source remote sensing data, proposes methods for valuing hazard and vulnerability for storm surge and builds a storm surge risk assessment model. Storm surges in different recurrence periods are simulated in numerical models and the flooding areas and depth are calculated, which are used for assessing the hazard of storm surge; remote sensing data and GIS technology are used for extraction of coastal key objects and classification of coastal land use are identified, which is used for vulnerability assessment of storm surge disaster. The storm surge risk assessment model is applied for a typical coastal city, and the result shows the reliability and validity of the risk assessment model. The building and application of storm surge risk assessment model provides some basis reference for the city development plan and strengthens disaster prevention and mitigation.

TI  - Forest Type Identification with Random Forest Using Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-2A, Multi-Temporal Landsat-8 and DEM Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Carbon sink estimation and ecological assessment of forests require accurate forest type mapping. The traditional survey method is time consuming and labor intensive, and the remote sensing method with high-resolution, multi-spectral commercial satellite images has high cost and low availability. In this study, we explore and evaluate the potential of freely-available multi-source imagery to identify forest types with an object-based random forest algorithm. These datasets included Sentinel-2A (S2), Sentinel-1A (S1) in dual polarization, one-arc-second Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission Digital Elevation (DEM) and multi-temporal Landsat-8 images (L8). We tested seven different sets of explanatory variables for classifying eight forest types in Wuhan, China. The results indicate that single-sensor (S2) or single-day data (L8) cannot obtain satisfactory results; the overall accuracy was 54.31% and 50.00%, respectively. Compared with the classification using only Sentinel-2 data, the overall accuracy increased by approximately 15.23% and 22.51%, respectively, by adding DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery. The highest accuracy (82.78%) was achieved with fused imagery, the terrain and multi-temporal data contributing the most to forest type identification. These encouraging results demonstrate that freely-accessible multi-source remotely-sensed data have tremendous potential in forest type identification, which can effectively support monitoring and management of forest ecological resources at regional or global scales.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional NDVI-T-s space is triangular or trapezoidal, but Liu et al. (2015) discovered that the NDVI-T-s space was bi-parabolic when the study area was covered with low biomass vegetation. Moreover, the numerical value of the indicator was considered in most of the study when the drought conditions in the space domain were evaluated. In addition, quantitatively assessing the spatial-temporal changes of the drought was not enough. In this study, first, we used MODIS NDVI and T-s data to reexamine if the NDVI-T-s space with time and a single pixel domain is bi-parabolic in the Shaanxi province of China, which is vegetated with low biomass to high biomass. This is compared with the triangular NDVI-T-s space and one of the well-known drought indexes called the temperature-vegetation index (TVX). The results demonstrated that dry and wet edges exhibited a parabolic shape again in scatter plots of T-s and NDVI in the Shaanxi province, which was linear in the triangular NDVI-T-s space. The Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDIc) was obtained from bi-parabolic NDVI-T-s andTVDI(t) was obtained from the triangular NDVI-T-s space and TVX were compared with 10-cm depth relative soil moisture. By estimating the 10-cm depth soil moisture, TVDIc was better than TVDIt, which were all apparently better than TVX. Second, combined with MODIS data, the drought conditions of the study area were assessed by TVDIc between 2000 to 2016. Spatially, the drought in the Shaanxi Province between 2000 to 2016 were mainly distributed in the northwest, North Shaanxi, and the North and East Guanzhong plain. The drought area of the Shaanxi province accounted for 31.95% in 2000 and 27.65% in 2016, respectively. Third, we quantitatively evaluated the variation of the drought status by using Gradient-based Structural Similarity (GSSIM) methods. The area of the drought conditions significantly changed and moderately changed at 5.34% and 40.22%, respectively, between 2000 and 2016. Finally, the possible reasons for drought change were discussed. The change of precipitation, temperature, irrigation, destruction or betterment of vegetation, and the enlargement of opening mining, etc., can lead to the variations of drought.

TI  - Prognostic significance of further axillary dissection in breast cancer patients with micrometastases & the number of micrometastases: a SEER population-based analysis
T2  - FUTURE SCIENCE OA
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To investigate the benefits of axillary dissection in patients with micrometastases. Methods: A review of data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was performed from 2004 to 2013. Kaplan-Meier curves, Cox regression models, and propensity score matching were utilized to comprehensively evaluate the cohort. Results: Multivariate analysis after propensity score matching showed that patients with one to two micrometastases did not substantially benefit from axillary lymph node dissection in breast cancer-specific survival (p = 0.725). However, a subgroup analysis indicated that axillary dissection may benefit estrogen receptor-negative patients. Moreover, patients who carried three micrometastases had a significantly lower crude hazard ratio in breast cancer-specific survival. Conclusion: Axillary lymph node dissection may have advantages in high-risk micrometastatic patients. Patients with three micrometastases should be treated with caution.Lay abstract: The current study demonstrated that among patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery following radiation with T1-T2 invasive breast cancer and one to two nodal micrometastases, there was no difference in the breast cancer-specific survival for patients with and without axillary lymph node dissection. Although negative results of the Z0011 and International Breast Cancer Study Group 23-01 trials have been reported, high-risk micrometastatic patients (e.g., estrogen receptor negative, young age) may be candidates for radical axillary treatment according to the unclear radiation field and higher recurrence rate. The preliminary assessment of three micrometastatic patients showed a lower breast cancer-specific survival than patients with one to two micrometastases. This study provides a novel perspective to the American Joint Committee on Cancer with respect to micrometastases.

TI  - Evaluating the surface temperature and vegetation index (<i>Ts/VI</i>) method for estimating surface soil moisture in heterogeneous regions
T2  - HYDROLOGY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The surface temperature and vegetation index (Ts/VI) method is a remote sensing-based quantitative approach. It is widely used for estimating the evapotranspiration, evaporative fraction, and surface soil moisture (SSM). However, this method can only be used in flat regions. In this study, we investigated the effect of altitude when using the Ts/VI method for estimating the SSM in heterogeneous regions. The results showed that the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) method performed poorly at estimating the SSM in the source region of the Yangtze River; there was a weak correlation with the observed SSM, and R-2 was only 0.167. However, the performance of the method improved considerably when the effects of both altitude and frozen soil were considered; the TVDI had a strong correlation with the observed SSM, and R-2 improved to 0.617. In the study area, the effects of altitude on the TVDI values were greater than those of the frozen soil. In general, the Ts/VI method can obtain satisfactory results in mountainous regions if the effects of both the altitude and frozen soil are considered.

TI  - Investigation of Short-Term Evolution of Soil Characteristics over the Lake Chad Basin Using GRACE Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the Sahelian region, the West African Monsoon (WAM) is an important phenomenon for land water storage evolution, as demonstrated by The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) estimations. The Monsoon leads to an annual increase of the water mass. However, GRACE data also displays the existence of a semi-annual cycle whose its origin is still uncertain. This cycle is characterized by a gain of water mass at the beginning of the dry season. In this study, 10-days GRACE data are used to understand the characteristics of this semi-annual cycle. Investigations of the rainfall events, rivers discharge peaks, and the Lake Chad water level variations suggest that they are not at the origin of this cycle. However, MODIS evapotranspiration data display an increase each 6 months, during the rainy season, and at the same time as the semi-annual cycle estimated by GRACE. This increase occurs in regions where the amount of clays at the surface exceeds 30%. The link between both signals and the proportion of clays at the surface leads us to the conclusion that the seasonal variation of the vertical permeability of clays controls the amount of water present in the unsaturated zone.

TI  - Evaluation of SEBS, SEBAL, and METRIC models in estimation of the evaporation from the freshwater lakes (Case study: Amirkabir dam, Iran)
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation is of great importance due to its key role in water resource management. Surface energy modeling tools such as Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL), Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration (METRIC), and the Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) can estimate the amount of evapotranspiration for every pixel of the satellite images. The main objective of this research is evaporation investigation from the freshwater bodies using SEBAL, METRIC, and SEBS. For this purpose, the Amirkabir dam reservoir and its nearby agricultural lands in a semi-arid climate were selected and studied from 2011 to 2017 as the study area. The implementations of this study were accomplished on 16 satellite images of Landsat TM5 and OLI. Then, SEBAL, METRIC, and SEBS were implemented on the selected images. Moreover, the corresponding pan evaporate measurements on the reservoir bank were considered as the ground truth data. Regarding to the results, SEBAL is not a reliable method to evaluate freshwater evaporation with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.36 and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 5.1 mm. On the other hand, METRIC with RMSE and R-2 of 0,57 and 2.02 mm and SEBS with RMSE and R-2 of 0.93 and 0.62 demonstrated a relatively good performance.

TI  - Topographic controls on the surging behaviour of Sabche Glacier, Nepal (1967 to 2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Using a combination of Landsat, Pleiades and CORONA satellite imagery from 1967 to 2017, we map changes in the terminus position, ice surface velocity and surface elevation of Sabche Glacier, and report the first observations of surging behaviour in central Nepal. Our observations show that Sabche Glacier surged four times over the last 50 years. The three most recent surges occurred at 10 to 11-year cycles, which is one of the shortest surge cycles ever recorded. Detailed analysis of the most recent surge (2012 onwards), indicates that the glacier advanced 2.2 km and experienced maximum velocities of 1.6 +/- 0.10 m day(-1). During this surge, there was a surface elevation gain at the terminus of up to 90 +/- 6.19 m a(-1), with a corresponding surface lowering of between 10 +/- 6.19 and 60 +/- 6.19 m a(-1), 3 km up-glacier of the terminus. This transfer of mass amounted to a volume of similar to 2.7 x 10(7) +/- 0.1 x 10(7) m(3)a(-1). Sabche Glacier is the first surge-type glacier to be observed in the central Himalayas, but this is consistent with a previous global analysis which indicates that surge-type glaciers should exist in the region. We hypothesise that the surge is at least partially controlled by subglacial topography, whereby a major subglacial overdeepening and constriction 3 km up-glacier of the terminus provides resistance to glacier flow from the accumulation area to the ablation area. This overdeepening appears to store mass until a threshold is crossed, after which the glacier flows out of the subglacial depression and rapidly surges over a bedrock lip and down the valley. Thus, whilst the surges are likely to be facilitated by subglacial processes (e.g. changes in subglacial hydrology and/or basal thermal regime), the topographic setting of the glacier appears to be modulating both the timing and duration of each surge.

TI  - Examining soil organic carbon distribution and dynamic change in a hickory plantation region with Landsat and ancillary data
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) is an important soil property relating to soil formation, structure, and water-holding capacity. Remote sensing has been used for predicting SOC but remains a challenge due to the complex and indirect relationship between SOC and remote sensing variables. In this research we explored the approaches of predicting SOC distribution in a hickory plantation region using random forest (RF) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) based on Landsat and ancillary data, analyzed SOC spatial distribution and dynamic change between 2008 and 2013 through a thresholding approach, and examined major factors that resulted in SOC degradation in the young and mature hickory plantations using a logistic regression. The results showed that RF outperformed GWR in the prediction of SOC and provided stable and reliable SOC predictions with root mean squared errors of 4.6 g kg(-1) in 2008 and 4.4 g kg(-1) in 2013. A large area of hickory plantation was experiencing SOC decrease. The analysis of major factors causing SOC degradation indicated that steep slope and high proportion of silt component in soil resulted in SOC decrease in the young hickory plantations, and high elevation, high proportion of silt component in the soil, and the increase of soil fraction in the ground cover led to SOC decrease in the mature hickory plantations. This research provides valuable approaches to spatially predict SOC and identify major factors driving SOC degradation, which will be useful for adopting better measures to improve management of hickory plantations.

TI  - Comparison of Phenology Estimated from Reflectance-Based Indices and Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) Observations in a Temperate Forest Using GPP-Based Phenology as the Standard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We assessed the performance of reflectance-based vegetation indices and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) datasets with various spatial and temporal resolutions in monitoring the Gross Primary Production (GPP)-based phenology in a temperate deciduous forest. The reflectance-based indices include the green chromatic coordinate (GCC), field measured and satellite remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI); and the SIF datasets include ground-based measurement and satellite-based products. We found that, if negative impacts due to coarse spatial and temporal resolutions are effectively reduced, all these data can serve as good indicators of phenological metrics for spring. However, the autumn phenological metrics derived from all reflectance-based datasets are later than the those derived from ground-based GPP estimates (flux sites). This is because the reflectance-based observations estimate phenology by tracking physiological properties including leaf area index (LAI) and leaf chlorophyll content (Chl), which does not reflect instantaneous changes in phenophase transitions, and thus the estimated fall phenological events may be later than GPP-based phenology. In contrast, we found that SIF has a good potential to track seasonal transition of photosynthetic activities in both spring and fall seasons. The advantage of SIF in estimating the GPP-based phenology lies in its inherent link to photosynthesis activities such that SIF can respond quickly to all factors regulating phenological events. Despite uncertainties in phenological metrics estimated from current spaceborne SIF observations due to their coarse spatial and temporal resolutions, dates in middle spring and autumnthe two most important metricscan still be reasonably estimated from satellite SIF. Our study reveals that SIF provides a better way to monitor GPP-based phenological metrics.

TI  - Accounting for soil porosity improves a thermal inertia model for estimating surface soil water content
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil thermal inertia (P), a property that controls the temporal variation of near-surface temperature, has been used to estimate surface water content (theta) in remote sensing studies. The accuracy of theta estimates, however, is affected by surface soil porosity (n). We hypothesize that n can be derived using a simple linear n-P relationship of a dry surface soil layer, and that accounting for n improves the accuracy of theta estimation using a P(theta) model. The P of a surface layer was measured by using the heat pulse method during a drying period, and the feasibility of estimating theta with a P(theta) model that included n was explored. The approach was also tested with published P values derived from meteorological data and MODIS data against in situ theta measurements at two field sites in Arizona, USA. The results on a partially vegetated shrubland indicated that by using the P-derived n, the P(theta) model provided more accurate theta estimates than by using the literature n values. Discrepancies between modeled theta and in situ theta measurements were observed at small theta values, which were caused in part by the fact that the modeled theta represented soil layers a few millimeters thick, while the in situ measurements represented theta at the 5 cm depth. The new n-P function has potential for estimating surface theta accurately using multi-scale P data on bare soils or on sparsely vegetated lands.

TI  - Analysis of intra-day solar irradiance variability in different Brazilian climate zones
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main barriers to increasing the solar energy share is its intermittency. Solar energy's large variability in different timescales is driven by natural solar astronomical cycles and weather. Ground-based measurements are important for evaluating variability at high temporal resolutions, but they are only representative of small areas close to the measurement sites. Satellite observations come as an alternative to analysis over large areas. However, they have coarse temporal and spatial resolutions. In our study, we first evaluated the variability in different time steps, using one-year of 1-min resolution ground-based irradiance measured at three sites located in different Brazilian climate regimes. The results showed that more humid months have the largest variability. By contrast, the driest locations presented more variability on short timescales, probably due to the presence of a large number of clouds, even in very dry conditions. This characteristic can be of concern to Brazilian energy planning since the site is located in the most prominent region for solar energy generation. We also compared ground observations with satellite cloud variability, with 30-min resolution. For the same timescale, the results were promising, with a Pearson correlation of up to 0.93, depending on the site. However, when the frequency of the solar irradiance measurements increased, the correlation decreased. A solution may be to analyze a larger pixel area around the sites. Another option would be the use of downscaling methods. This topic, however, will be the subject of the future study. The most important result achieved in this study was the development of a simple methodology for evaluating the surface solar irradiance variability using cloud cover obtained from visible satellite imagery.

TI  - Land Cover Change Detection Based on Adaptive Contextual Information Using Bi-Temporal Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change detection (LCCD) based on bi-temporal remote sensing images plays an important role in the inventory of land cover change. Due to the benefit of having spatial dependency properties within the image space while using remote sensing images for detecting land cover change, many contextual information-based change detection methods have been proposed in past decades. However, there is still a space for improvement in accuracies and usability of LCCD. In this paper, a LCCD method based on adaptive contextual information is proposed. First, an adaptive region is constructed by gradually detecting the spectral similarity surrounding a central pixel. Second, the Euclidean distance between pairwise extended regions is calculated to measure the change magnitude between the pairwise central pixels of bi-temporal images. All the bi-temporal images are scanned pixel by pixel so the change magnitude image (CMI) can be generated. Then, the Otsu or a manual threshold is employed to acquire the binary change detection map (BCDM). The detection accuracies of the proposed approach are investigated by three land cover change cases with Landsat bi-temporal remote sensing images and aerial images with very high spatial resolution (0.5 m/pixel). In comparison to several widely used change detection methods, the proposed approach can produce a land cover change inventory map with a competitive accuracy.

TI  - The influence of optical depth predictors on the rapid forward accuracy of infrared channels of FY-4 AGRI
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast radiative transmission model can quickly calculate the transmittances coefficients by extending a series of optical depth core functions and channel spectral characteristics, so as to obtain an accuracy that is compatible with the line-by-line model. In this paper, four fast forward operators are established to predict the optical depth (OD) of mixed gas, water vapor line absorption and water vapor continuum absorption of RTTOV v7, v8, v9 and CRTM v2. 1 in 6 infrared channels of AGRI in FY-4. The largest STDs of all the four fast operators are less than 0. 6 K in brightness temperature of AGRI. The STD of water vapor, CO2 and channel transmittances simulation in RTTOV v9 are the smallest among the four models. And the errors are less in lower levels than that of higher levels in the channel transmittances simulation. Experiments were also conducted using standard atmospheric profiles to calculate the Jacobine and OD of the mixed gas, water vapor absorption and water vapor continuum absorption. The OD errors of the mixed gas decrease with the new information of the deviations of real atmosphere profiles and the reference ones in v9. Simulations of OD of water vapor are improved by 19 water vapor line absorption profiles and 4 water vapor continuum absorption ones in v9.

T2  - BIRTH-ISSUES IN PERINATAL CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundMaternal mortality is a sentinel indicator of health care quality. Our purpose was to analyze trends in Texas maternal mortality by demographic characteristics and cause of death, and to evaluate data quality.MethodsMaternal mortality data were initially analyzed by single years, but then were grouped into 5-year averages (2006-2010 and 2011-2015) for more detailed analyses. Rates were computed per 100000 live births. A two-proportion z test or Poisson regression for numerators <30 was used to evaluate differences.ResultsThe Texas maternal mortality rate increased from 18.6 in 2010 to 38.7 in 2012, and then declined nonsignificantly to 32.5 in 2015. The 2011-2015 rate (34.2) was 87% higher than the 2006-2010 rate (18.3). In 2011-2015, the maternal mortality rate for women 40years (558.8) was 27 times higher than for women <40years (20.7). From 2006-2010 to 2011-2015, the maternal mortality rate increased by 121% for women 40years and by 55% for women <40years. The rate increased by 132% for nonspecific causes of death, and by 54% for specific causes. Rates for women <40years for specific causes increased by 36%.ConclusionsThe observed increase in maternal mortality in Texas from 2006-2010 to 2011-2015 is likely a result of both a true increase in rates and increased overreporting of maternal deaths, as indicated by implausibly high and increasing rates for women aged 40years and among nonspecific causes of death. Efforts are needed to strengthen reporting of death certificate data, and to improve access to quality maternal health care services.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Andaman Sea in the Indian Ocean has been a classical study region for Internal Solitary Waves (ISWs) for several decades. Papers such as Osborne and Burch (1980) usually describe mode-1 packets of ISWs propagating eastwards, separated by distances of around 100 km. In this paper, we report on shorter period solitary-like waves that are consistent with a mode-2 vertical structure, which are observed along the Ten Degree Channel, and propagate side-by-side the usual large mode-1 solitary wave packets. The mode-2 waves are identified in TerraSAR-X images because of their distinct surface signatures, which are reversed when compared to those that are typical of mode-1 ISWs in the ocean. These newly observed regularly-spaced packets of ISW-like waves are characterized by average separations of roughly 30 km, which are far from the nominal mode-1 or even the mode-2 internal tidal wavelengths. On some occasions, five consecutive and regularly spaced mode-2 ISW-like wave envelopes were observed simultaneously in the same TerraSAR-X image. This fact points to a tidal generation mechanism somewhere in the west shallow ridges, south of the Nicobar Islands. Furthermore, it implies that unusually long-lived mode-2 waves can be found throughout the majority of the fortnightly tidal cycle. Ray tracing techniques are used to identify internal tidal beams as a possible explanation for the generation of the mode-2 solitary-like waves when the internal tidal beam interacts with the ocean pycnocline. Linear theory suggests that resonant coupling with long internal waves of higher-mode could explain the longevity of the mode-2 waves, which propagate for more than 100 km. Owing to their small-scale dimensions, the mode-2 waves may have been overlooked in previous remote sensing images. The enhanced radiometric resolution of the TerraSAR-X, alongside its wide coverage and detailed spatial resolutions, make it an ideal observational tool for the present study.

TI  - Marine aerosol distribution and variability over the pristine Southern Indian Ocean
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an 8-year (2005-2012 inclusive) study of the marine aerosol distribution and variability over the Southern Indian Ocean, precisely in the area {10 degrees S- 40 degrees S; 50 degrees E- 110 degrees E} which has been identified as one of the most pristine regions of the globe. A large dataset consisting of satellite data (POLDER, CALIOP), AERONET measurements at Saint-Denis (French Reunion Island) and model reanalysis (MACC), has been used. In spite of a positive bias of about 0.05 between the AOD (aerosol optical depth) given by POLDER and MACC on one hand and the AOD measured by AERONET on the other, consistent results for aerosol distribution and variability over the area considered have been obtained. First, aerosols are mainly confined below 2 Ion asl (above sea level) and are dominated by sea salt, especially in the center of the area of interest, with AOD <= 0. 1. This zone is the most pristine and is associated with the position of the Mascarene anticyclone. There, the direct radiative effect is assessed around -9 W m(-2) at the top of the atmosphere and probability density functions of the AODs are leptokurtic lognormal functions without any significant seasonal variation. It is also suggested that the Madden-Jullian oscillation impacts sea salt emissions in the northern part of the area considered by modifying the state of the ocean surface. Finally, this area is surrounded in the northeast and the southwest by seasonal Australian and South African intrusions (AOD > 0.1); throughout the year, the ITCZ seems to limit continental contaminations from Asia. Due to the long period of time considered (almost a decade), this paper completes and strengthens results of studies based on observations performed during previous specific field campaigns.

TI  - Factors Predictive of Sentinel Lymph Node Involvement in Primary Breast Cancer
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has replaced axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) for axillary staging in patients with early-stage breast cancer. The need for therapeutic ALND is the subject of ongoing debate especially after the publication of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial. In a retrospective trial with univariate and multivariate analyses, factors predictive of sentinel lymph node involvement should be analyzed in order to define tumor characteristics of breast cancer patients, where SLNB should not be spared to receive important indicators for adjuvant treatment decisions (e.g. thoracic wall irradiation after mastectomy with or without reconstruction). Patients and Methods: Between 2006 and 2010, 1,360 patients with primary breast cancer underwent SLNB withlwithout ALND with evaluation of tumor localization, multicentricity and multifocality, histological subtype, tumor size, grading, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), and estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 status. These characteristics were retrospectively analyzed in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models to define significant predictive factors for sentinel lymph node involvement. The multivariate analysis demonstrated that tumor size and LVI (p<0.001) were independent predictive factors for metastatic sentinel lymph node involvement in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Conclusion: Because of the increased risk for metastatic involvement of axillary sentinel nodes in cases with larger breast cancer or diagnosis of LVI, patients with these breast cancer characteristics should not be spared from SLNB in a clinically node-negative situation in order to avoid falsenegative results with a high potential for wrong indication of primary breast reconstruction or wrong non-indication of necessary post-mastectomy radiation therapy. The prognostic impact of avoidance of axillary staging with SLNB is analyzed in the ongoing prospective INSEMA trial.

TI  - A history of exploring cancer in context
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - The concept that progression of cancer is regulated by interactions of cancer cells with their microenvironment was postulated by Stephen Paget over a century ago. Contemporary tumour microenvironment (TME) research focuses on the identification of tumour-interacting microenvironmental constituents, such as resident or infiltrating non-tumour cells, soluble factors and extracellular matrix components, and the large variety of mechanisms by which these constituents regulate and shape the malignant phenotype of tumour cells. In this Timeline article, we review the developmental phases of the TME paradigm since its initial description. While illuminating controversies, we discuss the importance of interactions between various microenvironmental components and tumour cells and provide an overview and assessment of therapeutic opportunities and modalities by which the TME can be targeted.

T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Kurseong municipality and it's surrounding hill slope in the part of Darjeeling Himalayas, one of the major biodiversity hotspots in India. This paper is dealt with the spatio-temporal outline of settlement expansion in Kurseong municipality and its surrounding area. Two land-use land-cover maps for the year 1991 and 2017 were prepared from Landsat images to estimate annual land use change rate using support vector machine model in ArcGis10.3 and Erdas Imagine 2014 software. Two important methods for such application of binary map and posting assessment method were applied in the change in LULC. 5 TM and 8 OLI Landsat images used for analyzing land use/land cover change and its impact on land surface temperature in Kurseong municipality and its surrounding hill slope Darjeeling Himalaya of West Bengal, India. Split window algorithm and spectral radiance model were used for determining land surface temperature with the help of Landsat 8 OLI and Landsat 5 TM, duet on ArcGis10.3. The average change in land surface temperature revealed that the spreading settlement area recorded the highest increase in temperature. The expansion of human settlement or development of communication lines over the surface resulted in the declining of vegetation cover and increased land surface temperature, which can be seen as the Darjeeling Himalaya of the near future, the hill slope in the biodiversity loss.

TI  - Streamflow response to shrinking glaciers under changing climate in the Lidder Valley, Kashmir Himalayas
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigated the streamflow response to the shrinking cryosphere under changing climate in the Lidder valley, Upper Indus Basin (UIB), Kashmir Himalayas. We used a combination of multitemporal satellite data and topographic maps to evaluate the changes in area, length and volume of the glaciers from 1962 to 2013. A total of 37 glaciers from the Lidder valley, with an area of 39.76 km(2) in 1962 were selected for research in this study. It was observed that the glaciers in the valley have lost similar to 28.89 +/- 0.1% of the area and similar to 19.65 +/- 0.069% of the volume during the last 51 years, with variable interdecadal recession rates. Geomorphic and climatic influences on the shrinking glacier resources were studied. 30-years temperature records (1980-2010) in the study area showed a significant increasing trend in all the seasons. However, the total annual precipitation during the same period showed a nonsignificant decreasing trend except during the late summer months (July, August and September), when the increasing trend is significant. The depletion of glaciers has led to the significant depletion of the streamflows under the changing climate in the valley. Summer streamflows (1971-2012) have increased significantly till mid-nineties but decreased significantly thereafter, suggesting that the tipping point of streamflow peak, due to the enhanced glacier-melt contribution under increasing global temperatures, may have been already reached in the basin. The observed glacier recession and climate change patterns, if continued in future, would further deplete the streamflows with serious implications on water supplies for different uses in the region.

TI  - Monitoring the Agung (Indonesia) Ash Plume of November 2017 by Means of Infrared Himawari 8 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Agung volcano (Bali; Indonesia) erupted in later November 2017 after several years of quiescence. Because of ash emissions, hundreds of flights were cancelled, causing an important air traffic disruption in Indonesia. We investigate those ash emissions from space by applying the RSTASH algorithm for the first time to Himawari-8 data and using an ad hoc implementation scheme to reduce the time of the elaboration processes. Himawari-8 is a new generation Japanese geostationary meteorological satellite, whose AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) sensor offers improved features, in terms of spectral, spatial and temporal resolution, in comparison with the previous imagers of the MTSAT (Multi-Functional Transport Satellite) series. Those features should guarantee further improvements in monitoring rapidly evolving weather/environmental phenomena. Results of this work show that RSTASH was capable of successfully detecting and tracking the Agung ash plume, despite some limitations (e.g., underestimation of ash coverage under certain conditions; generation of residual artefacts). Moreover, estimates of ash cloud-top height indicate that the monitored plume extended up to an altitude of about 9.3 km above sea level during the period 25 November at 21:10 UTC-26 November at 00:50 UTC. The study demonstrates that RSTASH may give a useful contribution for the operational monitoring of ash clouds over East Asia and the Western Pacific region, well exploiting the 10 min temporal resolution and the spectral features of the Himawari-8 data.

TI  - Historical and Operational Monitoring of Surface Sediments in the Lower Mekong Basin Using Landsat and Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir construction and land use change are altering sediment transport within river systems at a global scale. Changes in sediment transport can impact river morphology, aquatic ecosystems, and ultimately the growth and retreat of delta environments. The Lower Mekong Basin is crucial to five neighboring countries for transportation, energy production, sustainable water supply, and food production. In response, countries have coordinated to develop programs for regional scale water quality monitoring that including surface sediment concentrations (SSSC); however, these programs are based on a limited number of point measurements and due to resource limitations, cannot provide comprehensive insights into sediment transport across all strategic locations within the Lower Mekong Basin. To augment in situ SSSC data from the current monitoring program, we developed an empirical model to estimate SSSC across the Lower Mekong Basin from Landsat observations. Model validation revealed that remotely sensed SSSC estimates captured the spatial and temporal dynamics in a range of aquatic environments (main stem of Mekong river, tributary systems, Mekong Floodplain, and reservoirs) while, on average, slightly underestimating SSSC by about 2 mgL-1across all settings. The operational SSSC model was developed and implemented using Google Earth Engine and Google App Engine was used to host an online application that allows users, without any knowledge of remote sensing, to access SSSC data across the region. Expanded access to SSSC data should be particularly helpful for resource managers and other stakeholders seeking to understand the dynamics between surface sediment concentrations and land use conversions, water policy, and energy production in a globally strategic region.

TI  - ERT, GPR, InSAR, and tracer tests to characterize karst aquifer systems under urban areas: The case of Quebec City
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban infrastructures built over karst settings may be at risk of collapse due to hydro-chemical erosion of underlying rock structures. In such settings, mapping cave networks and monitoring ground stability is important to assure civil safety and guide future infrastructure development decisions. However, no technique can directly and comprehensively map these hydrogeological features and monitor their stability. The most reliable method to map a cave network is through speleological exploration, which is not always possible due to restrictions, narrow corridors/passages, or high water levels. Borehole drilling is expensive and is often only performed where the presence of karsts is suggested by other techniques. Numerous indirect and cost-effective methods exist to map a karst flow system, such as geophysics, geodesy, and tracer tests. This paper presents the outcomes from a challenging application in Quebec City. Canada, where a multidisciplinary approach was designed to better understand the groundwater dynamics and cave paths.Two tracer tests in groundwater flowing through the cave system indicated that water flows along an approximately straight path from the sinking stream to the spring. It also suggests the presence of a parallel flow path close to the one already partially mapped. This observation was confirmed by combining Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) techniques, and ultimately by observing voids in several boreholes drilled close to the main cave path. Lowering the water levels at the suspected infiltration zone and inside the karst, the infiltration cracks were identified and the hydraulic link between them was confirmed. In fact, almost no infiltration occurs into the karst system when the water level at the sinking stream drops below a threshold level. Finally, SAR interferometry (InSAR) using RADARSAT-2 images detected movements on few buildings located over a backfilled sinkhole intercepted by the karst system and confirmed the stability of the rest of the karst area. The knowledge of the flow system described in this paper is used by policy makers to assure civil security of this densely populated area. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Fear-based niche shifts in neotropical birds
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Predation is a strong ecological force that shapes animal communities through natural selection. Recent studies have shown the cascading effects of predation risk on ecosystems through changes in prey behavior. Minimizing predation risk may explain why multiple prey species associate together in space and time. For example, mixed-species flocks that have been widely documented from forest systems, often include birds that eavesdrop on sentinel species (alarm calling heterospecifics). Sentinel species may be pivotal in (1) allowing flocking species to forage in open areas within forests that otherwise incur high predation risk, and (2) influencing flock occurrence (the amount of time species spend with a flock). To test this, we conducted a short-term removal experiment in an Amazonian lowland rainforest to test whether flock habitat use and flock occurrence was influenced by sentinel presence. Antshrikes (genus Thamnomanes) act as sentinels in Amazonian mixed-species flocks by providing alarm calls widely used by other flock members. The alarm calls provide threat information about ambush predators such as hawks and falcons which attack in flight. We quantified home range behavior, the forest vegetation profile used by flocks, and the proportion occurrence of other flocking species, both before and after removal of antshrikes from flocks. We found that when sentinel species were removed, (1) flock members shifted habitat use to lower risk habitats with greater vegetation cover, and (2) species flock occurrence decreased. We conclude that eavesdropping on sentinel species may allow other species to expand their realized niche by allowing them to safely forage in high-risk habitats within the forest. In allowing species to use extended parts of the forest, sentinel species may influence overall biodiversity across a diverse landscape.

TI  - Use of Farmer Knowledge in the Delineation of Potential Management Zones in Precision Agriculture: A Case Study in Maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.)
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the fields of research in precision agriculture (PA) is the delineation of potential management zones (PMZs, also known as site-specific management zones, or simply management zones). To delineate PMZs, cluster analysis is the main used and recommended methodology. For cluster analysis, mainly yield maps, remote sensing multispectral indices, apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa), and topography data are used. Nevertheless, there is still no accepted protocol or guidelines for establishing PMZs, and different solutions exist. In addition, the farmer's expert knowledge is not usually taken into account in the delineation process. The objective of the present work was to propose a methodology to delineate potential management zones for differential crop management that expresses the productive potential of the soil within a field. The Management Zone Analyst (MZA) software, which implements a fuzzy c-means algorithm, was used to create different alternatives of PMZ that were validated with yield data in a maize (Zea mays L.) field. The farmers' expert knowledge was then taken into account to improve the resulting PMZs that best fitted to the yield spatial variability pattern. This knowledge was considered highly valuable information that could be also very useful for deciding management actions to be taken to reduce within-field variability.

TI  - Modern Social And Environmental Strategies Of Nature Protection: Environmental Paradigm
T2  - MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of the study is due to the imperatives of environmental protection - the survival of the biosphere and humanity in the era of the global environmental crisis. The solution to this problem is not possible without coordinated actions of the world community, coherent systemic actions of States, societies and businesses, without awareness by the masses of people of threaten to them and their descendants from consequences of environmental dangers. Under the current circumstances, there is a necessity for formation a new ecological worldview of man, the core of which is not traditional anthropocentric, and environmental ethical values based on the unity of man and the environment, on the recognition of the right of all kinds of wildlife to equal value with man - freedom of life on Earth. The study proved the theoretical and practical feasibility of using environmental approach to solving problems of nature protection through limiting the negative impact of human activities on it.

TI  - Non-negative scattering power decomposition for PolSAR data interpretation
T2  - IET RADAR SONAR AND NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a hybrid technique for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data decomposition. The proposed technique aims to overcome the negative power problem of model-based decomposition methods. To achieve this, matrix rotation theory is used along with hybrid scattering models. The matrix rotation theory is utilised on the basis of underlying dominant scatterer to remove maximal of the cross-polarisation power generated by the coupling between orthogonal states of polarisation. Removing the coupling energy between orthogonal states not only optimised the PolSAR coherency matrix but also transform it more close to reflection symmetry condition. The applicability of the proposed approach is shown through the implementation of hybrid three- and four-component decomposition methods. The proposed hybrid methods are experimentally verified on C-band Radarsat-2 San Francisco and L-band UAVSAR Hayward datasets. For further analysis, different land-cover patches are selected. Moreover, the variations in percentage of negative power pixels are investigated by employing different volume scattering models. Comparative analyses are presented with existing PolSAR decomposition techniques in terms of normalised scattering power means and amount of negative power pixels. All experimental analyses clearly report the superiority of the proposed hybrid approach through improvements over existing PolSAR decomposition techniques along with non-negative scattering powers.

TI  - MOBILE X-POL RADAR A New Tool for Investigating Pyroconvection and Associated Wildfire Meteorology
T2  - BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of pyroconvection occurs when fire-released heat, moisture, and/or aerosols induce or augment convection in the atmosphere. Prediction of pyroconvection presents a set of complex problems for meteorologists and wildfire managers. In particular, the turbulent characteristics of a pyroconvective plume exert bidirectional feedback on fire behavior, often with resulting severe impacts on life and property. Here, we present the motivation, field strategy, and initial results from the Bushfire Convective Plume Experiment, which through the use of mobile radar aims to quantify the kinematics of pyroconvection and its role in fire behavior. The case studies presented include world-first observations from two wildfires and one prescribed burn using the University of Queensland's portable, dual-polarized X-band Doppler radar (UQ-XPOL). The initial analyses of reflectivity, Doppler winds, polarimetric variables, and spectrum width data provide insights into these relatively unexplored datasets within the context of pyroconvection. Weather radar data are supported by mesonet observations, time-lapse photography, airborne multispectral imaging, and spot-fire mapping. The ability to combine ground-validated fire intensity and progression at an hourly scale with quantitative data documenting the evolution of the convective plume kinematics at the scale of hundreds of meters represents a new capability for advancing our understanding of wildfires. The results demonstrate the suitability of portable, dual-polarized X-band Doppler radar to investigate pyroconvection and associated plume dynamics.

TI  - Assessing components of the model-based mean square error estimator for remote sensing assisted forest applications
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Model-based inference is an alternative to probability-based inference for small areas or remote areas for which probability sampling is difficult. Model-based mean square error estimators incorporate three components: prediction covariance, residual variance, and residual covariance. The latter two components are often considered negligible, particularly for large areas, but no thresholds that justify ignoring them have been reported. The objectives of the study were threefold: (i) to compare analytical and bootstrap estimators of model parameter covariances as the primary factors affecting prediction covariance; (ii) to estimate the contribution of residual variance to overall variance; and (iii) to estimate thresholds for residual spatial correlation that justify ignoring this component. Five datasets were used, three from Europe, one from Africa, and one from North America. The dependent variable was either forest volume or biomass and the independent variables were either Landsat satellite image bands or airborne laser scanning metrics. Three conclusions were noteworthy: (i) analytical estimators of the model parameter covariances tended to be biased; (ii) the effects of residual variance were mostly negligible; and (iii) the effects of spatial correlation on residual covariance vary by multiple factors but decrease with increasing study area size. For study areas greater than 75 km(2) in size, residual covariance could generally be ignored.

TI  - Spatial variability of zooplankton community structure in Colombian Caribbean waters during two seasons
T2  - REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Zooplankton is an important component to understand oceanographic dynamics, they are considered good indicators of environmental variability, since most species are short-lived they can be tight coupling of climate and population dynamics, and some taxa are sensitive to variables such as temperature, quality and quantity of food, oxygenation and stratification. In the Colombian Caribbean two oceanographic cruises were carried out, in order to characterize and analyze the biodiversity of the continental margin, for the periods May-June 2008 and November-December 2009. The objective of this study was to determine which oceanographic variable was the most important in the distribution of zooplankton in the oceanic waters, and how the variables structure the community. In each cruise, zooplankton samples were obtained by vertical hauls with a 1 m 2 diameter conical net (200 tun mesh size). The zooplankton community structure was studied by automated image analysis (Zoolmage), which combined with abundance data, allowed to calculate the slope of size spectrum, and diversity indexes of taxa and sizes. The environmental variables included temperature, salinity, oxygen and chlorophyll a of the water column, and were used to calculate the stratification with the Brunt-Vaiisala frequency; this information was complemented by satellite images of temperature, surface chlorophyll, geostrophic currents and sea level, obtained from MODIS and AQUA products. The association between environmental variables and the zooplankton community structure was determined using Spearman's correlation ranges with the Bioenv routine and a stepwise regression model, and Principal component analysis (PCA). Our results showed spatial and temporal patterns in the oceanographic conditions of the study area, such as upwelling in the Northeast region, strong stratification in the Southwest, and mesoscale activity. The abundance of zooplankton exhibited differences between the two climatic seasons and zones. Temporal differences were also evident in the size and diversity of taxa (ANOVA 2-way p <0.05). These changes were related to the moderate upwelling and the activity of mesoscale eddies. Cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies of variable size can either transport or retain zooplankton over cross-shelf and oceanic areas, thus modifying the taxonomic structure of the community. According to the Bioenv analysis, the main variables that explained the abundance and composition of zooplankton were sea level and chlorophyll a (Spearman correlation= 0.49). The stepwise regression showed that stratification, oxygen and chlorophyll a were the most important predictors of zooplankton abundance and size.

TI  - Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3): A powerful data mining procedure to retrieve soil spectral reflectance from satellite images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil mapping has been identified as key to environmental issues. The determination of soil attributes to achieve the best decision making on land use planning is crucial. The use of remote sensing (satellite images) can improve understanding of the surface, since it collects a spectral reflectance fingerprint related to soil properties. However, methodologies still gather spatially fragmented information on bare soil in a single image; thus, there is still room to improve information as a continuous surface. This work has the purpose of developing a procedure using multi-temporal satellite image information, aiming to construct a single synthetic image which would represent soils. The work was carried out in the state of Sao Paulo, Brazil, on a site covering 14,614 km(2). The procedure, designated as Geospatial Soil Sensing System (GEOS3), is based on the following steps: a) creation of a database with Landsat 5 legacy data.; b) filtering of the database to provide images only from the dry season in the region; c) insertion of a set of rules into the system to filter other objects besides soils; d) Each bare soil occurrence for each location along the time-series was used to calculate a Temporal Synthetic Spectral Reflectance (TESS) of the soil surface; e) aggregation of all TESS composes the Synthetic Soil Image (SYSI); f) quantitative and qualitative validation of the SYSI through the correlation between laboratory and TESS, soil line assessment and the principal component analysis (PCA). GEOS3 was able to provide the best representative reflectance of soils for each band during the historical period. Thus, TESS is not the 'true' but a synthetic spectral reflectance. The canonical correlation between laboratory and satellite data reached 0.93. A value of up to 0.88 in the Pearson's correlation between laboratory and TESS was also achieved. In a single scene, only 0.5% of area was available as isolated bare soil for spatial analysis. However, SYSI reached 68%. Considering only the sugarcane agricultural areas, a value of 92% was achieved. Our study indicates that a multi-temporal data mining procedure can retrieve soil surface representation. The key to the results was calculating the median spectral reflectance from the bare soil pixels along the period of the time series. GEOS3 products can aid soil evaluation by assisting in digital soil mapping, soil security, precision agriculture, soil attribute quantification, soil conservation, environment monitoring and soil sample allocation, among others.

TI  - Measuring short-term post-fire forest recovery across a burn severity gradient in a mixed pine-oak forest using multi-sensor remote sensing techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding post-fire forest recovery is pivotal to the study of forest dynamics and global carbon cycle. Field based studies indicated a convex response of forest recovery rate to burn severity at the individual tree level, related with fire-induced tree mortality; however, these findings were constrained in spatial/temporal extents, while not detectable by traditional optical remote sensing studies, largely attributing to the contaminated effect from understory recovery. Here, we examined whether the combined use of multi-sensor remote sensing techniques (i.e., 1 m simultaneous airborne imaging spectroscopy and LiDAR and 2 m satellite multi-spectral imagery) to separate canopy recovery from understory recovery would enable to quantify post-fire forest recovery rate spanning a large gradient in burn severity over large-scales. Our study was conducted in a mixed pine-oak forest in Long Island, NY, three years after a top-killing fire. Our studies remotely detected an initial increase and then decline of forest recovery rate to burn severity across the burned area, with a maximum canopy area-based recovery rate of 10% per year at moderate forest burn severity class. More intriguingly, such remotely detected convex relationships also held at species level, with pine trees being more resilient to high burn severity and having a higher maximum recovery rate (12% per year) than oak trees (4% per year). These results are one of the first quantitative evidences showing the effects of fire adaptive strategies on post-fire forest recovery, derived from relatively large spatial-temporal scales. Our study thus provides the methodological advance to link multi sensor remote sensing techniques to monitor forest dynamics in a spatially explicit manner over large-scales, with important implications for fire-related forest management and constraining/benchmarking fire effect schemes in ecological process models.

TI  - Urban greenspace is associated with reduced psychological stress among adolescents: A Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA) analysis of activity space
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the momentary association between urban greenspace, captured using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Landsat imagery, and psychological stress, captured using Geographic Ecological Momentary Assessment (GEMA), in the activity spaces of a sample of primarily African American adolescents residing in Richmond, Virginia. We employ generalized estimating equations (GEE) to estimate the effect of exposure to urban greenspace on stress and test for moderation by sex, emotional dysregulation, season, neighborhood disadvantage, and whether the observation occurs at home or elsewhere. Results indicate that urban greenspace is associated with lower stress when subjects are away from home, which we speculate is due to the properties of stress reduction and attention restoration associated with exposure to natural areas, and to the primacy of other family dynamics mechanisms of stress within the home. Subjects may also seek out urban greenspaces at times of lower stress or explicitly for purposes of stress reduction. The greenspace-stress association away from home did not differ by sex, emotional dysregulation, neighborhood disadvantage, or season, the latter of which suggests that the observed greenspace-stress relationship is associated with being in a natural environment rather than strictly exposure to abundant green vegetation. Given the association of urban greenspace with lower stress found here and in other studies, future research should address the mediated pathways between greenspace, stress, and stress-related negative health outcomes for different population subgroups as a means toward understanding and addressing health disparities.

AB  - Tasks such as the monitoring of natural disasters or the detection of change highly benefit from complementary information about an area or a specific object of interest. The required information is provided by fusing high accurate coregistered and georeferenced datasets. Aligned high-resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data additionally enable an absolute geolocation accuracy improvement of the optical images by extracting accurate and reliable ground control points (GCPs) from the SAR images. In this paper, we investigate the applicability of a deep learning based matching concept for the generation of precise and accurate GCPs from SAR satellite images by matching optical and SAR images. To this end, conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) are trained to generate SAR-like image patches from optical images. For training and testing, optical and SAR image patches are extracted from TerraSAR-X and PRISM image pairs covering greater urban areas spread over Europe. The artificially generated patches are then used to improve the conditions for three known matching approaches based on normalized cross-correlation (NCC), scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT), and binary robust invariant scalable key (BRISK), which are normally not usable for the matching of optical and SAR images. The results validate that a NCC-, SIFT-, and BRISK-based matching greatly benefit, in terms of matching accuracy and precision, from the use of the artificial templates. The comparison with two state-of-the-art optical and SAR matching approaches shows the potential of the proposed method but also revealed some challenges and the necessity for further developments.

TI  - The Extent and Correlates of Public Support for Deterrence Reforms and Hot Spots Policing
T2  - LAW & SOCIETY REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - As one approach to prison downsizing and criminal justice reform, scholars recommend altering the nature of policing by reallocating resources toward policing and increasing sentinel patrols and hot spots interventions. Public attitudes toward these reforms are unknown. In the current police crisis, shifting policies in ways disfavored by the public can impact police-community relations, especially among those disproportionately affected. The current study uses survey data from a nationally representative sample of Americans to evaluate whether the public is receptive to the suggested reforms. Our results indicate that the majority of the general public believes policing is more cost-effective than incarceration and supports a focus on sentinel patrols and crime hot spots, although there is less support for hot spots policing among blacks, Hispanics, and lower income individuals. The hot spots policing strategy most preferred is situational prevention, and the least supported is aggressive order-maintenance policing.

TI  - Soil Moisture Monitoring in a Temperate Peatland Using Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing and Linear Mixed Effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this research was to use empirical models to monitor temporal dynamics of soil moisture in a peatland using remotely sensed imagery, and to determine the predictive accuracy of the approach on dates outside the time series through statistically independent validation. A time series of seven Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were collected along with concurrent field measurements of soil moisture over one growing season, and soil moisture retrieval was tested using Linear Mixed Effects models (LMEs). A single-date airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey was incorporated into the analysis, along with temporally varying environmental covariates (Drought Code, Time Since Last Rain, Day of Year). LMEs allowed repeated measures to be accounted for at individual sampling sites, as well as soil moisture differences associated with peatland classes. Covariates provided a large amount of explanatory power in models; however, SAR imagery contributed to only a moderate improvement in soil moisture predictions (marginal R-2 = 0.07; conditional R-2 = 0.7, independently validated R-2 = 0.36). The use of LMEs allows for a more accurate characterization of soil moisture as a function of specific measurement sites, peatland classes and measurement dates on model strength and predictive power. For intensively monitored peatlands, SAR data is best analyzed in conjunction with peatland Class (e.g., derived from an ecosystem classification map) to estimate the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture, provided there is a ground-based monitoring network with a sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to fit the LME models.

TI  - Environmental samples make soiled bedding sentinels dispensable for hygienic monitoring of IVC-reared mouse colonies
T2  - LABORATORY ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate knowledge of the health status of experimental animals is pivotal to high scientific and ethical standards in biomedical research. Individually ventilated cages (IVCs) are becoming the predominant system for housing laboratory mice, as they prevent cage-to-cage infections. However, this feature constitutes a major drawback for hygienic monitoring of mouse colonies, as traditional screening programs build on reliable transmission of infectious agents from experimental animals to sentinel mice commonly tested as representatives for the mouse colonies. In recent years, the laboratory animal community has realized that sentinels are ineffectual for screening mouse colonies in IVC systems because infections are often not transmitted to sentinels and therefore remain undetected. Furthermore, sentinel monitoring results in high numbers of used animals. In contrast, environmental monitoring provides a more reliable approach to identify and exclude pathogens in rodent colonies. In recent studies we provided evidence that polymerase chain reaction analysis of exhaust air particles is superior to soiled bedding sentinels for different agents. In this study, we show that testing pooled environmental samples generates more meaningful information compared to soiled bedding sentinels during routine hygienic monitoring in different barriers.

Typically, an L-band microwave radiometer has spatial resolution on the order of 36-40 km, which is too coarse for many specific hydro-meteorological and agricultural applications. With the failure of the SMAP active radar within three months of becoming operational, an intermediate (9-km) and finer (3-km) scale soil moisture product solely from the SMAP mission is no longer possible. Therefore, the focus of this study is a disaggregation of the 36-km resolution SMAP passive-only surface soil moisture (SSM) using the Soil Evaporative Efficiency (SEE) approach to spatial scales of 3-km and 9-km. The SEE was computed using thermal-infrared (TIR) estimation of surface evaporation over Continental U.S. (CONUS). The disaggregation results were compared with the 3 months of SMAP-Active (SMAP-A) and Active/Passive (AP) products, while comparisons with SMAP-Enhanced (SMAP-E), SMAP-Passive (SMAP-P), as well as with more than 180 Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) stations across CONUS were performed for a 19 month period. At the 9-km spatial scale, the TIR-Downscaled data correlated strongly with the SMAP-E SSM both spatially (r = 0.90) and temporally (r = 0.87). In comparison with SCAN observations, overall correlations of 0.49 and 0.47; bias of -0.022 and -0.019 and unbiased RMSD of 0.105 and 0.100 were found for SMAP-E and TIR-Downscaled SSM across the Continental U.S., respectively. At 3-km scale, TIR-Downscaled and SMAP-A had a mean temporal correlation of only 0.27. In terms of gain statistics, the highest percentage of SCAN sites with positive gains (> 55%) was observed with the TIRD-ownscaled SSM at 9-km. Overall, the TIR-based downscaled SSM showed strong correspondence with SMAP-E; compared to SCAN, and overall both SMAP-E and TIR-Downscaled performed similarly, however, gain statistics show that TIR-Downscaled SSM slightly outperformed SMAP-E.

TI  - The Use of Surgery and Radiotherapy as Treatment of Regional Nodes in Breast Cancer Patients
T2  - ONCOLOGY-NEW YORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Ipsilateral regional nodal status is an important independent prognostic factor for patients with breast cancer. Several decisions regarding local therapy are necessary for patients found to have pathologically involved lymph node(s). This article reviews the role of completion dissection and/or radiation therapy in patients found to have positive sentinel lymph node(s), taking into consideration use of mastectomy vs lumpectomy, tumor characteristics, tumor biology, plans for systemic therapy, and patient preferences. Published literature and current guidelines are reviewed, with emphasis on controversial topics such as regional nodal and postmastectomy radiation therapy for patients with one to three positive nodes. Choice of field design in patients undergoing radiation therapy will also be highlighted. Unique clinical situations such as locoregional treatment in patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the emerging role of tumor biology and molecular assays in local therapy decision making will also be discussed.

T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY

AB  - Accurately estimating regional water and vegetation carbon fixation and understanding their covariation mechanisms will benefit regional water resources and ecosystem management. The process-based vegetation interface processes model was employed to simulate the spatiotemporal variations of evapotranspiration (ET) and vegetation gross primary production (GPP) over the land mass of China, by integrating the 8-day Terra-MODIS leaf area index dataset from 2000 to 2013. It is found that there are remarkable spatial variations in annual ET and GPP across the country, top values being around 1,200mm for ET and 3,000gCm(-2) for GPP mostly occurred in the southern rainforests. Average annual ET and GPP are weakly increasing, in which about one third is significant. At annual scale, variability of ET follows precipitation variations, whereas variability of GPP follows variations of both precipitation and leaf area index. At monthly scale, variations of ET and GPP are more correlated with net radiation than precipitation. It is revealed that the climatic factors dominating water and carbon fluxes are different over the typical climate zones. The increasing GPP and water use efficiency are benefitting the regional vegetation recovery and carbon fixation, however, more water consumption may exaggerate the ecosystem vulnerability in water-limited zones.

TI  - Assessing biomass of diverse coastal marsh ecosystems using statistical and machine learning models
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance and vulnerability of coastal marshes necessitate effective ways to closely monitor them. Optical remote sensing is a powerful tool for this task, yet its application to diverse coastal marsh ecosystems consisting of different marsh types is limited. This study samples spectral and biophysical data from freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes in Louisiana, and develops statistical and machine learning models to assess the marshes' biomass with combined ground, airborne, and spaceborne remote sensing data. It is found that linear models derived from NDVI and EVI are most favorable for assessing Leaf Area Index (LAI) using multispectral data (R-2 = 0.7 and 0.67, respectively), and the random forest models are most useful in retrieving LAI and Aboveground Green Biomass (AGB) using hyperspectral data (R-2 = 0.91 and 0.84, respectively). It is also found that marsh type and plant species significantly impact the linear model development (P < .05 in both cases). Sensors with coarser spatial resolution yield lower LAI values because the fine water networks are not detected and mixed into the vegetation pixels. The Landsat OLI-derived map shows the LAI of coastal mashes in Louisiana mostly ranges from 0 to 5.0, and is highest for freshwater marshes and for marshes in the Atchafalaya Bay delta. The CASI-derived maps show that LAI of saline marshes at Bay Batiste typically ranges from 0.9 to 1.5, and the AGB is mostly less than 900 g/m(2). This study provides solutions for assessing the biomass of Louisiana's coastal marshes using various optical remote sensing techniques, and highlights the impacts of the marshes' species composition on the model development and the sensors' spatial resolution on biomass mapping, thereby providing useful tools for monitoring the biomass of coastal marshes in Louisiana and diverse coastal marsh ecosystems elsewhere.

TI  - Assessment and Mapping of Environmentally Sensitive Areas To Desertification Using Gis in An Area of The North Delta Region of Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - THIS STUDY aims to delineate areas in the northern Nile Delta of Egypt that are sensitive to desertification using integrated remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS).Desertification is one of the fundamental problems associated with land degradation in arid and semi-arid regions. Desertification results from several factors, including climate change, chemical and physical degradation and human activities.Thematic indicators of soil, climate, vegetation, and management practices represent essential data and are required to approximately define the environmentally sensitive areas (ESAs). These layers are extracted and manipulated from topographic maps, geologic maps, land use intensity data, policy enforcement data, satellite images collected by the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor in 2015, and data obtained during field surveys. The functions of the Spatial Analyst Toolbox in the Arc GIS 10.1 software package are used to collect the thematic layers and identify the ESAs.The results obtained in this study reveal that the sensitive areas to desertification were located in the northern parts of the study area. These vulnerable areas are located around Lake Burullus and represent 19% of the study area. Also, the results indicate that the central part of the study area exhibits fragile areas that are sensitive to desertification and represent 24% of the total area. The southern parts of the study area are characterized by critical sensitivity and represent 57% of the total area. The impact factors that affect the sensitivity to desertification are soil salinity, water logging and management indicators in the study area.

TI  - The effect of daily fortified yogurt consumption on weight loss in adults with metabolic syndrome: A 10-week randomized controlled trial
T2  - NUTRITION METABOLISM AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Aims: Obesity is a complex and multifaceted condition. Thus, functional foods need investigation as novel adjunct treatments for obesity. The objective was to determine the effects of daily consumption of a fortified yogurt (FY) on weight loss in over-weight and obese patients with metabolic syndrome on a caloric-restricted diet.Methods and Results: This was a randomized, double-blind, 10-week study. Participants were randomly allocated to two groups receiving either two servings (2 x 250 g)/day of FY with whey protein, calcium, vitamin D, prebiotic fibre and probiotic cultures (n = 44) or a low-fat plain yogurt (PY) (n = 43). All participants were put on a calorie-restricted diet throughout the 10-week study. Body composition and biochemical indices were assessed before and after the intervention. Body mass decreased by 4.3 +/- 1.9 kg and 5.1 +/- 3.0 kg in the PY and FY groups, respectively, following the 10-week intervention. Compared to PY, consumption of FY resulted in a significant reduction in body fat mass (FM) (p = 0.023), body fat percentage (p = 0.028), waist circumference (p = 0.002), homoeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (p = 0.025), triglyceride concentration (p = 0.003), and a significant increase in total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration (p < 0.001), high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) (p = 0.009) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (0.022). Participants consuming the FY lost less fat-free mass (FFM) compared to the PY group (Delta = -0.9 +/- 3.5 kg vs. Delta = -2.0 +/- 2.7 kg; p = 0.025).Conclusions: Consuming FY for 10-weeks improved body composition and metabolic parameters, while on a caloric-restricted diet. Further research is needed to elucidate whether FY can be used as a preventative strategy for metabolic syndrome in obese persons.

M3  - Article
AB  - The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in its publication No. 56 of the Irrigation and Drainage Series presents the FAO Penman-Monteith procedure for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration from meteorological data, however, its calculation may be complicated in areas where there are no weather stations. This paper presents an evaluation of the potential of the Land Surface Temperature and Digital Elevation Models products derived from the MODIS and ASTER sensors, both on board the Terra EOS AM-1 satellite, for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration using the Penman-Monteith FAO-56, Hargreaves, Thornthwaite and Blaney-Criddle models. The four models were compared with the method proposed by FAO calculated with the observed data of a ground based meteorological station, finding a significant relation with the models Penman-Monteith FAO-56 and Hargreaves.

TI  - Is Low-Volume Disease in the Sentinel Node After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy an Indication for Axillary Dissection?
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 71st Annual Cancer Symposium of the Society-of-Surgical-Oncology (SSO)
CL  - Chicago, IL
AB  - Intraoperative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has a higher false-negative rate than in the primary surgical setting, particularly for small tumor deposits. Additional tumor burden seen with isolated tumor cells (ITCs) and micrometastases following primary surgery is low; however, it is unknown whether the same is true after NAC. We examined the false-negative rate of intraoperative frozen section (FS) after NAC, and the association between SLN metastasis size and residual disease at axillary lymph node dissection (ALND).Patients undergoing SLN biopsy after NAC were identified. The association between SLN metastasis size and residual axillary disease was examined.From July 2008 to July 2017, 702 patients (711 cancers) had SLN biopsy after NAC. On FS, 181 had metastases, 530 were negative; 33 negative cases were positive on final pathology (false-negative rate 6.2%). Among patients with a positive FS, 3 (2%) had ITCs and no further disease on ALND; 41 (23%) had micrometastases and 125 (69%) had macrometastases. Fifty-nine percent of patients with micrometastases and 63% with macrometastases had one or more additional positive nodes at ALND. Among those with a false-negative result, 10 (30%) had ITCs, 15 (46%) had micrometastases, and 8 (24%) had macrometastases; 17 had ALND and 59% had one or more additional positive lymph nodes. Overall, 1/6 (17%) patients with ITCs and 28/44 (64%) patients with micrometastases had additional nodal metastases at ALND.Low-volume SLN disease after NAC is not an indicator of a low risk of additional positive axillary nodes and remains an indication for ALND, even when not detected on intraoperative FS.

TI  - Liminality, hybridity and 'Third Space:' Bessie Head's <i>A question of power</i>
T2  - NEOHELICON
M3  - Article
AB  - Hybridity has been a controversial issue not only in eugenic hypotheses of the nineteenth century but also in the postcolonial, cultural, linguistic, and geographical contexts. It can be seen as a 'Janus-faced' entity. Theorists like Bhabha consider it as a 'Third Space' which is fraught with ambiguities, while some use the term 'liminal' to point to its location in history, culture, and society in general. This essay deals with a 'coloured' writer's coloured character in the light of hybridity. Elizabeth, the coloured protagonist of Bessie Head's A question of power lives as a hybrid in a state of liminality, and tries to dismiss the worldview of colonialism and the postcolonial nationalism of South Africa and reconstruct her shattered identity in the 'Third Space' of Motabeng. Elizabeth's hybridity and her iconoclastic condition are intensified by rampant liminal elements in the novel. The essay follows the intricate interrelationships of hybrid elements in terms of Elizabeth's multi-faceted character, her garden, and the borders she crosses in the course of the novel. Hybridity here is by no means a mere inter-racial issue, the attempt here is to relate this concept to the anti-conventional and iconoclastic; the things that are liminal and indefinable within established epistemology.

TI  - Agroecological Pest Management in the City: Experiences from California and Chiapas
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban gardens are a prominent part of agricultural systems, providing food security and access within cities; however, we still lack sufficient knowledge and general principles about how to manage pests in urban agroecosystems in distinct regions. We surveyed natural enemies (ladybeetles and parasitoids) and conducted sentinel pest removal experiments to explore local management factors and landscape characteristics that influence the provisioning of pest control services in California, USA, and Chiapas, Mexico. We worked in 29 gardens across the two locations. In each location, we collected data on garden vegetation, floral availability, ground cover management, and the percentage of natural, urban, and agricultural land cover in the surrounding landscape. We sampled ladybeetles, Chalcidoidea, and Ichneumonoidea parasitoids with sticky traps, and monitored the removal of three different pest species. Ladybeetle abundance did not differ between locations; abundance decreased with garden size and with tree cover and increased with herbaceous richness, floral abundance, and barren land cover. Chalcicoidea and Ichneumonoidea parasitoids were more abundant in Chiapas. Chalcicoidea abundance decreased with herbaceous richness and with urban cover. Ichneumonoidea abundance increased with mulch and bare ground cover, garden size, garden age, and with agriculture land cover but decreased with tree richness and urban cover. Predators removed between 15-100% of sentinel prey within 24 h but prey removal was greater in California. Generally, prey removal increased with vegetation diversity, floral abundance, mulch cover, and urban land cover, but declined with vegetation cover and bare ground. Although some factors had consistent effects on natural enemies and pest control in the two locations, many did not; thus, we still need more comparative work to further develop our understanding of general principles governing conservation biological control in urban settings.

AB  - Recent publication of the results of clinical trials in which lymph node dissection was not associated with any survival benefit in patients with sentinel node metastasis makes it necessary to reconsider the treatment of patients with melanoma. This article provides an update on the available evidence on the diverse factors (routes of metastatic spread, predictors, adjuvant therapy, etc.) that must be considered when treating patients with sentinel node-positive melanoma. The authors propose a decision-making algorithm for use in this clinical setting. The current evidence no longer supports lymph node dissection in patients with Low-risk sentinel node metastasis (sentinel node tumor load <= 1 mm). (C) 2018 AEDV.

T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Escape from the natural enemy community by invasive species in their introduced range is a key determinant to their success. Historically in North America, there have been only low levels of predation and parasitism for Halyomorpha halys (Stal), the brown marmorated stink bug. In our study, we sought to determine whether prey-, predator-, or plant-associated stimuli increase mortality of H. halys egg masses, and whether the exotic parasitoid Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead) is present in West Virginia or New Jersey. We deployed sentinel egg masses over two years in a variety of studies. We found that the H. halys aggregation pheromone was not used as a kairomone by natural enemies, the presence of methyl salicylate and varying host species stimuli did not impact egg mortality, and other predator attractants did not increase predation damage to egg masses. However, we documented Trissolcus japonicus for the first time in Jefferson Co., West Virginia, USA. Ultimately, our study suggests that other related stimuli and potential landscape factors should be investigated for increasing the impact of the natural community on H. halys.

TI  - Influence of recent warming and ice dynamics on glacier surface elevations in the Canadian High Arctic, 1995-2014
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Repeat airborne laser altimetry measurements show widespread thinning (surface lowering) of glaciers in Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands since 1995. Thinning rates averaged for 50 m elevation bins, were more than three times higher during the period 2005/06 to 2012/14 pentad than during the previous two pentads. Strongly negative thickness change (dh/dt) anomalies from 2005/06 to 2012/14, relative to the 1995-2012/14 mean, suggest that most of the measured thinning occurred during the most recent 5-6 year period when mean summer land surface temperatures (LSTs) were anomalously high and the mean summer black-sky shortwave broadband albedos (BSA) were anomalously low, relative to the 2000/01-15/16 period, and upper-air (700 hPa) and near surface (2 m) air temperatures were between 0.8(degrees)C and 1.5(degrees)C higher than 1995-2012 mean. Comparisons of ddhdAt with mean summer LST and BSA measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and with surface longitudinal strain rates computed from surface velocity fields derived from RADARSAT 1/2 and Landat-7 ETM + data suggest that surface elevation changes were driven mainly by changes in climate. An exception to this occurs along many fast-flowing outlet glaciers where ice dynamics appear also to have played an important role in surface elevation changes.

TI  - Estimating and mapping forest biomass using regression models and Spot-6 images (case study: Hyrcanian forests of north of Iran)
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyrcanian forests of North of Iran are of great importance in terms of various economic and environmental aspects. In this study, Spot-6 satellite images and regression models were applied to estimate above-ground biomass in these forests. This research was carried out in six compartments in three climatic (semi-arid to humid) types and two altitude classes. In the first step, ground sampling methods at the compartment level were used to estimate aboveground biomass (Mg/ha). Then, by reviewing the results of other studies, the most appropriate vegetation indices were selected. In this study, three indices of NDVI, RVI, and TVI were calculated. We investigated the relationship between the vegetation indices and aboveground biomass measured at sample-plot level. Based on the results, the relationship between aboveground biomass values and vegetation indices was a linear regression with the highest level of significance for NDVI in all compartments. Since at the compartment level the correlation coefficient between NDVI and aboveground biomass was the highest, NDVI was used for mapping aboveground biomass. According to the results of this study, biomass values were highly different in various climatic and altitudinal classes with the highest biomass value observed in humid climate and high-altitude class.

TI  - Spatiotemporal analysis of the effect of climate change on vegetation health in the Drakensberg Mountain Region of South Africa
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of climate change on mountain ecosystems has been in the spotlight for the past three decades. Climate change is generally considered to be a threat to ecosystem health in mountain regions. Vegetation indices can be used to detect shifts in ecosystem phenology and climate change in mountain regions while satellite imagery can play an important role in this process. However, what has remained problematic is determining the extent to which ecosystem phenology is affected by climate change under increasingly warming conditions. In this paper, we use climate and vegetation indices that were derived from satellite data to investigate the link between ecosystem phenology and climate change in the Namahadi Catchment Area of the Drakensberg Mountain Region of South Africa. The time series for climate indices as well as those for gridded precipitation and temperature data were analyzed in order to determine climate shifts, and concomitant changes in vegetation health were assessed in the resultant epochs using vegetation indices. The results indicate that vegetation indices should only be used to assess trends in climate change under relatively pristine conditions, where human influence is limited. This knowledge is important for designing climate change monitoring strategies that are based on ecosystem phenology and vegetation health.

TI  - Polarimetry-Based Distributed Scatterer Processing Method for PSI Applications
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Permanent scatterer interferometry is a multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar technique that produces high-accuracy ground deformation measurement. A high density of permanent scatterer (PS) is required to provide accurate results. In natural environments with low PS density, distributed scatterers (DSs) could serve as additional coherent observations. This paper introduces a polarimetric scattering property-based adaptive filtering method that preserves PS candidates and filters DS candidates. To further increase the coherence estimate of DS candidates, the technique includes a complex coherence decomposition that adaptively selects the most stable scattering mechanisms, thus improving pixel coherence estimation. The proposed method was evaluated on 11 quad-polarized ALOS PALSAR images and 21 dual-polarized Sentinel-1 images acquired over San Fernando Valley, CA, USA, and Groningen, The Netherlands, respectively. The application of this method increased the number of coherent pixels by almost a factor of eight compared with a single-polarization channel. This paper concludes that a coherence estimate can be significantly improved by applying scattering property-based adaptive filtering and coherence matrix decomposition and accurate displacement measurements can be achieved.

TI  - Anime Landscapes as a Tool for Analyzing the Human-Environment Relationship: Hayao Miyazaki Films
T2  - ARTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Common dualistic thinking in environmental design education adopts humans and the environment as separate entities, with the environment as raw material stock. This approach affects the intellectual development of landscape architects and limits their ability to create meaningful landscapes. Therefore, it is necessary to explore and highlight new ideas about the more integrated human-environment relationship. Through the films of Hayao Miyazaki, many audiences around the world have encountered a different worldview. By contrast with Western thinking, which adopts human superiority to nature, the worldview that Miyazaki reflects in his films depicts human as an inseparable part of nature. Being inspired by different communities and their relationship to nature in Miyazaki's films, we propose using anime as a means of analyzing the human-environment relationship. We classified landscapes based on power relations between humans and nature. We explored how communities shape their physical environment based on how they socially construct nature and the resulting landscapes. Thus, through apocalyptic landscapes, the bitter results of exploiting nature were depicted. Wilderness landscapes reflect the bias humanity has about nature as wild and hostile. Responsible landscapes were introduced asway of understanding the unbreakable bond between humans and the environment. Through these animated landscape types, the ways landscape architecture should approach nature in professional practices was discussed, and the importance of creating responsible landscapes was emphasized.

TI  - The large-scale drivers of population declines in a long-distance migratory shorebird
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Migratory species can travel tens of thousands of kilometers each year, spending different parts of their annual cycle in geographically distinct locations. Understanding the drivers of population change is vital for conserving migratory species, yet the challenge of collecting data over entire geographic ranges has hindered attempts to identify the processes leading to observed population changes. Here, we use remotely sensed environmental data and bird count data to investigate the factors driving variability in abundance in two subspecies of a long-distance migratory shorebird, the bar-tailed godwit Limosa lapponica. We compiled a spatially and temporally explicit dataset of three environmental variables to identify the conditions experienced by each subspecies in each stage of their annual cycle (breeding, non-breeding and staging). We used a Bayesian N-mixture model to analyze 18 years of monthly count data from 21 sites across Australia and New Zealand in relation to the remote sensing data. We found that the abundance of one subspecies L.l. menzbieri in their non-breeding range was related to climate conditions in breeding grounds, and detected sustained population declines between 1995 and 2012 in both subspecies (L.l. menzbieri, -6.7% and L.l. baueri, -2.1% year(-1)). To investigate the possible causes of the declines, we quantified changes in habitat extent at 22 migratory staging sites in the Yellow Sea, East Asia, over a 25-year period and found -1.7% and -1.2% year(-1) loss of habitat at staging sites used by L.l. menzbieri and L.l. baueri, respectively. Our results highlight the need to identify environmental and anthropogenic drivers of population change across all stages of migration to allow the formulation of effective conservation strategies across entire migratory ranges.

TI  - New Paradigms for Commercial Benefits from India's Earth Observation Activities
T2  - NEW SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - India's public funded earth observation (EO) program over the decades had evolved into a multidimensional program aiming to fulfill widely diverse application objectives. Remote Sensing Data Policy was first adopted by the Government of India in the year 2000 and subsequently revised in 2011. These policies placed strong emphasis on government funding of space infrastructure and also several downstream development activities relating to applications. In recent decade, however, commercial EO systems made rapid strides in providing access to high-quality data as well as information to users all over the globe. Through active role of private sector, several New Space initiatives have also been undertaken in different parts of the globe. In view of some unique opportunities arising in the Indian market due to the transforming economic, demographic, and social structure, the opportunities and challenges for commercial space had been studied. In the context of growing middle-income markets, the Indian private sector had also been showing increasing interest to invest into global initiatives and also explore new segments of value chain in the Indian market. This has already begun to happen in the field of satellite communications and it would also extend into other areas such as EOs and applications, which are now driven by national initiatives such as Digital India announced by the Indian Prime Minister recently and a nationalgeographic information system (GIS). The major drivers that would create burgeoning demands for space-based products and services are the decision support needs arising from diverse requirements of large-scale infrastructure developments and trends such as urban shift of the population, land use change, huge needs ofinformation and communication technologies (ICT)-based services addressing the demands of education, health, mobility, and environment sectors, robust demands for disaster warning and mitigation, national security, and natural resources management. An attempt has been made to analyze different policy paradigms. The article will also discuss the perspectives of private industry in India on policy issues and the perceptions of market opportunities in such a rapidly transforming environment and presents a portfolio of models to derive greater economic benefits. Since government policies had invariably played a major role in triggering investment and participation by private sector in this field, an avant-garde policy and regulatory changes to attract greater private sector participation are presented in conclusion.

M3  - Article
AB  - In their article "Innovations in Self-Consciousness. Towards Oneness with the World" Soonok Myong and Byong-soon Chun examine the limitations and vulnerabilities of modern civilization. Asia is a multiethnic, multilingual and multicultural territory of over 40 countries and more than 4.4 billion people, that is, almost half of the population of the world. The One Asia community seeks to question a world made up of strong egos that make up businesses, organization and nations, and embrace communal goals, helping Asia and the world to become 'one community.' Thus, the paper suggests ways of self-innovation through forms of transitional consciousness. Although the modern Sapiens is a highly social being, the human tendency to exclusive superiority over all other creatures falls into self-destructive contradictions as civilization evolves. The research seeks to show how the nature of altruistic cooperation and the empathic abilities inherent to humans can be re-activated by expanding our worldview to larger frame. Only then can humankind be called 'sapiens' in the true sense of the word.

TI  - Observation of surface and atmospheric parameters using "NOAA 18" satellite: a study on earthquakes of Sumatra and Nicobar Is regions for the year 2014 (<i>M</i> ≥ 6.0)
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysing pre-earthquake signals using satellite technology are getting importance among the scientific community, since round-the-clock survey for the wider region is possible compared to ground-based monitoring techniques. Several scientists are involved in various satellites and ground-based technologies to decode the complex physical mechanism of the earthquake process since 1980. They involved in measuring anomalous variations using space-based methodologies like EM signals, SAR interferometry, GPS for ionospheric sounding, satellite gravimetry, atmospheric sounding, Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR), radon gas and seismo-tectonic clouds. In this paper, the authors have considered surface latent heat flux (SLHF) and OLR satellite data for detailed analysis of earthquakes took place during the year 2014 in Sumatra and Nicobar Is regions. At the surface and atmospheric interface, the anomalous variations in SLHF were observed prior to the occurrence of the earthquake. Similarly, anomalous variations in OLR have been observed 3-30 days prior to the big earthquakes and it is measured above the cloud level. From the analysis, the author has found that variations in the SLHF and OLR flux can be utilized as efficient tools to identify the impending big earthquakes. SLHF and OLR variation level can give us a clue about the probable magnitude of earthquakes and also about earthquake preparation zones. Hence, by correlating the above-mentioned parameters, it is potential to key out the impending earthquakes with reasonable accuracy.

TI  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and the emerging role of sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - GIORNALE ITALIANO DI DERMATOLOGIA E VENEREOLOGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin cancer and is usually associated with a favorable prognosis in most patients. However, a small minority of patients will be diagnosed with a high-risk cSCC (HRcSCC) and a proportion will have a poor outcome, in some cases causing death. HRcSCC is characterized by an increase in aggressiveness manifested as local recurrence, the development of lymph node metastases, and occasionally death. The utility of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in this group of patients is unclear without high-level evidence or clear-cut recommendations. If clinicians accept as a cut-off threshold of a >10% of risk of harboring occult nodal metastasis, then selected HRcSCC patients may benefit from SLNB and/or additional investigations. Herein, we performed a review of the current evidence regarding SLNB in HRcSCC. We believe that SLNB may be considered in selected HRcSCC patients to potentially better predict prognosis and influence management. However larger prospective studies are needed to better define the subset of patients that may benefit from SLNB and if early detection of occult nodal metastases is associated with an improved outcome.

TI  - The Futility of Systematic Lymphadenectomy in Early-Stage Low-grade Endometrial Cancer
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lymphadenectomy is considered an integral part of comprehensive surgical staging of endometrial cancer but debate on the value of lymphadenectomy continues in early-stage endometrial cancer. The aim of our study was to determine the number of node positive patients in clinically early-stage low-grade (G1-G2) endometrioid endometrial cancer. We retro-prospectively analyzed the medical records of 155 women with endometrial pathology coming to the BLK cancer center between January 2015 and December 2017 and studied 60 patients of FIGO grade 1-2 endometrioid endometrial cancer confined to the uterus to determine the nodal positivity. Out of total 60 cases, 2 (3.3%) patients had positive nodes indicating the very low incidence of nodal positivity in clinically uterus confined low-grade endometrioid tumors. Both pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes were positive in 1 patient. Skip metastases with para-aortic nodal positivity only while pelvic lymph nodes being negative were found in 1 (1.6%) patient. The necessity of comprehensive lymphadenectomy in endometrial cancer remains controversial. Sentinel node mapping can be a reasonably good alternative to strike a balance between systematic lymphadenectomy and no dissection at all in low and intermediate risk endometrial cancer.

TI  - Smallholder crop area mapped with wall-to-wall WorldView sub-meter panchromatic image texture: A test case for Tigray, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global food production in the developing world occurs within sub-hectare fields that are difficult to identify with moderate resolution satellite imagery. Knowledge about the distribution of these fields is critical in food security programs. We developed a semi-automated image segmentation approach using wall-to-wall sub-meter imagery with high-performance computing to map crop area (CA) throughout Tigray, Ethiopia that encompasses over 41,000 km(2). Multiple processing streams were tested to minimize mapping error while applying five unique smoothing kernels to capture differences in land surface texture associated to CA. Typically, very-small fields (mean < 2 ha) have a smooth image roughness compared to natural scrub/shrub woody vegetation at the similar to 1 m scale and these features can be segmented in panchromatic imagery with multi-level histogram thresholding. Multi-temporal very-high resolution (VHR) panchromatic imagery with multi-spectral VHR are sufficient in extracting critical CA information needed in food security programs. A 2011 to 2015 CA map was produced, using over 3000 WorldView-1 panchromatic images wall-to-wall in 1/2 degrees mosaics for Tigray, Ethiopia. CA was evaluated with nearly 3000 WorldView-2 2 m multispectral 250 x 250 m image subsets by seven expert interpretations, and with in-situ global positioning system photography. CA estimates ranged from 32 to 41% in sub regions of Tigray with median maximum per bin commission and omission errors of 11% and 1% respectively, with most of the error occurring in bins < 15%. This empirical, simple, and low direct cost approach via U.S. government license agreement to access commercial VHR data, could be a viable big-data high-performance computing methodology to extract wall-to-wall CA for other regions of the world that have very-small agriculture fields with similar image texture.

TI  - InSAR Reveals Land Deformation at Guangzhou and Foshan, China between 2011 and 2017 with COSMO-SkyMed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Subsidence from groundwater extraction and underground tunnel excavation has been known for more than a decade in Guangzhou and Foshan, but past studies have only monitored the subsidence patterns as far as 2011 using InSAR. In this study, the deformation occurring during the most recent time-period between 2011 and 2017 has been measured using COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) to understand if changes in temporal and spatial patterns of subsidence rates occurred. Using InSAR time-series analysis (TS-InSAR), we found that significant surface displacement rates occurred in the study area varying from -35 mm/year (subsidence) to 10 mm/year (uplift). The 2011-2017 TS-InSAR results were compared to two separate TS-InSAR analyses (2011-2013, and 2013-2017). Our CSK TS-InSAR results are in broad agreement with previous ENVISAT results and levelling data, strengthening our conclusion that localised subsidence phenomena occurs at different locations in Guangzhou and Foshan. A comparison between temporal and spatial patterns of deformations from our TS-InSAR measurements and different land use types in Guangzhou shows that there is no clear relationship between them. Many local scale deformation zones have been identified related to different phenomena. The majority of deformations is related to excessive groundwater extraction for agricultural and industrial purposes but subsidence in areas of subway construction also occurred. Furthermore, a detailed analysis on the sinkhole collapse in early 2018 has been conducted, suggesting that surface loading may be a controlling factor of the subsidence, especially along the road and highway. Roads and highways with similar subsidence phenomenon are identified. Continuous monitoring of the deforming areas identified by our analysis is important to measure the magnitude and spatial pattern of the evolving deformations in order to minimise the risk and hazards of land subsidence.

TI  - A Hybrid CNN plus Random Forest Approach to Delineate Debris Covered Glaciers Using Deep Features
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of this study is to propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework approach for accurate mapping of debris covered glaciers. The framework comprises of integration of several CNNs architecture, in which different combinations of Landsat 8 multispectral bands (including thermal band), topographic and texture parameters are passed as input for feature extraction. The output of an ensemble of these CNNs is hybrid with random forest model for classification. The major pillars of the framework include: (1) technique for implementing topographic and atmospheric corrections (preprocessing), (2) the proposed hybrid of ensemble of CNNs and random forest classifier, and (3) procedures to determine whether a pixel predicted as snow is a cloud edge/shadow (post-processing). The proposed approach was implemented on the multispectral Landsat 8 OLI (operational land imager)/TIRS (thermal infrared sensor) data and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation Model for the part of the region situated in Alaknanda basin, Uttarakhand, Himalaya. The proposed framework was observed to outperform (accuracy 96.79%) the current state-of-art machine learning algorithms such as artificial neural network, support vector machine, and random forest. Accuracy assessment was performed by means of several statistics measures (precision, accuracy, recall, and specificity).

TI  - Analysis of relationships between land surface temperature and land use changes in the Yellow River Delta
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed land use and land cover changes and their impact on land surface temperature using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Thermal Infrared Sensor imagery of the Yellow River Delta. Six Landsat images comprising two time series were used to calculate the land surface temperature and correlated vegetation indices. The Yellow River Delta area has expanded substantially because of the deposited sediment carried from upstream reaches of the river. Between 1986 and 2015, approximately 35% of the land use area of the Yellow River Delta has been transformed into salterns and aquaculture ponds. Overall, land use conversion has occurred primarily from poorly utilized land into highly utilized land. To analyze the variation of land surface temperature, a mono-window algorithm was applied to retrieve the regional land surface temperature. The results showed bilinear correlation between land surface temperature and the vegetation indices (i.e., Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Adjusted-Normalized Vegetation Index, Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index, and Modified Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index). Generally, values of the vegetation indices greater than the inflection point mean the land surface temperature and the vegetation indices are correlated negatively, and vice versa. Land surface temperature in coastal areas is affected considerably by local seawater temperature and weather conditions.

TI  - Evolution of the Performances of Radar Altimetry Missions from ERS-2 to Sentinel-3A over the Inner Niger Delta
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar altimetry provides unique information on water stages of inland hydro-systems. In this study, the performance of seven altimetry missions, among the most commonly used in land hydrology (i.e., European Remote-Sensing Satellite-2 (ERS-2), ENVIronment SATellite (ENVISAT), Satellite with Argos and ALtika (SARAL), Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A), are assessed using records from a dense in situ network composed of 19 gauge stations in the Inner Niger Delta (IND) from 1995 to 2017. Results show an overall very good agreement between altimetry-based and in situ water levels with correlation coefficient (R) greater than 0.8 in 80% of the cases and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 0.4 m in 48% of cases. Better agreement is found for the recently launched missions such as SARAL, Jason-3 and Sentinel-3A than for former missions, indicating the advance of the use of the Ka-band for SARAL and of the Synthetic-aperture Radar (SAR) mode for Sentinel-3A. Cross-correlation analysis performed between water levels from the same altimetry mission leads to time-lags between the upstream and the downstream part of the Inner Niger Delta of around two months that can be related to the time residence of water in the drainage area.

TI  - Classifying the Built-Up Structure of Urban Blocks with Probabilistic Graphical Models and TerraSAR-X Spotlight Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date maps of a city's urban structure types (USTs) are very important for effective planning, as well as for different studies and applications. We present an approach for the classification of USTs at the level of urban blocks based on high-resolution spaceborne radar imagery. Images obtained at the satellite's ascending and descending orbits were used for extracting line and polygon features from each block. Most of the attributes considered in the classification concern the geometry of these features, as well as their spatial disposition inside the blocks. Furthermore, assuming the UST classes of neighboring blocks are probabilistically dependent, we explored the framework of probabilistic graphical models and propose different context-based classification models. These models differ with respect to (i) their type, i.e., Markov or conditional random fields, (ii) their parameterization and (iii) the criterion applied for establishing pairwise neighboring relationships between blocks. In our experiments, 1,695 blocks from the city of Munich (Germany) and five representative UST classes were considered. A standard classification performed with the Random Forest algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of nearly 70%. All context-based classifications achieved overall accuracies up to 7% higher than that. The results indicate that denser pairwise block-neighborhood structures lead to better results and that the accuracy improvement is higher when the strength of the contextual influences is proportional to the similarity of the neighboring blocks attributes.

TI  - The adsorption of dissolved organic carbon onto glass fiber filters and its effect on the measurement of particulate organic carbon: A laboratory and modeling exercise
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY-METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate organic carbon (POC) represents a small portion of total carbon in the ocean. However, it plays a large role in the turnover of organic matter through the biological pump and other processes. Early on since the development of the POC measurement technique in the 1960s, it was known that dissolved organic carbon (DOC) adsorbs and is retained both on and in the filter. That retained DOC is measured as if it was part of the particulate fraction, an artifact that can cause significant overestimates of POC concentration. We set out to address the long-standing question of whether the magnitude of the DOC adsorption is affected by the quantity and quality of the dissolved organic matter in the sample. However, our results precluded an unequivocal answer to that question; nevertheless, the experimental data generated did allow us to develop and test predictive models that relate the mass of carbon adsorbed to the volume of sample filtered. The results indicate that the uptake of DOC can be predicted using an exponential model and that a saturation point is approached when approximately a half-liter of water is filtered. This model can be a valuable tool for correcting existing POC data sets that did not account for DOC adsorption. Nonetheless, this approach should not be regarded as a substitute for collecting in situ filter blanks in parallel with POC samples to properly correct for this artifact.

TI  - Investigating the distribution of archaeological sites: Multiparametric vs probability models and potentials for remote sensing data
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeological remains generated by human activities in prehistorical and historical times result in anthropogenic spatial components of modern landscapes. The study of these features in geographical areas of interest can be advantageous to assist in both cultural heritage protection policies and the efficient management of the archaeological risk impacts inherent in infrastructural planning. As such, predictive distribution models are becoming an investigation method for archaeological landscapes. Moreover, the use of remote sensing data in this type of model, both in archaeological and ecological contexts, is gaining momentum. Based on presence-only data, two inductive predictive modelling approaches, i.e., a geographical information system (GIS)-based multiparametric spatial analysis (MPSA) and maximum entropy model (MaxEnt), were tested, integrated and evaluated for archaeological applications at different scales over the case study area of the Tavoliere Plain (Southern Italy). Presence data included sites identified via both remote sensing and archaeological survey techniques. Environmental variables included topographic, geomorphological and remote sensing derived attributes. Two contrasting repeatable criteria (i.e., correlation coefficients plus MaxEnt statistics and spatial principal component analysis (PCA) were used to select non-redundant environmental variables and Akaike's information criterion (AIC) to select the most parsimonious model configurations. A threshold analysis of the presence data was performed on the best model to define the minimum size of the presence data set with respect to the extent of the study area as well as the relative amounts of remote sensing derived response data to reach a stable performance of the model. The results show a higher performance of the MaxEnt models with respect to the GIS_MSPA models regardless of scale, indicating that the two approaches cannot be considered alternatives. The most parsimonious configurations of these models indicate that, depending on their scale, both spatial PCA and MaxEnt statistics can be used to select non-redundant input variables. The threshold analysis suggests that for the illustrated case study, a density of 0.2 presence sites/km(2) and 45% of remotely sensed sites are necessary to improve and stabilise the performance of the model. Critical issues and opportunities for advances in the performance of the MaxEnt approach in an operational archaeological context are highlighted. These results suggest stakeholders should deal with predictive modelling prior to the undertaking of both land development and scientific field surveys and offer advice for informed decisions at this regard.

TI  - Diurnal spatial distributions of aerosol optical and cloud micro-macrophysics properties in Africa based on MODIS observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The diurnal spatial distribution of both natural and anthropogenic aerosols, as well as liquid and ice cloud micro-macrophysics have been evaluated over Africa using Terra and Aqua MODIS collection 6 products. The variability of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE), liquid and ice cloud microphysics (Liquid cloud effective radius LCER, Ice cloud effective radius ICER) and cloud macrophysics (Liquid cloud optical thickness LCOT, Liquid cloud water path LCWP, Ice cloud optical thickness ICOT, Ice cloud water path ICWP) parameters were investigated from the morning to afternoon over Africa from 2010 to 2014. In both the morning (Terra) and afternoon (Aqua) heavy pollution (AOD a 0.6) occurs in the coastal and central areas (between 12 degrees N-17 degrees N and 10 degrees E-15 degrees E) of West of Africa (WA), Central of Africa (CA) (0.5 degrees S-7 degrees S and 10 degrees E-25 degrees E),. Moderate pollution (0.3 < AOD < 0.6) often occurs in West and North of Africa (between 5 degrees N-27 degrees N and 16 degrees W-5 degrees E), and clean environmental (AOD < 0.3) conditions are common in South of Africa (SA), East of Africa (EA) and some regions in North of Africa (NA). The West-North of Africa (WNA) and Central-South of Africa (CSA) regions are dominated by dust (AE < 0.7) and biomass burning (AE > 1.2) aerosols. The mixture of dust and biomass burning aerosols (0.7 < AE < 1.2) are found at the coastal areas in West of Africa (CoWA) and Central of Africa (CA) (5 degrees N-8 degrees N and 10 degrees E-34E), particularly in the morning and afternoon respectively. The LCER often decrease from the morning to the afternoon in all seasons, but an increase occur from the morning to the afternoon in CSA (5 degrees S-22 degrees S) in DJF, both CA (2 degrees S-5 degrees N)and CoWA in JJA and SON. The ICER increase from the morning to afternoon in all seasons over Africa and decreases in South of Africa (5 degrees S-20 degrees S) in DJF. The LCOT increases from the morning to afternoon in NA and SA while a decrease occur in CA in all seasons. The LCWP increase in many regions of Africa in all seasons while a decrease occurs in CoWA during JJA. The ICOT and ICWP show a remarkable increase from the morning to afternoon in regions dominated by biomass burning (CSA) compared to regions dominated by dust (WNA) aerosols in DJF, MAM and SON. Dust aerosols are mainly distributed in WNA by northerly and westerly winds in both January and April, southerly and southwesterly winds in July, and southerly and southwesterly winds in October, while biomass burning aerosols are mainly distributed in CSA by, the northerly and northeasterly winds in January, easterly winds in April, July and October. The diurnal variability of cloud parameters is associated with both convective processes and cloud types. The knowledge of interactions between natural and anthropogenic aerosols with liquid and ice cloud microphysics parameters could contribute to improve aerosol and cloud remote sensing retrieval.

TI  - The Impact of Drought on Native Southern California Vegetation: Remote Sensing Analysis Using MODIS-Derived Time Series
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystems in Mediterranean climates are adapted to seasonal drought. Multiannual drought, however, may significantly affect Mediterranean ecosystems and, further, may affect their constituent communities in different ways with differences in responses emerging during severe drought and over the course of long-term climate change. This study investigates the response to recent prolonged drought of two important Mediterranean-climate vegetation types: chaparral and coastal sage scrub. Their greenness was monitored from 2000 to 2017 using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. A bootstrapped multiple regression of NDVI anomalies against Palmer Drought Severity Index was used to assess the response of vegetation to drought. The results suggest that drought had a greater effect on chaparral-dominated ecosystems than coastal sage over the entire region. Shallow-rooted coastal sage scrub displayed higher interannual variability in NDVI than chaparral but had a lower correlation with Palmer Drought Severity Index. This suggests that this vegetation community is generally less responsive to drought on longer timescales than chaparral, which may be more sensitive to soil water depletion in a prolonged drought. Soil texture plays a critical role in affecting the community sensitivity to drought. For chaparral communities, elevation is negatively correlated with drought sensitivity, suggesting the role of temperature-related water stress on their long-term response to drought. Future predicted climate change in the form of increased temperature and drought hazards in Southern California will influence the native ecosystems in nonuniform ways. Long-term trends in soil moisture depletion and temperature may be particularly important in chaparral-dominated areas.Plain Language Summary Chaparral and coastal sage scrub are the two most widely distributed shrubland communities along the South Pacific Coast of California. Shallow-rooted coastal sage scrub has been presumed to be more vulnerable to drought, compared to the deep-rooted chaparrals. However, the recent prolonged 2012-2016 drought, which has been reported as the worst drought in the last 1,200years, suggests otherwise. Satellite data show that chaparral ecosystems have been more affected by drought than the coastal sage, indicating the higher vulnerability of chaparral over the long term. Chaparral plants are generally more dependent on water in deeper soil layers, making them more resistant to short-term drought (e.g., <1year) than coastal sage, but this physiological characteristic, at the same time, makes them susceptible to prolonged droughts (e.g., >2years). Local response of both communities during drought are dependent upon soil texture, with sandier soils that have higher water holding capacity providing a greater buffer against drought impacts. Chaparral sensitivity to drought, in addition, depends upon elevation that, in turn, controls local temperature. Communities in lower, warmer sites displayed greater drought sensitivity compared to higher, cooler sites, implying that future climate warming may further exacerbate the impact of drought on chaparral ecosystems.

TI  - Global Warming and its Implications on Meteorological and Hydrological Drought in the Southeastern Mediterranean
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSES-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Southeastern Mediterranean is a semiarid marginal area which is highly sensitive to small perturbations in global climate. This area is projected to become warmer and drier which will in turn intensify drought frequency and severity, leading to serious adverse consequences on water resources, soil moisture regime, land productivity, socio-economic and political stability. The present paper assesses precipitation, temperature and drought trends, using the Palmer Drought Severity Index and data from six synoptic meteorological stations situated in the mountainous areas of Jordan and operating during the past 40 to 60 years. The Mann-Kendall non-parametric test and the Sen's method were implemented to test drought trend and magnitude during the study period. Results show that average annual temperature increased substantially in all stations, while precipitation has dropped appreciably in the southern region. Drought frequency and severity have become more distinct near the turn of the twenty-first century, particularly in the southern region. Soil moisture regime within the top one meter shows a tangible declining trend, particularly in the southern stations. Five multispectral Landsat images taken during the period 1987 through 2015 were used to monitor land cover changes in the most southern location where drought trend is more severe. Land cover as deduced from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index reveals that barren land increased appreciably at the expense of other land covers between 2000 and 2015. Findings indicate that global warming is intensifying drought frequency and severity in the eastern Mediterranean, thereby posing challenging economic, societal and political consequences which need to be urgently addressed.

T2  - GEODESY AND CARTOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) maps are important datasets in various environmental projects. Our aim was to demonstrate how GEOBIA framework can be used for integrating different data sources and classification methods in context of LULC mapping. We presented multi-stage semi-automated GEOBIA classification workflow created for LULC mapping of Tuszyma Forestry Management area based on multi-source, multi-temporal and multi-resolution input data, such as 4 bands-aerial orthophoto, LiDAR-derived nDSM, Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite images and ancillary vector data. Various classification methods were applied, i.e. rule-based and Random Forest supervised classification. This approach allowed us to focus on classification of each class 'individually' by taking advantage from all useful information from various input data, expert knowledge, and advanced machine-learning tools. In the first step, twelve classes were assigned in two-steps rule-based classification approach either vector-based, ortho-and vector-based or ortho-and Lidar-based. Then, supervised classification was performed with use of Random Forest algorithm. Three agriculture-related LULC classes with vegetation alternating conditions were assigned based on aerial orthophoto and Sentinel-2 information. For classification of 15 LULC classes we obtained 81.3% overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of 0.78. The visual evaluation and class coverage comparison showed that the generated LULC layer differs from the existing land cover maps especially in relative cover of agriculture-related classes. Generally, the created map can be considered as superior to the existing data in terms of the level of details and correspondence to actual environmental and vegetation conditions that can be observed in RS images.

TI  - Validation of a Novel Diagnostic Kit Using the Semidry Dot-Blot Method to Detect Metastatic Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer: Distinguishing Macrometastases From Nonmacrometastases
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluated 159 lymph nodes using the kit's targeted cytokeratin 19 protein compared with pathology results. The kits could distinguish macrometastases from nonmacrometastases in breast cancer, with 94.4% sensitivity, 96.2% specificity, and 95.6% accuracy. Diagnosis was achieved in approximately 20 minutes using the kits, at a cost within $30 USD. The kits are accurate, fast, cost-effective, and a dual detection method. Background: The semidry dot-blot method is a diagnostic procedure for detecting lymph node (LN) metastases using the presence of cytokeratin (CK) in lavage fluid from sectioned LNs. We evaluated 2 novel kits that use newly developed anti-CK-19 antibodies to diagnose LN metastases in breast cancer. Patients and Methods: We examined 159 LNs dissected that we sliced at 2-mm intervals and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The suspended cells in the lavage were centrifuged and lysed to extract protein. This extracted protein was used with a low-power and a high-power kit to diagnose LN metastasis. Diagnoses on the basis of the kits were compared with pathological diagnoses. Results: Of the 159 LNs, 68 were assessed as positive and 91 as negative in permanent section examination. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the low-power kit for detecting LN metastases was 83.8%, 100%, and 93.1%, respectively. Those of the high-power kit were 92.6%, 92.3%, and 92.5%, respectively. Combining the low-a h-power kit results, those for distinguishing macrometastases were 94.5%, 95.2%, and 95.0%, respectively. Diagnosis was achieved in approximately 20 minutes, at a cost of less than $30 USD. Conclusion: The kits were accurate, fast, and cost-effective in diagnosing LN metastases without the loss of LN tissue.

T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand and dust storms are causing hazards and problems in aviation as well as the dangers and distresses they cause on living things. The low meteorological visibility, the presence of strong winds with gust, and the transport of dust and sand particles by the wind are dangerous on landing and departure of aircrafts, and even on planes that are parked. The main aim of the study is to examine the meteorological conditions causing the dust storm that took place in the Arabian Peninsula on February 28, 2009, and to determine the source of dust caused dust storm, sand storm, blown sand, and blown dust at the airports. Within the scope of the study, aviation routine weather report (METAR) and aviation selected special weather report (SPECI) reports have been assessed at many airports over Arabian Peninsula (AP), the northern part of the AP and North Africa. As model outputs; NCEP-DOE Reanalysis 2 data, BSC-DREAM8B, and HYSPLIT model were used. In the satellite images; METEOSAT MSG dust RGB images, MODIS, and Kalpana-1 data were used. According to obtained results, dust storms were detected in Bahrain, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and United Arab Emirates (UAE). At Al-Ahsa Airport in Saudi Arabia, the lowest visibility measured on February 28, 2009, dropping to 200 m, which was dominated by blowing sand. The source region of the dust observed at Dubai Airport in UAE is the eastern regions of the Rub'al Khali Desert located between Saudi Arabia, Oman, and UAE.

TI  - Application of forest canopy density model for forest cover mapping using LISS-IV satellite data: a case study of Sali watershed, West Bengal
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigation of forest canopy density has become an important tool for proper management of natural resources. Vegetation cover density can identify the exact forest gaps within a particular area which in turn will provide the appropriate management strategies for future. Forest canopy density has become an essential tool for identifying the exact areas where the afforestation or reforestation programmes needs to be implemented. The aim and objective of this article is to show up the existing density of forest cover using remote sensing and geographic information system tools. Weighted overlay analysis method has been adopted for investigating forest canopy density of Sali river basin, Bankura district, West Bengal. Several indices likewise normalized difference vegetation index, bareness index, shadow index and perpendicular vegetation index etc. have been used for this study. Higher the weight was assigned for greater concentration of vegetation and lower the weight was assigned for lesser concentration of vegetation. Southern part of the region has very high density of forest coverage in comparison with the northern part of the region. It has been observed that 7.48% of the area is at very low density, 12.63% of low density, 24.84% of medium density, 23.92% of high density and 31.13% of very high forest canopy density.

AB  - The article highlights the category of literary space, connecting different topophones with the author's worldview. Topophones in the works by Ray Bradbury are used not only for identifying the place where the events unfold but they equally serve as the background to the expression of the author's evaluative characteristics of the modern world, his attitude to science, the latest technologies, and the human beings who are responsible for all the events, which take place not only on the Earth, but also far away from it.

TI  - Analyzing land surface temperature trends using non-parametric approach: A case of Delhi, India
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban Heat Island (UHI) creates backwash effect in the system. The existing studies consider averaging of Land Surface Temperature (LST) over the area of a land-use/land-cover for analysis of UHI, whereas it is not necessary that all pixels observe similar behavior. Besides this, averaging of LST over space obstructs the spatial continuity. The analysis of the behavior of LST over a pixel is important. The pixel-wise temperature trend analysis will further open up the layers of intensities in a particular land-use/land-cover, and is more meaningful. The LST images have been used for trend analysis in different studies but the robustness has never been analyzed. In this research, the robustness of the LST trend is analyzed pixel-wise by using non-parametric Mann-Kendall to detect trends in monthly LST, and Theil-Sen slope estimator for analyzing the extent of significance of this trend in Delhi. MODIS data from 2001 to 2015 has been used. The results highlighted a mix of positive and negative trends in monthly LST. February (nighttime) and September (daytime) trends are most important due to high robustness at all significance levels. This research concludes that there is a positive temperature trend throughout the study period especially in night time in Delhi.

TI  - Epikarst mapping by remote sensing
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Epikarst the shallow, surficial part of a karstic massif - has a significant influence on the spatio-temporal variability of recharge and the hydrodynamic functioning of many karst aquifers. In the Mediterranean morphoclimatic zone, the average thickness of a well-developed epikarst is around ten metres, but the spatial patterns of its degree of development are very heterogeneous due to the complex interaction of a number of different factors such as lithology, fracturing, weathering, soil and vegetation. In addition, direct field observation is difficult because good outcropping conditions are restricted to particular locations, some areas are not accessible and the size of the study area is often too large for exhaustive field surveys. Satellite-based remote sensing, however, provides a complete coverage of an entire area with spectral resolutions that detect variability in features that can define image textures related to the development of the epikarst. This paper describes a quantitative methodology for epikarst mapping using satellite images and field data. The proposed method comprises an unsupervised classification to define the spectral signature of each of three epikarst development categories in a high-resolution satellite image followed by a supervised classification of the terrain into one of the three categories on a low spatial resolution scale. The training areas in the field are assigned to the three categories by a panel of experts using the Delphi method. Geophysical data are used for validation to overcome any bias that may be introduced by the panel. The proposed methodology has been applied to the Sierra de las Nieves karstic aquifer (Malaga, southern Spain). The outcome is a map of estimated epikarst development that is an approximation to reality and which can be improved as more experimental data become available.

TI  - Potential for foot dysfunction and plantar fasciitis according to the shape of the foot arch in young adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXERCISE REHABILITATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated potential for foot dysfunction and plantar fasciitis according to the shape of the foot arch in young adults. Fifty-two participants were required for the present study design to achieve 80% power, 0.8 effect size (eta(2)), and an alpha level of 0.05. This study recruited 52 young adults (30 men and 22 women). All participants voluntarily agreed to participate in the study after hearing explanations about the purpose and process of the study. They were divided into two groups of 26 according to the shape of foot with and without flat foot using the navicular drop test. The participants were measured the foot function index (FFI), range of motion (ROM) of ankle, and four-way ankle strength. Additionally, the thickness of the plantar fascia was measured using ultrasonography. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to verify the inter-and intrarater reliability of ultrasonography. The inter-and intrarater reliability was excellent (ICC2,1= 0.88, ICC3,1= 0.93). There were significant differences in dorsi-flexion of ankle ROM, FFI, dorsi-flexion and eversion of ankle strength, and the thickness of the plantar fascia between the two groups (P< 0.05). Based on the results, the group with flat foot may gradually generate potential of the foot dysfunction and plantar fasciitis. Therefore, the interventions are necessary to improve the foot dysfunction and plantar fasciitis in people with flat foot.

TI  - A Study on Automated Lineament Extraction with Respect to Spatial Resolution of Digital Elevation Model
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lineament is a linear or curved terrain element to discriminate adjacent geological structures in each other. It has been widely used for analysis of geology, mineral exploration, natural disasters, and earthquake, etc. In the past, the lineament has been extracted using cartographic map or field survey. However, it is possible to extract more efficiently the lineament for a very wide area thanks to development of remote sensing technique. Remotely sensed observation by aircraft, satellite, or digital elevation model (DEM) has been used for visual recognition for manual lineament extraction. Automatic approaches using computer science have been proposed to extract lineament more objectively. In this study, we evaluate the characteristics of lineament which is automatically extracted with respect to difference of spatial resolution of DEM. We utilized two types of DEM: one is Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) with spatial resolution of about 90 m (3 arc sec), and the other is the latest world DEM of TerraSAR-X add-on for Global DEM with 12 m spatial resolution. In addition, a global DEM was resampled to produce a DEM with a spatial resolution of 30 m (1 arc sec). The shaded relief map was constructed considering various sun elevation and solar azimuth angle. In order to extract lineament automatically, we used the LINE module in PCI Geomatica software. We found that predominant direction of the extracted lineament is about N15-25 degrees E (NNE), regardless of spatial resolution of DEM. However, more fine and detailed lineament were extracted using higher spatial resolution of DEM. The result shows that the lineament density is proportional to the spatial resolution of DEM. Thus, the DEM with appropriate spatial resolution should be selected according to the purpose of the study.

TI  - Changes in foliage projective cover and its implications for mapping groundwater dependent vegetation across a precipitation gradient
T2  - ECOHYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Adequate protection of groundwater dependent vegetation (GDV) at the landscape scale (>10(4)km(2)) is often hampered as their extent is poorly mapped. Remote sensing data sets have previously been used to delineate GDV by analysing both actual and changes, in green biomass over space and time. The rationale behind such approaches is based on the phenological characteristics of GDV, which often retain greater mean green biomass during dry periods, in comparison to vegetation with access to soil moisture only. However, such methods are hampered by inadequate knowledge about how average annual precipitation, seasonality, and differing water regimes of vegetation communities within a landscape influence green biomass. Therefore, we aimed to test for amount of foliage projective cover (FPC) and variation in FPC as indicators of GDV presence. We assessed differences in the FPC of GDV at 3 sites across a 1,500mm(-1)year(-1) precipitation gradient, ranging from arid inland to humid coastal environments in Southern Queensland, Australia. Overall, we found that average annual precipitation had the largest influence on predicting FPC followed by seasonality. During winter in the semi-arid and humid environments (season with least precipitation), FPC for non-GDV was higher than subsurface GDV. For our study area, GDV delineation on the basis of higher green biomass than surrounding vegetation was effective when average annual precipitation was less than similar to 600mm(-1)year(-1).

TI  - Mean Composite Fire Severity Metrics Computed with Google Earth Engine Offer Improved Accuracy and Expanded Mapping Potential
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-based fire severity datasets are an invaluable resource for monitoring and research purposes. These gridded fire severity datasets are generally produced with pre- and post-fire imagery to estimate the degree of fire-induced ecological change. Here, we introduce methods to produce three Landsat-based fire severity metrics using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform: The delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR), the relativized delta normalized burn ratio (RdNBR), and the relativized burn ratio (RBR). Our methods do not rely on time-consuming a priori scene selection but instead use a mean compositing approach in which all valid pixels (e.g., cloud-free) over a pre-specified date range (pre- and post-fire) are stacked and the mean value for each pixel over each stack is used to produce the resulting fire severity datasets. This approach demonstrates that fire severity datasets can be produced with relative ease and speed compared to the standard approach in which one pre-fire and one post-fire scene are judiciously identified and used to produce fire severity datasets. We also validate the GEE-derived fire severity metrics using field-based fire severity plots for 18 fires in the western United States. These validations are compared to Landsat-based fire severity datasets produced using only one pre- and post-fire scene, which has been the standard approach in producing such datasets since their inception. Results indicate that the GEE-derived fire severity datasets generally show improved validation statistics compared to parallel versions in which only one pre-fire and one post-fire scene are used, though some of the improvements in some validations are more or less negligible. We provide code and a sample geospatial fire history layer to produce dNBR, RdNBR, and RBR for the 18 fires we evaluated. Although our approach requires that a geospatial fire history layer (i.e., fire perimeters) be produced independently and prior to applying our methods, we suggest that our GEE methodology can reasonably be implemented on hundreds to thousands of fires, thereby increasing opportunities for fire severity monitoring and research across the globe.

TI  - Consistency of spatiotemporal sound features supports the use of passive acoustics for long-term monitoring
T2  - ANIMAL CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies stress the usefulness of fish calls as effective indicators of distinct species occurrence. However, most of these studies have been undertaken in a given area and during restricted periods of time. There is a need to show passive acoustic monitoring is a reliable method to study vocal species over space and time. This study aims to use passive acoustic methods to follow the brown meagre Sciaena umbra at relevant temporal and spatial scales. Specimens of S. umbra were recorded in both aquarium and in the field. In situ recordings were made at two regions (Corsica and Sardinia) during four summers (2008-2012-2013-2015). Temporal and frequency parameters of the fish calls were collected by different teams and compared to test the ability to unequivocally identify the fish sound. The comparison between our data and the bibliography highlights the capability to identify S. umbra during a period of 17years in different Mediterranean regions, clearly supporting the usefulness of acoustic monitoring to discover and protect aggregation sites of this endangered species. The sound producing mechanism in S.umbra consists of high-speed sonic muscles surrounding dorsally the posterior end of the swim bladder, which can explain the low acoustic variability that helps in the species identification. Similar mechanisms are found in other Sciaenidae, suggesting that a similar conclusion can be drawn for many other adult sciaenids that could be used as sentinel species. This study should be of high interest to policymakers and scientists because it shows passive acoustic can be confidently used in resource management.

TI  - Improved mapping of forest type using spectral-temporal Landsat features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-spectral imagery from the Landsat family of satellites has been used to map forest properties for decades, but accurate forest type characterizations at a 30-m Landsat resolution have remained an ongoing challenge, especially over large areas. We combined existing Landsat time series algorithms to quantify both harmonic and phenological metrics in a new set of spectral-temporal features that can be produced seamlessly across many Landsat scenes. Harmonic metrics characterize mean annual reflectance and seasonal variability, while phenological metrics quantify the timing of seasonal events. We assessed the performance of spectral-temporal features derived from time series of all available observations (1985-2015) relative to more conventional single date and multi-date inputs. Performance was determined based on agreement with a reference dataset for eight New England forest types at both the pixel and polygon scale. We found that spectral-temporal features consistently and significantly (paired t-test, p << 0.01) outperformed all feature sets derived from individual images and multi-date combinations in all measures of agreement considered. Harmonic features, such as annual amplitude and model fit error, aid in distinguishing deciduous hardwoods from conifer species, while phenology features, like the timing of autumn onset and growing season length, were useful in separating hardwood classes. This study represents an important step toward large-scale forest type mapping using spectral-temporal Landsat features by providing a quantitative assessment of the advantages of harmonic and phenology features derived from time series of Landsat data as compared with more conventional single-date and multi-date classification inputs.

TI  - Improvement to visualization of nodes in breast cancer patients following audit: are we seeing the problem?
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Successful localization of nodes in breast cancer patients depends upon the effectiveness of the lymphoscintigraphy technique employed. A benefit of performing imaging as part of this procedure is that it allows sites to audit their technique. An audit of breast cancer patients at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary (GRI) hospital showed nodes to be visualized in only 81% of patients. Current guidelines state that nodes should be seen in more than 95% of patients. A period of investigation and review led to changes being made to the injection and imaging technique employed at the GRI site. Following these changes a re-audit was performed that showed that the node visualization rate has successfully been increased to 97%, thereby meeting the standards set in the guidelines. This technical note details the results of the initial audit and re-audit, and explains the investigation and changes made to clinical procedures at the GRI site to improve the node visualization rate. The challenges that can occur when performing breast sentinel node procedures are also discussed.

TI  - Quantifying variation in occupational air pollution exposure within a small metropolitan region of Brazil
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - An occupational sampling campaign was conducted in the city of Londrina, Parand, during an eleven-week period of the dry season (spring) of 2015. To assess worker exposure, concentrations of black carbon (BC), fine particles (< 2.g5 mu m) and particle number counts (PNC, between 0.01 and 1.0 mu m), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) and ozone (O-3) were monitored at a 1-min resolution within seven occupational microenvironments for an entire working week (similar to 45 h in each location). Workplace observations were supported by simultaneous collection of BC, PM2.5, PNC, O-3 and meteorological variables at an urban background site. In order to distinguish between immediate local sources and wide-area influences on worker exposures, the contribution of long-range transport (LRT) from fire events was assessed using air mass back trajectory and satellite fire spot analyses. A total of fifteen environmental variables influencing workplace exposures were tested using multiple regression models and exposure differences between occupations were assessed using non-parametric tests. Although the environmental settings differed substantially, weekly median exposures were similar, with the exception of occupations involving significant indoor sources and those proximate to heavy traffic. Median TVOC exposure was 8 (3,351, range 17-77,530 ppb, p < 0.001) and 3.5 times higher (1,616, range 0.3-18,861 ppb, p < 0.001) at a shoe repair store and hair salon, respectively, than in a clean office environment situated directly within the city centre (414, range 0.5-4844 ppb). Similarly, median BC concentrations were 2.8 (3.7, range 1.2-27.8 mu g/m(3), p < 0.001) times greater inside a street canyon drug store and elevated by a factor of 3.0 (3.8, range 0.4-39.6 mu g/m(3), p < 0.001), on a local commuter bus, than in the office environment (1.3 mu g/m(3)). These results hold important implications for workplace exposure and can aid in informing potential mitigation strategies, such as a review of ventilation configurations and hazardous materials used in certain occupations.

TI  - Remote assessment of extracted volumes and greenhouse gases from tropical timber harvest
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Timber harvest from tropical regions generates seven billion dollars annually in exports and is estimated to occur across 20% of the area of remaining tropical forests. This timber harvesting is estimated to account for more than one in eight of all greenhouse gas emissions from tropical forests. Yet there is currently no means to independently estimate extracted volumes and associated greenhouse gas emissions.In this study, we built upon an earlier paper that used an automated algorithm applied to LiDAR to accurately identify area of timber harvest impact in the categories of roads/decks, skid trails and gaps. This algorithm was applied to 2014 harvest areas in four concessions in Kalimantan, Indonesia. In two of these concessions, total harvested timber volumes and greenhouse gas emissions were measured and calculated in the field using data from 188 harvested and extracted trees.In order to relate remote sensing data with the estimated extracted volumes, we calculated factors that linked extracted timber volumes with greenhouse gas emissions, and applied three different regression equations. The parameters of the most accurate equation were the areas of roads, skid trails and gaps, explaining 87% of the variation in the data. For situations where rivers are used in place of roads for extracting timber and for instances of non-mechanized, often illegal logging, a second equation was created in which only skid trail and gap attribute data were used, and in this equation 86% of the variation was accounted. The final equation, intended for use in scenarios where LiDAR data are not available but moderate resolution imagery could be used, associated length of roads only with extracted volumes. In this case, 78% of the variation was explained.Application of the first equation permitted estimation of extracted volumes and associated greenhouse gas emissions from two additional logging concessions. We discuss the application of these equations to areas that have been identified as illegal logging concessions, and propose that these may be applied to larger regions across the country.These equations offer a way to estimate volumes of timber extraction when no ground data is available, and to calculate greenhouse gas emissions associated with extracted volumes, providing a simple methodology useful across forested tropical countries.

TI  - Quantifying snow controls on vegetation greenness
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow is a key driver for biotic processes in Arctic ecosystems. Yet, quantifying relationships between snow metrics and biological components is challenging due to lack of temporally and spatially distributed observations at ecologically relevant scales and resolutions. In this study, we quantified relationships between snow, air temperature, and vegetation greenness (using annual maximum normalized difference vegetation index [MaxNDVI] and its timing [MaxNDVI_DOY]) from ground-based and remote-sensing observations, in combination with physically based models, across a heterogeneous landscape in a high-Arctic, northeast Greenland region. Across the 98-km distance from the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) to the coast, we quantified significant inland-coast gradients of air temperature, winter precipitation (using pre-melt snow-water-equivalent [SWE]), and snowmelt timing (using snow-free day of year [SnowFree(-) DOY]). Near the coast, the mean annual air temperature was 4.5 degrees C lower, the mean SWE was 0.3 m greater, and the mean SnowFree_DOY was 37 d later, than near the GrIS. The regional continentality gradient was eight times stronger than the south-to-north air-temperature gradient along the Greenland east coast. Across this strong gradient, the mean vegetation greening-up period (SnowFree_DOY-MaxNDVI_ DOY) varied spatially by 24-57 d. We quantified significant non-linear relationships between the vegetation characteristics of MaxNDVI and MaxNDVI_DOY, and SWE, SnowFree_DOY, and growing degree-days-sums during greening-up (Greening(-)GDD) across the 16-yr study period (2000-2015). These demonstrated that the snow metrics, both SWE and SnowFree(-)DOY, were more important drivers of MaxNDVI and MaxNDVI(-)DOY than Greening(-)GDD within this seasonally snow-covered region. The methodologies that provided temporally and spatially distributed snow, air temperature, and vegetation greenness data are applicable to any snow- and vegetation-covered area on Earth.

TI  - Beyond T, N and M: The impact of tumor deposits on the staging and treatment of colorectal and gastric carcinoma
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - This review aims to describe the results of the most recent studies on the prognostic value of TDs and highlight the impact of TDs on the staging and treatment of colorectal and gastric carcinoma. For colorectal carcinoma TDs have an adverse prognostic effect that is at least similar to that of positive regional lymph nodes. However, support is growing in favor of including of TDs in the M category, rather than the N or T categories of the TNM classification. Moreover, TDs seem to have an adverse effect on outcomes not only in patients without lymph node involvement but also in patients with nodal involvement. Although the prognostic impact of TDs in gastric cancer appears to be undeniable, the actual prognostic determinants of TDs, particularly in relation to the number, size and histological types, remain to be established.Although the 7th and 8th Edition of the TNM classification of colorectal and gastric carcinoma includes TDs in the N category, no current procedures or methods to assess preoperative or intraoperative N-status allow TD detection. After neoadjuvant treatment for advanced rectal carcinoma, the presence of TDs may indicate incomplete eradication of the main tumor and not discontinuous tumor foci.TDs have an undeniable prognostic impact but no algorithm of staging and strategy of treatment has been conformed to this prognostic factor to overcome the classical T,N, and M prognostic categories. Staging and treatment of colorectal and gastric cancers should be reconsidered in light of the emerging prognostic value of TDs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Use of Massive Deformation Datasets for the Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Evolution of Mauna Loa Volcano (Hawai'i)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we exploited large DInSAR and GPS datasets to create a 4D image of the magma transfer processes at Mauna Loa Volcano (Island of Hawai'i) from 2005 to 2015. The datasets consist of 23 continuous GPS time series and 307 SAR images acquired from ascending and descending orbits by ENVISAT (ENV) and COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) satellites. Our results highlight how the joint use of SAR data acquired from different orbits (thus with different look angles and wavelengths), together with deformation data from GPS networks and geological information can significantly improve the constraints on the geometry and location of the sources responsible for the observed deformation. The analysis of these datasets has been performed by using an innovative method that allows building a complex source configuration. The results suggest that the deformation pattern observed from 2005 to 2015 has been controlled by three deformation sources: the ascent of magma along a conduit, the opening of a dike and the slip along the basal decollement. This confirms that the intrusion of the magma within a tabular system (rift dikes) may trigger the sliding of the SE portion of the volcanic edifice along the basal decollement. This case study confirms that it is now possible to exploit large geodetic datasets to improve our knowledge of volcano dynamics. The same approach could also be easily applied in other geodynamical contexts such as geothermal reservoirs and regions with complex tectonics.

TI  - Number of nodes in sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer: Are surgeons still biased?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesThe purpose of this study was to assess the number of lymph nodes removed at SLNB, and what factors might bias a surgeon's decision to remove additional nodes.MethodsA prospectively maintained database was reviewed. All patients that had SLNB for primary treatment of breast cancer between January 2012 and March 2016 were identified. Clinicopathologic factors were used to compare the number of LNs and rates of node positivity.ResultsOne thousand six hundred and three patients were included. The average number of SLNs, non-SLNs, and total LNs was 2.53, 0.54, 3.08, respectively. Significantly more LNs were removed in age <40 versus age >40 (3.73, 3.04 P<0.01), invasive versus DCIS (3.13, 2.73 P<0.001), Grade III versus Grade II (3.42, 2.99 P<0.01), T2 versus T1 (3.40, 2.96 P<0.01), and ER- versus ER+ (3.45, 3.05 P<0.05). SLN positivity was significantly higher (P<0.05) in invasive versus DCIS (27%, 4%), T2 versus T1 (30%. 17%), Grade II versus Grade I (42%, 18%), and ILC versus IDC (38%, 26%).ConclusionsThere was a significant difference in the number of lymph nodes removed at SLNB in certain groups however; node positivity was not necessarily higher in these groups. Surgeons must be cognizant of potential bias when performing SLNB.

TI  - Using adult ⁢Aedes aegypti⁢ females to predict areas at risk for dengue transmission: A spatial case-control study
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Traditional indices for measuring dengue fever risk in a given area are based on the immature forms of the vector (larvae and pupae surveys). However, this is inefficient because only adult female mosquitoes actually transmit the virus. Based on these assumptions, our objective was to evaluate the association between an entomological index obtained from adult mosquito traps and the occurrence of dengue in a hyperendemic area. Additionally, we compared its cost to that of the Breteau Index (BI).Material and methods: We performed this study in Sao Jose do Rio Preto, SP, Brazil, between the epidemiological weeks of 36/2012 and 19/2013. BG-Sentinel and BG-Mosquitito traps were installed to capture adult mosquitoes. Positive and negative cases of dengue fever were computed and geocoded. We generated biweekly thematic maps of the entomological index, generated by calculating the number of adult Aedes aegypti females (NAF) per 100 households during a week by kriging, and based on the number of mosquitoes captured. The relation between the occurrence of dengue fever and the NAF was tested using a spatial case-control design and a generalized additive model and was controlled by the coordinates of the positive and negative cases of dengue fever.Results: Our analyses showed that increases in dengue fever cases occurred in parallel with increases in the number of Ae. aegypti females. The entomological index produced in our study correlates positively with the incidence of dengue, particularly during intervals when vector control measures were applied less intensively. The operational costs of our index were lower than those of the BI: NAF used 71.5% less human resources necessary to measure the Bl.Conclusions: Spatial analysis techniques and the number of adult Ae. aegypti females were used to produce an indicator of dengue risk. The index can be applied at various levels of spatial aggregation for an entire study area, as well as for sub-areas, such as city blocks. Even though the index is adequate to predict dengue risk, it should be tested and validated in various scenarios before routine use.

This Cartesian vision of the world is formed in the dichotomic rationality that underlies the legal occidental systems, pretending not to know all the possibility to an intercultural dialogue in the same conditions with other conceptions of the law. However, the Andean Constitutionalism has made way to a constitutional ecologism, reminding as subjects of rights to Mother Earth or Pachamama changing the logic to an ethic of respect for life and of opening to a plural legal system.

TI  - Assumption-versus data-based approaches to summarizing species' ranges
T2  - CONSERVATION BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - For conservation decision making, species' geographic distributions are mapped using various approaches. Some such efforts have downscaled versions of coarse-resolution extent-of-occurrence maps to fine resolutions for conservation planning. We examined the quality of the extent-of-occurrence maps as range summaries and the utility of refining those maps into fine-resolution distributional hypotheses. Extent-of-occurrence maps tend to be overly simple, omit many known and well-documented populations, and likely frequently include many areas not holding populations. Refinement steps involve typological assumptions about habitat preferences and elevational ranges of species, which can introduce substantial error in estimates of species' true areas of distribution. However, no model-evaluation steps are taken to assess the predictive ability of these models, so model inaccuracies are not noticed. Whereas range summaries derived by these methods may be useful in coarse-grained, global-extent studies, their continued use in on-the-ground conservation applications at fine spatial resolutions is not advisable in light of reliance on assumptions, lack of real spatial resolution, and lack of testing. In contrast, data-driven techniques that integrate primary data on biodiversity occurrence with remotely sensed data that summarize environmental dimensions (i.e., ecological niche modeling or species distribution modeling) offer data-driven solutions based on a minimum of assumptions that can be evaluated and validated quantitatively to offer a well-founded, widely accepted method for summarizing species' distributional patterns for conservation applications.

TI  - Satellite remote sensing of ecosystem functions: opportunities, challenges and way forward
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Societal, economic and scientific interests in knowing where biodiversity is, how it is faring and what can be done to efficiently mitigate further biodiversity loss and the associated loss of ecosystem services are at an all-time high. So far, however, biodiversity monitoring has primarily focused on structural and compositional features of ecosystems despite growing evidence that ecosystem functions are key to elucidating the mechanisms through which biological diversity generates services to humanity. This monitoring gap can be traced to the current lack of consensus on what exactly ecosystem functions are and how to track them at scales beyond the site level. This contribution aims to advance the development of a global biodiversity monitoring strategy by proposing the adoption of a set of definitions and a typology for ecosystem functions, and reviewing current opportunities and potential limitations for satellite remote sensing technology to support the monitoring of ecosystem functions worldwide. By clearly defining ecosystem processes, functions and services and their interrelationships, we provide a framework to improve communication between ecologists, land and marine managers, remote sensing specialists and policy makers, thereby addressing a major barrier in the field.

TI  - Deriving daily water levels from satellite altimetry and land surface temperature for sparsely gauged catchments: A case study for the Mekong River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Space borne radar altimeters often complement in-situ water levels to provide greater insights to hydrodynamic models in sparsely gauged catchments. However, 10-day or 35-day water levels derived from satellite radar altimetry are generally too infrequent for flood forecasting or hydrodynamic modelling purposes. This paper proposes a new approach to find daily water levels for areas where in-situ river heights are not available. The new approach is based on the relationship between river height and difference between daytime and night time land surface temperatures (LST). This relationship is first demonstrated using in-situ gauge data to explore appropriate statistical models to predict river height using LST differences. The approach is then applied to a number of virtual stations at the intersections between the Mekong River and the ground-tracks of Jason-2 satellite altimetry which gives 10-day water level time series.The LST difference from the thermal infrared (TIR) observations of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is shown to have a strong relationship with in-situ water levels and a good relationship with the Jason-2 water levels. The models included a simple linear regression model which was then extended to firstly include seasonal terms and secondly assimilate satellite altimetry data. A regression model tree (M5) was also considered but was found to be inferior to the seasonal linear model. The developed regression models were used to predict daily water levels to infill the 10-day Jason-2 altimeters. RMSE of modelled daily water levels at gauges is between 0.3 m to 0.6 m, while RMSE of modelled daily water levels without using in-situ data is higher varying from 1.4 m to 1.9 m. The temporal correlation between the modelled water levels using satellite altimeters at virtual stations and in-situ water levels at adjacent gauges ranged from 0.72 to 0.86. These results show the potential of the proposed approach to produce high temporal resolution water levels for flood models or other applications using only remotely sensed data.

TI  - HidroMap: A New Tool for Irrigation Monitoring and Management Using Free Satellite Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Proper control and planning of water resource use, especially in those catchments with large surface, climatic variability and intensive irrigation activity, is essential for a sustainable water management. Decision support systems based on useful tools involving main stakeholders and hydrological planning offices of the river basins play a key role. The free availability of Earth observation products with high temporal resolution, such as the European Sentinel-2B, has allowed us to combine remote sensing with cadastral and agronomic data. This paper introduces HidroMap to the scientific community, an open source tool as a geographic information system (GIS) organized in two different modules, desktop-GIS and web-GIS, with complementary functions and based on PostgreSQL/PostGIS database. Through an effective methodology HidroMap allows monitoring irrigation activity, managing unregulated irrigation, and optimizing available fluvial surveillance resources using satellite imagery. This is possible thanks to the automatic download, processing and storage of satellite products within field data provided by the River Surveillance Agency (RSA) and the Hydrological Planning Office (HPO). The tool was successfully validated in Duero Hydrographic Basin along the 2017 summer irrigation period. In conclusion, HidroMap comprised an important support tool for water management tasks and decision making tackled by Duero Hydrographic Confederation which can be adapted to any additional need and transferred to other river basin organizations.

TI  - An Enhanced Linear Spatio-Temporal Fusion Method for Blending Landsat and MODIS Data to Synthesize Landsat-Like Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat and MODIS data have been widely utilized in many remote sensing applications, however, the trade-off between the spatial resolution and temporal frequency has limited their capacities in monitoring detailed spatio-temporal dynamics. Spatio-temporal fusion methods based on a linear model that considers the differences between fine- and coarse-spatial-resolution images as linear can effectively solve this trade-off problem, yet the existing linear fusion methods either regard the coefficients of the linear model as constants or have adopted regression methods to calculate the coefficients, both of which may introduce some errors in the fusion process. In this paper, we proposed an enhanced linear spatio-temporal fusion method (ELSTFM) to improve the data fusion accuracy. In the ELSTFM, it is not necessary to calculate the slope of the linear model, and the intercept, which can be deemed as the residual caused by systematic biases, is calculated based on spectral unmixing theory. Additionally, spectrally similar pixels in a given fine-spatial-resolution pixel's neighborhood and their corresponding weights were used in the proposed method to mitigate block effects. Landsat-7/ETM+ and 8-day composite MODIS reflectance data covering two study sites with heterogeneous and homogenous landscapes were selected to validate the proposed method. Compared to three other typical spatio-temporal fusion methods visually and quantitatively, the predicted images obtained from ELSTFM could acquire better results for the two selected study sites. Furthermore, the resampling methods used to resample MODIS to the same spatial resolution of Landsat could slightly, but did not significantly influence the fusion accuracy, and the distributions of slopes of different bands for the two study sites could all be deemed as normal distributions with a mean value close to 1. The performance of ELSTFM depends on the accuracy of residual calculation at fine-resolution and large landscape changes may influence the fusion accuracy.

TI  - Biogeochemical patterns and microbial processes in the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water of Ionian Sea
T2  - HYDROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Microbial processes involved in water biogeochemistry are linked to physical and chemical variability of water masses. While the occurrence of hydrological changes in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea has been documented, its effects on microbial dynamics and processes have been poorly investigated. An interdisciplinary survey was carried out in November 2011 to depict recent scenarios in the Ionian Mediterranean Sea. This study provides a snapshot of the hydrology and biogeochemistry of this basin, with particular emphasis on the abyssal waters, where two cores of the Eastern Mediterranean Deep Water, both of Adriatic origin, were found. The first core, located at about 3000 m, overlies the second one, which has a recent origin. Both water masses have Adriatic origin and the upper one is older than the lower one. A novel approach has been adopted to relate changes in microbial abundance and metabolism to new thermohaline and biogeochemical findings. A close relationship between surface processes driven by air-sea interaction, microbial variables, physical and chemical parameters (nutrients, dissolved organic carbon and oxygen) was observed. Being intimately coupled to DOC patterns, the microbial respiratory activity was likely the most responsive microbial parameter to hydrological changes, confirming this variable as a sentinel of environmental changes.

TI  - Semantics of the cemetery chronotope in the novel "Laurus" by E. Vodolazkin
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The cemetery chronotope is considered for the first time in the space-time structure of the novel "Laurus" written by E. Vodolazkin. The cemetery chronotope represents one of the main chronotopes in the novel "Laurus". The cemetery culture constitutes the core of the socio-cultural code of any nation. Hence, the author depicts a significant part of the nation's worldview by using the chronotope concerned. The paper analyses two forms of the cemetery chronotope presented in the novel "Laurus" - the cemetery and skudelnitsa. The description of their semantics is given: the integration of space structure, relevant characteristics and associative valency. For example, time at the cemetery is sacralized, the cemetery possesses a mnemonic function and is considered to be a space allowing living and dead people to contact with each other. In the novel, the village cemetery does not have any other description but silence. The silence characterizes the time spent at the cemetery as sacral, as one correlated to eternity and opposed to everyday's life. This time is uneventful. There are only three episodes taking place partially in the cemetery: reading the favourite book, the old teacher's funeral, the appearance of beloved Ustina. All three events are fateful for the main character. The mnemonic function of the cemetery in the novel differs from the modern one: the cemetery is anonymized - there is neither oral nor written speech (inscriptions on the tombstones). It is the mnemonic function that reflects the cultural code of medieval Russia, the attitude to God and the dead. The time in the novel possesses the category of perspective: some characters can see the future in their visions. The spacial structure of the cemetery correlating with the threshold chronotope and taking the mediatory semantics reflects the concept of the border. Another form of the cemetery chronotope is skudelnitsa, which is a burial place for suicides, unbaptized people and those who died a violent death. It differs from the cemetery in the following: skudelnitsa does not have any sacral function, it is not just an other-worldly space, but also a hostile one to the people alive; in addition to this it does not have any mnemonic function this place is not meant to be visited. The novel highlights that the semantics of cemetery and skudelnitsa has not an archetypical but a contextual opposition: burial without a Christian rite is considered illegal. The main character resolves this conflict by deliberately choosing the burial method and giving skudelnitsa the status of the martyr's burial place. The contextual opposition of the cemetery chronotope forms is found to underlie the narrative structure of the novel.

TI  - Fluorescence-guided surgery and intervention - An AAPM emerging technology blue paper
T2  - MEDICAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) and other interventions are rapidly evolving as a class of technologically driven interventional approaches in which many surgical specialties visualize fluorescent molecular tracers or biomarkers through associated cameras or oculars to guide clinical decisions on pathological lesion detection and excision/ablation. The technology has been commercialized for some specific applications, but also presents technical challenges unique to optical imaging that could confound the utility of some interventional procedures where real-time decisions must be made. Accordingly, the AAPM has initiated the publication of this Blue Paper of The Emerging Technology Working Group (TETAWG) and the creation of a Task Group from the Therapy Physics Committee within the Treatment Delivery Subcommittee. In describing the relevant issues, this document outlines the key parameters, stakeholders, impacts, and outcomes of clinical FGS technology and its applications. The presentation is not intended to be conclusive, but rather to inform the field of medical physics and stimulate the discussions needed in the field with respect to a seemingly low-risk imaging technology that has high potential for significant therapeutic impact. This AAPM Task Group is working toward consensus around guidelines and standards for advancing the field safely and effectively. (c) 2018 American Association of Physicists in Medicine

TI  - Responses to Systemic Nitrogen Signaling in Arabidopsis Roots Involve <i>trans</i>-Zeatin in Shoots
T2  - PLANT CELL
M3  - Article
AB  - Plants face temporal and spatial variation in nitrogen (N) availability. This includes heterogeneity in soil nitrate (NO3-) content. To overcome these constraints, plants modify their gene expression and physiological processes to optimize N acquisition. This plasticity relies on a complex long-distance root-shoot-root signaling network that remains poorly understood. We previously showed that cytokinin (CK) biosynthesis is required to trigger systemic N signaling. Here, we performed split-root experiments and used a combination of CK-related mutant analyses, hormone profiling, transcriptomic analysis, NO3- uptake assays, and root growth measurements to gain insight into systemic N signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana. By comparing wild-type plants and mutants affected in CK biosynthesis and ABCG14-dependent root-to-shoot translocation of CK, we revealed an important role for active trans-zeatin (tZ) in systemic N signaling. Both rapid sentinel gene regulation and long-term functional acclimation to heterogeneous NO3- supply, including NO3- transport and root growth regulation, are likely mediated by the integration of tZ content in shoots. Furthermore, shoot transcriptome profiling revealed that glutamate/glutamine metabolism is likely a target of tZ root-to-shoot translocation, prompting an interesting hypothesis regarding shoot-to-root communication. Finally, this study highlights tZ-independent pathways regulating gene expression in shoots as well as NO3-uptake activity in response to total N deprivation.

TI  - Identifying optimal remotely-sensed variables for ecosystem monitoring in Colorado Plateau drylands
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-limited ecosystems often recover slowly following anthropogenic or natural disturbance. Multitemporal remote sensing can be used to monitor ecosystem recovery after disturbance; however, dryland vegetation cover can be challenging to accurately measure due to sparse cover and spectral confusion between soils and non-photosynthetic vegetation. With the goal of optimizing a monitoring approach for identifying both abrupt and gradual vegetation changes, we evaluated the ability of Landsat-derived spectral variables to characterize surface variability of vegetation cover and bare ground across a range of vegetation community types. Using three year composites of Landsat data, we modeled relationships between spectral information and field data collected at monitoring sites near Canyonlands National Park, UT. We also developed multiple regression models to assess improvement over single variables. We found that for all vegetation types, percent cover bare ground could be accurately modeled with single indices that included a combination of red and shortwave infrared bands, while near infrared-based vegetation indices like NDVI worked best for quantifying tree cover and total live vegetation cover in woodlands. We applied four models to characterize the spatial distribution of putative grassland ecological states across our study area, illustrating how this approach can be implemented to guide dryland ecosystem management.

TI  - From tropical shelters to temperate defaunation: The relationship between agricultural transition stage and the distribution of threatened mammals
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Agriculture is a key threat to biodiversity; however, its relationship with biodiversity patterns is understudied. Here, we evaluate how the extent, intensity and history of croplands relate to the global distribution of threatened mammals. We propose two hypotheses to explain these relationships: shelter, which predicts that threatened species concentrate in areas with low human land use; and threat, according to which threatened species should concentrate in areas of high human land use.Location: Global.Time period: c. 6000 BC - AD 2014.Major taxa studied: Terrestrial mammals.Methods: We used boosted regression trees (BRT) that include spatial autocorrelation to investigate the relationship between the proportion of threatened terrestrial mammals [as defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List] and multiple metrics describing agricultural extent, intensity and history derived from remote sensing data and statistical projections. Data were analysed with a grain size of c.110kmx110 km at both global and biogeographical-realm scales.Results: Agricultural extent and intensity were the most relevant indicator types, with specific metrics important for each realm. Forest cover (extent) was identified as important in several regions. Tropical regions in early agricultural transition stages (e.g. frontier landscapes) were consistent with the shelter hypothesis, whereas patterns found for regions in later stages (e.g. intensified agricultural landscapes) were mostly found in temperate regions and agreed with the threat hypothesis.Main conclusions: These results highlight the need to consider multiple land-use indicators when addressing threats to biodiversity and to separately assess areas with divergent human and ecological histories in global-scale studies. Different relationships associated with different agricultural transition stages suggest that high concentrations of threatened species may have contrasting meanings in different regions worldwide. We propose a new unifying hypothesis following a cyclic relationship along agricultural transition stages resulting in alternating negative and positive relationships between agriculture and threatened species richness.

TI  - Legal Ideas Of Mastering Humanism By A Person And Society: Toward Modern Russian Legal Humanism
T2  - MODERN JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE TEACHING METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Goal. To overcome person's alienation from the forms of activities in law, to embody the ideas of legal humanism in the Russian legal system. The meaning of the idea is to "humanize" a legal system and to create a legal system focused on a person, his rights, and freedoms.Methods. The author uses a method of material dialectics, analysis and synthesis, deduction and induction to address the issue. The methods have enabled to make a necessary analysis and come to logical generalizations. Analysis enables to conclude that a person is alienated from the forms of activities in law: he is alienated from his own legal awareness, legal will, and legal interest. Synthesis justifies the category of legal mastering to overcome person's alienation from the forms of activities in law and to embody the ideas of legal humanism in the Russian legal system. Deduction implies that we should change the ratio of the "law" and "person" notions and elevate a person in a legal system to embody the ideas of legal humanism. Legal ideas of mastering humanism by a person and society provide the elaboration of the issue of modern legal humanism. Humanization (spiritualization and transformation for the benefit) of a legal system is formed as a gradual change of the ratio of "law" and "person" notions. Induction recreates the category of legal mastering as rational-critical, intellectual, and law-cognizing activities to overcome person's alienation from the forms of activities in law and to embody the ideas of legal humanism in a legal system. It treats a person as a particular individual homo juridicus capable of identifying himself and admitting his own human originality. A person becomes like this when he acquires a right for himself, his corporeality, and spirituality not only through the attribute of power, property, and right, but also through other phenomena: morality, diligence, justice, virtue etc.Result. Legal mastering expresses the activities of a law-cognizing intellectual-volitional actor (homo juridicus) who is able to become aware of legal being and strives for the freedom of will as a moral virtue - the realization of legal humanism in the Russian legal system.Discussion. The reference to legal humanism as a perspective of development of the theory of law is associated with natural human rights and freedoms already implemented in a legal system, legal awareness, and a civil society. S.S. Alekseev assumes that a stronger focus on panhuman values and humanitarian foundations in our worldview in modern condition coincided with an actually growing role of law in social life(1).

AB  - This letter presents a method of automatic detection of subsidence troughs in the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferograms. Construction of such an algorithm is motivated by the very large amount of freely available SAR imagery from Sentinel mission. The proposed method is based on the convolution of the SAR interferogram with a bank of circular wavelets. Spatial locations with high values of the convolved images correspond to centers of troughs. The method has been tested on differential interferograms generated based on Sentinel-1 SAR images. The detection rate varies from 30% to 53% with a relatively low number of false alarms.

TI  - Regional geology mapping using satellite-based remote sensing approach in Northern Victoria Land, Antarctica
T2  - POLAR SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing imagery is especially useful for geological investigations in Antarctica because of its remoteness and extreme environmental conditions that constrain direct geological survey. The highest percentage of exposed rocks and soils in Antarctica occurs in Northern Victoria Land (NVL). Exposed Rocks in NVL were part of the paleo-Pacific margin of East Gondwana during the Paleozoic time. This investigation provides a satellite-based remote sensing approach for regional geological mapping in the NVL, Antarctica. Landsat-8 and the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) datasets were used to extract lithological-structural and mineralogical information. Several spectral-band ratio indices were developed using Landsat-8 and ASTER bands and proposed for Antarctic environments to map spectral signatures of snow/ice, iron oxide/hydroxide minerals, Al-OH-bearing and Fe, Mg-OH and CO3 mineral zones, and quartz-rich felsic and mafic-to-ultramafic lithological units. The spectral-band ratio indices were tested and implemented to Level 1 terrain-corrected (L1T) products of Landsat-8 and ASTER datasets covering the NVL. The surface distribution of the mineral assemblages was mapped using the spectral-band ratio indices and verified by geological expeditions and laboratory analysis. Resultant image maps derived from spectral-band ratio indices that developed in this study are fairly accurate and correspond well with existing geological maps of the NVL. The spectral-band ratio indices developed in this study are especially useful for geological investigations in inaccessible locations and poorly exposed lithological units in Antarctica environments.

TI  - Predictive power of remote sensing versus temperature-derived variables in modelling phenology of herbivorous insects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Application of remote sensing datasets in modelling phenology of heterotrophic animals has received little attention. In this work, we compare the predictive power of remote sensing versus temperature-derived variables in modelling peak flight periods of herbivorous insects, as exemplified by nocturnal moths. Moth phenology observations consisted of weekly observations of five focal moth species (Orthosia gothica, Ectropis crepuscularia, Cabera exanthemata, Dysstroma citrata and Operophtera brumata) gathered in a national moth monitoring scheme in Finland. These species were common and widespread and had peak flight periods in different seasons. Temperature-derived data were represented by weekly accumulating growing degree days (GDD) calculated from gridded temperature observations. Remote sensing data were obtained from three sources: (1) snow melt-off date from the MODIS daily snow maps, (2) greening date using the NDWI from MODIS data and (3) dates of start, maximum and end of growing season based on the JRC FAPAR products. Peak phenology observations of moths were related to different explanatory variables by using linear mixed effect models (LMM), with 70% of the data randomly selected for model calibration. Predictive power of models was tested using the remaining 30% of the data. Remote sensing data (snow melt-off and vegetation greening date) showed the highest predictive power in two moth species flying in the early and late spring, whereas in the three other species none of the variables showed reasonable predictive power. Flight period of the spring species coincides with natural events such as snow melt or vegetation greening that can easily be observed using remote sensing techniques. We demonstrate the applicability of our methodology by predictive spatial maps of peak flight phenology covering the entire Finland for two of the focal species. The methods are applicable insituations that require spatial predictions of animal activity, such as the management of populations of insect pest species.

TI  - Recent Trends in Local-Regional Recurrence Rates: Implications for Therapeutic Intervention
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review Local and regional recurrences pose a significant therapeutic challenge in the field of breast cancer. Unfortunately, between 5 and 10% of patients will have this form of recurrences. This article seeks to review recent declines in locoregional recurrence risk and discuss the potential implications for the extent of therapeutic intervention currently implemented and how this may change in the future.Recent Findings Recurrence rates have significantly decreased in recent times. Additionally, the vast amount of clinical research in the field of breast cancer allows for guidelines and traditional treatments to be updated and revamped as novel information is discovered. Patients who had neoadjuvant chemotherapy have been shown to experience a higher rate of recurrence in comparison with patients that had adjuvant chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is now recommended for patients with one to three positive lymph nodes. Axillary resections have been shown to provide no benefits to patients undergoing radiotherapy.Summary Local and regional recurrence rates are decreasing lately both due to improvements in various therapeutic interventions and in implementation of breast cancer screening so that cancers may be caught earlier. Due to declines in local recurrence risk, it may be reasonable to scale back surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radio-therapeutic interventions.

TI  - Trends of absorption, scattering and total aerosol optical depths over India and surrounding oceanic regions from satellite observations: role of local production, transport and atmospheric dynamics
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study examines trends of scattering, absorption and total aerosol optical depths (SAOD, AAOD and AOD) over India and surrounding oceanic regions and explores role of local production, long-range transport and atmospheric dynamics on observed trends. Long-term satellite observations are used to estimate trends and assess their statistical significance. Significant spatial and seasonal changes are observed in trends of SAOD, AAOD and AOD. AOD is observed to be increasing during post monsoon and winter over most of the land mass and surrounding oceanic regions, whereas decreasing trends over land and increasing trends over oceanic regions are observed in pre-monsoon and summer months. In general, SAOD and AAOD show similar trends (if there is any) as that of AOD over most of the regions in most of the months. Strongest positive trends over land regions are observed in November with trend of AOD greater than 0.01 year(-1), especially over Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP). Increase of AOD over IGP in post monsoon is contributed significantly by absorbing aerosols with rate of increase similar to 0.005 AAOD year(-1). AAODs are observed to be increasing over Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal (BoB) in December also, with rate similar to 0.003 AAOD year(-1). Strongest positive trends over Arabian Sea and BoB are observed in June with rate of increase greater than 0.02 AOD year(-1), whereas strong negative trends are observed over north-west India in the same period with rate of decrease greater than 0.02 AOD year(-1). Over IGP, AOD, AAOD and SAOD show contrasting trends in winter and summer seasons. AAOD exhibits strongest decreasing trend over IGP during April-June. Positive trends of AOD over Arabian Sea and BoB are favoured significantly by changes in circulation dynamics. Atmospheric convergence is observed to be strengthening over these regions in April and June, leading to more accumulation and hence positive trends of AOD. Aerosol transport over to the Arabian Sea is observed to be enhancing and contributing significantly to AOD increase over the Arabian Sea in pre-monsoon and summer months. Enhancement in aerosol transport over to the Arabian Sea is observed in pre-monsoon at higher altitudes above 3 km, whereas it is observed in summer at lower levels. However, decreasing trends of AOD over north-west India and IGP during pre-monsoon and summer are observed to be due to decrease in aerosol transport from the continental regions at the west.

TI  - Does the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed affect the false negative rate for head and neck melanoma?
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and ObjectivesHead and neck (HN) cutaneous melanoma is associated with worse disease-free survival compared to non-HN cutaneous melanoma, possibly due to inadequate staging. We aim to determine if a higher yield of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) affected rates of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) positivity.MethodsTwo Cancer Registries were used to identify patients who underwent SLNB for HN melanoma. A false negative (FN) was defined by nodal recurrence after negative SLNB.ResultsOut of 333 patients who underwent SLNB, 20% (n=69) had a positive SLN with a FN rate of 6.3%. Those with three or more SLNs had a higher rate of SLN positivity (23.8% [17.5-29.9% CI] vs 16.4% [10.7-23.6% CI]), a lower FN rate (16.7% [10.2-21.2% CI] vs 35.3% [27.1-42.9% CI]), and higher sensitivity (83.3% [82.59-84.09% CI] vs 65.7% [64.87-66.53% CI]) compared to those with one or two SLNs. Of patients in Group 1 (one or two SLNs) with a positive SLN who underwent completion lymph node dissection (20/23), 47% (33-61% CI) had one or more positive non-sentinel nodes compared to 29% (16-51%) of patients in Group 2 (three or more SLNs) (42/46).ConclusionIn HN melanoma cases in which multiple nodes are identified, removal of all SLNs will more adequately stage patients.

TI  - Clinical significance of internal mammary lymph node metastasis for breast cancer: Analysis of 337 breast cancer patients
T2  - SURGICAL ONCOLOGY-OXFORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Internal mammary nodes (IMNs) is a major pathway of lymphatic drainage for breast cancer, apart from axillary lymph node (ALN). However, owing to lack of a feasible and safe biopsy method, management of IMNs is still controversial in breast surgery.Methods: From 2005 to 2009, a total of 337 consecutive breast cancer women patients were recruited. All patients underwent IMNs biopsy through intercostal space or endoscopic lymphatic chain resection. The ER, PR and HER-2 status were retested according to the current ASCO/CAP guidelines. We analyzed the relationship between clinical pathological parameters and IMNs metastasis and investigated the high risk factors and prognostic values of IMNs metastasis in breast cancer.Results: Among 337 patients, 314 patients underwent intercostal space IMNs biopsy and 23 patients underwent endoscopic lymphatic chain resection. A total of 63 (18.69%) patients were pathologically diagnosed with IMNs metastasis. Among them, 28 (44.44%) patients changed the pathological lymph node staging, and 15 cases (23.81%) changed the postoperative comprehensive treatment program and accepted extended postoperative radiotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that compared with no ALN involvement, the risk of IMNs metastasis was significantly increased in patients with 1-3 ALN involvement (OR = 42.097, 95% CI = 5.225-339.178; P = 0.0004) and >4 ALN involvement (OR = 82.429, 95%CI = 10.134-670.496; P <0.0001). The risk of IMNs metastasis in HER-2 positive patients was significantly higher than that in negative patients (OR = 5.452, 95% CI = 2.353-12.634; P< 0.0001). However, we did not find IMNs involvement was an independent indicator for both overall survival and disease-free survival.Conclusions: Our clinical practice and data indicated that IMNs biopsy through intercostal space and endoscopic lymphatic chain resection are effective and minimally invasive methods to detect the IMNs status, which may be helpful for accurate tumor staging, risk assessment and option of chemotherapy or radiotherapy to improve the patients' survival.

TI  - 55-year (1960-2015) spatiotemporal shoreline change analysis using historical DISP and Landsat time series data in Shanghai
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline change has been an increasing concern for low-lying and vulnerable coastal zones worldwide, especially in estuarine delta regions, which generally have significant economic development, large human settlements and infrastructures. Thus, long time-series shoreline change data are useful for understanding how shorelines respond to natural and anthropogenic activities, as well as for providing greater insights into coastal protection and sustainable development in the future. For the first time, this study analyzes 55 years of spatiotemporal shoreline changes in Shanghai, China, by integrating the historical Declassified Intelligence Satellite Photography (DISP) and Landsat time series data at five-year intervals from 1960 to 2015. Twelve shorelines were interpreted from DISP and Landsat images. The spatiotemporal changes in the shorelines were explored at five-year intervals within the study period for the Shanghai mainland and islands. The results indicate that shorelines in Shanghai accreted significantly over the last 55 years, but different accretion patterns were observed in Chongming Dongtan. The rate of shoreline change varied in different areas, and the most noticeable expansions were Chongming Beitan, Chongming Dongtan, Hengsha Dongtan, and Nanhuizui. The length of the entire shoreline increased by 25.7% from 472.6 km in 1960 to 594.2 km in 2015. Due to the shoreline changes, the Shanghai area expanded by 1,192.5 km(2) by 2015, which was an increase of 19.9% relative to its 1960 area. The Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to compute rate-of-change statistics. Between 1960 and 2015, 10.6% of the total transects exceeded 3 km of Net Shoreline Movement (NSM), with a maximum value of approximately 20 km at eastern Hengsha Island. The average Weighted Linear Regression Rate (WLR) of the Shanghai shoreline was 52.2 m/yr from 1960 to 2015; there was 94.1% accretion, 3.1% erosion, and 2.8% with no significant change. In addition, the driving forces of the shoreline changes were also explored in detail. Compared with natural factors, such as relative Sea Level Rise (SLR) and the reduction in sediment loading from the Yangtze River, anthropogenic activities that include land reclamation and channel projects are the primary causes of the shoreline changes in Shanghai.

TI  - Mapping and Characterizing Thermal Dilation of Civil Infrastructures with Multi-Temporal X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature variation plays a significant role in the long-term structural behaviour of civil infrastructures, but very few quantitative studies have measured and analysed the infrastructures' global thermal dilation because of their large sizes and geometric complexities. The modern Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) technique has great potential in applications of their thermal dilation mapping and characterization due to the techniques' unique capabilities for use in large areas, with high-resolution, and at low-costs for deformation measurements. However, the practical application of DInSAR in thermal dilation estimation is limited by difficulty in the precise separation from the residual topographic phase and the trend deformation phase. Moreover, due to a lack of thermal dilation characteristics analyses in previous studies, the thermal dilation mechanisms are still unclear to users, which restricts the accurate understanding of the thermal dilation evolution process. Given the above challenges, an advanced multi-temporal DInSAR approach is proposed in this study, and the effectiveness of this approach was presented using three cases studies concerning different infrastructure types. In this method, the coherent, incoherent, and semantic information of structures were combined in order to refine the detection of point-like targets (PTs). Interferometric subsets with small temporal baselines and temperature differences were used for high-resolution topography estimation. A pre-analysis was adopted to determine the transmission direction, spatial pattern, and temporal variation of the thermal dilation. Then, both the traditional least squares estimation and our robust coherence-weighted least squares regression analysis were performed between the time series displacements and the corresponding temperatures to quantitatively estimate the thermal dilation model. The results were verified in terms of the estimated linear thermal dilation coefficient, which indicates the greater reliability of our method. Furthermore, the thermal dilation characteristics of different civil infrastructure types were analysed, which facilitates a greater understanding of the thermal dilation evolution process of civil infrastructures.

AB  - GOES-R satellite was successfully launched on November 19, 2016 with an Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on board. ABI is a new imager and provides more advanced capabilities for weather applications through more channels and higher temporal and spatial resolutions than the earlier GOES imagers. In this study, impacts from assimilating ABI brightness temperatures in NWP models on quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) are presented and compared with those from assimilating GOES-13/15 imager data. Cloudy and precipitation-affected brightness temperatures are removed in assimilation through using an infrared (IR) cloud algorithm in quality control. This quality control can be applied for ABI data both at day and at night. Assimilation of the ten ABI IR channels improves the 24-h forecast accuracy of both temperature and specific humidity fields when compared with radiosonde observations. It is also shown that the assimilation of ABI IR channels produces positive impacts on QPFs. The impacts of ABI data assimilation on QPFs are slightly larger than those from assimilation of GOES-13 and -15 imager observations.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Leaf Area Index from LiDAR Height Percentile Metrics and Comparison with MODIS Product in a Selectively Logged Tropical Forest Area in Eastern Amazonia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is an important parameter to describe the capacity of forests to intercept light and thus affects the microclimate and photosynthetic capacity of canopies. In general, tropical forests have a higher leaf area index and it is a challenge to estimate LAI in a forest with a very dense canopy. In this study, it is assumed that the traditional Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR)-derived fractional vegetation cover (fCover) has weak relationship with leaf area index in a dense forest. We propose a partial least squares (PLS) regression model using the height percentile metrics derived from airborne LiDAR data to estimate the LAI of a dense forest. Ground inventory and airborne LiDAR data collected in a selectively logged tropical forest area in Eastern Amazonia are used to map LAI from the plot level to the landscape scale. The results indicate that the fCover, derived from the first return or the last return, has no significant correlations with the ground-based LAI. The PLS model evaluated by the leave-one-out validation shows that the estimated LAI is significantly correlated with the ground-based LAI with an R-2 of 0.58 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.13. A data comparison indicates that the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) LAI underestimates the landscape-level LAI by about 22%. The MODIS quality control data show that in the selected tile, the cloud state is not the primary factor affecting the MODIS LAI performance; rather, the LAI from the main radiative transfer (RT) algorithm contributes much to the underestimation of the LAI in the tropical forest. In addition, the results show that the LiDAR-based LAI has a better response to the logging activities than the MODIS-based LAI, and that the leaf area reduction caused by logging is about 13%. In contrast, the MODIS-based LAI exhibits no apparent spatial correlation with the LiDAR-based LAI. It is suggested that the main algorithm of MODIS should be improved with regard to tropical forests. The significance of this study is the proposal of a framework to produce ground-based LAI using forest inventory data and determine the plot-level LAI at the airborne and satellite scale using LiDAR data.

TI  - Fatty acid composition, enzyme activities and metallothioneins in <i>Donax trunculus</i> (Mollusca, Bivalvia) from polluted and reference sites in the Gulf of Annaba (Algeria): Pattern of recovery during transplantation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The gulf of Annaba, the most important touristic and economic coastal zone located in Northeast Algeria, is contaminated by several pollutants from urban, agricultural, harbor and industrial activities. Elevated levels of heavy metals were detected in a locally prevalent edible mollusk Donax trunculus (Bivalvia, Donacidae) widely used as a sentinel species for the assessment of marine pollution. The present work aims to measure the difference between two localities, one being full of different pollutants (Sidi Salem) and the other being relatively clean (El Battah) and to evaluate the ability of D. trunculus to overcome the environmental stress during a transplantation experiment by a determination of fatty acid profile, the enzymes activities and the level of metallothioneins (MTs), a biomarker of metallic contamination. Adults of D. trunculus were collected at Sidi Salem (contaminated site) and transplanted into El Battah (reference site) for 21 days in cages (60 x 60 x 60 cm with a 2 mm mesh). Biochemical analyzes were conducted at different times (0, 7, 14 and 21 days). At 0-day experiment: the rate of the fatty acids, the enzymes activities and MT levels at the site of Sidi Salem (polluted site) were significantly different from those of El Battah. During the transplantation a gradual restoration of fatty acids rates, enzymes activities and MT levels was observed. At the end of the period of transplantation, the values are comparable to those of El Battah. A two-way ANOVA (time, site) on data revealed significant effects of time and site. Overally, D. trunculus is able to induce its detoxification system and to restore relatively rapidly the status of individuals from the reference site (El Battah). (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Negotiating the hierarchy: Social dominance orientation among women is associated with the endorsement of benevolent sexism
T2  - AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveWe examine how women high in social dominance orientation reconcile supporting a social system that seemingly disadvantages them. We propose that women high in social dominance orientation are more likely to adopt a benevolently sexist worldview.MethodThis paper contains data from two survey studies. Study 1 used data from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Survey (N=10,485) which is a study of social attitudes, personality, and health outcomes among New Zealanders. Measures of Social Dominance Orientation, as well as Hostile and Benevolent Sexism were included in Study 1. Study 2 consisted of data from a smaller sample of American females (N=269). In addition to the variables described above, we also measured the extent to which participants perceived the gender hierarchy to be legitimate and their perceived personal need for protection from men. Control variables included hostile sexism and demographic variables (participants' age, race, and socioeconomic status).ResultsResults revealed that social dominance orientation was a stronger predictor of benevolent sexism among women compared to men. Serial mediation analysis was then conducted in Study 2. Study 2 confirmed the hypothesised mechanism: Higher social dominance orientation was associated with perceptions that women's low status is legitimate which, in turn, was associated with higher perceived personal need for protection from men. This was then associated with the endorsement of a benevolently sexist worldview.ConclusionOur findings suggest that social dominance orientation might help to explain why some women endorse benevolent sexism.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in malignant melanoma of the head and neck
T2  - JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The aim of this retrospective study was to investigate sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with head and neck melanoma.Materials and methods: Patients who underwent SLNB between 2010 and 2016 were comprised. Epidemiological, radiological, and surgical data were collected and compared to histological findings. Patients who underwent primary complete lymph node dissection were excluded.Results: 74 patients underwent SLNB during this period. The most common tumor localizations were the cheek (20.4%) and ears (20.4%). Overall, 256 sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were detected and removed, most frequently in Robbins-levels IIA and IIB as well as in the surrounding of the parotid gland. 12.3% of the SLN showed a microscopic or macroscopic metastasis. In preoperative imaging all lymph nodes with macroscopic metastasis were described as suspect but only 4 of 11 lymph nodes with microscopic metastases were described as such.Conclusions: SLNB is an especially good procedure for the diagnosis of microscopically metastases as disease status is an important diagnostic and prognostic factor in early-stage melanoma patients. However, due to the complex lymphatic system in head and neck melanoma, a short follow-up interval is necessary in order to prevent delayed diagnosis of a nodal recurrence due to a false-negative SLN.

TI  - Detection of Annual Spruce Budworm Defoliation and Severity Classification Using Landsat Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spruce budworm (SBW) is the most destructive forest pest in eastern forests of North America. Mapping annual current-year SBW defoliation is challenging because of the large landscape scale of infestations, high temporal/spatial variability, and the short period of time when detection is possible. We used Landsat-5 and Landsat-MSS data to develop a method to detect and map SBW defoliation, which can be used as ancillary or alternative information for aerial sketch maps (ASMs). Results indicated that Landsat-5 data were capable of detecting and classifying SBW defoliation into three levels comparable to ASMs. For SBW defoliation classification, a combination of three vegetation indices, including normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), were found to provide the highest accuracy (non-defoliated: 77%, light defoliation: 60%, moderate defoliation: 52%, and severe defoliation: 77%) compared to using only NDMI (non-defoliated: 76%, light defoliation: 40%, moderate defoliation: 43%, and severe defoliation: 67%). Detection of historical SBW defoliation was possible using Landsat-MSS NDVI data, and the produced maps were used to complement coarse-resolution aerial sketch maps of the past outbreak. The method developed for Landsat-5 data can be used for current SBW outbreak mapping in North America using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. Overall, the work highlights the potential of moderate resolution optical remote sensing data to detect and classify fine-scale patterns in tree defoliation.

TI  - Sleep breathing disorders in adult: role of orthodontist
T2  - DENTAL CADMOS
M3  - Review
AB  - OBJECTIVESThe purpose of the following work is to provide the orthodontist with a series of updated evidence based recommendations and indications for the diagnosis and treatment of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in adults.MATERIALS AND METHODSA systematic analysis of the existing OSA literature in the adult was made using the PubMed database and using the following related keywords: sleep apnea AND oral appliance OR mandibular repositioning OR mandibular advancement OR Non-CPAP therapie NOT orthognatic surgery NOT osteotomy NOT children and with the following filters: article types (Clinical Trial, Guideline, Meta-Analysis), publication dates (10 years), languages (english). The analysis of the publications was limited to studies conducted on humans. The guidelines of the "Societa Italiana Medicina del Sonno Odontoiatrica" and the guidelines of the Italian Ministry of Health have been added to the selected publications.RESULTSSnoring is an inspirational noise that can originate from various anatomic sites, while obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is attributable to the collapse of the upper airways that results in partial (hypopnea) or complete obstruction (apnea) of the passage of air, resulting in a decrease in blood oxygenation. Untreated OSAs can cause very serious complications for the patient's health, increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and vehicular or working accidents.CONCLUSIONSGiven the complexity of the etiologic and pathophysiological factors of sleep disorders, diagnostic and therapeutic management requires a multidisciplinary approach. In these phases, the orthodontist plays an important role both as a "diagnostic sentinel" and in the management of the oral device, such as mandibular advancements.

TI  - Quantifying long-term changes in carbon stocks and forest structure from Amazon forest degradation
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite sustained declines in Amazon deforestation, forest degradation from logging and fire continues to threaten carbon stocks, habitat, and biodiversity in frontier forests along the Amazon arc of deforestation. Limited data on the magnitude of carbon losses and rates of carbon recovery following forest degradation have hindered carbon accounting efforts and contributed to incomplete national reporting to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+). We combined annual time series of Landsat imagery and high-density airborne lidar data to characterize the variability, magnitude, and persistence of Amazon forest degradation impacts on aboveground carbon density (ACD) and canopy structure. On average, degraded forests contained 45.1% of the carbon stocks in intact forests, and differences persisted even after 15 years of regrowth. In comparison to logging, understory fires resulted in the largest and longest-lasting differences in ACD. Heterogeneity in burned forest structure varied by fire severity and frequency. Forests with a history of one, two, and three or more fires retained only 54.4%, 25.2%, and 7.6% of intact ACD, respectively, when measured after a year of regrowth. Unlike the additive impact of successive fires, selective logging before burning did not explain additional variability in modeled ACD loss and recovery of burned forests. Airborne lidar also provides quantitative measures of habitat structure that can aid the estimation of co-benefits of avoided degradation. Notably, forest carbon stocks recovered faster than attributes of canopy structure that are critical for biodiversity in tropical forests, including the abundance of tall trees. We provide the first comprehensive look-up table of emissions factors for specific degradation pathways at standard reporting intervals in the Amazon. Estimated carbon loss and recovery trajectories provide an important foundation for assessing the long-term contributions from forest degradation to regional carbon cycling and advance our understanding of the current state of frontier forests.

TI  - Recent recession and potential future lake formation on Drang Drung glacier, Zanskar Himalaya, as assessed with earth observation data and glacier modelling
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the changes in the area, snout and proglacial lake formation for Drang Drung glacier located in Zanskar region of Jammu and Kashmir using earth observation data of 46 years from 1971 to 2017. In addition, ice thickness and formation of potential future lakes were modelled using a distributed model-GlabTop. Our analysis indicated that Drang Drung glacier shrunk by 13.84% from 1971 to 2017. Meteorological projections of temperature and precipitation over region were used to understand climatic changes over Drang Drung region. The snout of the glacier has retreated by 925 m since 1971 at the rate of 21.11 ma(-1). However, the snout retreat radically accelerated since 2014 at 60 ma(-1). Analysis of available satellite data suggested that the proglacial lake formed around 2014. The lake has expanded to 16.62 ha in 2017 amassing a water volume of 2.69 mi m(3) with a potential peak discharge of 2667 m(3) s(-1). Based on GlabTop simulation, the mean thickness of the glacier is 155 m with the highest thickness of 311 m. Climate projections indicate that the temperatures would rise by over 4 A degrees C by the end of this century with insignificant increase in precipitation. GlabTop simulations indicate formation of two huge lakes with areas of 97 and 47 ha in the lower ablation part of the glacier which could pose a risk to the incidence of glacial lake outburst flood in the near future.

TI  - Estimation of Net Rice Production through Improved CASA Model by Addition of Soil Suitability Constant ((h)over-barα)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary production (NPP) is an important indicator of the supply of food and wood. We used a hierarchy model and real time field observations to estimate NPP using satellite imagery. Net radiation received by rice crop canopies was estimated as 27,428 Wm(-2) (215.4 Wm(-2) as averaged) throughout the rice cultivation period (RCP), including 23,168 Wm(-2) (118.3 Wm(-2) as averaged) as shortwave and 4260 Wm(-2) (34.63 Wm(-2) as averaged) as longwave radiation. Soil, sensible and latent heat fluxes were approximated as 3324 Wm(-2), 16,549 Wm(-2), and 7554 Wm(-2), respectively. Water stress on rice crops varied between 0.5838 and 0.1218 from the start until the end of the RCP. Biomass generation declined from 6.09-1.03 g/m(2) in the tillering and ripening stages, respectively. We added a soil suitability constant () into the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model to achieve a more precise estimate of yield. Classification results suggest that the total area under rice cultivation was 8861 km(2). The spatial distribution of rice cultivation as per suitability zone was: 1674 km(2) was not suitable (NS), 592 km(2) was less suitable (LS), 2210 km(2) was moderately suitable (MS) and 4385 km(2) was highly suitable (HS) soil type with ranges of 0.05-0.25, 0.4-0.6, 0.7-0.75 and 0.85-0.95 of the CASA based yield, respectively. We estimated net production as 1.63 million tons, as per 0.46 ton/ha, 1.2 ton/ha 1.9 ton/ha and 2.4 ton/ha from NS, LS, MS and HS soil types, respectively. The results obtained through this improved CASA model, by addition of the constant , are likely to be useful for agronomists by providing more accurate estimates of NPP.

TI  - Drivers of spatial variability in greendown within an oak-hickory forest landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Declining near-infrared (NIR) surface reflectance between early and late summer, here termed greendown, is a common, yet poorly understood phenomena in remote sensing time series of temperate deciduous forests. As revealed by phenology analysis of Landsat satellite data, there are strong spatial patterns in the rate of green down across temperate deciduous forest landscapes, and analyzing these patterns could help advance our understanding of surface reflectance drivers. Within an oak-hickory (Quercus spp. - Carya spp.) forest landscape in western Maryland, USA, we tested how spatial patterns in greendown related to potential drivers at the landscape-, tree crown- and leaf-levels. We found that 50% of the spatial variability in greendown was explained by landscape variables, with greendown particularly higher in locations with higher maximum greenness, more southerly aspects, or locations with greater abundance of white oak (Quercus alba). The importance of species composition as a driver of greendown was supported at the tree crown level, where, relative to three other tree species, white oak exhibited the most consistent trend toward more vertical leaf angles later in the season. At the leaf level, NIR reflectance decreased in productive sites where %N increased, and delta C-13 decreased, through the season. However, among all sites, there were no consistent seasonal trends in foliar NIR reflectance, and we found no correlation among leaf-level NIR reflectance and satellite-observed greendown. Collectively, these results suggest that the spatial variability of greendown in this oak-hickory forest is most strongly controlled by an interaction of topographic and species compositional drivers operating at the landscape and tree crown levels. We found spatial analysis of greendown to be a useful approach to explore landscape-, tree crown-, and leaf-level controls on surface reflectance, and thereby help translate land surface phenology data into predictions of ecosystem structure and functioning.

TI  - Predictive mapping of soil-landscape relationships in the arid Southwest United States
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-scale geospatial and absolute variation of surface and near-surface soil physical and chemical properties can be mapped and quantified by coupling digital soil mapping techniques with high resolution remote sensing products. The goal of this research was to advance data-driven digital soil mapping techniques by developing an approach that can integrate multi-scale digital surface topography and reflectance-derived remote sensing products, and characterize multi-scale soil-landscape relations of Quaternary alluvial and eolian deposits. The study area spanned the arid landscape encompassed by the Barry M. Goldwater Range West (BMGRW), which is administered by the Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, in southwestern Arizona, USA. An iterative principal component analysis (iPCA) was implemented for LiDAR elevation- and Landsat ETM + -derived soil predictors, termed environmental covariates. Principal components that characterize > 95% of covariate space variability were then integrated and classified using an ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data) unsupervised technique. The classified map was further segmented into polygons based on a region growing algorithm, yielding multi scale maps of soil-landscape relations that were compared with maps of soil landforms identified from aerial photographs, satellite images and field observation. The approach identified and mapped the spatial variability of soil-landscape relationships in alluvial and eolian deposits and illustrated the applicability of coupling covariate selection and integration by iPCA, ISODATA classification of integrated data layers, and image segmentation for effective spatial prediction of soil landscape characteristics. The approach developed here is data driven, applicable for multi-scale mapping, allows incorporation of a wide variety of covariates, and maps spatially homogenous soil-landscape units that are necessary for hydrologic models, land and ecosystem management decisions, and hazard assessment.

TI  - Can sustainability auditing be indigenized?
T2  - AGRICULTURE AND HUMAN VALUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Although there are different approaches to sustainability auditing, those considered authoritative use scientific indicators and instruments to measure and predict the impact of organizational operations on socio-ecological systems. Such approaches are biased because they can only measure phenomena whose features lend themselves to quantification, control, and observation directly with the instruments produced by technology. This technocratic bias is a product of the mechanistic worldview, which presumes that all components of socio-ecological systems are identifiable, discrete, and material. In contrast to the mechanistic worldview, indigenous people use animist familial representations. In the case of New Zealand MAori a family tree (whakapapa) is used to represent socio-ecological systems. This is a flexible conception, which views socio-ecological systems as both composites made up of interlinking causally-connected parts but also as reciprocating systems that have intangible elements such as consciousness, emotion, and agency. The technocratic approach is ontologically incapable of incorporating intangible elements to such a degree we consider that it incompatible with animist approaches. It is not, however, epistemologically-incongruous for indigenous peoples because of the flexible hybridity of their worldview. This worldview provides a broad moral framework, which avoids discrediting subjectivity and reducing socio-ecological systems to only their instrumental value. Finally, we conclude that the indigenous approach has much to offer the field of sustainability auditing, given that it provides a moral framework, and insight into building assessment systems upon abductive reasoning.

TI  - Usefulness of Ct value in acute respiratory infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus A and B and influenza virus A (H1N1)pdm09, A (H3N2) and B
T2  - ENFERMEDADES INFECCIOSAS Y MICROBIOLOGIA CLINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Acute respiratory infections of viral cause are very frequent entities. The difficulty in evaluating the detection of a virus in these entities could be solved by determining the viral load.Methods: A prospective study on the mean Ct value (cycle threshold value) detected against RSV-A, RSV-B and influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, A (H3N2) and B viruses in patients of different origin and age was performed. Detection was performed using a commercial molecular amplification (RT-PCR) technique.Results: Different mean Ct values were detected for each virus. In RSV infections, no differences were observed between those caused by RSV-A or RSV-B in children. Depending on the patient's age, the only statistical significance was observed in those included in the 0-4 month groups for RSV-A and this group and the 5-12 months group for RSV-B (higher values). A lower viral load was detected in adult patients than in paediatric patients. In influenza infections, no statistical significance was observed in the mean values detected in patients from the Red Centinela (<< sentinel network >>, a Spanish network of doctors aimed at research and surveillance of diseases), those diagnosed in the adult emergency room or in hospital admissions. In the adult patients admitted to the ICU, only a slightly lower mean value was observed in those infected with influenza A (H1N1)pdm09, but without statistical significance. There were no patients admitted to the ICU with influenza B infection.Conclusion: The detection of viral load could be a good tool for the evaluation, monitoring and prognosis of acute viral respiratory infections. With the exception of those caused by RSV, no significant differences were observed in influenza infections except in younger paediatric patients.

TI  - Towards a Reproducible LULC Hierarchical Class Legend for Use in the Southwest of Para State, Brazil: A Comparison with Remote Sensing Data-Driven Hierarchies
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) classes defined by subjective criteria can diminish the significance of a study, hindering the reproducibility and the comparison of results with other studies. Having a standard legend for a given study area and objective could benefit a group of researchers focused on long-term or multidisciplinary studies in a given area, in the sense that they would be able to maintain class definition among different works, done by different teams. To allow for reproducibility, it is important that the classes in this legend are described using quantifiable elements of land cover, which can be measured on the ground, as is recommended by Land Cover Meta Language (LCML). The present study aims to propose LCML formalized hierarchical legends for LULC classes, focusing on the southwest of Para state, within the Brazilian Amazon. In order to illustrate the potential of these legends, a secondary objective of the current study is to analyze classification results using legends derived from a particular Remote Sensing dataset and compare these results with the classification obtained using the LCML hierarchical legend proposed. To perform this analysis, firstly, we proposed a conceptual class model based on existing classification systems for the upland Brazilian Amazon Biome. From this model, 16 LULC classes were described in LCML, using quantifiable and easily recognizable physiognomic characteristics of land cover classes measured on the lower Tapajos river, in Para state. These classes were grouped into legends with different levels of detail (number of classes), based on our model or on the image and clustering algorithms. All legends were used in supervised classification of a Landsat5/TM image. Results indicate that it is necessary to incorporate multi-temporal knowledge for class definition as well as the proposed thresholds (height and cover proportion of soil, litter, herbaceous vegetation, shrubs, and trees) in order to properly describe classes. However, the thresholds are useful to delimit classes that happen in a successive way. Classification results revealed that classes formed by the same elements of land cover with similar thresholds present high confusion. Additionally, classifications obtained using legends based on the class separability in a given Remote Sensing image tend to be more accurate but not always useful because they can hide or mix important classes. It was observed that the more generalized the legend (those with few details and number of classes), the more accurate the classifications results are for all types of legends.

TI  - Remote Monitoring of Expansion of Aquaculture Ponds Along Coastal Region of the Yellow River Delta from 1983 to 2015
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture ponds are one of the fastest-growing land use types in valuable and fertile coastal areas and have caused serious environmental problems. Quantitative assessment of the extent, spatial distribution, and dynamics of aquaculture ponds is of utmost importance for sustainable economic development and scientific management of land and water resources in the coastal area. An object-oriented classification approach was applied to Landsat images acquired over three decades to investigate the long-term change of aquaculture ponds in the coastal region of the Yellow River Delta. The results indicated that the aquaculture ponds in the study area undergone a sharp expansion from 40.38 km(2) in 1983 to 1406.89 km(2) in 2015, and the fast expansion occurred during the period of 2010-2015 and 1990-2000. Natural wetlands, especially mudflat, and cropland were main land use types contributing to the increase of aquaculture ponds. The patches of aquaculture ponds were consequently prevalence in the north of the Yellow River Estuary and landscape metrics indicated an increase of the aquaculture ponds of the study area in the quantity and complexity. The expansion of aquaculture ponds inevitably had negative effects on the coastal environment, including loss of natural wetlands, water pollution and land subsidence, etc. The results from this study provide baseline data and valuable information for efficiently planning and managing aquaculture practices and for effectively implementing adequate regulations and protection measures.

TI  - Remote observation of water clarity patterns in Three Gorges Reservoir and Dongting Lake of China and their probable linkage to the Three Gorges Dam based on Landsat 8 imagery
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Secchi disk depth (ZsD) plays a critical role in describing water clarity. Several studies have shown linkages between Three Gorges Dam (TGD) and the downstream lacustrine ecosystem in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin. However, the potential influence on the Zsr, fluctuation in the entire anthropogenic reservoirs of Three Gorges (ER) and Dongting Lake (DTL) has not been reported, possibly due to technical obstacles in obtaining statistically significant spatial and temporal results. We addressed this challenge by using remote sensing technology: the Landsat S Operational Land Imager (OLI) We proposed a new, robust remote-sensing algorithm to estimate Zsr, from OLI imagery using red and green band-ratio, leading to MAPE of 21.68% and RMSE of 0.076 m for Z50 ranging from 0.1 m to 1.05 nt After satisfactory image-based validation, the algorithm was implemented on OLI data to derive Z(sD) patterns over ER and DTL from 2013 to 2017. Several crucial findings can be drawn: 1) Spatial-temporal patterns of Z(sD) exhibited notable fluctuations over both ER and DTL, and they also demonstrated a significant correlation with each other because of the opposite temporal cycle of Zs0 fluctuations between ER and DTL; 2) Temporally, monthly fluctuations of Z50 between ER and DTL had opposite temporal cycles, which was mainly attributed to the surface runoff and sediment discharge driven by the outbound runoff variations of TGD. Spatially, the heterogeneity of the Z(sD) pattern in ER might have resulted from the different geographical regions being divided by large anthropologic hydrological facilities, such as TGD; 3) The relationship between ZsD and total suspended matter (TSM) showed a significant negative correlation, as did the relationship between ZsD and Kd(490). These findings demonstrate that TSM often plays a principal role in light attenuation of extremely turbid inland waters; 4) An inversed phenomenon of water clarity was observed at the intersection of DTL and the Yangtze River around Chenglingji site (YRAC), which was due to the opposite temporal cycle of ZsD fluctuations between DTL and ER after the impoundment of TGD; and 5) Owing to the analysis of noise-equivalent Z(sD), OLI data can be used to derive Z(sD), since the imagery uncertainty is 0.07 m by means of our band-ratio algorithm, which demonstrates similar results to MODIS. The proposed 40-derived algorithm in this study could be suitable for other turbid lakes or reservoirs to formulate related strategies of water quality management in the middle and lower Yangtze River basin, and the unveiled findings here improve our understanding of ZsD spatiotemporal fluctuations in large river-connected lakes, such as Poyang Lake.

TI  - Assessment of ecosystem functioning from space: Advancements in the Habitats Directive implementation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Habitats Directive (HD) and the Natura 2000 network establish a common framework for maintaining European natural habitats in a favourable conservation status and represent the main instrument used by conservation decision makers in the European Union. Habitat conservation status depends on the sum of the influences acting upon the habitat and its typical species that may affect its long-term natural distribution, structure and functions. Thus, ecosystem functioning is influenced by the diversity, number and functional traits of the species occurring in a habitat. Although the HD establishes that representative species should be selected to reflect favourable structure and functioning of the habitat type, it would not be realistic to associate species with all aspects of structure and functioning given the variability of Annex I habitats. This constraint led us to seek new approaches that allow a more direct assessment of the ecosystem functioning for natural habitats in space and time. We propose a remote sensing-based approach to characterize and assess the ecosystem functioning of habitats. As a case study, we applied our approach to three Mediterranean natural habitat types from the Iberian Peninsula included in Annex I of the Habitats Directive, i.e., Mediterranean sclerophyllous forest, Mediterranean deciduous forest and Sub-Mediterranean and temperate scrub. First, we estimated two key descriptors of ecosystem functioning derived from the Enhanced Vegetation Index and related them to primary production dynamics by using satellite images captured by the MODIS sensor for each year between 2001 and 2012. Second, we arranged these functional descriptors in two-dimensional space and calculated the distances from the habitats assessed to the reference sites, i.e., habitat patches that showed an optimal conservation status of composition and structure. Then, the distances were averaged over the period, and the habitats were categorized according to their mean distances as favourable or unfavourable-inadequate or unfavourable-bad, as outlined in the reporting guidelines under Article 17 of the Directive. Our approach provides new procedures to assess ecosystem functions across space and time, while complying with reporting obligations derived from the HD.

TI  - Distribution and Prevalence of <i>Myxobolus cerebralis</i> in Postfire Areas of Plumas National Forest: Utility of Environmental DNA Sampling
T2  - JOURNAL OF AQUATIC ANIMAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Myxobolus cerebralis is a myxozoan parasite and the etiological agent of whirling disease in salmonids. The parasite's life cycle involves waterborne spores and requires both a salmonid fish and the benthic freshwater oligochaete worm Tubifex tubifex (Oligochaeta: Tubificidae). Wildfires can lead to the erosion of fine sediments into stream channels and have been implicated as promoting environmental conditions that are suitable for the survival and success of T. tubifex, whose presence in turn can affect the prevalence of M. cerebralis. Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) has the potential to be a powerful tool for evaluating the presence of microorganisms, for which direct observation is impossible. We investigated the presence of M. cerebralis eDNA in river water and river sediment samples collected from areas affected by recent fire activity in Plumas National Forest, California. We compared eDNA loads in the environment to M. cerebralis infection in T. tubifex and sentinel-exposed Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and the presence of T. tubifex lineages in the same environment. For the latter, we developed a multiplex quantitative PCR assay for detection of T. tubifex lineages I, III, and V. Lineage III T. tubifex and M. cerebralis (eDNA as well as DNA extracted from fish and worm tissues) were detected only in samples obtained from areas affected by the Moonlight wildfire. The association between M. cerebralis infection in sentinel-exposed fish and eDNA detection in environmental samples only approached significance at a P-value of 0.056. However, given the difference in relative effort between the two sampling methods (host versus nonhost environment), our data suggest that eDNA sampling of water and substrate is a promising approach for surveillance of myxozoan fish parasites.

TI  - A Multisensor Approach to Global Retrievals of Land Surface Albedo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based retrievals offer the most cost-effective way to comprehensively map the surface albedo of the Earth, a key variable for understanding the dynamics of radiative energy interactions in the atmosphere-surface system. Surface albedo retrievals have commonly been designed separately for each different spaceborne optical imager. Here, we introduce a novel type of processing framework that combines the data from two polar-orbiting optical imager families, the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The goal of the paper is to demonstrate that multisensor albedo retrievals can provide a significant reduction in the sampling time required for a robust and comprehensive surface albedo retrieval, without a major degradation in retrieval accuracy, as compared to state-of-the-art single-sensor retrievals. We evaluated the multisensor retrievals against reference in situ albedo measurements and compare them with existing datasets. The results show that global land surface albedo retrievals with a sampling period of 10 days can offer near-complete spatial coverage, with a retrieval bias mostly comparable to existing single sensor datasets, except for bright surfaces (deserts and snow) where the retrieval framework shows degraded performance because of atmospheric correction design compromises. A level difference is found between the single sensor datasets and the demonstrator developed here, pointing towards a need for further work in the atmospheric correction, particularly over bright surfaces, and inter-sensor radiance homogenization. The introduced framework is expandable to include other sensors in the future.

TI  - Detection of gullies in Fort Riley military installation using LiDAR derived high resolution DEM
T2  - JOURNAL OF TERRAMECHANICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Intensive use of military vehicles in military installations create conditions favorable for gully formation. Gullies impede the access of vehicle, restrict the continuation of training, and lead to significant damage to vehicle and risk the life of soldiers. Therefore, it is critical to correctly identify the locations of gullies for continuous training mission. In this study, Fort Riley (FR) military installation was chosen as the study area. LiDAR derived 1 m resolution digital elevation model (DEM) acquired on 2010 was used to map the gullies. A procedure that measures local topographic position, i.e., difference from mean elevation (DFME) along with its integration to the land surface having high surface curvature values was employed. Two high spatial resolution WorldView-2 images of 2010 and field gully data collected in 2010 were utilized for accuracy assessment. Results showed that: (1) A total of 237 small and 166 large gullies were detected and most of them dominated the central west and northwest parts of the installation; (2) Based on the visual interpretation in the WorldView-2 images, there was no statistically significant difference between the detected and observed numbers of gullies; (3) Gullies measured in the field were well detected with an overall accuracy of 78%.

TI  - Flood Hazard Mapping of a Rapidly Urbanizing City in the Foothills (Birendranagar, Surkhet) of Nepal
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding in the rapidly urbanizing city of Birendranagar, Nepal has been intensifying, culminating in massive loss of life and property during July and August 2014. No previous studies have monitored underlying land-cover dynamics and flood hazards for the area. This study described spatiotemporal urbanization dynamics and associated land-use/land-cover (LULC) changes of the city using Landsat imagery classifications for five periods between 1989 and 2016 (1989-1996, 1996-2001, 2001-2011, 2011-2016). Areas with high flood-hazard risk were also identified on the basis of field surveys, literature, and the Landsat analysis. The major LULC changes observed were the rapid expansion of urban cover and the gradual decline of cultivated lands. The urban area expanded nearly by 700%, from 85 ha in 1989 to 656 ha in 2016, with an average annual growth rate of 23.99%. Cultivated land declined simultaneously by 12%, from 7005 ha to 6205 ha. The loss of forest cover also contributed significantly to increased flood hazard. Steep topography, excessive land utilization, fragile physiographic structure, and intense monsoonal precipitation aggravate hazards locally. As in Nepal generally, the sustainable development of the Birendranagar area has been jeopardized by a disregard for integrated flood-hazard mapping, accounting for historical land-cover changes. This study provides essential input information for improved urban-area planning in this regard.

TI  - Detecting early warning signals of tree mortality in boreal North America using multiscale satellite data
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing tree mortality from global change drivers such as drought and biotic infestations is a widespread phenomenon, including in the boreal zone where climate changes and feedbacks to the Earth system are relatively large. Despite the importance for science and management communities, our ability to forecast tree mortality at landscape to continental scales is limited. However, two independent information streams have the potential to inform and improve mortality forecasts: repeat forest inventories and satellite remote sensing. Time series of tree-level growth patterns indicate that productivity declines and related temporal dynamics often precede mortality years to decades before death. Plot-level productivity, in turn, has been related to satellite-based indices such as the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Here we link these two data sources to show that early warning signals of mortality are evident in several NDVI-based metrics up to 24 years before death. We focus on two repeat forest inventories and three NDVI products across western boreal North America where productivity and mortality dynamics are influenced by periodic drought. These data sources capture a range of forest conditions and spatial resolution to highlight the sensitivity and limitations of our approach. Overall, results indicate potential to use satellite NDVI for early warning signals of mortality. Relationships are broadly consistent across inventories, species, and spatial resolutions, although the utility of coarse-scale imagery in the heterogeneous aspen parkland was limited. Longer-term NDVI data and annually remeasured sites with high mortality levels generate the strongest signals, although we still found robust relationships at sites remeasured at a typical 5 year frequency. The approach and relationships developed here can be used as a basis for improving forest mortality models and monitoring systems.

TI  - Management of penile cancer patients: new aspects of a rare tumour entity
T2  - AKTUELLE UROLOGIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Over the past few decades, some principles in the treatment of penile cancer have changed fundamentally. While 15 years ago a negative surgical margin of at least 2cm was considered mandatory, organ-sparing surgery permitting minimal negative surgical margins has a high priority nowadays. The current treatment principle requires as much organ preservation as possible and as much radicality as necessary. The implementation of organ-sparing and re-constructive surgical techniques has improved the quality of life of surviving patients. However, oncological and functional outcomes are still unsatisfactory.Alongside with adequate local treatment of the primary tumour, a consistent management of inguinal lymph nodes is of fundamental prognostic significance. In particular, clinically inconspicuous inguinal lymph nodes staged T1b and upwards need a surgical approach. Sentinel node biopsy, minimally-invasive surgical techniques and modified inguinal lymphadenectomy have reduced morbidity compared to conventional inguinal lymph node dissection. Multimodal treatment with surgery and chemotherapy is required in all patients with lymph node-positive disease; neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been established for patients with locally advanced lymph node disease, and adjuvant treatment after radical inguinal lymphadenectomy for lymph node-positive disease.An increasing understanding of the underlying tumour biology, in particular the role of the human papilloma virus (HPV) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) status, has led to a new pathological classification and may further enhance treatment options.This review summarises current aspects in the therapeutic management of penile cancer.

TI  - Radiative impact of Etna volcanic aerosols over south eastern Italy on 3 December 2015
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irradiance and LiDAR measurements at the surface combined with satellite products from SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager) and MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were used to detect and characterize the Etna volcano (Italy) plume that crossed southeastern Italy on 3 December 2015, from about 10:00 up to 11:30 UTC, and estimate its radiative impact. The volcanic plume was delivered by a violent and short paroxysmal eruption that occurred from 02:30 to 03:10 UTC of 3 December 2015, about 400 km away from the monitoring site. Measurements from the LiDAR combined with model results showed that the aerosol optical depth of the volcanic plume, located from about 11 to 13 km above sea level (asl), was equal to 0.80 +/- 0.07 at 532 nm. A low tropospheric aerosol load, located up to about 7 km asl, with optical depth equal to 0.19 +/- 0.01 at 532 nm was also revealed by the LiDAR measurements. Short-Wave (SW) downward and upward irradiance measurements revealed that the instantaneous SW direct radiative forcing at the surface (DRFsurf) decreased to -146 +/- 16 Wm(-2) at 10:50 UTC because of the volcanic plume passage. A Two-Stream radiative transfer model integrated with experimental measurements, which took into account the volcanic plume and the low tropospheric aerosol properties, was used to reproduce the SW radiative flux measurements at the surface and estimate the aerosol DRF both at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and at the surface, in addition to the aerosol heating rate vertical profile. We found that the clear-sky, instantaneous, SW DRF at the TOA and the atmospheric forcing were equal to -112 and 33 W m(-2), respectively, at 10:50 UTC that represented the time at which the volcanic plume radiative impact was the highest. The SW aerosol heating rate reached the peak value of 1.24 K day(-1) at 12 km asl and decreased to - 0.06 K day(-1) at 11 km asl, at 10:50 UTC. The role of the aerosol load located up to about 7 km asl and the corresponding radiative impact has also been evaluated.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In response to an outbreak of Zika virus that started in February 2016 on Kosrae Island, Kosrae State, Federated States of Micronesia, we conducted entomological investigations, including a survey to characterize the mosquito fauna on Kosrae, from November 29 to December 8, 2016. Mosquitoes were collected using several surveillance methods in order to sample all stages of the mosquito life cycle. Eggs were collected using ovicups, larvae and pupae were sampled using standard dippers, and adults were collected using aspirators and Biogents-2 Sentinel traps. All species previously recorded from Kosrae State were found in the current survey, confirming their continued presence on the island. Aedes aegypti was detected on Lelu Island, representing a new municipal record. The collection of Ae. vexans nocturnus represents a new species record for Kosrae, increasing the number of known taxa on this island from 6 to 7. The report herein provides updated knowledge of the mosquitoes that occur on Kosrae State, Federated States of Micronesia.

TI  - Stepping In: My Experience of Embodied Power Through the Relational-Cultural Framework
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF DANCE THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - This qualitative embodied artistic inquiry self-study explored how I used my embodied power in an ethical and intentional way as a dance/movement therapist and illustrated how I experienced my embodied power as informed by relational-cultural theory and racial identity development theory. This led to an exploration of my racial identity as a White, second-year dance/movement therapy and counseling graduate student, who also identifies with other dominate cultural groups. Data were collected through five authentic movement sessions with a trained authentic movement practitioner. Data analysis took the form of creative synthesis through embodied writing passages following each authentic movement session. Results included a journey of self-compassion through a growing movement repertoire, which developed into three themes: self-acceptance, ownership of the past, and choice. Implications demonstrated the importance of therapists exploring theoretical frameworks that align with or challenge one's worldview, and continuously engaging in introspective exploration of one's racial identity.

TI  - Design and outcomes of the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute coronary heart disease cohort study
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) established Clinical Data Research Networks (CDRNs) to support pragmatic research. The objective was to electronically identify, recruit, and survey coronary heart disease (CHD) patients and describe their characteristics, health status, and willingness to participate in future research.Methods: We developed a computable phenotype and assembled CHD patients 30 years or older and had visits or hospitalizations between 2009 and 2015. A sample of patients was surveyed between August 2014 and September 2015. Survey administration included the following methods: face-to-face, telephone, paper or web portal. Survey items covered broad domains including: health literacy and numeracy, and socio-demographics, physical and mental health, health behaviors, access to medical care, and willingness to participate in future research.Results: Of 5517 approached patients, 2605 completed the survey. Participants were mostly white (similar to 88%), male (68%) and had a median age of 69 years (interquartile range [IQR] 61-76 years). Most respondents' health literacy and numeracy were adequate (83.2% and 84.3%, respectively). Only 4% of respondents reported that their overall health or physical health was excellent. The majority (similar to 58%) reported that their health was good or very good, while 40% reported that their general and physical health were fair or poor. The majority reported that their quality of life was good to excellent (81%). Limitations in physical health and function were common, including often/always having fatigue (25%), pain (38.7%), or sleep difficulty (19.7%). A patient sample (n = 1936) was provided with a trial summary which would randomize their aspirin dose; and 63% reported that they would consider participating.Conclusion: Many patients with CHD had limitations in physical health. However, the majority reported a good or excellent quality of life.

TI  - Satellite-Based Evaluation of the Post-Fire Recovery Process from the Worst Forest Fire Case in South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The worst forest fire in South Korea occurred in April 2000 on the eastern coast. Forest recovery works were conducted until 2005, and the forest has been monitored since the fire. Remote sensing techniques have been used to detect the burned areas and to evaluate the recovery-time point of the post-fire processes during the past 18 years. We used three indices, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Gross Primary Production (GPP), to temporally monitor a burned area in terms of its moisture condition, vegetation biomass, and photosynthetic activity, respectively. The change of those three indices by forest recovery processes was relatively analyzed using an unburned reference area. The selected unburned area had similar characteristics to the burned area prior to the forest fire. The temporal patterns of NBR and NDVI, not only showed the forest recovery process as a result of forest management, but also statistically distinguished the recovery periods at the regions of low, moderate, and high fire severity. The NBR2.1 for all areas, calculated using 2.1 m wavelengths, reached the unburned state in 2008. The NDVI for areas with low and moderate fire severity levels became significantly equal to the unburned state in 2009 (p > 0.05), but areas with high severity levels did not reach the unburned state until 2017. This indicated that the surface and vegetation moisture conditions recovered to the unburned state about 8 years after the fire event, while vegetation biomass and health required a longer time to recover, particularly for high severity regions. In the case of GPP, it rapidly recovered after about 3 years. Then, the steady increase in GPP surpassed the GPP of the reference area in 2015 because of the rapid growth and high photosynthetic activity of young forests. Therefore, the concluding scientific message is that, because the recovery-time point for each component of the forest ecosystem is different, using only one satellite-based indicator will not be suitable to understand the post-fire recovery process. NBR, NDVI, and GPP can be combined. Further studies will require more approaches using various terms of indices.

TI  - Mapping boreal forest biomass from a SRTM and TanDEM-X based on canopy height model and Landsat spectral indices
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a method for mapping above-ground biomass (AGB) (Mg ha (-1)) in boreal forests based predominantly on Landsat 8 images and on canopy height models (CHM) generated using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) from the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and the TanDEM-X mission. The original SRTM digital elevation model (DEM) was corrected by modelling the respective effects of landform and land cover on its errors and then subtracted from a TanDEM-X DSM to produce a SAR CHM. Among all the landform factors, the terrain curvature had the largest effect on SRTM elevation errors, with a r(2) of 0.29. The NDSI was the best predictor of the residual SRTM land cover error, with a r(2) of 0.30. The final SAR CHM had a RMSE of 2.45 m, with a bias of 0.07 m, compared to a lidar-based CHM. An AGB prediction model was developed based on a combination of the SAR CHM, TanDEM-X coherence, Landsat 8 NDVI, and other vegetation indices of RVI, DVI, GRVI, EVI, LAI, GNDVI, SAVI, GVI, Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness. The best results were obtained using a Random forest regression algorithm, at the stand level, yielding a RMSE of 26 Mg ha (-1) (34% of average biomass), with a r(2) of 0.62. This method has the potential of creating spatially continuous biomass maps over entire biomes using only spaceborne sensors and requiring only low-intensity calibration.

TI  - Role of calcium permeable channels in dendritic cell migration
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Calcium ion (Ca2+) is an essential second messenger involved in multiple cellular and subcellular processes. Ca2+ can be released and sensed globally or locally within cells, providing complex signals of variable amplitudes and time-scales. The key function of Ca2+ in the regulation of acto-myosin contractility has provided a simple explanation for its role in the regulation of immune cell migration. However, many questions remain, including the identity of the Ca2+ stores, channels and upstream signals involved in this process. Here, we focus on dendritic cells (DCs), because their immune sentinel function heavily relies on their capacity to migrate within tissues and later on between tissues and lymphoid organs. Deciphering the mechanisms by which cytoplasmic Ca2+ regulate DC migration should shed light on their role in initiating and tuning immune responses.

TI  - The economics of fishing the high seas
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - While the ecological impacts of fishing the waters beyond national jurisdiction (the "high seas") have been widely studied, the economic rationale is more difficult to ascertain because of scarce data on the costs and revenues of the fleets that fish there. Newly compiled satellite data and machine learning now allow us to track individual fishing vessels on the high seas in near real time. These technological advances help us quantify high-seas fishing effort, costs, and benefits, and assess whether, where, and when high-seas fishing makes economic sense. We characterize the global high-seas fishing fleet and report the economic benefits of fishing the high seas globally, nationally, and at the scale of individual fleets. Our results suggest that fishing at the current scale is enabled by large government subsidies, without which as much as 54% of the present high-seas fishing grounds would be unprofitable at current fishing rates. The patterns of fishing profitability vary widely between countries, types of fishing, and distance to port. Deep-sea bottom trawling often produces net economic benefits only thanks to subsidies, and much fishing by the world's largest fishing fleets would largely be unprofitable without subsidies and low labor costs. These results support recent calls for subsidy and fishery management reforms on the high seas.

TI  - Determination of uncertainty characteristics for estimation of fractional snow cover the satellite data-based
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We developed a methodology to evaluate quantitative uncertainty characteristics of satellite data retrievals including the contribution of systematic error and statistical error. This is introduced by assessing the total product error of optical, satellite data-based, Fractional Snow Cover (FSC) estimates. Here the FSC estimation is based on an algorithm allowing the consideration of the effect of different error sources; a semi-empirical reflectance model describing the relationship of the observed reflectance and FSC through several variables and parameters. We assume that after the statistical error analysis, the remaining portion of total product error arises due to systematic factors. Hence, first we define a statistical error component through the theory of error propagation, and then estimate the total product error (PE) by using in situ observations on FSC, and finally derive the systematic error from these two error components. The experimental approach for estimating PE is conducted through an analysis of the observed estimation errors (i.e. residuals) in the GlobSnow Snow Extent (SE) v2.1 products on FSC. In practice, independent in situ snow course observations from Finland on FSC are compared to corresponding satellite FSC estimates to quantify the residuals. The approach is then illustrated for an extended region of corresponding European boreal forest. Our results show that the total PE in the GlobSnow FSC product is significantly higher than the originally provided statistical error. This is due to deficiencies in the parameterization of the applied forward modelling approach, in particular in the consideration of the forest canopy effects.

TI  - Flood Inundation Hazard Modelling Using CCHE2D Hydrodynamic Model and Geospatial Data for Embankment Breaching Scenario of Brahmaputra River in Assam
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In many flood prone river basins, water inundates vast areas of land causing loss of life and heavy damage to the dwellings in flood plains. It also impacts agricultural productivity and cause severe economic losses. One of the reasons for flooding in plains of Brahmaputra valley in north east India is embankment breaching. In this study, an attempt was made for probabilistic flood hazard modelling of July 2008 embankment breaching scenario of Brahmaputra river at Matmara village, Lakhimpur district in Assam, based on various numerical simulations with the help of Center for Computational Hydro science and Engineering hydro-dynamic model. The methodology was applied over 2146 km(2) flood prone area. Data inputs in the study include: Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Digital Elevation Model, Pre-flood and Post flood satellite images of Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and other ancillary data. The simulation was carried out for various discharge levels based on flood frequency analysis. The result of the model includes spatial variations of inundated water depth and water velocity. The results were validated by comparing it with the post-flood ETM+ data and flood situation status report of National Informatics Centre. Flood hazard maps were prepared by carrying out a spatial analysis of simulated inundation depth and velocity. It was seen that the majority of flooded area fell into the very high and high categories. This information can be used to plan appropriate cost effective flood mitigation schemes.

TI  - Analyzing the role of biophysical compositions in minimizing urban land surface temperature and urban heating
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The alteration of the environment at local and regional scale is often attributed to the rapid urbanization in the developing economies like India, China, etc. The land use and land cover (LULC) modification due to urbanization affect the thermal character and Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) of an urban area. The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has witnessed the drastic urbanization in the last decade and, is the sixth largest agglomeration of India. In the present study, the temporal dataset from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) are used to trace the LULC, and land surface temperature (LST) changes during 2002-2015 and demarcate the fluctuation of different biophysical surfaces. Subsequently, four different indices viz. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Normalized Difference Bareness Index (NDBaI) are used to document the individual and collective response of the different LULC classes/biophysical surfaces. The simple linear and stepwise multiple linear regression models determined the complex and linear behaviour of the LST with the various biophysical compositions. The GHMC exhibits a rapid urban expansion resulting into increased the LST clusters that corroborate to the changing LULC pattern. The spatio-temporal changes of LULC, LST, and UHI of GHMC from 2002 to 2015 are quantified to evaluate the effects of biophysical indices on moderating or exaggerating LST. The study outlines the urbanization in the GHMC and interaction of changing LULC pattern with the local climate and urban biophysical compositions.

TI  - Soil Erosion Susceptibility Mapping with the Application of Logistic Regression and Artificial Neural Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOVISUALIZATION AND SPATIAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, the multi-criteria-based predictive mapping of geoenvironmental processes is a considerable research concern in the domain of earth sciences. This study aimed to predict the probability of occurrence or nonoccurrence of soil erosion at any given site based on a range of factors active therein. The GPS survey of 412 observation sites recorded the soil erosion status of Purulia district in the state of West Bengal in India. An algorithm of binary logistic regression and the artificial neural network was used to build an erosion susceptibility model by using 70% dataset of the sample sites. The model performance was assessed with the remaining 30% of the datasets. After a successful validation, the model equation was used to prepare a susceptibility map for the study area. The model was found to be valid for the given study area; however, it can be used for preparing the susceptibility map of water-induced soil erosion at any other area with similar geoenvironmental conditions. The map will help in framing the comprehensive policies for scientific land-use planning and area-specific soil conservation practices. In addition, the susceptibility map may be used as a base map for designing income, employment, and livelihood planning for the agro-based areas and serves as a decision support to the priority-based allocation of funds to different micro-level administrative units for government-sponsored schemes related to agriculture, irrigation, and soil and land management.

TI  - Monitoring a local extreme weather event with the scope of hyperspectral sounding
T2  - METEOROLOGY AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational space-based hyperspectral Infrared sounders retrieve atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles from the measured radiances. These sounders like Atmospheric InfraRed Sounder, Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer as well as INSAT-3D sounders on geostationary orbit have proved to be very successful in providing these retrievals on global and regional scales, respectively, with good enough spatio-temporal resolutions and are well competent with that of traditional profiles from radiosondes and models fields. The aim of this work is to show how these new generation hyperspectral Infrared sounders can benefit in real-time weather monitoring. We have considered a regional extreme weather event to demonstrate how the profiles retrieved from these operational sounders are consistent with the environmental conditions which have led to this severe weather event. This work has also made use of data products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer as well as by radiative transfer simulation of clear and cloudy atmospheric conditions using Numerical Weather Prediction profiles in conjunction with INSAT-3D sounder. Our results indicate the potential use of high-quality hyperspectral atmospheric profiles to aid in delineation of real-time weather prediction.

TI  - Mapping of spatial variability in soil properties for site-specific nutrient management of Nagpur Mandarin in Central India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the mapping of spatial variability in soil properties of Nagpur Mandrin growing areas in central India for site-specific nutrient management. Contiguous area of Nagpur mandarin orchards was identified using Cartosat-1-sharpened IRS-P6 LISS-IV data followed by ground truth. Soil samples were collected from 0-20 and 20-40 cm in a grid design (200 x 200 m) using Global Positioning System and analyzed for particle-size, bulk density, moisture retention at -33 kPa, and -1500 kPa, pH, organic carbon, calcium carbonate, available N, P and K and micronutrient cations. The GIS aided kriged thematic maps showed spatial variation in soil properties and soil fertility parameters. The cadastral maps overlaid on kriged thematic soil maps precisely indicated the areas having soil related constraints for site-specific nutrient management to improve the productivity of Nagpur mandarin in central India.

TI  - Multibeam sonar backscatter data processing
T2  - MARINE GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Multibeam sonar systems now routinely record seafloor backscatter data, which are processed into backscatter mosaics and angular responses, both of which can assist in identifying seafloor types and morphology. Those data products are obtained from the multibeam sonar raw data files through a sequence of data processing stages that follows a basic plan, but the implementation of which varies greatly between sonar systems and software. In this article, we provide a comprehensive review of this backscatter data processing chain, with a focus on the variability in the possible implementation of each processing stage. Our objective for undertaking this task is twofold: (1) to provide an overview of backscatter data processing for the consideration of the general user and (2) to provide suggestions to multibeam sonar manufacturers, software providers and the operators of these systems and software for eventually reducing the lack of control, uncertainty and variability associated with current data processing implementations and the resulting backscatter data products. One such suggestion is the adoption of a nomenclature for increasingly refined levels of processing, akin to the nomenclature adopted for satellite remote-sensing data deliverables.

TI  - The Dilemma of Moral Naturalism in Nagel's Mind and Cosmos
T2  - ETHICAL PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present contribution deals with both moral naturalism in general and Nagel's version thereof in particular. In Mind and Cosmos, Nagel offers a neo-naturalistic theory of moral values that claims the existence of irreducibly objective moral values and that excludes at the same time so-called 'metaphysical baggage', i.e. the postulation of supposedly 'queer' non-natural entities. It is this meta-ethical standpoint that I critically examine here. I begin by providing a rough outline of Nagel's meta-ethical thought. The strategy in the next part of the article is the following: I explore moral naturalism (and its variants) as an attempt to somehow integrate morality into the scientific worldview. This moral naturalism, I argue, faces a dilemma: either it overstretches the term 'natural', or it fails to account for a substantial element of morality, namely prescriptivity. Since Nagel does not maintain a traditional form of naturalism, but rather a non-scientific or liberal one that allows for entities and truths that cannot be explained by traditional sciences, one might hope that he is in a position to avoid this dilemma of (scientific) moral naturalism. However, I argue that this hope is illusive; Nagel's liberal naturalism does not save him from the dilemma of moral naturalism. Therefore, Nagel's moral naturalism is inconsistent.

TI  - Radiometric accuracy and stability of sentinel-1A determined using point targets
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MICROWAVE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1A is a space-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system developed in the frame of the Copernicus Program. The German Aerospace Center supported the radiometric and polarimetric calibration of Sentinel-1A by the analysis of point target responses of several acquisitions considering different modes, beams, and polarization channels. An elevation dependent bias, which had not been properly predicted by the used antenna model, was found for all investigated modes. Offsets of up to 2 dB were determined during the SAR instrument calibration phase, in particular, for low and high elevation angles. Therefore, in order to correct these elevation biases, a radiometric refinement was carried out by European Space Agency in November 2015. After that, Sentinel-1A radiometric accuracy and long-term stability were analyzed over a period of 1.5 years. For this period, the absolute calibration factor and the channel imbalance were determined for the main imaging mode. Moreover, a slight drift of the derived calibration factor was observed starting from July 2016. At the same time an anomaly was detected in the front-end affecting several transmit and receive modules in one tile. The radiometric behavior of Sentinel-1A should therefore be monitored for a longer period of time, especially to detect potential degradation effects of the SAR instrument.

TI  - Evaluation of sentinel lymph node biopsy prior to axillary lymph node dissection: the role of isolated tumor cells/micrometastases and multifocality/multicentricity-a retrospective study of 1214 breast cancer patients
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone has thus become an accepted surgical approach for patients with limited axillary metastatic disease. We investigated to what extent isolated tumor cells (ITC) or micrometastasis in SLNBs is associated with proven tumor cells or metastasis in non-sentinel lymph nodes. Furthermore, we investigated the feasibility of SLNB in multifocal and multicentric tumors as both entities have been considered a contraindication for this technique.Methods 1214 women suffering from T1 and T2 invasive breast cancer, with clinically and sonographically insuspect axillary status and undergoing primary breast cancer surgery including SLNB and axillary staging in case of SLN (sentinel lymph node) metastases, were recruited into this multicentered study.Results ITC and micrometastases were found in 2.01 and 21.4% of patients with SLN metastases (n= 299). Among patients with sentinel micrometastases, 4.7% showed further axillary micrometastases, while only two patients (3.1%) had two axillary macrometastases. Multifocal and multicentric tumors were diagnosed in 9.3 and 2.6% of our patients who at least had one SLN resected, respectively. Detection rates of SLNs did not differ between the cohorts suffering from unicentric and multifocal or multicentric disease. Moreover, the portion of tumor-free SLNs, the number of SLNs with metastasis as well as the mean number of resected SLNs did not differ.Conclusions No patient with sentinel node micrometastases showed more than two axillary macrometastases. Multifocal and multicentric disease is no contraindication for SLNB.

TI  - Mapping patterns of urban development in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, using machine learning regression modeling with bi-seasonal Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid urban population growth in Sub-Saharan Western Africa has important environmental, infrastructural and social impacts. Due to the low availability of reliable urbanization data, remote sensing techniques become increasingly popular for monitoring land use change processes in that region. This study aims to quantify land cover for the Ouagadougou metropolitan area between 2002 and 2013 using a Landsat-TM/ETM + /OLI time series. We use a support vector regression approach and synthetically mixed training data. Working with biseasonal image stacks, we account for spectral variability between dry and rainy season and incorporate a new class- seasonal vegetation- that describes surfaces that are soil and vegetation during parts of the year. We produce fraction images of urban surfaces, soil, permanent vegetation and seasonal vegetation for each time step. Statistical evaluation shows that a temporally generalized, hi-seasonal model over all time steps performs equally or better than yearly or mono-seasonal models and provides reliable cover fractions. Urban fractions can be used to visualize pixel-based spatial-temporal patterns of urban densification and expansion. A simple rule set based on a seasonal vegetation to soil ratio is appropriate to delineate areas of unplanned and planned settlements and, thus, contributes to monitoring urban development on a neighborhood scale.

TI  - A continent-wide search for Antarctic petrel breeding sites with satellite remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic petrel (Thalassoica antarctica) has been identified as a key species for monitoring the status and health of the Southern Ocean and Antarctic ecosystems. Breeding colonies of the Antarctic petrel are often found on isolated nunataks far from inhabited stations, some up to hundreds of kilometers from the shoreline. It is difficult therefore to monitor and census known colonies, and it is believed that undiscovered breeding locations remain to be found. We developed an algorithm that can detect Antarctic petrel colonies and used it to complete a continent-wide survey using Landsat-8 Operational Line Imager (OLI) imagery in Antarctica up to the southernmost extent of Landsat's orbital view at 82.68 degrees S. Our survey successfully identified 8 known Antarctic petrel colonies containing 86% of the known population of Antarctic petrels. The survey also identified what appears to be a significant population of breeding birds in areas not known to host breeding Antarctic petrel colonies. Our survey suggests that the breeding population at Mt. Biscoe (66 degrees 13'S 51 degrees 21'E), currently reported to be in the 1000s, may actually be on the order of 400,000 breeding pairs, which would make it the largest known Antarctic petrel breeding colony in the world. The algorithm represents a first-ever attempt to apply satellite remote sensing to assess the distribution and abundance of the Antarctic petrel on a continent-wide basis. As such, we note several algorithm shortcomings and identify research topics for algorithm improvement. Even with these caveats, our algorithm for identifying Antarctic petrel colonies with Landsat imagery demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring their populations using satellite remote sensing and identifies breeding locations, including Mt. Biscoe, that should be considered high priorities for validation with directed field surveys.

TI  - Satellite detection of cover crops and their effects on crop yield in the Midwestern United States
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of planting winter cover crops has seen renewed interest as a solution to environmental issues with the modern maize- and soybean-dominated row crop production system of the US Midwest. We examine whether cover cropping patterns can be assessed at scale using publicly available satellite data, creating a classifier with 91.5% accuracy (.68 kappa). We then use this classifier to examine spatial and temporal trends in cover crop occurrence on maize and soybean fields in the Midwest since 2008, finding that despite increased talk about and funding for cover crops as well as a 94% increase in cover crop acres planted from 2008-2016, increases in winter vegetation have been more modest. Finally, we combine cover cropping with satellite-predicted yields, finding that cover crops are associated with low relative maize and soybean production and poor soil quality, consistent with farmers adopting the practice on fields most in need of purported cover crop benefits. When controlling for invariant soil quality using a panel regression model, we find modest benefits of cover cropping, with average yield increases of 0.65% for maize and 0.35% for soybean. Given these slight impacts on yields, greater incentives or reduced costs of implementation are needed to increase adoption of this practice for the majority of maize and soybean acres in the US.

M3  - Review
AB  - The National Solar Radiation Data Base (NSRDB), consisting of solar radiation and meteorological data over the United States and regions of the surrounding countries, is a publicly open dataset that has been created and disseminated during the last 23 years. This paper briefly reviews the complete package of surface observations, models, and satellite data used for the latest version of the NSRDB as well as improvements in the measurement and modeling technologies deployed in the NSRDB over the years. The current NSRDB provides solar irradiance at a 4-km horizontal resolution for each 30-min interval from 1998 to 2016 computed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL's) Physical Solar Model (PSM) and products from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the National Ice Center's (NIC's) Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's NASA's) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2). The NSRDB irradiance data have been validated and shown to agree with surface observations with mean percentage biases within 5% and 10% for global horizontal irradiance (GHI) and direct normal irradiance (DNI), respectively. The data can be freely accessed via https://nsrdb. nrel. gov or through an application programming interface (API). During the last 23 years, the NSRDB has been widely used by an ever-growing group of researchers and industry both directly and through tools such as NREL's System Advisor Model.

T2  - Osong public health and research perspectives
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Hand, Foot and Mouth disease (HFMD) is a highly contagious viral disease that affects young children and frequently causes epidemics. A vaccine is available in China (enterovirus 71) and, the Republic of Korea took the first step to develop a new vaccine. New vaccine development requires that disease burden is calculated in advance so the financial cost, morbidity and mortality can be measured.METHODS: Data from National Sentinel Surveillance and health insurance systems of 1 million claimants were used. Direct medical and non-medical costs, indirect (caregiving and premature death) costs, cases and related deaths were summarized.RESULTS: From 2010 to 2014, there were an estimated 3,605 to 9,271 cases of HFMD, with 1 to 3 deaths. The estimated socioeconomic disease burden ranged from 80.5 to 164.2 million USD and was similar to that of hepatitis A (93.6-103.8 million USD). Among each costs, costs of caregiving consisted of highest proportion mainly due to hiring caregivers (50% - 60%) or opportunity costs from day off (62% - 69%).CONCLUSION: Considering the social impact of HFMD, the estimated socioeconomic disease burden is not high and government policies need to focus on reducing the loss of work in caregivers.

TI  - A district and sector land-use and landscape analysis of urban sprawl in Al Ain municipality (United Arab Emirates): Just a quick conversion from sand to a built-up environment?
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Al Ain, located in the United Arab Emirates, is an example of medium-sized desert city with rapid urban growth guided by two master plans from the 1980s. The present study is an empirical contribution to analyse the spatial temporal land-use and land-cover (LULC) dynamics from 1984 to 2014 applying three different tools: i) a Base Map of Al Ain Town Planning from 2014 combined with four Landsat images to extract the main LULC changes; ii) a landscape analysis using spatial metrics to determine processes of sprawl; iii) statistical analysis of census data at district scale to obtain a better understanding of changes. Results show an intensive urban sprawl mainly, between 1984 and 1990, with an increase in residential land and in services, very clear in the Western sector as proposed by the 1980s Master Plan. Urban compaction was observed in the Centre and Downtown sectors whereas in the Northern and Southern sectors the urban pattern was leapfrogging and associated to the main roads. Simultaneously, and as a particularity of Al Ain, an intensive process of agricultural sprawl occurred, mainly from 1990 to 2000. The increase was very isolated in the Eastern sector, quite associated to linear patterns in the Northern and Southern sectors, restricted to the north and south in the Centre sector, where vacant land was available, and sprawled throughout the Western. Finally, according to the statistical analysis, the residential increase was more associated to Emiratis, public and private houses, foreign women and religious facilities, whereas the increment of commercial services was more linked to foreign workers, privates houses and religious facilities.

TI  - Irrigation History Estimation Using Multitemporal Landsat Satellite Images: Application to an Intensive Groundwater Irrigated Agricultural Watershed in India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater has rapidly evolved as a primary source for irrigation in Indian agriculture. Over-exploitation of the groundwater substantially depletes the natural water table and has negative impacts on the water resource availability. The overarching goal of the proposed research is to identify the historical evolution of irrigated cropland for the post-monsoon (rabi) and summer cropping seasons in the Berambadi watershed (Area = 89 km(2)) of Kabini River basin, southern India. Approximately five-year interval irrigated area maps were generated using 30 m spatial resolution Landsat satellite images for the period from 1990 to 2016. The potential of Support Vector Machine (SVM) was assessed to discriminate irrigated and non-irrigated croplands. Three indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), were derived from multi-temporal Landsat satellite images. Spatially distributed intensive ground observations were collected for training and validation of the SVM models. The irrigated and non-irrigated croplands were estimated with high classification accuracy (kappa coefficient greater than 0.9). At the watershed scale, this approach allowed highlighting the contrasted evolution of multiple-cropping (two successive crops in rabi and summer seasons that often imply dual irrigation) with a steady increase in the upstream and a recent decrease in the downstream of the watershed. Moreover, the multiple-cropping was found to be much more frequent in the valleys. These intensive practices were found to have significant impacts on the water resources, with a drastic decline in the water table level (more than 50 m). It also impacted the ecosystem: Groundwater level decline was more pronounced in the valleys and the rivers are no more fed by the base flow.

TI  - Validation of significant wave height retrieval from co-polarization Chinese Gaofen-3 SAR imagery using an improved algorithm
T2  - ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) is the first civilian satellite to carry C-band (5.3 GHz) synthetic aperture radar (SAR). During the period of August 2016 to December 2017, 1 523 GF-3 SAR images acquired in quad-polarization (vertical-vertical (VV), horizontal-horizontal (HH), vertical-horizontal (VH), and horizontal-vertical (HV)) mode were recorded, mostly around China's seas. In our previous study, the root mean square error (RMSE) of significant wave height (SWH) was found to be around 0.58 m when compared with retrieval results from a few GF-3 SAR images in co-polarization (VV and HH) with moored measurements by using an empirical algorithm CSAR_WAVE. We collected a number of sub-scenes from these 1 523 images in the co-polarization channel, which were collocated with wind and SWH data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis field at a 0.125A degrees grid. Through the collected dataset, an improved empirical wave retrieval algorithm for GF-3 SAR in co-polarization was tuned, herein denoted as CSAR_WAVE2. An additional 92 GF-3 SAR images were implemented in order to validate CSAR_WAVE2 against SWH from altimeter Jason-2, showing an about 0.52 m RMSE of SWH for co-polarization GF-3 SAR. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed empirical algorithm has a good performance for wave retrieval from GF-3 SAR images in co-polarization.

TI  - Deteriorating water clarity in shallow waters: Evidence from long term MODIS and in-situ observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Water clarity (Secchi disk depth: SDD), as a proxy of water transparency, provides important information on the light availability to the water or lake ecosystem. Shallow lakes have been experienced dramatic environmental and climatic change. This study demonstrated using combination of long-term MODIS and in-situ measurements to track the dynamics of SDD with these environmental and climate changes in shallow water environments. We selected a typical turbid shallow Lake Taihu as our case study. Based on MODIS-Aqua data, an empirical model for estimating SDD was developed and validated. Subsequently, we employed the proposed model to derive the spatial and temporal SDD distribution patterns of Lake Taihu from 2003 to 2015. Combining MODIS-derived SDD time series of 2003-2015 and long-term in-situ SDD observations dated back to 1993, we elucidated SDD long-term variation trends and driving mechanism. Deteriorating water clarity from the long-term SDD observations indicated that Lake Taihu became more and more turbid and water quality was decreasing. Increasing in cyanobacterial bloom area, as a result of decreasing in wind speed and eutrophication, may partially be responsible for the decreasing trend. A predicted future decrease in the wind speed in Lake Taihu region could enhance the formation of cyanobacterial blooms and consequently lead to a further decrease in water clarity. This study suggested that coupling remote sensing monitoring and long-term in-situ observations could provide robust evidence and new insights to elucidate long-term dynamics in aquatic ecosystem evolution.

TI  - An Active Relearning Framework for Remote Sensing Image Classification
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification is an important technique for remote sensing data interpretation. In order to enhance the performance of a supervised classifier and ensure the lowest possible cost of the training samples used in the process, active learning (AL) can be used to optimize the training sample set. At the same time, integrating spatial information can help to enhance the separability between similar classes, which can in turn reduce the need for training samples in AL. To effectively integrate spatial information into the AL framework, this paper proposes a new active relearning (ARL) model for remote sensing image classification. In particular, our model is used to relearn the spatial features on the classification map, which contributes significantly to enhancing the performance of the classifier. We integrate the relearning model into the AL framework, with the aim to accelerate the convergence of AL and further reduce the labeling cost. Under the newly developed ARL framework, we propose two spatial-spectral uncertainty criteria to optimize the procedure for selecting new training samples. Furthermore, an adaptive multiwindow ARL model is also introduced in this paper. Our experiments with two hyperspectral images and two very high resolution images indicate that the ARL model exhibits faster convergence speed with fewer samples than traditional AL methods. Our results also suggest that the proposed spatial-spectral uncertainty criteria and the multiwindow version can further improve the performance when implementing ARL.

TI  - A Model Design for Risk Assessment of Line Tripping Caused by Wildfires
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - A power line is particularly vulnerable to wildfires in its vicinity, and various damage including line tripping can be caused by wildfires. Using remote sensing techniques, a novel model developed to assess the risk of line tripping caused by the wildfire occurrence in high-voltage power line corridors is presented. This model mainly contains the wildfire risk assessment for power line corridors and the estimation of the probability of line tripping when a wildfire occurs in power line corridors. For the wildfire risk assessment, high-resolution satellite data, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, meteorological data, and digital elevation model (DEM) data were employed to infer the natural factors. Human factors were also included to achieve good reliability. In the estimation of the probability of line tripping, vegetation characteristics, meteorological status, topographic conditions, and transmission line parameters were chosen as influencing factors. According to the above input variables and observed historical datasets, the risk levels for wildfire occurrence and line tripping were obtained with a logic regression approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed model can provide good results in predicting wildfire occurrence and line tripping for high-voltage power line corridors.

TI  - Real Data Assimilation Using the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) System for a Global Non-hydrostatic NWP model on the Cubed-sphere
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - An ensemble data assimilation system using the 4-dimensional Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter is implemented to a global non-hydrostatic Numerical Weather Prediction model on the cubed-sphere. The ensemble data assimilation system is coupled to the Korea Institute of Atmospheric Prediction Systems Package for Observation Processing, for real observation data from diverse resources, including satellites. For computational efficiency in a parallel computing environment, we employ some advanced software engineering techniques in the handling of a large number of files. The ensemble data assimilation system is tested in a semi-operational mode, and its performance is verified using the Integrated Forecast System analysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. It is found that the system can be stabilized effectively by additive inflation to account for sampling errors, especially when radiance satellite data are additionally used.

TI  - Hierarchical classification of land use types using multiple vegetation indices to measure the effects of urbanization
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting fine-scale spatiotemporal land use changes is a prerequisite for understanding and predicting the effects of urbanization and its related human impacts on the ecosystem. Land use changes are frequently examined using vegetation indices (VIs), although the validation of these indices has not been conducted at a high resolution. Therefore, a hierarchical classification was constructed to obtain accurate land use types at a fine scale. The characteristics of four popular VIs were investigated prior to examining the hierarchical classification by using Purbachal New Town, Bangladesh, which exhibits ongoing urbanization. These four VIs are the normalized difference VI (NDVI), green-red VI (GRVI), enhanced VI (EVI), and two-band EVI (EVI2). The reflectance data were obtained by the IKONOS (0.8-m resolution) and WorldView-2 sensor (0.5-m resolution) in 2001 and 2015, respectively. The hierarchical classification of land use types was constructed using a decision tree (DT) utilizing all four of the examined VIs. The accuracy of the classification was evaluated using ground truth data with multiple comparisons and kappa (kappa) coefficients. The DT showed overall accuracies of 96.1 and 97.8% in 2001 and 2015, respectively, while the accuracies of the VIs were less than 91.2%. These results indicate that each VI exhibits unique advantages. In addition, the DT was the best classifier of land use types, particularly for native ecosystems represented by Shorea forests and homestead vegetation, at the fine scale. Since the conservation of these native ecosystems is of prime importance, DTs based on hierarchical classifications should be used more widely.

TI  - National linguistic world-image in mental-speech activity of Mongolian and Russian native speakers (comparative study)
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents the results of a comparative analysis of the fragments of the Mongolian and Russian national linguistic worldviews. Linguistic world-image is considered as a component of the national mental linguistic consciousness that mediates the text processes. Thus, our research interest is focused on the problem of text generation and perception of the text, but not on the internal organization of the text. This study presents the following parameters of the organization of mental-speech activity of linguistic identity: referential relatedness, meta-referential relatedness and the relatedness of the modal linguistic picture of the world. A survey of native speakers of Russian and Mongolian languages is used as a research method. The linguistic material is described through associative fields of words of the thematic group "domestic animals".Factorial analysis (two-way ANOVA) by selected parameters reveals significant differences in the national language pictures of the world. A conclusion is made that verbal reactions to words-stimuli reflect their natural disposition to a certain mental-speech process. A significant predominance of event propositions over the logical ones in the associative fields of the Russian words is indicative of the orientation of Russian linguistic personality in the memories of typical situations using the object denoted by this word. The same number of eventive and logical propositions is observed in the Mongolian national linguistic worldview, suggesting that these linguistic persons are guided both by the non-linguistic reality and the situation of mental operations associated with these denotations. There is an excess of the number of situational meta-referents over systemic meta-referents in the Russian language, indicating that the Russian linguistic personality is oriented more toward the knowledge about the world in conditions of spontaneous text generation. There is a statistically significant excess of system meta-referents over situational meta-referents in associative fields with the same words in Mongolian. This fact means that the Mongolian linguistic personality more often refers to the knowledge about the connections of words in language and speech. Imaginary modal referents quantify in the Russian language picture of the world in comparison with the Mongolian language picture of the world. All the conclusions of the authors are supported by statistical analysis.

TI  - Collective Memory and the Transplanting of Shint to Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the process of Shintoism transplantation in Brazil and its related strategies of dissemination. Shint in Brazil is divided in two diffusion stages representing at the same time two main poles in the transplantation process. The first phase is defined by State Shint that remained the main worldview of Japanese immigrants in Brazil until the 1950s, initially uniting and later separating the ethnic community on issues such as emperor devotion and Japanese spirit loyalty. The transmission of the nationalistic belief was largely maintained by the provisionary Japanese schools and the Emperor cult recreated in Brazil. The second pole developed as a Japanese Brazilian (Nikkei) Shint and is marked by the new Shintoist groups blended with the Spiritist worldview. These shrines were created in Brazil by the immigrants themselves, and some still preserve a combination of ancestor worship, Japanese folk religion, and incorporated local deities. At the end of the paper, I will review the current challenges of Shint in Brazil as it relates to collective memory maintenance and connection with the local nature if the social survival of Shint in Brazil is to be pursued.

TI  - Characterizing the spatio-temporal variations of C3 and C4 dominated grasslands aboveground biomass in the Drakensberg, South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - C3 and C4 grass species composition, with different physiological, morphological and most importantly phenological characteristics, influence Aboveground Biomass (AGB) and their ability to provide ecosystem goods and services, over space and time. For decades, the lack of appropriate remote sensing data sources compromised C3 and C4 grasses AGB estimation, over space and time. This resulted in uncertainties in understanding their potential and contribution to the provision of services. This study therefore examined the utility of the new multi-temporal Sentinel 2 to estimate and map C3 and C4 grasses AGB over time, using the advanced Sparse Partial Least Squares Regression (SPLSR) model. Overall results have shown the variability in AGB between C3 and C4 grasses, estimation accuracies and the performance of the SPLSR model, over time. Themeda (C4) produced higher AGB from February to April, whereas from May to September, Festuca produced higher AGB. Both species also showed a decrease in AGB in August and September, although this was most apparent for Themeda than its counterpart. Spectral bands information predicted species AGB with lowest accuracies and an improvement was observed when both spectral bands and vegetation indices were applied. For instance, in the month of May, spectral bands predicted species AGB with lowest accuracies for Festuca (R-2 = 0.57; 31.70% of the mean), Themeda (R-2 = 0.59; 24.02% of the mean) and combined species (R-2 = 0.61; 15.64% of the mean); the use of spectral bands and vegetation indices yielded 0.77; (18.64%), 0.75 (14.27%) and 0.73 (16.47%), for Festuca, Themeda and combined species, respectively. The red edge (at 0.705 and 0.74 pm) and derived indices, NIR and SWIR 2 (2.19 mu m) were found to contribute more to grass species AGB estimation, over time. Findings have also revealed the potential of the SPLSR model in estimating C3 and C4 grasses AGB using Sentinel 2 images, over time. The AGB spatial variability maps produced in this study can be used to quantify C3 and C4 forage availability or accumulating fuel, as well as for developing operational management strategies.

TI  - Towards understanding vulnerability: Investigating disruptions in cropping schedules in irrigated rice fields in West Java
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Unsafe conditions may increase the vulnerability of farmers natural hazards and reduce the capacity of farmers to prevent or recover from disaster impacts. This study aimed to investigate disruptions in cropping schedules to understand unsafe conditions that contribute to vulnerability in irrigated fields served by Ir. Djuanda (Jatiluhur) reservoir in West Java. Firstly, the deviation of ongoing cropping schedules from the official cropping calendar was evaluated using the time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) derived from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imageries. Secondly, reasons for disruptions in cropping schedules were explored using an in-depth interview with farmers, extension officers, and water managers and analyzed using a qualitative content analysis. Thirdly, the progression from potential causes to consequences of the disruption was identified using a Bow-Tie analysis. Unsafe conditions were identified using the result of the Bow-Tie analysis. Finally, several ways to reduce vulnerability were suggested. This study has successfully showed that cropping schedules deviate from the official cropping calendar in the study area. Reasons for disruptions in cropping schedules include economic motives, weather variabilities, geographic locations, coping strategies, farmers' interactions, and agricultural infrastructures. The Bow-Tie analysis has visualized the progression from potential causes, disruptions in cropping schedules, to potential disaster impacts. Unsafe conditions have been identified, categorized into the dangerous locations, unsustainable farming activities, unsuitable coping strategies, fragile infrastructures, and inaccurate perceptions, have been pinpointed. Addressing unsafe conditions is likely to able to reduce vulnerability in irrigated rice fields.

TI  - Deforestation-Induced Fragmentation Increases Forest Fire Occurrence in Central Brazilian Amazonia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Amazonia is home to more than half of the world's remaining tropical forests, playing a key role as reservoirs of carbon and biodiversity. However, whether at a slower or faster pace, continued deforestation causes forest fragmentation in this region. Thus, understanding the relationship between forest fragmentation and fire incidence and intensity in this region is critical. Here, we use MODIS Active Fire Product (MCD14ML, Collection 6) as a proxy of forest fire incidence and intensity (measured as Fire Radiative PowerFRP), and the Brazilian official Land-use and Land-cover Map to understand the relationship among deforestation, fragmentation, and forest fire on a deforestation frontier in the Brazilian Amazonia. Our results showed that forest fire incidence and intensity vary with levels of habitat loss and forest fragmentation. About 95% of active fires and the most intense ones (FRP > 500 megawatts) were found in the first kilometre from the edges in forest areas. Changes made in 2012 in the Brazilian main law regulating the conservation of forests within private properties reduced the obligation to recover illegally deforested areas, thus allowing for the maintenance of fragmented areas in the Brazilian Amazonia. Our results reinforce the need to guarantee low levels of fragmentation in the Brazilian Amazonia in order to avoid the degradation of its forests by fire and the related carbon emissions.

TI  - Using Spatial Features to Reduce the Impact of Seasonality for Detecting Tropical Forest Changes from Landsat Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In forested areas that experience strong seasonality and are undergoing rapid land cover conversion (e.g., Brazilian savannas), the accuracy of remote sensing change detection is affected by seasonal changes that are erroneously classified as having changed. To improve the quality and consistency of regionally important forest change maps, we aim to separate process related change (for example, spectral variability due to phenology) from changes related to deforestations or fires. Seasonal models are typically used to account for seasonality, but fitting a model is difficult when there are insufficient data points in the time series. In this research, we utilize remotely sensed data and related spectral trends and the spatial context at the object level to evaluate the performance of geostatistical features to reduce the impact of seasonality from the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) of Landsat time series. The study area is the SAo RomAo municipality, totaling 2440 km(2), and is part of the Brazilian savannas biome. We first create image objects via multiresolution segmentation, basing the objects on the characteristics found in the first image (2003) of the 13-year time series. We intersected the objects with the NDVI images in order to extract semivariogram indices, the RVF (Ratio VarianceFirst lag) and AFM (Area First lagFirst Maximum), and spectral information (average and standard deviation of NDVI values) to generate the time series from these features and to derive Spatio-Temporal Metrics (change and trend) to train a Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The NDVI spatial variability, captured by the AFM semivariogram index time series produced the best result, reaching 96.53% of the overall accuracy (OA) to separate no-change from forest change, while the greatest inter-class confusion occurred using the average of the NDVI values time series (OA = 63.72%). The spatial context approach we presented is a novel approach for the detection of forest change events that are subject to seasonality (and possible miss-classification of change) and mitigating the effects of forest phenology without the need for specific de-seasoning models.

TI  - Vulnerability assessment of urban road network from urban flood
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood and flood-related problems have become more rampant all over the world leading to loss of life, infrastructure damage, and epidemics every year. There are evidences in recent years where heavy precipitation events have resulted in severe detrimental floods in India. A number of major cities in India have reported a series of devastating floods in the recent decade. The immediate impact of floods specifically in urban areas is on the transport system. Most of the studies on transport vulnerability consider topographic properties along with supply and demand side of transport system to access the disruption; but less attention is given to the potential impacts of weather extremes on the performance of transportation network. In response to that, this study aims to provide a framework to assess the vulnerability of urban road network due to floods. An integrated framework linking meteorological information, land use functions, and hydrodynamic model with safety speed function is used to relate flood depth to reduction in speed in order to determine road network vulnerability. Two rainfall events with 1-in-10 year and 1-in-100 year return period were simulated for inundation mapping over road network and spatial vulnerability of road network was assessed. A critical map and index is developed to identify affected road length vulnerable to flood. It has been observed that more than 40% of road length across the network becomes immovable for 1-in-100 year rainfall event. Also, there is a significant decrease in average maximum speed in each road category corresponding to its normal.

TI  - A novel method for destriping of OCM-2 data and radiometric performance analysis for improved ocean color data products
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the capability of Ocean Color Monitor aboard Oceansat-2 satellite to provide frequent, high-spatial resolution, visible and near-infrared images for scientific research on coastal zones and climate data records over the global ocean, the generation of science quality ocean color products from OCM-2 data has been hampered by serious vertical striping artifacts and poor calibration of detectors. These along-track stripes are the results of variations in the relative response of the individual detectors of the OCM-2 CCD array. The random unsystematic stripes and bandings on the scene edges affect both visual interpretation and radiometric integrity of remotely sensed data, contribute to confusion in the aerosol correction process, and multiply and propagate into higher level ocean color products generated by atmospheric correction and bio-optical algorithms. Despite a number of destriping algorithms reported in the literature, complete removal of stripes without residual effects and signal distortion in both low- and high-level products is still challenging. Here, a new operational algorithm has been developed that employs an inverted gaussian function to estimate error fraction parameters, which are uncorrelated and vary in spatial, spectral and temporal domains. The algorithm is tested on a large number of OCM-2 scenes from Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal waters contaminated with severe stripes. The destriping effectiveness of this approach is then evaluated by means of various qualitative and quantitative analyses, and by comparison with the results of the previously reported method. Clearly, the present method is more effective in terms of removing the stripe noise while preserving the radiometric integrity of the destriped OCM-2 data. Furthermore, a preliminary time-dependent calibration of the OCM-2 sensor is performed with several match-up in-situ data to evaluate its radiometric performance for ocean color applications. OCM-2 derived water-leaving radiance products obtained after calibration show a good consistency with in-situ and MODIS-Aqua observations, with errors less than the validated uncertainties of +/- 5% and +/- 35% endorsed for the remote-sensing measurements of water-leaving radiance and retrieval of chlorophyll concentrations respectively. The calibration results show a declining trend in detector sensitivity of the OCM-2 sensor, with a maximum effect in the shortwave spectrum, which provides evidence of sensor degradation and its profound effect on the striping artifacts in the OCM-2 data products.

TI  - Assessing the Land and Vegetation Cover of Abandoned Fire Hazardous and Rewetted Peatlands: Comparing Different Multispectral Satellite Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1990s, many peatlands that were drained for peat extraction and agriculture in Russia have been abandoned with high CO2 emissions and frequent fires, such as the enormous fires around Moscow in 2010. The fire hazard in these peatlands can be reduced through peatland rewetting and wetland restoration, so monitoring peatland status is essential. However, large expanses, poor accessibility, and fast plant succession pose as challenges for monitoring these areas without satellite images. In this study, a technique involving multispectral satellite data was used to identify six land cover classes that meet the requirements for peatland monitoring using the Meschera National Park as the testing area. This park is the largest area of once-exploited and now rewetted peatlands. However, data from one scanner are often insufficient to successfully implement this technique. In this study, we compared the land cover classifications obtained by using data from Spot-5, Spot-6, Landsat-7, Landsat-8, and Sentinel-2 satellites. The Spot-6 data were insufficient, despite having a higher spatial resolution, due to the lack of a shortwave infrared (SWIR) band. The high classification accuracy attained using data from other sensors enabled their combined use to provide an acceptable accuracy in the final product. The classification results were compared using minimum distance Erdas Imagine and the object-oriented ScanEx Image Processor, and the classification accuracy was similar between satellite images, which facilitates the transition from one method to another without quality loss. The proposed and tested approach can be used to analyze the status of abandoned and rewetted peatlands in other locations for the inventory and prioritization of sites for rewetting and restoration, monitoring status changes, and assessing restoration efficacy. The comparability of the data from different sensors allows for the combination of classified images and creates new possibilities for time series analysis.

TI  - Potential of Different Optical and SAR Data in Forest and Land Cover Classification to Support REDD plus MRV
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The applicability of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for land cover classification to support REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) MRV (measuring, reporting and verification) services was tested on a tropical to sub-tropical test site. The 100 km by 100 km test site was situated in the State of Chiapas in Mexico. Land cover classifications were computed using RapidEye and Landsat TM optical satellite images and ALOS PALSAR L-band and Envisat ASAR C-band images. Identical sample plot data from Kompsat-2 imagery of one-metre spatial resolution were used for the accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy for forest and non-forest classification varied between 95% for the RapidEye classification and 74% for the Envisat ASAR classification. For more detailed land cover classification, the accuracies varied between 89% and 70%, respectively. A combination of Landsat TM and ALOS PALSAR data sets provided only 1% improvement in the overall accuracy. The biases were small in most classifications, varying from practically zero for the Landsat TM based classification to a 7% overestimation of forest area in the Envisat ASAR classification. Considering the pros and cons of the data types, we recommend optical data of 10 m spatial resolution as the primary data source for REDD MRV purposes. The results with L-band SAR data were nearly as accurate as the optical data but considering the present maturity of the imaging systems and image analysis methods, the L-band SAR is recommended as a secondary data source. The C-band SAR clearly has poorer potential than the L-band but it is applicable in stratification for a statistical sampling when other image types are unavailable.

TI  - Scalable Parcel-Based Crop Identification Scheme Using Sentinel-2 Data Time-Series for the Monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work investigates a Sentinel-2 based crop identification methodology for the monitoring of the Common Agricultural Policy's (CAP) Cross Compliance (CC) and Greening obligations. In this regard, we implemented and evaluated a parcel-based supervised classification scheme to produce accurate crop type mapping in a smallholder agricultural zone in Navarra, Spain. The scheme makes use of supervised classifiers Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Random Forest (RF) to discriminate among the various crop types, based on a large variable space of Sentinel-2 imagery and Vegetation Index (VI) time-series. The classifiers are separately applied at three different levels of crop nomenclature hierarchy, comparing their performance with respect to accuracy and execution time. SVM provides optimal performance and proves significantly superior to RF for the lowest level of the nomenclature, resulting in 0.87 Cohen's kappa coefficient. Experiments were carried out to assess the importance of input variables, where top contributors are the Near Infrared (NIR), vegetation red-edge, and Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) multispectral bands, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation (NDVI) and Plant Senescence Reflectance (PSRI) indices, sensed during advanced crop phenology stages. The scheme is finally applied to a Lansat-8 OLI based equivalent variable space, offering 0.70 Cohen's kappa coefficient for the SVM classification, highlighting the superior performance of Sentinel-2 for this type of application. This is credited to Sentinel-2's spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics.

TI  - Intraoperative consultation in gynecologic pathology.
T2  - Ceskoslovenska patologie
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Intraoperative consultation represents an integral part of diagnostic protocols in gynecologic oncology. It may be indicated 1) to evaluate the biologic nature of apathologic process (distinction between nonneoplastic lesions and tumors), 2) to classify the histologic type of tumor and assess its biologic behavior (typing), 3) to confirm or rule out the metastatic origin of atumor, 4) to determine the degree of differentiation and extent of local spread of amalignant tumor (grading and staging), 5) to detect tumor deposits in lymph nodes, 6) to examine surgical resection margins, 7) to detect products of conception in uterine curettings when ectopic pregnancy is suspected and 8) to collect native tumor tissue for ancillary studies (molecular methods, flow cytometry). Afrozen section of adnexal masses is commonly requested and focused primarily on the recognition of malignant tumors, the distinction between borderline tumors and carcinomas, and the identification of ametastatic process in the ovary. An intraoperative consultation may also be beneficial in the risk stratification of patients with endometrial carcinoma for the indication of lymphadenectomy, in the assessment of an endocervical surgical resection margin during fertility sparing and less radical surgery for the carcinoma of uterine cervix and in the detection of tumor spread into the lymph nodes (including sentinel lymph nodes). For the appropriate evaluation of afrozen section, awareness of the relevant clinical data and history of the patient, interpretation of the histologic findings in the context of macroscopic appearance of aspecimen and an active interaction with the surgeon are required as essential conditions. Keywords: intraoperative consultation - frozen section - gynecologic pathology - tumors of ovary - metastases - sentinel lymph node.

TI  - Diagnostic evaluation of sentinel lymph node biopsy using indocyanine green and infrared or fluorescent imaging in gastric cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SURGICAL ENDOSCOPY AND OTHER INTERVENTIONAL TECHNIQUES
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS) for gastric cancer using infrared visualization of indocyanine green (ICG) is intriguing because it may limit operative morbidity. We are the first to systematically review and perform meta-analysis on the diagnostic utility of ICG and infrared electronic endoscopy (IREE) or near infrared fluorescent imaging (NIFI) for SNNS exclusively in gastric cancer.A search of electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library using search terms "gastric/stomach" AND "tumor/carcinoma/cancer/neoplasm/adenocarcinoma/malignancy" AND "indocyanine green" was completed in May 2017. Articles were selected by two independent reviewers based on the following major inclusion criteria: (1) diagnostic accuracy study design; (2) indocyanine green was injected at tumor site; (3) IREE or NIFI was used for intraoperative visualization. 327 titles or abstracts were screened. The quality of included studies was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2.Ten full text studies were selected. 643 patients were identified with the majority of patients possessing T1 tumors (79.8%). Pooled identification rate, diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.99 (0.97-1.0), 380.0 (68.71-2101), 0.87 (0.80-0.93), and 1.00 (0.99-1.00), respectively. The summary receiver operator characteristic for ICG + IREE/NIFI demonstrated a test accuracy of 98.3%. Subgroup analysis found improved test performance for studies with low-risk QUADAS-2 scores, studies published after 2010 and submucosal ICG injection. IREE had improved diagnostic odds ratio, sensitivity, and identification rate compared to NIFI. Heterogeneity among studies ranged from low (I (2) < 25%) to high (I (2) > 75%).We found encouraging results regarding the accuracy, diagnostic odds ratio, and specificity of the test. The sensitivity was not optimal but may be improved by a strict protocol to augment the technique. Given the number and heterogeneity of studies, our results must be viewed with caution.

TI  - Reshaping International Relations: Theoretical Innovations from Africa
T2  - ALL AZIMUTH-A JOURNAL OF FOREIGN POLICY AND PEACE
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is based on the assumption that theoretical contributions from the global South - and in this case, from Africa, do not need to be radically different from existing theories to constitute an advancement in terms of engendering a better understanding of international relations. Reinterpretations or modifications of existing frameworks and the introduction of new concepts for understanding are equally important. This is an accepted practice in mainstream IR, where existing theories are constantly amended and revisited. One need only consider the various incarnations of realist thought. While adaptations and conceptual innovations by western scholars are recognised as legitimate and adopted into the canon of theory, this is not always the case with similar contributions emerging from outside of the West. This article will examine three examples of such contributions by African scholars. 1The first group of scholars reinterpreted the concept of "middle power," arguing that there are specific characteristics that set emerging middle powers like South Africa apart from traditional middle powers. The second, Deon Geldenhuys, developed the concept "isolated states" and generated a novel analytical framework to categorise states based on indicators of isolation. Finally, Thomas Tieku draws on the African worldview of ubuntu in calling for the state to be reconceptualised in a collectivist, societal way. It is hoped that these examples will illustrate that there are theoretical innovations emerging from the Global South that can assist us in not only better understanding international relations in a particular part of the world, but can in fact provide greater insights into the field as a whole.

TI  - Evaporite mineral mapping and determining their source rocks using remote sensing data in Sirjan playa, Kerman, Iran
T2  - CARBONATES AND EVAPORITES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, evaporite minerals of Sirjan playa, Iran were mapped using Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Landsat 8 images. Spectral angle mapper (SAM) was applied to map evaporite minerals of the study area. Two kinds of reference spectra were used for classifying the images that consist of: (1) recorded reflectance spectra of evaporite minerals and (2) image-derived spectra which were acquired from images based on GPS coordinates of samples. Determination of evaporite minerals assessed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) on field samples which were collected in October 2015 when the lake was completely dry. After image classification, the overall accuracy of 95.27% for Landsat 8 images and 91.81% for ASTER images were achieved, respectively, using image-derived spectra. SAM classification using samples' spectra showed lower accuracy of 85.96 and 80.31% for ASTER and Landsat images, respectively. Therefore, the image-derived spectra produced better classification accuracy. For determining the main source of inflows of the sediments into the playa, drainage system of Sirjan basin, that was derived using digital elevation model, false color composite image, mosaic of old aerial photographs and map of evaporite minerals were used. It showed that the main source of inflows of the sediments to the playa is from volcanic and sedimentary rocks of Urumieh-Dokhtar mountains located in the north-east and eastern parts of the playa.

TI  - Review of surface particulate monitoring of dust events using geostationary satellite remote sensing
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The accurate measurements of natural and anthropogenic aerosol particulate matter (PM) is important in managing both environmental and health risks; however, limited monitoring in regional areas hinders accurate quantification. This article provides an overview of the ability of recently launched geostationary earth orbit (GEO) satellites, such as GOES-R (North America) and HIMAWARI (Asia and Oceania), to provide near real-time ground-level PM concentrations (GLCs). The review examines the literature relating to the spatial and temporal resolution required by air quality studies, the removal of cloud and surface effects, the aerosol inversion problem, and the computation of ground-level concentrations rather than columnar aerosol optical depth (AOD).Determining surface PM concentrations using remote sensing is complicated by differentiating intrinsic aerosol properties (size, shape, composition, and quantity) from extrinsic signal intensities, particularly as the number of unknown intrinsic parameters exceeds the number of known extrinsic measurements. The review confirms that development of GEO satellite products has led to improvements in the use of coupled products such as GEOS-CHEM, aerosol types have consolidated on model species rather than prior descriptive classifications, and forward radiative transfer models have led to a better understanding of predictive spectra inter-dependencies across different aerosol types, despite fewer wavelength bands. However, it is apparent that the aerosol inversion problem remains challenging because there are limited wavelength bands for characterising localised mineralogy.The review finds that the frequency of GEO satellite data exceeds the temporal resolution required for air quality studies, but the spatial resolution is too coarse for localised air quality studies. Continual monitoring necessitates using the less sensitive thermal infra-red bands, which also reduce surface absorption effects. However, given the challenges of the aerosol inversion problem and difficulties in converting columnar AOD to surface concentrations, the review identifies coupled GEO-neural networks as potentially the most viable option for improving quantification.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article synthesizes recent advances in the study of astronomy and worldview in architectural and urban planning in Mesoamerica. Throughout most of this cultural area, the practice of orienting civic and ceremonial buildings followed similar principles, although regional and time-dependent variations are present. Analysis of alignment data has revealed the existence of distinct and widespread orientation groups; most refer to sunrises and sunsets on particular dates, although two groups can be related to lunar and Venus extremes. Astronomically relevant directions frequently dominate considerable parts of urban layouts. The orientation and the location of important buildings often were conditioned by astronomical criteria and beliefs about specific landscape features; particularly notable are structures that were aligned to prominent mountaintops on the local horizon. Based on a variety of contextual data, I interpret the uses and significance of orientations in terms of agricultural concerns, cosmological concepts, and political ideology. I outline the evolution of orientation practices, drawing attention to pan-Mesoamerican trends, regional patterns, and diffusion processes.

TI  - Diagnostic and prognostic value of additional SPECT/CT in sentinel lymph node mapping in breast cancer patients
T2  - NUKLEARMEDIZIN-NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study was to demonstrate the diagnostic and prognostic value of SPECT/CT in sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) in patients with invasive breast cancer. Methods: 114 patients with invasive breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes were included in this retrospective study as they were referred for SLNM with Tc-99m-na-nocolloid. Planar image acquisition was accomplished in a one-day or two-day protocol depending on the schedule of the surgical procedure. Low dose SPECT/CT was performed after the planar images. The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was considered false negative if a primary recurrence developed within 12 months after SLNB in the axilla from which a tumor-free SLN had been removed. Results: Between December 2009 and December 2011, 114 patients (pts.) underwent SLNM with additional SPECT/CT. Planar imaging identified in 109 pts. 139 SLNs, which were tumor-positive in 42 nodes (n = 41 pts.). SPECT/CT identified in 81 pts. 151 additional SLNs, of which 19 were tumor-positive and led to therapy change (axillary lymph node dissection) in 11 pts. (9.6 %). Of overall 61 tumor-positive SLNs (n = 52 pts.) SPECT/CT detected all, whereas planar imaging detected only 42 of 61 (P < 0.0001). No patient had lymph node metastasis within 12 months after SLNB in the axilla from which a tumor-free SLN had been removed resulting in a false-negative rate of 0 %. The local relapse rate was 1.8 % leading to a 4-year disease-free survival rate of 90 %. Conclusion: Among patients with breast cancer, the use of SPECT/CT-aided SLNM correlated due to a better anatomical localization and identification of planar not visible SLNs with a higher detection rate of SLNs. This led to therapeutic consequences and an excellent false-negative and 4-year disease-free survival rate.

TI  - PYSAT: Python Satellite Data Analysis Toolkit
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A common problem in space science data analysis is combining complementary data sources that are provided and analyzed in different formats and programming languages. The Python Satellite Data Analysis Toolkit (pysat) addresses this issue by providing an open source toolkit that implements the general process of space science data analysis, from beginning to end, in an instrument-independent manner. This toolkit uses an Instrument object that enables systematic analysis of science data from a variety of platforms within a single interface. Basic functions such as downloading, loading, and cleaning are included for all supported instruments. Common analysis routines are also included, which are instrument and data source independent. A nanokernel is used to provide instrument independence, it is attached to the Instrument object and mediates the systematic and arbitrary modification of loaded data. Pysat uses the nanokernel to improve the rigor of time series analysis, support on-the-fly orbit determination, and cleanly span file breaks. Pysat's functions and higher-level scientific analysis features are validated through the use of unit testing. Further adoption by the community provides a set of scientific results produced by a common core, constituting a distributed heritage that supports the validity of the underlying processing and scientific output. These features are used to demonstrate consistency between derived electron density profiles and measured ion drifts, particularly downward ion drifts in the afternoon hours during extreme solar minimum. Pysat builds upon open source Python software that is freely available and encourages community-driven development.

TI  - Winter Wheat Production Estimation Based on Environmental Stress Factors from Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid and accurate estimation of wheat production at a regional scale is crucial for national food security and sustainable agricultural development. This study developed a new gross primary productivity (GPP) estimation model (denoted as the [ACPM]), based on the effects of light, heat, soil moisture, and nitrogen content (N) on the light-use efficiency of winter wheat. The ACPM model used the quantic additivity of the environmental factors to improve the minimum form or multiple multiplication form in the previous model and thus characterized the joint effects of heat, soil moisture, and N on crop photosynthesis performance. The key parameters (i.e., light) were determined from the photosynthetically active radiation product of the Himawari-8 sensor and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation product of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The heat was determined from the land temperature products of MODIS. The soil moisture was obtained from the inversion using a visible and shortwave infrared drought index (VSDI), whereas the N stress of winter wheat was detected using the newly developed modified ratio vegetation index (MRVI), which could accurately obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of the leaf chlorophyll content of winter wheat. The ACPM and two other previous models (named the GPP1 and GPP2 models) were applied on the Himawari-8 and MODIS images in Hengshui City. The evaluation results, based on the ground measurement, indicated that the ACPM models exhibited the best estimate of dry aboveground biomass (DAM) and the wheat yield in Hengshui City, with errors of <10% and <12% for the DAM and yield, respectively. Considering the easy operation of the ACPM model and the accessibility of the corresponding satellite images, the Agriculture Crop Photosynthesis Model (ACPM) can be expected to provide information on the winter wheat shortfalls and surplus ahead of the availability of official statistical data.

TI  - Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques for Assessing Irrigation Performance: Case Study in Southern California
T2  - JOURNAL OF IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the potential of remotely sensed data in addressing spatially distributed irrigation equity, adequacy, and sustainability. The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) was implemented to map actual evapotranspiration (ET) over an irrigation district in southern California. Potential ET was also mapped based on the Priestley-Taylor method, modified to account for the effect of horizontally transported energy on enhancing/suppressing ET. Remotely sensed products were integrated with ground-based data in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment to quantify several irrigation and drainage performance indicators. The among- and within-field coefficients of variation of actual ET were comparable to previous studies, suggesting that water consumption was uniform across the irrigation district. The relative ET was high, indicating that irrigation supply was adequate. The extensive network of open drains was also found to be functioning at an optimal level according to the results of two performance indicators based on the magnitude and uniformity of groundwater depth.

TI  - The dynamics of vegetation coverage and its influencing factors in Yushenfu coalmine
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - To clarify the dynamics of fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) in Yushenfu coalmine, the spatiotemporal distribution and inter. annual changes of FVC were assessed using the pixel dichotomy model, linear regression trend and correction coefficient for topographic areas, based on the MOD13Q1 of MODIS data during 2005-2016. The relationships between FVC change and topography, land-use and land-cover change (LUCC) and mining activity were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) In the study period, FVC in Yushenfu coalmine showed drastic changes. The area with low VC was distributed in the south of Wulanmulun River and the north of Wuding River, while the area with high FVC was located in Shenfu mining and the south of Yuheng mining. (2) The inter. annual changes of FVC showed an improved trend with first descending and then raising from northeast to southwest, and areas with FVC improvement accounted for more than 90% of Yushenfu coalmine. (3) In the areas within elevation 899-1000 m, slope 8-12 degrees and plain, the mean FVC was the highest. The area ratio of vegetation improved type was the largest at the elevation 1000-1437 m, slope 4-28 degrees and hill. In addition, the overall vegetation situation of LUCC in 2010-2015 was better than that in 20052010, and vegetation was dominated by improved type. (4) Comparing the FVC in the ore occurrences, workshop, dumps, subsided land and buffer zone showed that mining activity had obvious influence on vegetation.

TI  - Microphysics and Radiation Effect of Dust on Saharan Air Layer: An HS3 Case Study
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - A Saharan air layer (SAL) event associated with a nondeveloping African easterly wave (AEW) over themain development region of the eastern Atlantic was sampled by the NASA Global Hawk aircraft on 24-25 August 2013 during the NASAHurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) campaign and was simulated with the NASA Unified Weather Research and Forecasting (NU-WRF) Model. Airborne, ground-based, and spaceborne measurementswere used to evaluate the model performance. The microphysical and radiative effects of dust and other aerosols on the SAL structure and environment were investigated with the factor-separation method. The results indicate that relative to a simulation without dust-radiative and microphysical impacts, Saharan dust and other aerosols heated the SAL air mainly through shortwave heating by the direct aerosol-radiation (AR) effect, resulting inawarmer (up to 0.6K) anddrier (up to 5% RHreduction) SAL andmaintaining the strong temperature inversion at the base of the SAL in the presence of predominant longwave cooling. Radiative heating of the dust accentuated a vertical circulationwithin the dust layer, in which air rose (sank) in the northern (southern) portions of the dust layer. Furthermore, above and to the south of the dust layer, both the microphysical and radiative impacts of dust tended to counter the vertical motions associated with the Hadley circulation, causing a small weakening and southward shift of convection in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and reduced anvil cloud to the north. Changes in moisture and cloud/precipitation hydrometeors were largely driven by the dustinduced changes in vertical motion. Dust strengthened the African easterly jet by up to; 1ms 21 at the southern edge of the jet, primarily through the AR effect, and produced modest increases in vertical wind shear within and in the vicinity of the dust layer. These modulations of the SAL and AEW environment clearly contributed to the nondevelopment of this AEW.

TI  - Risk of axillary recurrence after sentinel lymph node biopsy before neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. - In case of large breast cancer, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can be performed to reduce the size of the tumor and thus perform a conservative surgery. The place of the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in case of NAC is still debated. The main aim of this study is to assess the risk of axillary recurrence after negative SLNB before NAC.Methods. - It is a retrospective, observational and uni-centric study. We included 18 to 80-year-old patients with unilateral breast cancer requiring a NAC and with a negative SLNB before NAC. Our primary endpoint was axillary recurrence.Results. - Between August 2006 and October 2016, 64 patients had a negative GS performing before a NAC and did not benefit from axillary dissection after NAC. The average duration of follow-up was 37 months. During our follow-up, we did not find any cases of axillary recurrence.Conclusion. - This study supports the reliability of lymph node status assessment using the SLNB before CNA.

TI  - Sensitivity of the weather research and forecasting model to parameterization schemes for regional climate of Nile River Basin
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Regional climate models (RCMs) have been used to simulate rainfall at relatively high spatial and temporal resolutions useful for sustainable water resources planning, design and management. In this study, the sensitivity of the RCM, weather research and forecasting (WRF), in modeling the regional climate of the Nile River Basin (NRB) was investigated using 31 combinations of different physical parameterization schemes which include cumulus (Cu), microphysics (MP), planetary boundary layer (PBL), land-surface model (LSM) and radiation (Ra) schemes. Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA-Interim reanalysis data as initial and lateral boundary conditions, WRF was configured to model the climate of NRB at a resolution of 36 km with 30 vertical levels. The 1999-2001 simulations using WRF were compared with satellite data combined with ground observation and the NCEP reanalysis data for 2 m surface air temperature (T2), rainfall, short- and longwave downward radiation at the surface (SWRAD, LWRAD). Overall, WRF simulated more accurate T2 and LWRAD (with correlation coefficients > 0.8 and low root-mean-square error) than SWRAD and rainfall for the NRB. Further, the simulation of rainfall is more sensitive to PBL, Cu and MP schemes than other schemes of WRF. For example, WRF simulated less biased rainfall with Kain-Fritsch combined with MYJ than with YSU as the PBL scheme. The simulation of T2 is more sensitive to LSM and Ra than to Cu, PBL and MP schemes selected, SWRAD is more sensitive to MP and Ra than to Cu, LSM and PBL schemes, and LWRAD is more sensitive to LSM, Ra and PBL than Cu, and MP schemes. In summary, the following combination of schemes simulated the most representative regional climate of NRB: WSM3 microphysics, KF cumulus, MYJ PBL, RRTM longwave radiation and Dudhia shortwave radiation schemes, and Noah LSM. The above configuration of WRF coupled to the Noah LSM has also been shown to simulate representative regional climate of NRB over 1980-2001 which include a combination of wet and dry years of the NRB.

TI  - Gravity Maps of Antarctic Lithospheric Structure from Remote-Sensing and Seismic Data
T2  - PURE AND APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing data from altimetry and gravity satellite missions combined with seismic information have been used to investigate the Earth's interior, particularly focusing on the lithospheric structure. In this study, we use the subglacial bedrock relief BEDMAP2, the global gravitational model GOCO05S, and the ETOPO1 topographic/bathymetric data, together with a newly developed (continental-scale) seismic crustal model for Antarctica to compile the free-air, Bouguer, and mantle gravity maps over this continent and surrounding oceanic areas. We then use these gravity maps to interpret the Antarctic crustal and uppermost mantle structure. We demonstrate that most of the gravity features seen in gravity maps could be explained by known lithospheric structures. The Bouguer gravity map reveals a contrast between the oceanic and continental crust which marks the extension of the Antarctic continental margins. The isostatic signature in this gravity map confirms deep and compact orogenic roots under the Gamburtsev Subglacial Mountains and more complex orogenic structures under Dronning Maud Land in East Antarctica. Whereas the Bouguer gravity map exhibits features which are closely spatially correlated with the crustal thickness, the mantle gravity map reveals mainly the gravitational signature of the uppermost mantle, which is superposed over a weaker (long-wavelength) signature of density heterogeneities distributed deeper in the mantle. In contrast to a relatively complex and segmented uppermost mantle structure of West Antarctica, the mantle gravity map confirmed a more uniform structure of the East Antarctic Craton. The most pronounced features in this gravity map are divergent tectonic margins along mid-oceanic ridges and continental rifts. Gravity lows at these locations indicate that a broad region of the West Antarctic Rift System continuously extends between the Atlantic-Indian and Pacific-Antarctic mid-oceanic ridges and it is possibly formed by two major fault segments. Gravity lows over the Transantarctic Mountains confirms their non-collisional origin. Additionally, more localized gravity lows closely coincide with known locations of hotspots and volcanic regions (Marie Byrd Land, Balleny Islands, Mt. Erebus). Gravity lows also suggest a possible hotspot under the South Orkney Islands. However, this finding has to be further verified.

TI  - Quantifying suspended sediment dynamics in mega deltas using remote sensing data: A case study of the Mekong floodplains
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal and spatial concentrations of suspended sediment in floodplains are difficult to quantify because in situ measurements can be logistically complex, time consuming and costly. In this research, satellite imagery with long temporal and large spatial coverage (Landsat TM/ETM +) was used to complement in situ suspended sediment measurements to reflect sediment dynamics in a large (70,000 km(2)) floodplain. Instead of using a single spectral band from Landsat, a Principal Component Analysis was applied to obtain uncorrelated reflectance values for five bands of Landsat TM/ETM +. Significant correlations between the scores of the 1st principal component and the values of continuously gauged suspended sediment concentration, shown via high coefficients of determination of sediment rating curves (R-2 ranging from 0.66 to 0.92), permit the application of satellite images to quantify spatial and temporal sediment variation in the Mekong floodplains. Estimated suspended sediment maps show that hydraulic regimes at Chaktomuk (Cambodia), where the Mekong, Bassac, and Tonle Sap rivers diverge, determine the amount of seasonal sediment supplies to the Mekong Delta. The development of flood prevention systems to allow for three rice crops a year in the Vietnam Mekong Delta significantly reduces localized flooding, but also prevents sediment (source of nutrients) from entering fields. A direct consequence of this is the need to apply more artificial fertilizers to boost agricultural productivity, which may trigger environmental problems. Overall, remote sensing is shown to be an effective tool to understand temporal and spatial sediment dynamics in large floodplains.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Variation Due to Changes in Elevation in Northwest Vietnam
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is one of the most important variables for applications relating to the physics of land surface processes. LST rapidly changes in both space and time, and knowledge of LST and its spatiotemporal variation is essential to understand the interactions between human activity and the environment. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variation of LST according to changes in elevation. The newest version (version 6) of MODIS LST data for 2015 was used. An area of 40,000 km(2) (200 x 200 km(2)) in northwest Vietnam with elevations ranging from 8 m to 3165 m was chosen as a case study. Our results showed that the drop in LST with increased elevation varied throughout the year during both the daytime and nighttime. The monthly averages in 2015 and an altitude increase of 1000 m resulted in a decrease in LST ranging from 3.8 degrees C to 6.1 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C to 5.8 degrees C for the daytime and nighttime, respectively. This suggests that in any study relating to the spatial distribution of LST, the effect of elevation on LST should be considered. In addition, the effects of land use/cover and elevation distribution on the relationship between LST and elevation are discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 8, Sentinel 2, Aster, RapidEye and PlanetScope data and Sentinel 1- and Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)-Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR)-radar images have been evaluated for a karst feature inventory in the Black Hills area in Wyoming/South Dakota, USA. The GeoInformation System (GIS) integrated evaluation of the different satellite data included as well World Imagery files of ESRI and Bing Maps high resolution satellite data of Microsoft. The satellite data revealed several types of circular features related to karst such as enclosed depressions and collapsed dolines as well as traces of tectonic/structural features (visualized by lineament analysis) cutting through youngest sediments, influencing karstification processes. The origin of the circular features is complex and partly unknown, needing further investigations. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data, such as Aster- and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM data with 30 m and ALOS PASAR DEM with 12.5 m spatial resolution contributed to the detection of depressions, partly related to karst phenomena (sinkholes). Time series of satellite data reveal seasonal changes of the landscape and provide a data base for the documentation of the impact of climate change.

TI  - Efficacy of postoperative oral tepoxalin after decompressive surgery in dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis
T2  - THAI JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Twenty-three client-owned dogs with degenerative lumbosacral stenosis (DLS) treated by decompressive surgery were included in this study. The dogs were assigned to postoperative medication protocols of tepoxalin (10 mg/kg, SID) for 2 weeks (8 dogs, group 1), of tepoxalin (10 mg/kg, SID) for 6 weeks (7 dogs, group 2), and of carprofen (2 mg/kg, BID) for 2 weeks (8 dogs, group 3). Gait function after decompressive surgery of the dogs was evaluated by force plate analysis (FPA) and questionnaires filled out by their owners. FPA was performed before surgery, and at 4 days, 6 weeks, and 6 months after surgery. Peak vertical (Fz(+)), braking (F+'), and propulsive forces (Fy(-)), and also pelvic/thoracic (P/T) limb ratio of Fz(+) (P/TFz(+)), Fy(+) (P/TFy(+)), and Fy(-) (P/TFy(-)) were determined. Questionnaires were completed by the owners before surgery, and at 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery. During the period of the study, the Fz(+), Fy(+) and Fy(-) of the most affected pelvic limb were not different among the groups. The P/TFy(-) decreased at 4 days after surgery in all groups, but the difference was not significant. At 6 weeks and 6 months after surgery, there was no significant difference in the P/TFy(-) of the dogs in groups 1, 2, and 3. From the questionnaires, the majority of owners were moderately to very satisfied with the result of surgery. In conclusion, tepoxalin has similar postoperative anti-inflammatory and analgesic efficacy to carprofen in dogs with DLS that undergo decompressive spinal surgery.

TI  - Ultra-portable field transfer radiometer for vicarious calibration of earth imaging sensors
T2  - METROLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - A small portable transfer radiometer has been developed as part of an effort to ensure the quality of upwelling radiance from test sites used for vicarious calibration in the solar reflective. The test sites are used to predict top-of-atmosphere reflectance relying on ground-based measurements of the atmosphere and surface. The portable transfer radiometer is designed for one-person operation for on-site field calibration of instrumentation used to determine ground-leaving radiance. The current work describes the detector- and source-based radiometric calibration of the transfer radiometer highlighting the expected accuracy and SI-traceability. The results indicate differences between the detector-based and source-based results greater than the combined uncertainties of the approaches. Results from recent field deployments of the transfer radiometer using a solar radiation based calibration agree with the source-based laboratory calibration within the combined uncertainties of the methods. The detector-based results show a significant difference to the solar-based calibration. The source-based calibration is used as the basis for a radiance-based calibration of the Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager that agrees with the OLI calibration to within the uncertainties of the methods.

TI  - Development of SNP Panels as a New Tool to Assess the Genetic Diversity, Population Structure, and Parentage Analysis of the Eastern Oyster (<i>Crassostrea virginica</i>)
T2  - MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Culture of the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) is rapidly expanding. Combined with their continuing role as an environmental sentinel species and ecological model, this trend necessitates improved molecular tools for breeding and selection, as well as population assessment and genetic conservation. Here, we describe the development and validation of two panels of 58 single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNPs) for the species. Population analyses revealed three distinct populations, based on F-ST values and STRUCTURE, among wild oysters sampled from Delaware Bay (1), northwest Florida (2), Alabama (2), Louisiana (2), and the Texas Gulf Coast (3), consistent with previous microsatellite and mtDNA analyses. In addition, utilizing the developed panels for parentage assignment in cultured oysters (Rutgers, New Jersey) resulted in a highly accurate identification of parent pairs (99.37%). The SNP markers could, furthermore, clearly discriminate between hatchery stocks and wild-sourced individuals. The developed SNP panels may serve as an important tool for more rapid and affordable genetic analyses in eastern oyster.

TI  - Central Role of the NF-κB Pathway in the <i>Scgb1a1</i>-Expressing Epithelium in Mediating Respiratory Syncytial Virus-Induced Airway Inflammation
T2  - JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infection with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) produces profound inflammation. Despite an understanding of the role of adaptive immunity in RSV infection, the identity of the major sentinel cells initially triggering inflammation is controversial. Here we evaluate the role of nonciliated secretoglobin (Scgb1a1)-expressing bronchiolar epithelial cells in RSV infection. Mice expressing a tamoxifen (TMX)-inducible Cre recombinase-estrogen receptor fusion protein (CreERTM) knocked into the Scgb1a1 locus were crossed with mice that harbor a RelA conditional allele (RelA(fl)), with loxP sites flanking exons 5 to 8 of the Rel homology domain. The Scgb1a1(CreERTM/+) X RelA(fl/fl) mouse is a RelA conditional knockout (RelA(CKO)) of a nonciliated epithelial cell population enriched in the small bronchioles. TMX-treated RelA(CKO) mice have reduced pulmonary neutrophilic infiltration and impaired expression and secretion of NF-kappa B-dependent cytokines in response to RSV. In addition, RelA(CKO) mice had reduced expression levels of interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 1/7 (IRF1/7) and retinoic acid- inducible gene I (RIG-I), components of the mucosal IFN positive- feedback loop. We demonstrate that RSV replication induces RelA to complex with bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4), a cofactor required for RNA polymerase II (Pol II) phosphorylation, activating the atypical histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of BRD4 required for phospho-Ser2 Pol II formation, histone H3K122 acetylation, and cytokine secretion in vitro and in vivo. TMX-treated RelA(CKO) mice have less weight loss and reduced airway obstruction/hyperreactivity yet similar levels of IFN-gamma production despite higher levels of virus production. These data indicate that the nonciliated Scgb1a1-expressing epithelium is a major innate sensor for restricting RSV infection by mediating neutrophilic inflammation and chemokine and mucosal IFN production via the RelA-BRD4 pathway. IMPORTANCE RSV infection is the most common cause of infant hospitalizations in the United States, resulting in 2.1 million children annually requiring medical attention. RSV primarily infects nasal epithelial cells, spreading distally to produce severe lower respiratory tract infections. Our study examines the role of a nonciliated respiratory epithelial cell population in RSV infection. We genetically engineered a mouse that can be selectively depleted of the NF-kappa B/RelA transcription factor in this subset of epithelial cells. These mice show an impaired activation of the bromodomain-containing protein 4 (BRD4) coactivator, resulting in reduced cytokine expression and neutrophilic inflammation. During the course of RSV infection, epithelial RelA-depleted mice have reduced disease scores and airway hyperreactivity yet increased levels of virus replication. We conclude that RelA-BRD4 signaling in nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial cells mediates neutrophilic airway inflammation and disease severity. This complex is an attractive target to reduce the severity of infection.

TI  - Effect of orchard management, neighbouring land-use and shelterbelt tree composition on the parasitism of pest leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) larvae in kiwifruit orchard shelterbelts
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The parasitoid communities in organic and integrated pest management (IPM) kiwifruit orchards have previously been found to differ significantly, but we do not know if this affects the quality or quantity of biocontrol services. We compared parasitism of two leafroller (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) pest species, Ctenopseustis obliquana (Walker) and Cnephasia jactatana (Walker), in the two types of orchard. Within each orchard, we focussed on a large shelterbelt between the kiwifruit vines and an alternative land-use to also investigate whether the shelterbelts and neighbouring habitat were a source of pests or beneficial insects for these orchards. Sentinel larvae were used to determine both parasitoid identity and parasitism rate each month during the kiwifruit growing seasons in 2013/14 (16 orchards) and 2014/15 (12 orchards). The numbers of Tortricidae and parasitoids in the shelterbelt on each orchard in each month was also assessed in 2014/15. Four parasitoid species emerged from the sentinel larvae, although average parasitism rates were very low (1-3%). There were no detectable effects of orchard management, shelterbelt type or neighbouring land-use on parasitism rates. Parasitoid numbers were low in all orchards in 2014/15, although more parasitoids were collected from the IPM orchards than the organic ones. This may have been in response to the increasing numbers of Tortricidae in the shelterbelts on the IPM orchards during the season, a trend that was not observed in the organic orchards. Both shelterbelt composition and neighbouring land-use were found to affect total combined counts of Tortricidae and parasitoids, with higher counts in shelterbelts composed of Cryptomeria japonica and where adjacent land contained native bush or tree-based scrub. Each may therefore be a source of both taxa for the orchards. Modifications to the shelterbelts that increase parastoids but not Tortricidae are needed.

TI  - Changing snow seasonality in the highlands of Kyrgyzstan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Few studies have examined changing snow seasonality in Central Asia. Here, we analyzed changes in the seasonality of snow cover across Kyrgyzstan (KGZ) over 14 years from 2002/03-2015/16 using the most recent version (v006) of MODIS Terra and Aqua 8 day snow cover composites (MOD10A2/MYD10A2). We focused on three metrics of snow seasonality-first date of snow, last date of snow, and duration of snow season-and used nonparametric trends tests to assess the significance and direction of trends. We evaluated trends at three administration scales and across elevation. We used two techniques to assure that our identification of significant trends was not resulting from random spatial variation. First, we report only significant trends (positive or negative) that are at least twice as prevalent as the converse trends. Second, we use a two-stage analysis at the national scale to identify asymmetric directional changes in snow seasonality. Results show that more territory has been experiencing earlier onset of snow than earlier snowmelt, and roughly equivalent areas have been experiencing longer and shorter duration of snow seasons in the past 14 years. The changes are not uniform across KGZ, with significant shifts toward earlier snow arrival in western and central KGZ and significant shifts toward earlier snowmelt in eastern KGZ. The duration of the snow season has significantly shortened in western and eastern KGZ and significantly lengthened in northern and southwestern KGZ. Duration is significantly longer where the snow onset was significantly earlier or the snowmelt significantly later. There is a general trend of significantly earlier snowmelt below 3400 m and the area of earlier snowmelt is 15 times greater in eastern than western districts. Significant trends in the Aqua product were less prevalent than in the Terra product, but the general trend toward earlier snowmelt was also evident in Aqua data.

TI  - Characterization of landscape pattern based on land economic niche change: A case study in Ganzhou, Gansu Province, China
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use change has a profound impact on biodiversity and ecological processes, and is closely related to changes in landscape patterns. This paper introduces the theory and method of land economic niche into landscape ecology, which provides a new method for spatial characterization of urban and rural spatial landscape patterns. Based on this theory, this paper analyzes the landscape pattern of Ganzhou District by using Landsat images as data source in 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. We calculated the land economic niche by applying the niche potential theory. Combined with the theory of landscape ecology, we explored the effects of the land economic niche change on the landscape pattern at a county scale. The results show that economic niche of construction land, watershed and farmland increased during 1995-2015, and grassland declined significantly. The economic niche of farmland, construction land, watershed and grassland show a negative correlation with the number of patches (NP), fragmentation index (FN) and the fractal dimension index (FD), and had a positive correlation with the aggregation index (AI). There was no significant correlation between the forest land economic niche and landscape metrics. The change of land economic niche has a driving effect on the landscape pattern of the county, which can represent the economic development direction of Ganzhou District. The land economic niche is closely related to the landscape type which can directly obtain an economic benefit.

T2  - MOLECULAR IMAGING AND RADIONUCLIDE THERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: We investigated the utility of PET/CT in cutaneous melanoma (CM) patients with pathological negative sentinel lymph nodes (SLN), within the first year.Methods: The results of PET/CTs and SLN biopsy (SLNB) in 65 patients (39 male and 26 female, mean age 53.8) with a PET/CT in the first postoperative year were evaluated. Within this cohort, the utility of early PET/CT imaging was assessed in patients with negative SLNB. McNemar test was used to compare PET/CT findings with SLNB results.Results: Out of 43 patients with pathologically positive SLNs, 23 patients (53.5%) had positive and 20 patients (46.5%) had negative findings on PET/CT within the first postoperative year. On the other hand, PET/CT results of 22 patients with negative SLNBs were found to be negative in 19 patients (86.4%) and positive in 3 patients (13.6%). For the patients with negative SLNB results, the detection rate of distant metastasis with PET/CT was significantly lower (p<0.001) than that in patients with positive SLNBs.Conclusion: Our results showed that F-18-FDG PET/CT will most likely (86.4%) be negative during the first postoperative year in patients with a negative SLNB. Therefore, it is concluded that this modality would not provide any significant clinical contribution within this time frame.

TI  - Land cover and land use change analysis using multi-spatial resolution data and object-based image analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data and techniques are reliable tools for monitoring and studying urban land cover and land use (LCLU) change. Fine spatial resolution (FRes) commercial satellite image in conjunction with geographic object based image change analysis (GEOBICA) methods have been used to generate detailed and accurate urban LCLU maps. The integration of a backdating approach improves LCLU change classification results for the first date of a bi-temporal image sequences. Conversely, moderate spatial resolution satellite images such as those from Landsat sensors may not allow for detailed urban land use and land cover mapping. The objective of this study is to test a new bi-temporal change identification approach that integrates image classification of fine spatial resolution satellite imagery at time-2 and moderate spatial resolution satellite imagery (Landsat) at time-1, in a backdating and GEOBICA framework for mapping urban land use change. We compare the results from this approach to those of a GEOBICA approach based on fine spatial resolution imagery in both periods. The overall accuracy of the time-1 Landsat image classification is 0.82 and that of the fine spatial resolution image is 0.87. Moreover, the overall accuracy of the areal change data estimated from the pixel-wise spatial overlay of bitemporal FRes LCLU maps is 0.80 while that from overlaying a time-2 FRes-generated map to that from a Landsat time-1 image is 0.81. The proposed method can be used in areas that lack FRes data due to limited coverage in the early 2000s.

TI  - Estimating Satellite-Derived Bathymetry (SDB) with the Google Earth Engine and Sentinel-2
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry mapping forms the basis of understanding physical, economic, and ecological processes in the vastly biodiverse coastal fringes of our planet which are subjected to constant anthropogenic pressure. Here, we pair recent advances in cloud computing using the geospatial platform of the Google Earth Engine (GEE) with optical remote sensing technology using the open Sentinel-2 archive, obtaining low-cost in situ collected data to develop an empirical preprocessing workflow for estimating satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB). The workflow implements widely used and well-established algorithms, including cloud, atmospheric, and sun glint corrections, image composition and radiometric normalisation to address intra- and inter-image interferences before training, and validation of four SDB algorithms in three sites of the Aegean Sea in the Eastern Mediterranean. Best accuracy values for training and validation were R-2 = 0.79, RMSE = 1.39 m, and R-2 = 0.9, RMSE = 1.67 m, respectively. The increased accuracy highlights the importance of the radiometric normalisation given spatially independent calibration and validation datasets. Spatial error maps reveal over-prediction over low-reflectance and very shallow seabeds, and under-prediction over high-reflectance (<6 m) and optically deep bottoms (>17 m). We provide access to the developed code, allowing users to map bathymetry by customising the time range based on the field data acquisition dates and the optical conditions of their study area.

TI  - Land-Cover Change Analysis and Simulation in Conakry (Guinea), Using Hybrid Cellular-Automata and Markov Model
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, land-cover change in the capital Conakry of Guinea was simulated using the integrated Cellular Automata and Markov model (CA-Markov) in the Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing (RS). Historical land-cover change information was derived from 1986, 2000 and 2016 Landsat data. Using the land-cover change maps of 1986 and 2000, the land-cover change map for 2016 was simulated based on the Markov model in IDRISSI software (Clark University, Worcester, MA, USA). The simulated result was compared with the 2016 land-cover map for validation using the Relative Operating Characteristic (ROC). The ROC result showed a very strong agreement between the two maps. From this result, the land-cover change map for 2025 was simulated using CA-Markov model. The result has indicated that the proportion of the urban area was 49% in 2016, and it is expected to increase to 52% by 2025, while vegetation will decrease from 35% in 2016 to 32% in 2025. This study suggests that the rapid land-cover change has been led by both rapid population growth and extreme poverty in rural areas, which will result in migration into Conakry. The results of this study will provide bases for assessing the sustainability and the management of the urban area and for taking actions to mitigate the degradation of the urban environment.

TI  - The persistent decline of patterned woody vegetation: The tiger bush in the context of the regional Sahel greening trend
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Following 25 years of below average annual rainfall in the Sahel between 1970 and 1995, the return to more humid conditions has led to rapid postdrought recovery of the woody cover. However, the increase in the woody cover is not spatially homogeneous raising questions about the resilience of some woody vegetation types. Based on the analysis of field and remote sensing data collected on the tiger bush systems in the northern Sahel in Mali, this study noted the current and persistent degradation of these systems in the Sahel since the 1970s despite the recent improvement in rainfall since the mid-1990s and the general Sahel re-greening. Profound changes in the woody population pattern, tree density and cover, and floristic composition took place regardless of the site location along the south-north rainfall gradient. Associated with definite structural changes of the woody population, surface hydrology shifted from a sheet to concentrated run-off accelerating the collapse of the patterned woody population. Currently, there is no evidence in favour of reversing the current degradation process, at least at a decadal scale, although very sparse recolonization by pioneer woody vegetation has been observed in the driest sites along recently formed gullies. These observations support the hypothesis of an ecosystem shift, with long-term implications for the structure and functioning of the patterned vegetation, as well as the whole watershed landscape through increased run-off leading to stronger water flows in enlarged wadis, increased soil erosion upstream and sediment deposition downstream, enhanced water storage in ponds, and greater recharge of aquifers, which is an illustration of the "Sahelian paradox".

AB  - Planar lymphoscintigraphy (PL) has a lower detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in head and neck melanoma compared with other sites. We assessed situations when single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) identified nodes not seen by PL. We also evaluated the impact of SPECT/CT on surgical approach and oncologic outcomes.Patients who underwent SLN biopsy (SLNB) for head and neck melanoma with PL and SPECT/CT between November 2011 and December 2016 were included. Surgeons and radiologists completed a real-time survey inquiring about the utility of SPECT/CT. Patients were divided into two groups: patients with nodal basins identified by both PL and SPECT/CT ('PL + SPECT/CT'), and patients in whom SPECT/CT identified additional nodal basins not seen on PL ('SPECT/CT only'). Patient demographics and long-term outcomes including follow-up duration, recurrence, and survival are described.In the PL + SPECT/CT group, 73 (61.9%) patients were included and 45 (38.1%) patients were included in the SPECT/CT-only group. SPECT/CT added 51 basins to those seen on PL, primarily in the supraclavicular region (43.1%). Eighteen patients had positive node(s) in the PL + SPECT/CT group compared with two patients in the SPECT/CT-only group. Surgeons reported that 81% of the time, SPECT/CT influenced the location of incision for SLNB.SPECT/CT influences the location of incision and contributes most to identification of nodes in the supraclavicular region. It also detects additional SLN basins when compared with PL. Further studies are necessary to determine when these additional basins require sampling.

AB  - Background: Studies have suggested that statins may have a neuroprotective effect against epilepsy. However, evidence from rat models and case reports have suggested an opposite effect. Overall data are limited. Objective: To examine the association between statin use and epilepsy risk in a general population and in a healthy population (individuals with no severe comorbidities). Methods: Patients were Tricare beneficiaries from October 2003 to March 2012. Based on patients' characteristics during baseline phase (fiscal year [FY] 2004-2005), 2 propensity score (PS)-matched cohorts of statin users and nonusers were formed: (1) a PS-matched general cohort and (2) a PS-matched healthy cohort. Our outcome was defined using inpatient or outpatient ICD-9 codes for epilepsy during the follow-up phase (FY 2006 to March 2012) in the cohorts of statin users and nonusers. Results: The study included a total of 43 438 patients (13 626 statin users and 29 812 nonusers). The PS-matched general cohort matched 6342 statin users to 6342 nonusers; the odds ratio (OR) of epilepsy in this cohort during follow-up was 0.91; 95% CI = 0.67-1.23. The PS-matched healthy cohort matched 3351 statin users to 3351 nonusers; OR in the PS-matched healthy cohort during follow-up was 1.08; 95% CI = 0.64-1.83. Conclusions: This study did not demonstrate a significant beneficial or deleterious effect of statin use on risk of being diagnosed with epilepsy. Clinicians should not withhold statins, whenever indicated, in patients with epilepsy.

TI  - Choosing Wisely: Optimizing Routine Workup for the Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer Patient
T2  - CURRENT BREAST CANCER REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review The American Board of Internal Medicine Foundation's Choosing Wisely (CW) campaign has promoted a dialogue about avoiding unnecessary medical services since 2012. We review the evidence base, trends in utilization, and implications of CW recommendations relevant to the routine workup of newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer patients.Recent Findings There are several CW recommendations addressing routine workup of newly diagnosed breast cancer:Do not perform PET, CT, and radionuclide bone scans in the staging of early breast cancer at low risk for metastasis- These studies are obtained in 10-20% of patients, especially those with Stage IIB diseaseDo not routinely order breast MRI in new breast cancer patients with average risk- Evidence of long-term benefit to preoperative MRI is lacking, but approximately 1 in 4 breast cancer patients receive one, often leading to additional interventionsDo not routinely order specialized tumor gene testing in all new breast cancer patients- Evolving guidelines are expanding eligible populations for genetic assay driven clinical decision- making, with mixed implications for adjuvant chemotherapy utilizationDo not routinely use sentinel node biopsy in clinically node negative women >= 70 years of age with hormone receptor positive invasive breast cancer- The vast majority of such patients-85-90%-undergo sentinel node biopsy despite questions about the benefit of axillary staging in an elderly population.Summary CW recommendations offer a useful starting point for the discussion of optimal routine workup for breast cancer. Continued efforts are needed to define the marginal value of different tests and interventions and to develop mechanisms to incentivize and measure adoption of best practices.

TI  - Mapping Vegetation and Land Use Types in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve Using Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR) is a biodiversity hotspot in China that is part of a larger, multi-use landscape where farming, grazing, tourism, and other human activities occur. The steep terrain and persistent cloud cover pose challenges to robust vegetation and land use mapping. Our objective is to develop satellite image classification techniques that can reliably map forest cover and land use while minimizing the cloud and terrain issues, and provide the basis for long-term monitoring. Multi-seasonal Landsat image composites and elevation ancillary layers effectively minimize the persistent cloud cover and terrain issues. Spectral vegetation index (SVI) products and shade/illumination normalization approaches yield significantly higher mapping accuracies, compared to non-normalized spectral bands. Advanced machine learning image classification routines are implemented through the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform. Optimal classifier parameters (e.g., number of trees and number of features for random forest classifiers) were achieved by using tuning techniques. Accuracy assessment results indicate consistent and effective overall classification (i.e., above 70% mapping accuracies) can be achieved using multi-temporal SVI composites with simple illumination normalization and elevation ancillary data, despite the fact limited training and reference data are available. This efficient and open-access image analysis workflow provides a reliable methodology to remotely monitor forest cover and land use in FNNR and other mountainous forested, cloud prevalent areas.

TI  - Clinical practice guidelines in breast cancer
T2  - CURRENT ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPGS) concerning breast cancer (BCA) screening and management are available. Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of CPGS from various professional organizations and consensus groups with respect to their methodologic quality, recommendations, and implementability.Methods Guidelines from four groups were reviewed with respect to two clinical scenarios: adjuvant ovarian function suppression (OFS) in premenopausal women with early-stage estrogen receptor-positive BCA, and use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for locally advanced BCA. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO); Cancer Care Ontario's Program in Evidence Based Care (CCO's PEBC); the U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN); and the St. Gallen International Breast Cancer Consensus Conference were reviewed by two independent assessors. Guideline methodology and applicability were evaluated using the AGREE II tool.Results The quality of the CPGS was greatest for the guidelines developed by ASCO and CCO's PEBC. The NCCN and St. Gallen guidelines were found to have lower scores for methodologic rigour. All guidelines scored poorly for applicability. The recommendations for OFS were similar in three guidelines. Recommendations by the various organizations for the use of SLNB after NAC were contradictory.Conclusions Our review demonstrated that CPGS can be heterogeneous in methodologic quality. Low-quality CPG implementation strategies contribute to low uptake of, and adherence to, BCA CPGS. Further research examining the barriers to recommendations-such as intrinsic guideline characteristics and the needs of end users-is required. The use of BCA cpgs can improve the knowledge-to-practice gap and patient outcomes.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Bleed from Erosive Gastritis and Duodenitis: A Sentinel Event of Invasive Lobular Carcinoma of the Breast and a Diagnostic Dilemma
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Metastasis from breast cancer to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is uncommon, and such events presenting as GI bleeding are exceedingly rare. In some individuals, the absence of classical findings of primary breast cancer coupled with the non-specific nature of GI symptoms may make early detection and diagnosis challenging. Our patient is a 75-year-old female who presented with symptomatic anemia manifesting as progressive dizziness, weakness, and early satiety that developed eight days after right knee arthroplasty. She had a remote history of acid reflux disease and reported regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Physical examination was notable for pallor and tachycardia; the cardiopulmonary examination was otherwise unremarkable and the abdominal examination was normal. A fecal occult blood test was positive. Subsequent esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated significant erosive gastritis and duodenitis that was initially attributed to the patient's NSAID use. However, biopsy showed signet ring carcinoma. No gastric primary tumor was identified on work up. Extensive evaluation ultimately revealed invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast. Notably, no primary breast lesion had been detected on physical examination or breast mammography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Therapy for invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast is substantially different from gastric carcinoma and thus it is important to accurately diagnose the condition early in its course to optimize patient outcomes.

TI  - NIGHTTIME APPLICATIONS OF TWO FORMULATIONS OF PYRETHROIDS ARE EFFECTIVE AGAINST DIURNAL <i>AEDES ALBOPICTUS</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MOSQUITO CONTROL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The successful control of Aedes albopictus requires a multifaceted approach using a variety of integrated pest management techniques. Because this species is diurnal, nighttime ultra-low volume adulticide applications seem likely to miss resting mosquitoes and, therefore, are often met with skepticism. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of nighttime applications of pyrethroids with and without prallethrin to control caged and field populations of Ae. albopictus. During August and September of 2015, 2 adulticide applications were performed, treating 4 urban sites in the city of Trenton. We compared Anvil (R), which contains sumithrin and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), to Duet (TM), which contains sumithrin, prallethrin, and PBO. Because prallethrin excites resting mosquitoes to flight, we hypothesized that Duet would kill more mosquitoes, especially those resting in cryptic harborages. Comparing pretreatment and posttreatment adult mosquito numbers, Biogents Sentinel trap collections revealed twice as many mosquitoes were killed by Duet than by Anvil. For caged Ae. albopictus, both products performed comparably, with Duet achieving a slightly higher mortality in front yards and Anvil achieving a slightly higher mortality in backyards. It is clear that nighttime adulticide applications are effective against Ae. albopictus, and the need to continue efficacy data collection is important because adulticiding is a key component of disease control response.

T2  - MSMR
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - This report uses routinely collected data in the Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) to characterize the incidence and burden of medical conditions throughout the careers of service members separating from the active component of the U.S. Armed Forces between 1 October 2014 and 30 September 2015. Three surveillance periods between 30 September 2000 and 30 September 2015 were defined by each individual's time in service: early (first 6 months), middle (middle 6 months), and late (last 6 months). Overall, separating service members were most often aged 25-34 years (59.4%), male (84.0%), non-Hispanic white (64.0%), junior enlisted (52.4%), in the Marine Corps (33.1%), serving in a repair/engineering occupation (33.0%), and had never deployed (52.5%). The top five burden of disease categories across surveillance periods by sex were remarkably similar, including mental health disorders, which exhibited similar upward trends across the three surveillance periods (males: 1.3%, 17.0%, and 35.6%; females: 1.8%, 15.1%, and 32.4%, respectively). The most common diagnoses exhibiting upward, downward, or bimodal trends by incidence rate differences were mental health disorders, respiratory infections/diseases, and musculoskeletal diseases, respectively.

TI  - Improved segmentation and change detection of multi-spectral satellite imagery using graph cut based clustering and multiclass SVM
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Satellite image analysis automatically looks over an image to attain valuable information such as land cover classification and change detection from it. Generally, many image segmentation algorithms exploit specific spatial information between the pixel and its neighbors together with the color information to lengthen the cluster quality. Recently, a variety of clustering processes have been suggested to grasp data that is not linearly separable. The main issue in clustering algorithm is its inconsistency. To address this issue, the innovative spatial-spectral method for image segmentation and change detection based on Graph cut based clustering is proposed. In this hybrid approach, the Multispectral satellite images are preprocessed using Difference Of Offset Gaussian (DOOG) filters and then segmented by graph cut based clustering. Multi-class problems are highly expensive to solve, there is a need of a massive optimization problem. The changes between the classified images can be obtained by using image differencing method. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated with the temporal data sets of LANDSAT images. From the experimental results, it is observed that in the proposed work, the mean value of the changed area for a particular dataset achieves a 47.2% reduction compared to the conventional system.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Unlike in most other regions, Karakoram glaciers are either stable or advancing, a phenomenon known as the Karakoram anomaly. Despite studies of glacier surges and the derivation of surface velocity maps, the spatiotemporal variability of glacier dynamics still remains poorly understood, particularly in the Eastern Karakoram Range. We use Advanced Land Observing Satellite/the Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (ALOS/PALSAR)-1/2 data from 2007 to 2011 and 2014 to 2015 to examine detailed surface velocity patterns of the Siachen, Baltoro, Kundos, Singkhu and Gasherbrum Glaciers. The first three glaciers show considerable velocity variability (20-350 m a(-1)), with clear seasonal patterns. Although all glaciers, except for Baltoro, flow slowest in 2015, the velocity structures are individual and vary in space and time. In Gasherbrum Glacier, peak surge-phase velocities are seasonally modulated, with maxima in summers 2006 and 2007, suggesting surface melt plays an important role in maintaining the active phase. Given the relatively close proximity of these glaciers, we assume that surface melt timing and rates are comparable. We therefore argue that the observed spatiotemporal and interannual velocity patterns are determined by local and internal mechanisms, including englacial and subglacial hydrology, thermal processes and tributary configuration of each individual glacier.

TI  - Useful References in Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care: The 2017 Update
T2  - PEDIATRIC CRITICAL CARE MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Pediatric cardiac intensive care continues to evolve, with rapid advances in knowledge and improvement in clinical outcomes. In the past, the Board of Directors of the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society created and subsequently updated a list of sentinel references focused on the care of critically ill children with congenital and acquired heart disease. The objective of this article is to provide clinicians with a compilation and brief summary of updated and useful references that have been published since 2012.Data Selection: Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society members were solicited via a survey sent out between March 20, 2017, and April 28, 2017, to provide important references that have impacted clinical care. The survey was sent to approximately 523 members. Responses were received from 45 members, of which some included multiple references.Data Extraction: Following review of the list of references, and removing editorials, references were compiled by the first and last author. The final list was submitted to members of the society's Research Briefs Committee, who ranked each publication.Data Synthesis: Rankings were compiled and the references with the highest scores included. Research Briefs Committee members ranked the articles from 1 to 3, with one being highly relevant and should be included and 3 being less important and should be excluded. Averages were computed, and the top articles included in this article. The first (K.C.U.) and last author (K.M.G.) reviewed and developed summaries of each article.Conclusions: This article contains a compilation of useful references for the critical care of children with congenital and acquired heart disease published in the last 5 years. In conjunction with the prior version of this update in 2012, this article may be used as an educational reference in pediatric cardiac intensive care.

TI  - Land use and land cover changes in Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use changes are the land conversions from one type to another that alter the earth surface to satisfy mankind's immediate demand. Land use change detection using satellite imageries has emerged important mean to gather information on regional scale changes. Present study envisaged the spatio-temporal land use land cover changes of Kullu valley of Himachal Pradesh using LANDSAT imageries of 1989 and 2016. The results were verified through the secondary data as well as primary data collected by detailed survey of the Kullu valley (Kullu and Naggar blocks) and drivers for such changes were also identified. The studies were carried out for major land use type, viz. agriculture, orchard, forest and built up in the valley over a period of 27 years. Supervised classification was done using Maximum Likelihood Classification Algorithm through ERDAS Imagine 14 software. The results indicated that during last 27 years, the built up area has increased to the extent of 90.81% followed by orchards (12.39%) and forest (6.26%), whereas area under agriculture was decreased by 56.88%. The primary data revealed that farmers are abandoning the wheat, paddy, maize and barley crops and are pursuing cultivation of vegetable and fruit crops. Increased economic returns and climate change emerged as the probable drivers for the changes in the valley.

AB  - A forest fire in 2017 consumed about 184,000 hectares among which an important part of Nothofagus alessandrii forests, which is also an endangered species, was affected. Sentinel II images and the Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) indices were used to evaluate the fire severity on N. alessandrii forests. Results show that 172 hectares were affected by the fire (55 % of the known remaining forests). High severity and Moderate-high severity burn surface was 89 hectares (28 % of the total burned) and this would be the most difficult area to be recovered by the system.

TI  - Major Reduction in Axillary Lymph Node Dissections After Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy for Node-Positive Breast Cancer by combining PET/CT and the MARI Procedure
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 39th San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium
CL  - San Antonio, TX
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is frequently performed for node-positive (cN+) breast cancer patients. Combining positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) before-NST and the MARI (marking axillary lymph nodes with radioactive iodine seeds) procedure after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NST) has the potential for avoiding unnecessary ALNDs. This report presents the results from implementation of this strategy.All breast cancer patients treated with NST at the Netherlands Cancer Institute who underwent a PET/CT and the MARI procedure from July 2014 to July 2017 were included in the study. All the patients underwent tailored axillary treatment according to a protocol based on the combined results of PET/CT before NST and the MARI procedure after NST. With this protocol, patients showing one to three FDG-avid axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) on PET/CT (cN < 4) and a tumor-negative MARI node receive no further axillary treatment. All cN (< 4) patients with a tumor-positive MARI node receive locoregional radiotherapy, as well as patients with four or more FDG-avid ALNs [cN(4+)] and a tumor-negative MARI node after NST. An ALND is performed only for cN(4+) patients with a tumor-positive MARI node.The data of 159 patients who received a PET/CT before NST and a MARI procedure after NST were analyzed. Of these patients, 110 had one to three FDG-avid ALNs and 49 patients showed four or more FDG-avid ALNs on PET/CT before NST. For 130 patients (82%), ALND was omitted. Locoregional radiotherapy was administered to 91 patients (57%), and 39 patients (25%) received no further axillary treatment.Combining pre-NST axillary staging with PET/CT and post-NST staging with the MARI procedure resulted in an 82% reduction of ALNDs for cN + breast cancer patients.

TI  - Applying High-Resolution Imagery to Evaluate Restoration-Induced Changes in Stream Condition, Missouri River Headwaters Basin, Montana
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Degradation of streams and associated riparian habitat across the Missouri River Headwaters Basin has motivated several stream restoration projects across the watershed. Many of these projects install a series of beaver dam analogues (BDAs) to aggrade incised streams, elevate local water tables, and create natural surface water storage by reconnecting streams with their floodplains. Satellite imagery can provide a spatially continuous mechanism to monitor the effects of these in-stream structures on stream surface area. However, remote sensing-based approaches to map narrow (e.g., <5 m wide) linear features such as streams have been under-developed relative to efforts to map other types of aquatic systems, such as wetlands or lakes. We mapped pre- and post-restoration (one to three years post-restoration) stream surface area and riparian greenness at four stream restoration sites using Worldview-2 and 3 images as well as a QuickBird-2 image. We found that panchromatic brightness and eCognition-based outputs (0.5 m resolution) provided high-accuracy maps of stream surface area (overall accuracy ranged from 91% to 99%) for streams as narrow as 1.5 m wide. Using image pairs, we were able to document increases in stream surface area immediately upstream of BDAs as well as increases in stream surface area along the restoration reach at Robb Creek, Alkali Creek and Long Creek (South). Although Long Creek (North) did not show a net increase in stream surface area along the restoration reach, we did observe an increase in riparian greenness, suggesting increased water retention adjacent to the stream. As high-resolution imagery becomes more widely collected and available, improvements in our ability to provide spatially continuous monitoring of stream systems can effectively complement more traditional field-based and gage-based datasets to inform watershed management.

TI  - Glacier monitoring in the eastern mountain ranges of Bolivia from 1975 to 2016 using Landsat and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical glaciers are sensitive to climate variations and more than 95% of them are located in the South American Andes. The present study estimated current glacial surface extent in the eastern mountain ranges of Bolivia. Glacial surface changes were estimated using satellite images and available literature between 1975 and 2016. Sentinel-2 images were used, for the first time, for glacier mapping in the tropical Andes and Landsat imagery for glacial surface area change. Estimated glacial area reduction between 1975 and 2016 in Cordilleras; Apolobamba, Real, and Tres Cruces-Nevado Santa Vera Cruz was 48.8, 50.7, and 59.4%, respectively. Overall glacier shrinkage between 1975 and 2016 was 51% (from 543.9 to 266.5 km(2)). For the same period, total glacier area reduction in the Bolivian Cordillera Oriental below 5000 m a.s.l. was 91%. A prevalent southward glacial orientation was accounted for glaciers along the Cordillera Oriental of Bolivia. Furthermore, meteorological data analysis showed a positive trend in the air temperature and a negative trend in precipitation in the region. If current environmental conditions persist, no glacial surface at low elevations (5000 m a.s.l.) will remain in the future. This may seriously influence water resources in the region. Nevertheless, glaciers above 5500 m a.s.l. are considered relatively stable.

TI  - Risk stratification of sentinel node-positive melanoma patients defines surgical management and adjuvant therapy treatment considerations
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In light of the evolving landscape of adjuvant therapy in melanoma and the recently confirmed absent survival benefit of completion lymph node dissection (CLND), it becomes important to explore possible consequences of omitting CLND, and whether it is possible to adequately stratify positive sentinel node (SN) patients solely based on information retrieved from the melanoma up to the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB).Methods: A retrospective cohort from nine European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Melanoma Group centres was used. Patients were staged based on SLNB and CLND result according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) criteria and stratified by ulceration and SN tumour burden. These were incorporated in Cox regression models. Predictive ability was assessed using Harrell's concordance index (c-index) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC).Results: In total, 1015 patients were eligible. CLND led to upstaging in N-category in 19% and in AJCC stage in 5-6%. The model incorporating only ulceration and SN tumour burden performed equally well as the model incorporating substages after CLND. The model incorporating substages based on SLNB had the lowest predictive ability. Stratifying by ulceration and SN tumour burden resulted in four positive SN groups from which low-, intermediate- and high-risk prognostic classes could be derived.Conclusions: Adequate stratification of positive SN patients was possible based on ulceration and SN tumour burden category. The identification of low-, intermediate- and high-risk patients could guide adjuvant therapy in clinical practice. Omitting CLND seems to have little consequences. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Protected areas (PAs) represent real cornerstones in the conservation of biodiversity and natural habitats. Their protection must be a priority today for each society. The enhanced socio-economic requirements increase the pressure upon protected areas, and the effect can result in a reduction of biodiversity. The aim of this study is to quantify forest fragmentation in the pre- (1986-2002) and post-establishment (2002-2016) periods, inside and around (buffer 1, buffer 2 and buffer 3) Apuseni Natural Park (ANP), Romania, using a series of classified Landsat satellite images and six landscape metrics. The results show that forest fragmentation occurred both in the pre- and post-establishment periods, inside and around ANP. Inside the park, the deforestation rate increased four times, from 0.03% year(-1) in the pre-establishment period to 0.14% year(-1) in the post-establishment period. Around the park, the deforestation rate decreased from 0.31% year(-1) in the pre-establishment period (buffer 1) to 0.10% year(-1) in the post-establishment period (buffer 1). Forest fragmentation resulted in an increase in the patch density and edge density, and a decrease in the total core area and mean patch size leading to isolation of patches and fragmentation of landscape, especially in ANP in the post-establishment period. Several measures can be taken in order to stop forest fragmentation inside and around ANP, including the education of buffer-zone communities, reforestation, enforcement of park regulations, and forest legislation.

TI  - APPLICATION OF FINE QUAD-POLARIZATION RADARSAT-2 DATA AND SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES TO CLASSIFY OFFSEASON RICE PADDIES
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - In monsoon areas in Asia, most seasonal rice paddies are destroyed annually by flooding. To secure rice production, farmers in these areas grow off-season rice crops, which can be produced only with irrigated water. However, due to prevailing drought conditions, the cultivation of off-season rice crops cannot commence simultaneously. The availability of irrigated water is the critical factor for farmers in deciding when to begin off-season cultivation. To assess off-season rice production, a map of the cultivated area is required. Using multi-polarization/multi-temporal RADARSAT-2 data, this study aims to estimate and map the off-season rice paddies. The potential of using support vector machine classification to map off-season rice paddies with C-band SAR data was also established. Multi-temporal fine quad-polarization RADARSAT-2 data can be effectively used to estimate off-season rice cultivated areas.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ultralow-frequency wave and test particle models are used to investigate the pitch angle and energy dependence of ion differential fluxes measured by the Van Allen Probes spacecraft on 6 October 2012. Analysis of the satellite data reveals modulations in differential flux resulting from drift resonance between H+ ions and fundamental mode poloidal Alfven waves detected near the magnetic equator at L similar to 5.7. Results obtained from simulations reproduce important features of the observations, including a substantial enhancement of the differential flux between similar to 20 and 40 degrees pitch angle for ion energies between similar to 90 and 220 keV and an absence of flux modulations at 90 degrees. The numerical results confirm predictions of drift-bounce resonance theory and show good quantitative agreement with observations of modulations in differential flux produced by ultralow-frequency waves.

TI  - A Regional Mapping Method for Oilseed Rape Based on HSV Transformation and Spectral Features
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposed a colorimetric transformation and spectral features-based oilseed rape extraction algorithm (CSRA) to map oilseed rape at the provincial scale as a first step towards country-scale coverage. Using a stepwise analysis strategy, our method gradually separates vegetation from non-vegetation, crop from non-crop, and oilseed rape from winter wheat. The wide-field view (WFV) images from Chinese Gaofen satellite no. 1 (GF-1) at six continuous flowering stages in Wuxue City, Hubei Province, China are used to extract the unique characteristics of oilseed rape during the flowering period and predict the parameter of the CSRA method. The oilseed rape maps of Hubei Province from 2014 to 2017 are obtained automatically based on the CSRA method using GF-1 WFV images. As a result, the CSRA-derived provincial oilseed rape maps achieved at least 85% overall accuracy of spatial consistency when comparing with local reference oilseed rape maps and lower than 20% absolute error of provincial planting areas when comparing with agricultural census data. The robustness of the CSRA method is also tested on other satellite images including one panchromatic and multispectral image from GF-2 and two RapidEye images. Moreover, the comparison between the CSRA and other previous methods is discussed using the six GF-1 WFV images of Wuxue City, showing the proposed method has better mapping accuracy than other tested methods. These results highlight the potential of our method for accurate extraction and regional mapping capacity for oilseed rape.

TI  - Cloud Classification in Wide-Swath Passive Sensor Images Aided by Narrow-Swath Active Sensor Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a challenge to distinguish between different cloud types because of the complexity and diversity of cloud coverage, which is a significant clutter source that impacts on target detection and identification from the images of space-based infrared sensors. In this paper, a novel strategy for cloud classification in wide-swath passive sensor images is developed, which is aided by narrow-swath active sensor data. The strategy consists of three steps, that is, the orbit registration, most matching donor pixel selection, and cloud type assignment for each recipient pixel. A new criterion for orbit registration is proposed so as to improve the matching accuracy. The most matching donor pixel is selected via the Euclidean distance and the square sum of the radiance relative differences between the recipient and the potential donor pixels. Each recipient pixel is then assigned a cloud type that corresponds to the most matching donor. The cloud classification of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images is performed with the aid of the data from Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR). The results are compared with the CloudSat product 2B-CLDCLASS, as well as those that are obtained using the method of the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), which demonstrates the superior classification performance of the proposed strategy.

TI  - Modeling study of the ionospheric responses to the quasi-biennial oscillations of the sun and stratosphere
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a persistent oscillation in the zonal mean zonal winds of the low latitude middle atmosphere that is driven by breaking planetary and gravity waves with a period near two years. The atmospheric tides that dominate the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region (MLT, between heights of 70-120 km) are excited in the troposphere and stratosphere, and propagate through QBO-modulated zonal mean zonal wind fields. This allows the MLT tidal response to also be modulated by the QBO, with implications for ionospheric/thermospheric variability. Interannual oscillations in solar radiation can also directly drive the variations in the ionosphere with similar periodicities through the photoionization. Many studies have observed the connection between the solar activity and QBO signal in ionospheric features such as total electron content (TEC).In this research, we develop an empirical model to isolate stratospheric QBO-related tidal variability in the MLT diurnal and semidiurnal tides using values from assimilated TIMED satellite data. Migrating tidal fields corresponding to stratospheric QBO eastward and westward phases, as well as with the quasi-biennial variations in solar activity isolated by the Multi-dimensional Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (MEEMD) analysis from Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), are then used to drive the NCAR Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIE-GCM).The numerical experiment results indicate that the ionospheric QBO is mainly driven by the solar quasi-biennial variations during the solar maximum, since the solar quasi-biennial variation amplitude is directly proportionate to the solar cycle. The ionospheric QBO in the model is sensitive to both the stratospheric QBO and solar quasi biennial variations during the solar minimum, with solar effects still playing a stronger role.

M3  - Article
AB  - Forest biomass is a significant indicator for substance accumulation and forest succession, and can provide valuable information for forest management and scientific planning. Accurate estimations of forest biomass at a fine resolution are important for a better understanding of the forest productivity and carbon cycling dynamics. In this study, considering the low efficiency and accuracy of the existing biomass estimation models for remote sensing data, Landsat 8 OLI imagery and field data cooperated with the radial basis function artificial neural network (RBF ANN) approach is used to estimate the forest Above Ground Biomass (AGB) in the Mount Tai area, Shandong Province of East China. The experimental results show that the RBF model produces a relatively accurate biomass estimation compared with multivariate linear regression (MLR), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and backpropagation artificial neural network (BP ANN) models.

TI  - A robust Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI) for automated extraction of surface water from Landsat 8 OLI imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface water is vital resources for terrestrial life, while the rapid development of urbanization results in diverse changes in sizes, amounts, and quality of surface water. To accurately extract surface water from remote sensing imagery is very important for water environment conservations and water resource management. In this study, a new Multi-Band Water Index (MBWI) for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images is proposed by maximizing the spectral difference between water and non-water surfaces using pure pixels. Based on the MBWI map, the K-means cluster method is applied to automatically extract surface water. The performance of MBWI is validated and compared with six widely used water indices in 29 sites of China. Results show that our proposed MBWI performs best with the highest accuracy in 26 out of the 29 test sites. Compared with other water indices, the MBWI results in lower mean water total errors by a range of 9.31%-25.99%, and higher mean overall accuracies and kappa coefficients by 0.87%-3.73% and 0.06-0.18, respectively. It is also demonstrated for MBWI in terms of robustly discriminating surface water from confused backgrounds that are usually sources of surface water extraction errors, e.g., mountainous shadows and dark built-up areas. In addition, the new index is validated to be able to mitigate the seasonal and daily influences resulting from the variations of the solar condition. MBWI holds the potential to be a useful surface water extraction technology for water resource studies and applications.

TI  - On the classification of mixed floating pollutants on the Yellow Sea of China by using a quad-polarized SAR image
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored different methodologies using a C-band RADARSAT-2 quad-polarized Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image located over China's Yellow Sea to investigate polarization decomposition parameters for identifying mixed floating pollutants from a complex ocean background. It was found that solitary polarization decomposition did not meet the demand for detecting and classifying multiple floating pollutants, even after applying a polarized SAR image. Furthermore, considering that Yamaguchi decomposition is sensitive to vegetation and the algal variety Enteromorpha prolifera, while H/A/alpha decomposition is sensitive to oil spills, a combination of parameters which was deduced from these two decompositions was proposed for marine environmental monitoring of mixed floating sea surface pollutants. A combination of volume scattering, surface scattering, and scattering entropy was the best indicator for classifying mixed floating pollutants from a complex ocean background. The Kappa coefficients for Enteromorpha prolifera and oil spills were 0.7514 and 0.8470, respectively, evidence that the composite polarized parameters based on quad-polarized SAR imagery proposed in this research is an effective monitoring method for complex marine pollution.

TI  - Extraction of aquatic plants based on continuous removal method and analysis of its temporal and spatial changes-A case study of Guanting Reservoir
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims Screening of spectral characteristic variables is one of the important means for aquatic plant recognition, and it is widely applied in aquatic plant species identification. In this paper, a method for identifying aquatic plants species was constructed by combining extracted spectral feature information with the multi-temporal Landsat 8 OLI image data analysis.Methods In analyzing reflectance spectra of aquatic plants, the method of continuum removal for mineral analysis was introduced. The spectral resampling was performed on the measured spectral curve, and the spectral absorption depth was characterized by the continuous removal of the spectral resampling results. One-way ANOVA method was used to compare the seven spectral resampling bands and the three continuum removal absorption depth sensitive bands. Then the characteristic bands with significant differentiation of different aquatic plants were selected. The continuum removal was applied on remote sensing image processing. The results of the spectroscopic analysis were used to guide the identification of aquatic plants in using Landsat 8 OLI. The classification of aquatic plants was carried out by using support vector machine (SVM) classification.Important findings The results of the measured spectrum resampling are similar to the atmospheric calibration of Landsat 8 OLI in the same position, and the results of the measured spectral curves can be used to guide the classification of Landsat 8 OLI. The one-way ANOVA method was used to compare seven spectral resampling bands and three continuous systems in absorbing sensitive wavelengths. The results showed that the short wave infrared 1 band, which was processed by continuum removal (SWIR1CR), was the best in distinguishing different types of aquatic plants. In this paper, the continuum removal was applied on remote sensing image processing, and it was found that the SWIR1CR band can better distinguish the submerged plants and the emergent plants. The normalized differential vegetation index and SWIR1CR band were well capable of identifying submerged plants, floating plants and emergent plants. Based on the SVM classification method, the classification accuracies of aquatic plants were 86.33%. The distribution of aquatic plants showed that the aquatic plants were mainly distributed in shallow water areas of the south north bank of Guanting reservoir. When the aquatic plant distribution area reached the peak, it accounted for about 35.13% of the total area of the reservoir. The growth distribution of submerged plants changed significantly during a year. The stem and leaves of submerged plants began to emerge in early June. Aquatic plants began to wither in October, and aquatic plants accounted for only 20% of the total area in November.

TI  - Data fusion in data scarce areas using a back-propagation artificial neural network model: a case study of the South China Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The cloud cover for the South China Sea and its coastal area is relatively large throughout the year, which limits the potential application of optical remote sensing. A HJ-charge-coupled device (HJ-CCD) has the advantages of wide field, high temporal resolution, and short repeat cycle. However, this instrument suffers from its use of only four relatively low-quality bands which can't adequately resolve the features of long wavelengths. The Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper-plus (ETM+) provides high-quality data, however, the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) stopped working and caused striping of remote sensed images, which dramatically reduced the coverage of the ETM+ data. In order to combine the advantages of the HJ-CCD and Landsat ETM+ data, we adopted a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN) to fuse these two data types for this study. The results showed that the fused output data not only have the advantage of data intactness for the HJ-CCD, but also have the advantages of the multi-spectral and high radiometric resolution of the ETM+ data. Moreover, the fused data were analyzed qualitatively, quantitatively and from a practical application point of view. Experimental studies indicated that the fused data have a full spatial distribution, multi-spectral bands, high radiometric resolution, a small difference between the observed and fused output data, and a high correlation between the observed and fused data. The excellent performance in its practical application is a further demonstration that the fused data are of high quality.

TI  - Quantitative Measurement of Bedding Orientation Using Remote Sensing Data: Yili Basin, Northwest China
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bedding orientation measurement is a remote sensing application used in the field of geology, but the results are often unsatisfactory when the bed is dislocated along the strike direction. This paper proposes a new method called multiple-line method that is designed to improve bedding orientation measurement. This technique uses the bed as a vector, and fits the vectors as a plane to obtain the bedding orientation. This study employs the case of Yili Basin and measures 25 bedding orientations using the multiple-point and multiple-line methods, respectively. The result shows that the errors from the multiple-line method are mostly smaller than those from the multiple-point method when a bed is discontinuous.

TI  - Retrieving Three-Dimensional Co-Seismic Deformation of the 2017 Mw7.3 Iraq Earthquake by Multi-Sensor SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mw7.3 Iraq earthquake on 12 November 2017 was the largest recorded earthquake in the Zagros Mountains since 1900. In order to quantitatively analyze the co-seismic deformation caused by this earthquake, both the ascending and descending SAR images from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's ALOS-2 and the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1A satellites were collected to implement the conventional differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR), multiple aperture InSAR (MAI), and azimuth pixel offset (AZO) methods. Subsequently, the three-dimensional (3D) deformation field was reconstructed over an area of about 60 x 70 km(2) by a combined use of the line-of-sight (LOS) motion (detected by the DInSAR method) and the along-track (AT) motion (detected by the MAI method) through the weighted least square method. The experiment indicates that the ALOS-2 satellite performs better than the Sentinel-1A sensor in larger-magnitude earthquake deformation monitoring. Furthermore, the MAI method based on phase differencing has a better performance than the AZO method based on SAR amplitude correlation, as long as the coherence of the interferograms is sufficient. The maximum co-seismic displacements in the up-down, north-south, and east-west directions are approximately 100 cm, 100 cm, and -50 cm, respectively. After comparative analysis between the obtained 3D deformation field and the simulated deformation field with the fault parameters published by the USGS (United States Geological Survey), both co-seismic deformation fields are highly coincident, and the residuals between both (in different directions/dimensional) are in the magnitude of centimeters. Considering the geological structure in the earthquake region and factors of the LOS and 3D co-seismic deformationsuch as the trend and location of the deformation bound, the different sign of displacements in hanging wall and footwall, and the locations of mainshock and aftershockthe preliminary conclusion is that the Zagros Mountain Front fault is responsible for the earthquake.

TI  - The Simple Concurrent Online Processing System (SCOPS) - An open-source interface for remotely sensed data processing
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in technology allow remotely sensed data to be acquired with increasingly higher spatial and spectral resolutions. These data may then be used to influence government decision making and solve a number of research and application driven questions. However, such large volumes of data can be difficult to handle on a single personal computer or on older machines with slower components. Often the software required to process data is varied and can be highly technical and too advanced for the novice user to fully understand. This paper describes an open-source tool, the Simple Concurrent Online Processing System (SCOPS), which forms part of an airborne hyperspectral data processing chain that allows users accessing the tool over a web interface to submit jobs and process data remotely. It is demonstrated using Natural Environment Research Council Airborne Research Facility (NERC-ARF) instruments together with other free- and open-source tools to take radiometrically corrected data from sensor geometry into geocorrected form and to generate simple or complex band ratio products. The final processed data products are acquired via an HTTP download. SCOPS can cut data processing times and introduce complex processing software to novice users by distributing jobs across a network using a simple to use web interface.

TI  - Early-Stage Deforestation Detection in the Tropics With <i>L</i>-band SAR
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Fort Worth, TX
AB  - Polarimetric characteristics of early-stage deforestation areas were examined with L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to develop a forest early warning system. Time series of PALSAR-2/ScanSAR data and Landsat data were used to examine the differences in detection timing of deforestation in the most active deforestation sites in Peru and Brazil. The gamma(0)(HH) value increased by 0.8 dB on average for areas undergoing early-stages of deforestation, in which felled trees were left on the ground. The detection timing was almost the same as that of using the optical sensor. On the other hand, the gamma(0)(HV) value does not show significant gamma(0) change at this early-stage of deforestation. The gamma(0)(HV) value started to decrease 1-1.5 months after the deforestation was detected by Landsat. The gamma(0)(HV) value decreased by 1.5-1.6 dB, 4-5 months after the deforestation. To understand the radar backscattering mechanism at the early-stage deforestation sites, field experiments were carried out 2-16 days after the PALSAR-2/fully-polarimetric observations. The early-stage deforestation sites revealed 1.1-2.5 dB and 2.9-4.0 dB increases for sigma(0)(HH) and sigma(0)(surface), respectively. This can be explained by the direct (single bounce) scattering from felled trees left on the ground. The sites in which felled trees were removed and the surfaces were flattened showed 5.2-5.3 dB and 5.3-5.5 dB decreases for sigma(0)(HV) and sigma(0)(volume), respectively. This can be explained by the lower sensitivity of the HV polarization to both the branches remaining on the ground and the surface roughness, along with its increased sensitivity to the forest biomass. We conclude that an increase in L-band gamma(0)(HH) is a good indicator for detecting early-stage deforestation sites, where felled trees are left on the ground, while gamma(0)(HV) may be useful for detecting later-stage deforestation sites.

TI  - Adaptive population divergence and directional gene flow across steep elevational gradients in a climate-sensitive mammal
T2  - MOLECULAR ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological effects of climate change have been shown in most major taxonomic groups; however, the evolutionary consequences are less well-documented. Adaptation to new climatic conditions offers a potential long-term mechanism for species to maintain viability in rapidly changing environments, but mammalian examples remain scarce. The American pika (Ochotona princeps) has been impacted by recent climate-associated extirpations and range-wide reductions in population sizes, establishing it as a sentinel mammalian species for climate change. To investigate evidence for local adaptation and reconstruct patterns of genomic diversity and gene flow across rapidly changing environments, we used a space-for-time design and restriction site-associated DNA sequencing to genotype American pikas along two steep elevational gradients at 30,966 SNPs and employed independent outlier detection methods that scanned for genotype-environment associations. We identified 338 outlier SNPs detected by two separate analyses and/or replicated in both transects, several of which were annotated to genes involved in metabolic function and oxygen transport. Additionally, we found evidence of directional gene flow primarily downslope from high-elevation populations, along with reduced gene flow at outlier loci. If this trend continues, elevational range contractions in American pikas will likely be from local extirpation rather than upward movement of low-elevation individuals; this, in turn, could limit the potential for adaptation within this landscape. These findings are of particular relevance for future conservation and management of American pikas and other elevationally restricted, thermally sensitive species.

TI  - A tale of two wildfires; testing detection and prediction of invasive species distributions using models fit with topographic and spectral indices
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Developing species distribution models (SDMs) to detect invasive species cover and evaluate habitat suitability are high priorities for land managers.We tested SDMs fit with different variable combinations to provide guidelines for future invasive species model development based on transferability between landscapes.Generalized linear model, boosted regression trees, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and Random Forests were fit with location data for high cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) cover in situ for two post-burn sites independently using topographic indices, spectral indices derived from multiple dates of Landsat 8 satellite imagery, or both. Models developed for one site were applied to the other, using independent cheatgrass cover data from the respective ex situ site to test model transferability.Fitted models were statistically robust and comparable when fit with at least 200 cover plots in situ and transferred to the ex situ site. Only the Random Forests models were robust when fit with a small number of cover plots in situ.Our study indicated spectral indices can be used in SDMs to estimate species cover across landscapes (e.g., both within the same Landsat scene and in an adjacent Landsat scene). Important considerations for transferability include the model employed, quantity of cover data used to train/test the models, and phenology of the species coupled with the timing of imagery. The results also suggest that when cover data are limited, SDMs fit with topographic indices are sufficient for evaluating cheatgrass habitat suitability in new post-disturbance landscapes; however, spectral indices can provide a more robust estimate for detection based on local phenology.

TI  - A new synergistic approach for monitoring wetlands using Sentinels-1 and 2 data with object-based machine learning algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work the synergistic use of Sentinel-1 and 2 combined with the System for Automated Geo-scientific Analyses (SAGA) Wetness Index in the content of land use/cover (LULC) mapping with emphasis in wetlands is evaluated. A further objective has been to develop a new Object-based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach for mapping wetland areas using Sentinel-1 and 2 data, where the latter is also tested against two popular machine learning algorithms (Support Vector Machines - SVMs and Random Forests - RFs). The highly vulnerable iSimangaliso Wetland Park was used as the study site. Results showed that two-part image segmentation could efficiently create object features across the study area. For both classification algorithms, an increase in overall accuracy was observed when the full synergistic combination of available datasets. A statistically significant difference in classification accuracy at all levels between SVMs and RFs was also reported, with the latter being up to 2.4% higher. SAGA wetness index showed promising ability to distinguish wetland environments, and in combination with Sentinel-1 and 2 synergies can successfully produce a land use and land cover classification in a location where both wetland and non-wetland classes exist.

TI  - TerraSAR-X and Wetlands: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Since its launch in 2007, TerraSAR-X observations have been widely used in a broad range of scientific applications. Particularly in wetland research, TerraSAR-X's shortwave X-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) possesses unique capabilities, such as high spatial and temporal resolution, for delineating and characterizing the inherent spatially and temporally complex and heterogeneous structure of wetland ecosystems and their dynamics. As transitional areas, wetlands comprise characteristics of both terrestrial and aquatic features, forming a large diversity of wetland types. This study reviews all published articles incorporating TerraSAR-X information into wetland research to provide a comprehensive study of how this sensor has been used with regard to polarization, and the function of the data, time-series analyses, or the assessment of specific wetland ecosystem types. What is evident throughout this literature review is the synergistic fusion of multi-frequency and multi-polarization SAR sensors, sometimes optical sensors, in almost all investigated studies to attain improved wetland classification results. Due to the short revisiting time of the TerraSAR-X sensor, it is possible to compute dense SAR time-series, allowing for a more precise observation of the seasonality in dynamic wetland areas as demonstrated in many of the reviewed studies.

TI  - Surgical Treatment for Extramammary Paget's Disease
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is a rare, slow growing non-melanoma skin cancer. Diagnosis is often significantly delayed, since clinical presentation may resemble common benign dermatoses. Treatment is characterized by high recurrence rates. This is in part due to ill-defined margins and by frequent development of satellites. Improvement of outcome needs a better preoperative planning with fluorescence diagnostics or scouting biopsies. Mohs micrographic surgery has some advantages for patients, such as reduced relapse rates and prolonged relapse-free survival. Improved identification of Paget cells in cryosections by immunostainings or alternatively the use of delayed Mohs with formalin-fixed material reduces the rate of false-negative results. Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment.

TI  - Mapping Progression and Severity of a Southern Colorado Spruce Beetle Outbreak Using Calibrated Image Composites
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - An ongoing spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby.) epidemic in southern Colorado has resulted in the death of thousands of acres of forests primarily dominated by Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry.). To evaluate the ecological and economic impacts of this massive mortality event, researchers and land managers need to efficiently track its progression, spread, and severity across large spatial extents. In this study, mortality severity (0-100% dead) was successfully mapped at the Landsat pixel scale (30 x 30 m) across a large (5000 km(2)), persistently cloud-covered study area using multi-sensor (Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)) harmonized tasseled cap image composites as spectral predictors of gray stage spruce beetle mortality. Our maps display the distribution and severity of this landscape-scale mortality event in 2011 (R-2 = 0.48, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 7.7) and 2015 (R-2 = 0.55, RMSE = 11.6). Potential applications of this study include efficient landscape-scale forest health monitoring, targeted forest and timber management, and assessment of ecological impacts of bark beetle outbreaks.

TI  - Influence of reconstruction scale, spatial resolution and pixel spatial relationships on the sub-pixel mapping accuracy of a double-calculated spatial attraction model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mixed pixels universally exist in remote sensing images, and they are one of the main obstacles for further improving the accuracy of land cover recognition and classification. Since the concept of sub-pixel mapping (SPM) is proposed, SPM technology has rapidly become an important method to solve the problem of mixed pixels. To further improve SPM accuracy, this paper first proposes a double-calculated spatial attraction model (DSAM) combining the advantages of the spatial attraction model (SAM) and the pixel swap model (PSM). Then, based on the full validation of the proposed DSAM, how multiple factors affect the SPM accuracy is analyzed using the multispectral remote sensing (MRS) images. Finally, by analyzing the maximum variations in the ranges of the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient under different multiple factors, the order of factors influencing SPM accuracy is determined as follows: reconstruction scale > image spatial resolution > pixel spatial relationships. The results can serve as a reference for other scholars in setting model parameters and selecting the appropriate remote sensing data, thereby helping them achieve more accurate SPM results.

TI  - Fusion of Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data With a Novel Ensemble Classifier
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the development of sensors and data acquisition technology, the fusion of features from multiple sensors is a very hot topic. In this letter, the use of morphological features to fuse a hyperspectral (HS) image and a light detection and ranging (LiDAR)-derived digital surface model (DSM) is exploited via an ensemble classifier. In each iteration, we first apply morphological openings and closings with a partial reconstruction on the first few principal components (PCs) of the HS and LiDAR data sets to produce morphological features to model spatial and elevation information for HS and LiDAR data sets. Second, three groups of features (i.e., spectral and morphological features of HS and LiDAR data) are split into several disjoint subsets. Third, data transformation is applied to each subset and the features extracted in each subset are stacked as the input of a random forest classifier. Three data transformation methods, including PC analysis, linearity preserving projection, and unsupervised graph fusion, are introduced into the ensemble classification process. Finally, we integrate the classification results achieved at each step by a majority vote. Experimental results on coregistered HS and LiDAR-derived DSM demonstrate the effectiveness and potentialities of the proposed ensemble classifier.

TI  - Support vector regression snow-depth retrieval algorithm using passive microwave remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Snow cover is an informative indicator of climate change because it can affect local and regional surface energy and water balance, hydrological processes and climate, and ecosystem function. Passive microwave (PM) remote sensing data have long been used to retrieve snow depth and snow water equivalent with large uncertainties. The objective of this study is to develop snow-depth retrieval algorithm based on support vector regression (SVR) technique using PM remote sensing data and other auxiliary data. Ground-based daily snow depth data from 1223 stations across Eurasian continent were used to construct and validate the snow-depth retrieval algorithm. This SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm partitioned three snow cover stages, and four land cover types then generated twelve snow-depth models for each phases. A non-linear regression method based on support vector regression (SVR) was used to retrieve snow depth with PM brightness temperatures, location (latitude and longitude), and terrain parameters (elevation) as input data and land cover as auxiliary data. In addition, we compared the performance of the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm with four alternative algorithms: the Chang algorithm, the Spectral Polarization Difference (SPD) algorithm, the Artificial/Neural Networks (ANN) and, an algorithm based on linear regression. Comparing results obtained from these five snow-depth retrieval algorithms against the ground-based daily snow depth data, the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm performs much superior with reduced uncertainties. We report the results aimed at evaluating the impact of the variation of snow cover stages and land cover types. The preliminary results suggest that the SVR snow-depth algorithm could detect deep snow with high accuracy and decrease the impact of saturation effects. These results suggest that the SVR snow-depth retrieval algorithm integrating PM remote sensing data and other auxiliary data (land cover types, location, terrain, snow cover stage with indirectly considering grain size variation) can be a more efficient and effective algorithm for retrieving snow depth and snow water equivalent over various scales.

TI  - Effects of Infrastructure on Land Use and Land Cover Change (LUCC): The Case of Hangzhou International Airport, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an analysis of the land use and land cover change (LUCC) of major infrastructure construction as exemplified by the case of Hangzhou International Airport (HIA, Hangzhou, China), which is one of the busiest airports in Eastern China. The airport's effect on LUCC is evaluated by comparing the actual pattern from 1996 to 2001 with a counterfactual simulated land use pattern that would have occurred without the intervention of airport construction. This research is based on land use maps from Landsat images that were analyzed by supervised classification and visual interpretation. To simulate the land use pattern occurring without airport construction, the counterfactual, we applied a cellular automata (CA)-Markov model. Through before and after comparison, we found that cultivated land has decreased and that constructed land has increased because of airport construction. However, according to the counterfactual scenario, airport construction to some extent prevented a decrease in cultivated land and decelerated the expansion of constructed land at a small scale and in the short term. We discuss several reasons for this result, including governmental regulations, such as the setting of the airport clearance area for the safety of plane take-off and landing, the adverse effects of aviation noise or pollution, which may limit the construction activities in the surrounding areas of the airport, and, importantly, the unique land use and land management system in China, mainly the cultivated land requisition-compensation balance policy. We conclude that (1) the counterfactual CA-Markov model simulation is a suitable and unbiased way of evaluating the effect of infrastructure on LUCC that can solve the deficiency in the previous literature relying on before and after comparisons and (2) regulatory, economic, and institutional factors should be considered when explaining and assessing the LUCC due to large infrastructure projects, such as airports, in China and in other countries.

TI  - Improving Geometric Performance for Imagery Captured by Non-Cartographic Optical Satellite: A Case Study of GF-1 WFV Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous countries have established their own Earth observing systems (EOSs) for global change research. Data acquisition efforts are generally only concerned with the completion of the mission regardless of the potential to expand into other areas, which reduces the application effectiveness of Earth observation data. This paper explores the cartographic possibility of images being not initially intended for surveying and mapping, and a novel method is proposed to improve the geometric performance. First, the rigorous sensor model (RSM) is recovered from the rational function model (RFM), and then the system errors of the non-cartographic satellite's imagery are compensated by using the conventional geometric calibration method based on RSM; finally, a new and improved RFM is generated. The advantage of the method over traditional ones is that it divides the errors into static errors and non-static errors for each image during the improvement process. Experiments using images collected with the Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide-field view (WFV) camera demonstrate that the orientation accuracy of the proposed method is within 1 pixel for both calibration and validation images, and the obvious high-order system errors are eliminated. Moreover, a block adjustment test shows that the vertical accuracy is improved from 21 m to 11 m with four ground control points (GCPs) after compensation, which can fulfill requirements for 1:100,000 stereo mapping in mountainous areas. Generally, the proposed method can effectively improve the geometric potential for images captured by non-cartographic satellite.

TI  - Use of Landsat thermal imagery for dynamically monitoring spontaneous combustion of Datong Jurassic coalfields in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - It is highly helpful and necessary to investigate and monitor the status of coal seam. Fortunately, remote sensing has facilitated the identification and dynamical monitoring of spontaneous combustion for a large area coal mining area, especially using the time series remotely-sensed datasets. In this paper, Datong Jurassic coal mining area is used as the study area, China, and an exclusion method and a multiple-factor analysis method are jointly used to identify the spontaneous combustion, including land surface temperature (LST), burnt rocks, and land use and land cover change (LUCC). The LST is firstly retrieved using a single-window algorithm due to a thermal infrared band of Landsat-5 TM (Thematic Mapper). Burnt rocks is then extracted using a decision-tree classification method based on a high-resolution SPOT-5 image. The thermal anomaly areas are identified and refined by the spatial overlay analysis of the above affecting factors. Three-period maps of coal fire areas are obtained and dynamically analyzed in 2007, 2009 and 2010. The results show that a total of 12 coal fire areas have been identified, which account for more than 1% of the total area of the study area. In general, there is an increasing trend yearly and a total of 771,970 m is increased. The average annual increase is 257,320 m, the average annual growth rate is 3.78%, and the dynamic degree is 11.29%.

TI  - Assessing the impact of the Kuroshio Current on vertical cloud structure using CloudSat data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study analyzed CloudSat satellite data to determine how the warm ocean Kuroshio Current affects the vertical structure of clouds. Rainfall intensity around the middle troposphere (6 km in height) over the Kuroshio was greater than that over surrounding areas. The drizzle clouds over the Kuroshio have a higher frequency of occurrence of geometrically thin (0.5-3 km) clouds and thicker (7-10 km) clouds compared to those around the Kuroshio. Moreover, the frequency of occurrence of precipitating clouds with a geometric thickness of 7 to 10 km increased over the Kuroshio. Stronger updrafts over the Kuroshio maintain large droplets higher in the upper part of the cloud layer, and the maximum radar reflectivity within a cloud layer in non-precipitating and drizzle clouds over the Kuroshio is higher than that around the Kuroshio.

TI  - A Novel Approach to Unsupervised Change Detection Based on Hybrid Spectral Difference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The most commonly used features in unsupervised change detection are spectral characteristics. Traditional methods describe the degree of the change between two pixels by quantifying the difference in spectral values or spectral shapes (spectral curve shapes). However, traditional methods based on variation in spectral shapes tend to miss the change between two pixels if their spectral curves are close to flat; and traditional methods based on variation in spectral values tend to miss the change between two pixels if their values are low (dark objects). To inhibit the weaknesses of traditional methods, a novel approach to unsupervised change detection based on hybrid spectral difference (HSD) is proposed which combines the difference between spectral values and spectral shapes. First, a new method referred to as change detection based on spectral shapes (CDSS) is proposed that fuses the difference images produced by the spectral correlation mapper (SCM) and spectral gradient difference (SGD) in order to describe the variation in spectral shapes. Second, a method called change detection based on spectral values (CDSV), computing the Euclidean distance between two spectral vectors, is used to obtain a difference image based on the variation in spectral values. Then, the credibility of CDSS and CDSV for every pixel is calculated to describe how appropriate these two methods are for detecting the change. Finally, the difference images produced by CDSS and CDSV are fused with the corresponding credibility to generate the hybrid spectral difference image. Two experiments were carried out on worldview-2/3 and Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) datasets, and both qualitative and quantitative results indicated that HSD had superior capabilities of change detection compared with standard change vector analysis (CVA), SCM, SGD and multivariate alteration detection (MAD). The accuracy of CDSS is higher than CDSV in case-1 but lower in case-2 and, compared to the higher one, the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient of HSD improved by 3.45% and 6.92%, respectively, in the first experiment, and by 1.66% and 3.31%, respectively, in the second experiment. The omission rate dropped by approx. 4.4% in both tests.

TI  - Improved Land Use and Leaf Area Index Enhances WRF-3DVAR Satellite Radiance Assimilation: A Case Study Focusing on Rainfall Simulation in the Shule River Basin during July 2013
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of satellite radiance assimilation can improve the simulation of precipitation by numerical weather prediction models. However, substantial quantities of satellite data, especially those derived from low-level (surface-sensitive) channels, are rejected for use because of the difficulty in realistically modeling land surface emissivity and energy budgets. Here, we used an improved land use and leaf area index (LAI) dataset in the WRF-3DVAR assimilation system to explore the benefit of using improved quality of land surface information to improve rainfall simulation for the Shule River Basin in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau as a case study. The results for July 2013 show that, for low-level channels (e.g., channel 3), the underestimation of brightness temperature in the original simulation was largely removed by more realistic land surface information. In addition, more satellite data could be utilized in the assimilation because the realistic land use and LAI data allowed more satellite radiance data to pass the deviation test and get used by the assimilation, which resulted in improved initial driving fields and better simulation in terms of temperature, relative humidity, vertical convection, and cumulative precipitation.

AB  - AimThis study aims to explore the accuracy, specificity and laws of axillary lymph node metastasis predicted by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) by comparing axillary lymph node status via SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with nanocarbon as the tracer.MethodsForty six patients were retrospectively analyzed. These patients underwent SLNB with nanocarbon as the tracer from March 2013 to April 2014.ResultsTwo hundred and forty six patients of sentinel lymph node (SLN) were successfully detected. Among these patients, 8 patients had 1 SLN (3.25%), 33 patients had 2 SLN (13.41%), 46 patients had 3 SLN (18.70%), 51 patients had 4 SLN (20.73%), 40 patients had 5 SLN (16.26%), 24 patients had 6 SLN (9.76%) and 24 patients had 7 or more SLN (9.76%). The SLNB success rate of nanocarbon staining in the 246 cases was 99.59%, accuracy rate was 97.06% and sensitivity was 93.22%. Furthermore, false negatives were found in four patients, and the false-negative rate was 6.78%. The number of lymph node metastasis in the SLNB and ALND of early-stage breast cancer was analyzed. When the number of SLN dissection was 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 or 7, the coincidence rate of lymph node metastasis for SLNB and ALND was 80.00, 84.36, 78.57, 88.89, 90.48, 80.00, 73.68 and 78.36, respectively.ConclusionSentinel lymph node biopsy performed using the nanocarbon staining method is simple, easy and reliable, and it can be used to predict the axillary status of breast cancer in the early stage.

TI  - Aircraft measurement over the Gulf of Tonkin capturing aloft transport of biomass burning
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A suite of aircraft measurements was conducted over the Gulf of Tonkin, located downwind to the east of Mainland Southeast Asia (MSE), between March 23rd and April 6th, 2015. To the best of our knowledge, this campaign of 11 flights (totaling 34.4 h) was the first in-flight measurement over the region. Measurements of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ozone, carbon monoxide, black carbon and the particulate scattering coefficient were recorded at approximately 1 500 m (low level) and 3 000 m (high level). Significantly higher measurements of black carbon, carbon monoxide and ozone in the high level on March 23rd and April 5th and 6th were directly related to biomass burning in the MSE and were comparable to severe pollution events at the surface. Similarly, relatively low pollutant concentrations were observed at both altitudes between March 23rd and April 5th. A combined analysis of the measurements with meteorology and satellite data verified that the plumes captured at 3 000 m were attributed to transport in the high altitude originating from biomass burning in northern MSE. Furthermore, each plume captured by the measurements in the high level corresponded to heavy regional air pollution caused by biomass burning in northern MSE. In addition, relatively low levels of the measured pollutants corresponded to relatively light pollution levels in MSE and its adjacent areas. Taken together, these results indicated that aircraft measurements were accurate in characterizing the variation in transport and pollutant levels. During the most active season of biomass burning in MSE, pollutant emissions and their regional impact could vary on an episodic basis. Nonetheless, such concentrated emissions from biomass burning is likely to lead to particularly high atmospheric-loading of pollutants at a regional level and, depending on weather conditions, has the potential of being transported over considerably longer distances. Further investigation of the short-term impacts of such concentrations therefore appears prudent.

TI  - AMP Dual-Turbo Iterative Detection and Decoding for LDPC Coded Multibeam MSC Uplink
T2  - CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The uplink of mobile satellite communication (MSC) system with hundreds of spot beams is essentially a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. Dual-turbo iterative detection and decoding as a kind of MIMO receiver, which exchanges soft extrinsic information between a soft-in soft-out (SISO) detector and an SISO decoder in an iterative fashion, is an efficient method to reduce the uplink inter-beam-interference (IBI), and so the receiving bit error rate (BER).We propose to replace the linear SISO detector of traditional dual-turbo iterative detection and decoding with the AMP detector for the low-density parity-check (LDPC) coded multibeam MSC uplink. This improvement can reduce the computational complexity and achieve much lower BER.

TI  - Field-scale mapping of evaporative stress indicators of crop yield: An application over Mead, NE, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) quantifies temporal anomalies in a normalized evapotranspiration (ET) metric describing the ratio of actual-to-reference ET (f(RET)) as derived from satellite remote sensing. At regional scales (3-10 km pixel resolution), the ESI has demonstrated the capacity to capture developing crop stress and impacts on regional yield variability in water-limited agricultural regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to spatial and temporal limitations in the standard ESI products. In this study, we investigated potential improvements to ESI by generating maps of ET, f(RET), and f(RET) anomalies at high spatiotemporal resolution (30-m pixels, daily time steps) using a multi-sensor data fusion method, enabling separation of landcover types with different phenologies and resilience to drought. The study was conducted for the period 2010-2014 covering a region around Mead, Nebraska that includes both rainfed and irrigated crops. Correlations between ESI and measurements of maize yield were investigated at both the field and county level to assess the potential of ESI as a yield forecasting tool. To examine the role of crop phenology in yield-ESI correlations, annual input f(RET) time series were aligned by both calendar day and by biophysically relevant dates (e.g. days since planting or emergence). At the resolution of the operational U.S. ESI product (4 km), adjusting f(RET) alignment to a regionally reported emergence date prior to anomaly computation improves r(2) correlations with county-level yield estimates from 0.28 to 0.80. At 30-m resolution, where pure maize pixels can be isolated from other crops and landcover types, county-level yield correlations improved from 0.47 to 0.93 when aligning f(RET) by emergence date rather than calendar date. Peak correlations occurred 68 days after emergence, corresponding to the silking stage for maize when grain development is particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of remotely sensed ET in conveying spatially and temporally explicit water stress information to yield prediction and crop simulation models.

TI  - Time-Series 3-D Mining-Induced Large Displacement Modeling and Robust Estimation From a Single-Geometry SAR Amplitude Data Set
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel method for modeling and robustly estimating the time-series 3-D mining-induced large displacements from a single imaging geometry (SIG) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude data set using the offset-tracking (OT) technique (hereafter referred to as the OT-SIG). It first generates multitemporal observations of 3-D mining-induced displacements from the single-geometry SAR amplitude data set with the assistance of a prior model. Then, a functional relationship between mining-induced time-series 3-D displacements and the multitemporal 3-D deformation observations generated is constructed. Finally, the time-series 3-D displacements are robustly estimated based on the constructed function model using the M-estimator. The proposed OT-SIG provides a robust and cost-effective tool for retrieving time-series 3-D mining-induced large displacements, relaxing the basic requirement of the traditional method that at least two different viewing geometries' SAR data are needed. Finally, we tested the proposed OT-SIG with descending TerraSAR-X SAR amplitude data set over the Daliuta coal mining area in China. The results show that the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of OT-SIG-estimated time-series displacements are about 0.22 and 0.11 m in the vertical and horizontal directions, respectively. These RMSEs are around 5.7% and 10.9% of the maximum in situ deformation measurements in the corresponding directions, which can meet the accuracy requirements of practical applications.

TI  - Topology Discovery Sub-Layer for Integrated Terrestrial-Satellite Network Routing Schemes
T2  - CHINA COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - With the booming development of terrestrial network, scaling terrestrial network over satellite network to build Integrated Terrestrial-Satellite Network (ITSN) and meanwhile to provide the global Internet access. has become ever more attractive. Naturally. the widely and successfully used terrestrial routing protocols are the promising protocols to integrate the terrestrial and satellite networks. However, the terrestrial routing protocols, which rely on propagating routing messages to discover New Network Topology (NNT) in the terrestrial network with rare topology changes, will suffer from overly numerous routing messages in satellite network whose topology frequently changes as satellites move. In this paper, a Topology Discovery Sub-layer for ITSN Routing Schemes (TDS-IRS) is firstly proposed to avoid the propagation of numerous routing messages by taking advantage of the movement predictability of satellite and the requirements of muting schemes to discover NNT in advance of topology change. Secondly. a Weighted Perfect Matching based Topology Discovery (WPM-TD) model is designed to conduct the NNT discovery on the ground. Thirdly, this paper builds a testbed with real network devices and meanwhile interconnect that testbed with real Internet, to validate that RS-TDS can discover NNT immediately with the less on-board overhead compared with optimized routing schemes. Finally, different network scenarios are applied to validate the WPM-TD, i.e., the core module of TDS-IRS. Extensive experiments show WPM-TD can work efficiently. avoiding the invalid NNT discovery and decreasing 20%similar to 57% of potential topology changes, which can also improve up to 47%similar to 105% of network throughput.

TI  - A fuel moisture content and flammability monitoring methodology for continental Australia based on optical remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) is one of the primary drivers affecting fuel flammability that lead to fires. Satellite observations well-grounded with field data over the highly climatologically and ecologically diverse Australian region served to estimate FMC and flammability for the first time at a continental-scale. The methodology includes a physically-based retrieval model to estimate FMC from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) reflectance data using radiative transfer model inversion. The algorithm was evaluated using 360 observations at 32 locations around Australia with mean accuracy for the studied land cover classes (grassland, shrubland, and forest) close to those obtained elsewhere (r(2) = 0.58, RMSE = 40%) but without site-specific calibration. Logistic regression models were developed to generate a flammability index, trained on fire events mapped in the MODIS burned area product and four predictor variables calculated from the FMC estimates. The selected predictor variables were actual FMC corresponding to the 8-day and 16-day period before burning; the same but expressed as an anomaly from the long-term mean for that date; and the FMC change between the two successive 8-day periods before burning. Separate logistic regression models were developed for grassland, shrubland and forest. The models obtained an "Area Under the Curve" calculated from the Receiver Operating Characteristic plot method of 0.70, 0.78 and 0.71, respectively, indicating reasonable skill in fire risk prediction.

TI  - Assessment of Quadrivalent Human Papillomavirus Vaccine Safety Using the Self-Controlled Tree-Temporal Scan Statistic Signal-Detection Method in the Sentinel System
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The self-controlled tree-temporal scan statistic-a new signal-detection method-can evaluate whether any of a wide variety of health outcomes are temporally associated with receipt of a specific vaccine, while adjusting for multiple testing. Neither health outcomes nor postvaccination potential periods of increased risk need be prespecified. Using US medical claims data in the Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel system, we employed the method to evaluate adverse events occurring after receipt of quadrivalent human papillomavirus vaccine (4vHPV). Incident outcomes recorded in emergency department or inpatient settings within 56 days after first doses of 4vHPV received by 9- through 26.9-year-olds in 2006-2014 were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes and analyzed by pairing the new method with a standard hierarchical classification of diagnoses. On scanning diagnoses of 1.9 million 4vHPV recipients, 2 statistically significant categories of adverse events were found: cellulitis on days 2-3 after vaccination and "other complications of surgical and medical procedures" on days 1-3 after vaccination. Cellulitis is a known adverse event. Clinically informed investigation of electronic claims records of the patients with "other complications" did not suggest any previously unknown vaccine safety problem. Considering that thousands of potential short-term adverse events and hundreds of potential risk intervals were evaluated, these findings add significantly to the growing safety record of 4vHPV.

TI  - Inversion model of soil profile moisture content in rocky desertification area based on microwave and optical remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFRARED AND MILLIMETER WAVES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil water is an important component of the global ecosystem. Quantitative remote sensing estimation of soil water content in Karst Rocky Desertification Area can provide basic data and theoretical support for rocky desertification control and ecological restoration. It also provides guidance for agricultural activities in Rocky Desertification Areas. Based on Sentinel-1A and Landsat 8 image data, the backscatter coefficients of shrub land and sparse woodland were extracted by using water cloud model, and TVDI of dry land and forest land were calculated by simplified Ts/NDVI feature space. Combined with the measured data, the soil moisture content of different depths was modeled by fitting analysis, which was used to inverse the soil moisture content. The results show that the VH polarization quadratic curve model and the VH polarization cubic curve model are suitable for inversion of soil water content at depths of 0 similar to 5 cm and 5 similar to 10 cm in shrub lands, respectively. The R-2 and RMSE of the two models were 0. 87, 0. 87 and 4. 57%, 4. 29% individually. The exponential regression model of VH polarization was applied to soil moisture inversion of sparse woodland in 0 similar to 5 cm depth and the linear regression model of VH polarization was suitable for 5 similar to 10 cm depth. The R-2 and RMSE of the two models are 0. 736,0. 72 and 9. 77%, 11. 28% respectively. The best soil moisture inversion models of dry land and forested land are the cubic curve model and the logistic regression model respectively. And the R2 and RMSE of 0 similar to 5 cm depth soil moisture inversion are 0. 85, 0. 69 and 2. 88%, 4. 02%, while in 5 similar to 10 cm depth the value of R-2 and RMSE are 0. 76, 0. 23 and 3. 5%, 6. 37% individually.

TI  - Mapping agricultural land abandonment from spatial and temporal segmentation of Landsat time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural land abandonment is a common land-use change, making the accurate mapping of both location and timing when agricultural land abandonment occurred important to understand its environmental and social outcomes. However, it is challenging to distinguish agricultural abandonment from transitional classes such as fallow land at high spatial resolutions due to the complexity of change process. To date, no robust approach exists to detect when agricultural land abandonment occurred based on 30-m Landsat images. Our goal here was to develop a new approach to detect the extent and the exact timing of agricultural land abandonment using spatial and temporal segments derived from Landsat time series. We tested our approach for one Landsat footprint in the Caucasus, covering parts of Russia and Georgia, where agricultural land abandonment is widespread. First, we generated agricultural land image objects from multi-date Landsat imagery using a multi resolution segmentation approach. Second, we estimated the probability for each object that agricultural land was used each year based on Landsat temporal-spectral metrics and a random forest model. Third, we applied temporal segmentation of the resulting agricultural land probability time series to identify change classes and detect when abandonment occurred. We found that our approach was able to accurately separate agricultural abandonment from active agricultural lands, fallow land, and re-cultivation. Our spatial and temporal segmentation approach captured the changes at the object level well (overall mapping accuracy = 97 +/- 1%), and performed substantially better than pixel-level change detection (overall accuracy = 82 +/- 3%). We found strong spatial and temporal variations in agricultural land abandonment rates in our study area, likely a consequence of regional wars after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In summary, the combination of spatial and temporal segmentation approaches of time-series is a robust method to track agricultural land abandonment and may be relevant for other land-use changes as well.

TI  - Primary ovarian small cell carcinoma of pulmonary type with coexisting endometrial carcinoma in a breast cancer patient receiving tamoxifen A case report and literature review
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Rationale: Small cell carcinoma of the ovary (SCCO) is a rare and aggressive extra-pulmonary variant of small cell tumors of uncertain histogenesis. The pathogenesis and optimal treatment of SCCO is unclear. We present a very rare case of a synchronous primary ovarian small cell carcinoma and endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus in a patient after 2 years of tamoxifen treatment for breast cancer. This is the first such report in the English literature.Patient concerns: A 46-year-old woman had a history of left breast cancer that was treated with a simple mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in 2013. The post-operative pathology was invasive ductal carcinoma of the left breast. she had been taking tamoxifen for 2 years. The patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy to reduce the tumor burden, improve bowel compression symptoms, and promote defecation in 2015. The post-operative pathology revealed a rare, simultaneous occurrence of two tumors (endometrial adenocarcinoma and SCCO [pulmonary type]).Diagnoses: Primary ovarian small cell carcinoma of pulmonary type with coexisting endometrial carcinoma in a breast cancer patient.Interventions: The patient received 3 courses of chemotherapy after operation. The effect was not apparent and the general health status was poor.Outcomes: The patient died of progressive disease 7 months post-operatively.Lessons: The present case suggests that tamoxifen use might be among many etiologic factors in SCCO development. Despite its rarity, SCCO requires a high degree of attention in clinical work because it is an aggressive tumor that has a poor prognosis.

TI  - Strictly Limited Orbital Pain as Sentinel Headache of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage
T2  - WORLD NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The headache preceding an intracranial aneurysm rupture is called a sentinel headache (SH), and it is characterized by a sudden, intense, and persistent headache. As subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) often develops within several weeks of SH, its rapid diagnosis and treatment can improve the prognosis.CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old woman with migraine in her medical history visited the outpatient clinic due to left orbital pain. There was no neurologic deficit. Although magnetic resonance imaging examination found no SAH, a left internal carotid artery-posterior communicating artery bifurcation aneurysm was detected by magnetic resonance angiography. Ten days after the onset of orbital pain, the patient consulted our hospital for a second opinion. We scheduled an elective clipping because the irregular shape of the aneurysm had a high risk of rupture. On the day before surgery, the aneurysm ruptured and led to SAH. Clipping was performed immediately. The patient was discharged with no neurologic deficit.CONCLUSION: Clinicians must take into consideration that unilateral orbital pain, though atypical, may be a symptom of SH.

TI  - Are negative/unrealistic parent descriptors of infant attributes associated with physical abuse?
T2  - CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT
M3  - Article
AB  - Parents' perceptions of child behavior influence their responses to the child and may be important predictors of physical abuse. We examined whether infants 12 months of age or younger who were described with negative or developmentally unrealistic words were more likely than other infants to have been physically abused. As part of a prospective observational multicenter study investigating bruising and familial psychosocial characteristics, parents were asked to (1) describe their child's personality, and (2) list three words to describe their child. Four independent raters coded parent responses using a qualitative content analysis, identifying descriptors of infants and classifying each as positive, neutral, or negative/unrealistic. A medical expert panel, blinded to the psychosocial data, separately categorized each case as abuse or accident. We then analyzed the potential association between negative/unrealistic descriptors and abusive injury. Of 185 children enrolled, 147 cases (79%) were categorized as accident and 38 (21%) as abuse. Parents used at least one negative/unrealistic descriptor in 35/185 cases (19%), while the remaining 150 cases (81%) included only positive or neutral descriptors. Of the infants described with negative/unrealistic words, 60% were abused, compared to 11% of those described with positive or neutral words (p <.0001; age group -adjusted OR = 9.95; 95% confidence interval [3.98, 24.90]). Though limited by sample-size, this pilot study informs future work to create a screening tool utilizing negative/unrealistic descriptors in combination with other predictive factors to identify infants at high risk for physical child abuse.

TI  - Comparison of hydrothermal alteration patterns associated with porphyry Cu deposits hosted by granitoids and intermediate-mafic volcanic rocks, Kerman Magmatic Arc, Iran: Application of geological, mineralogical and remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The southern section of the Cenozoic Urumieh-Dokhtar Magmatic Arc (UDMA) of Iran, known as Kerman Magmatic Arc (KMA) or Kerman copper belt, is a major host to porphyry Cu +/- Mo +/- Au deposits, collectively known as PCDs. In this study, the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data and spectral angle mapper (SAM) method, combined with field data, mineralogical studies, and spectral analysis are used to determine hydrothermal alteration patterns related to PCDs in the KMA. Gossans developed over some of these porphyry type deposits were mapped using Landsat 8 data. In the NKMA gossans are more developed than in the SKMA due to comparatively lower rate of erosion. The hydrothermal alteration pattern mapped by ASTER data were evaluated using mineralogical and spectral data. ASTER data proved to be useful for mapping the hydrothermal alteration in this semi-arid type of climate. Also Landsat 8 was useful for mapping the iron oxide minerals in the gossans that are associated with the porphyry copper deposits. Our multidisciplinary approach indicates that unlike the PCDs in the northern KMA that are associated with distinct and widespread propylitic alteration, those in the granitoid country rocks lack propylitic alteration or the alteration is only weakly and irregularly developed. The porphyry systems in southern KMA are further distinguished by development of quartz-rich phyllic alteration zones in the outer parts of the PCDs that could be mapped using remote sensing data. Consideration of variations in alteration patterns and specific alteration assemblages are critical in regional exploration for PCDs. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of the BRDF Characteristics of Dunhuang Radiometric Calibration Site in the Spring
T2  - ACTA PHOTONICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - An on-orbit vicarious calibration experiment for FY-4A was formally performed at Dunhuang Radiometric Calibration Site in late April, 2017. In order to meet the needs of the directional corrections in the sensor viewing angle of surface reflectances, the Dunhuang Gobi surface directional reflectances were measured using a portable measurement instrument. The spring directional reflection characteristics of Dunhuang site were qualitatively analyzed and the parameters of bidirectional reflectance distribution function model were inversed based on the RossThick-LiSparseR kernel-driven model. The linear regression analysis was performed for the calculated data and the measured data, the adjusted R-Square of April 26th, 27th and 28th, 2017 are 0.75, 0.83 and 0.85, and the present model had proven to provide a good fit to measured data. The anisotropy factors in the solar principal plane were obtained by utilizing model and compared with historical data of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer BRDF/Albedo model parameters product. The relative deviation of band 2 and band 4 were below 1.56% and the band 5 was below 3.12% when the view zenith angle was less than 40 degrees. The results demonstrate that the constructed model can pretty describe the directional reflection characteristics of Dunhuang site, and verify the reliability of measured data.

TI  - Global Land Cover Heterogeneity Characteristics at Moderate Resolution for Mixed Pixel Modeling and Inversion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial heterogeneity is present in the land surface at every scale and is one of the key factors that introduces inherent uncertainty into simulations of land surface processes and parameter retrieval based on remotely sensed data. Because of a lack of understanding of the heterogeneous characteristics of global mixed pixels, few studies have focused on modeling and inversion algorithms in heterogeneous areas. This paper presents a parameterization scheme to describe land cover heterogeneity quantitatively by composition and boundary information based on high-resolution land cover products. Global heterogeneity features at the 1-km scale are extracted from the GlobeLand30' land cover dataset with a spatial resolution of 30 m. The composition analysis of global mixed pixels shows that only 35% of pixels over the land surface of Earth are covered by a single land cover type, namely, pure pixels, and only 25.8% are located in vegetated areas. Pixels mixed with water are more common than pixels mixed with any other non-vegetation type. The fragmentation analysis of typical biomes based on the boundary length shows that the savanna is the most heterogeneous biome, while the evergreen broadleaf forest is the least heterogeneous. Deciduous needleleaf forests are significantly affected by canopy height differences, while crop and grass biomes are less affected. Lastly, the strengths and limitations of the method and the application of the land cover heterogeneity characteristics extracted in this study are discussed.

TI  - Monitoring the Health Status of Trees in Maksimir Forest Park Using Remote Sensing Methods
T2  - SEEFOR-SOUTH-EAST EUROPEAN FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Purpose: In Zagreb, the forests have assumed the characteristics of forest parks, of which the most famous and the most visited is Maksimir Park. The health condition of many trees has deteriorated due to environmental changes and the forest's age. The tree health status can be monitored by direct observation in the field using the terrestrial method, or by remote sensing methods. Recent advances in technology have made it possible to use high-resolution satellite imagery to monitor the damage.Materials and Methods: In order to estimate the health status of trees, the research area - Maksimir Forest Park - was visually interpreted by means of the WorldView 2 (WV2) satellite image, color composite (8, 5, 3). Such color composite was also used to delineate the strata. After delineation, a systematic sample of 25x25 m was laid over the stratum to help interpret the tree health status. Differences in tree damage were observed by comparing the WV2 images and other satellite images (Google Earth images from 2014 and 2016) recorded at different points in time. Field research was then conducted in order to inventory the current situation.Results: The main results of the research in Maksimir Forest Park include the calculation of damage indicators by tree species, as well as thematic maps with the spatial distribution of the mean damage (SO) and damage index (IO) for those tree species which are most represented in a particular stratum. Mean and significant damage of the most represented tree species and overall is also presented spatially in the form of thematic maps. A comparison of the results of WV2 satellite imagery and satellite images taken from Google Earth denoted a change in the tree health status, which confirms that satellite imagery can serve to inventory and track the condition in an area over a number of years. Field investigations and the assessment of tree health status confirmed the results obtained by satellite imagery interpretation.Conclusions: Since quality forest monitoring is based on systematic collection of forest data in any area or at any point in time, the obtained results not only represent the current health status, but also provide a basis for monitoring and predicting the future conditions.

TI  - Remote Sensing Satellite Data Preparation for Simulating and Forecasting River Discharge
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulating and forecasting river discharge using satellite information is one of the most economical ways of measuring discharge, especially in remote areas where in situ gauges are too expensive to install, maintain, and operate. However, satellite signals are affected by climatic factors, such as clouds, mist, dust storms, and smoke from large forest fires. Hence, a reliable method of preparing and treating space-based signals is necessary. In this paper, a method is introduced to remove inaccurate and out-of-range signals having a low correlation with the in situ discharge measurements, using a combination of data classification and outlier detection procedures. To forecast future river discharge using space-based signals, the signal data set should not contain any gaps. Therefore, we introduced a procedure for the missing signals to be estimated by a model calibrated using the measured discharge. This procedure is illustrated using a case study for the White River, near Boston, MA, USA, that involved using a ddata set of three years' daily signals of the passive microwave information from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System satellite, which are obtained from the difference between thermal emission of wet and dry land surfaces, and the in situ discharge measurements of the river. The best model was selected from 6200 available models using the Pareto front. The optimum model detected 339 samples as outliers and eliminated them from the data set. Subsequently, the signals were calibrated with the in situ information, and the results indicated the superior accuracy in simulating White River discharge using satellite information.

TI  - Severe fire weather and intensive forest management increase fire severity in a multi-ownership landscape
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have examined how fuels, topography, climate, and fire weather influence fire severity. Less is known about how different forest management practices influence fire severity in multi-owner landscapes, despite costly and controversial suppression of wildfires that do not acknowledge ownership boundaries. In 2013, the Douglas Complex burned over 19,000 ha of Oregon & California Railroad (O&C) lands in Southwestern Oregon, USA. O&C lands are composed of a checkerboard of private industrial and federal forestland (Bureau of Land Management, BLM) with contrasting management objectives, providing a unique experimental landscape to understand how different management practices influence wildfire severity. Leveraging Landsat based estimates of fire severity (Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio, RdNBR) and geospatial data on fire progression, weather, topography, pre-fire forest conditions, and land ownership, we asked (1) what is the relative importance of different variables driving fire severity, and (2) is intensive plantation forestry associated with higher fire severity? Using Random Forest ensemble machine learning, we found daily fire weather was the most important predictor of fire severity, followed by stand age and ownership, followed by topographic features. Estimates of pre-fire forest biomass were not an important predictor of fire severity. Adjusting for all other predictor variables in a general least squares model incorporating spatial autocorrelation, mean predicted RdNBR was higher on private industrial forests (RdNBR 521.85 +/- 18.67 [mean +/- SE]) vs. BLM forests (398.87 +/- 18.23) with a much greater proportion of older forests. Our findings suggest intensive plantation forestry characterized by young forests and spatially homogenized fuels, rather than pre-fire biomass, were significant drivers of wildfire severity. This has implications for perceptions of wildfire risk, shared fire management responsibilities, and developing fire resilience for multiple objectives in multi-owner landscapes.

TI  - Knowledge and Knowing in Islam: A Comparative Study between Nursi and al-Attas
T2  - GLOBAL JOURNAL AL-THAQAFAH
M3  - Article
AB  - This article compares Bediuzzaman Said Nursi's conception of knowledge and knowing with Syed Mohammad Naquib al-Attas' epistemology and philosophy of science. These two prominent Muslim thinkers are worth our attention, given the impact that their thought have had on contemporary Muslim discourse and social movement in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and beyond. It is found that both Nursi and al-Attas share a common conviction that modern science is neither neutral nor value-free; it is dominated by theories and principles derived from secularistic and atheistic-naturalistic worldview. It comes to the conclusion that although Nursi and al-Attas both have the same concern, their thought do exhibit some differences with regard to the nature of knowledge and knowing, the meaning and object of knowledge as well as the process of knowing.

TI  - Albedo of a Small Ice-Covered Boreal Lake: Daily, Meso-Scale and Interannual Variability on the Background of Regional Climate
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In winter, the reflective properties of ice-and-snow-covered lakes and the surrounding surface covered with snow differ little. Estimation of the albedo becomes especially important in spring when the reflectivity of the ice-covered lakes differs markedly from the surrounding snow-free surface. The measurements of the snow and ice albedo in situ are necessary to ensure adequate analysis of remote sensing data and monitoring of the state of the land ice. A wide range of surface albedo of small boreal ice-covered Lake Vendyurskoe (North-Western Russia) is calculated from observational data of solar radiation obtained in 1995-2000 and 2002-2017. A noticeable variability of albedo due to spring melting and changes in weather conditions is described. Climatic variability (North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, the average monthly air temperature and sum of precipitation in December-March) is analyzed in the context of possible influence on the maximal thickness of snow and white ice, and, consequently, on the spring lake albedo dynamics. In current work to estimate the external heat flux that comes from the atmosphere to the surface of the lake and presumably determines the dynamics of albedo during spring melting, a simple parameter was used: the accumulated sum of positive temperatures, starting from March 1. The obtained prognostic equation of the cubic dependence of albedo on the named parameter demonstrates a different rate of albedo decrease in the melting of snow, white, and congelation ice.

TI  - Statistical Monitoring of Changes to Land Cover
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate detection of changes in land cover leads to better understanding of the dynamics of landscapes. This letter reports the development of a reliable approach to detecting changes in land cover based on remote sensing and radiometric data. This approach integrates the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (MEWMA) chart with support vector machines (SVMs) for accurate and reliable detection of changes to land cover. Here, we utilize the MEWMA scheme to identify features corresponding to changed regions. Unfortunately, MEWMA schemes cannot discriminate between real changes and false changes. If a change is detected by the MEWMA algorithm, then we execute the SVM algorithm that is based on features corresponding to detected pixels to identify the type of change. We assess the effectiveness of this approach by using the remote-sensing change detection database and the SZTAKI AirChange benchmark data set. Our results show the capacity of our approach to detect changes to land cover.

TI  - Preflight Evaluation of the Performance of the Chinese Environmental Trace Gas Monitoring Instrument (EMI) by Spectral Analyses of Nitrogen Dioxide
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Environmental trace gas Monitoring Instrument (EMI) onboard the Chinese high-resolution remote sensing satellite GaoFen-5 is an ultraviolet-visible imaging spectrometer, aiming to quantify the global distribution of tropospheric and stratospheric trace gases and planned to be launched in spring 2018. The preflight calibration phase is essential to characterize the properties and performance of the EMI in order to provide information for data processing and trace gas retrievals. In this paper, we present the first EMI measurement of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from a gas absorption cell using scattered sunlight as the light source by the differential optical absorption spectroscopy technique. The retrieved NO2 column densities in the UV and Vis wavelength ranges are consistent with the column density in the gas cell calculated from the NO2 mixing ratio and the length of the gas cell. Furthermore, the differences of the retrieved NO2 column densities among the adjoining spatial rows of the detector are less than 3%. This variation is similar to the wellknown "stripes-pattern" of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument and is probably caused by remaining systematic effects like a nonperfect description of the individual instrument functions. Finally, the signal-to-noise ratios of EMIin-orbit measurements of NO2 are estimated on the basis of on-ground scattered sunlight measurements and radiative transfer model simulations. Based on our results, we conclude that the EMI is capable of measuring the global distribution of the NO2 column with the retrieval precision and accuracy better than 3% for the tested wavelength ranges and viewing angles.

TI  - Multiple Mode SAR Raw Data Simulation and Parallel Acceleration for Gaofen-3 Mission
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Fort Worth, TX
AB  - Gaofen-3 is China's first meter-level multipolarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite with 12 imaging modes for the scientific and commercial applications. In order to evaluate the imaging performance of these modes, the multiple mode SAR raw data simulation is highly demanded. In the paper, the multiple mode SAR simulation framework will be briefly introduced to expose how the raw data simulation guarantees the development of Gaofen-3 and its ground processing system. As an engineering simulation, the complex working modes and practical evaluation requirements of Gaofen-3 mission put forward to the higher demand for simulation simplification and data input/output (I/O) efficiency. To meet the requirements, two improvements have been proposed. First, the stripmap mode based multiple mode decomposition method is introduced to make a solid and simplified system simulation structure. Second, the cloud computing and graphics processing unit (GPU) are integrated to simulate the practical huge volume raw data, resulting in improved calculation and data I/O efficiency. The experimental results of sliding spotlight imaging prove the effectiveness of the Gaofen-3 mission simulation framework and the decomposition idea. The results for efficiency assessment show that the GPU cloud method greatly improves the computing power of a 16-core CPU parallel method about 40x speedup and the data throughput with the Hadoop distributed file system. These results prove that the simulation system has the merits of coping with multiple modes and huge volume raw data simulation and can be extended to the future space-borne SAR simulation.

TI  - High-frequency attitude jitter correction for the Gaofen-9 satellite
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - With the gradually improving resolution of earth observation satellite images, attitude determination accuracy has become a key factor influencing image geometric positioning accuracy. However, high-frequency attitude jitters caused by the instability of the satellite platform lead to image distortions which cannot be corrected by the low-frequency star sensor and gyro attitude measurement. Therefore, this paper proposes a high-frequency attitude jitter correction method based on micro-vibration accelerometer measurement. Three images from the GaoFen-9 (GF-9) satellite over Lijiang in China were selected to verify the method. The correction effect was assessed in terms of road straightness and image relative registration error. The results show that the proposed method can effectively eliminate image distortions caused by high-frequency jitters, providing a feasible way to process images from small agile satellite platforms.Resume Avec l'amelioration progressive de la resolution des images des satellites d'observation de la Terre, la precision de la determination de l'attitude est devenue un facteur cle qui influence la precision de positionnement geometrique de l'image. Cependant, les oscillations d'attitude a haute frequence provoquees par l'instabilite de la plate-forme conduisent a des distorsions de l'image qui ne peuvent pas etre corrigees par les mesures a basse frequence d'un senseur stellaire ou d'un gyroscope. Cet article propose donc une methode de correction de ces oscillations basee sur la mesure de micro-vibrations par accelerometre. Trois images du satellite GaoFen-9 (GF-9) ont ete acquises au-dessus de Lijiang en Chine pour verifier la methode. L'effet de la correction a ete evalue en termes de linearite des routes et d'erreur de recalage relatif entre images. Les resultats montrent que la methode proposee peut eliminer efficacement les distorsions provoquees par les oscillations a haute frequence, ce qui permet de traiter les images acquises par de petits satellites agiles.Zusammenfassung Mit der zunehmenden Verbesserung der Auflosung der Aufnahmen von Erdbeobachtungssatelliten wurde die Genauigkeit der Bestimmung der Neigungsinformation ein Schlusselfaktor fur die geometrische Genauigkeit der Positionsbestimmung aus den Bilddaten. Allerdings fuhren hochfrequente Neigungsschwankungen, verursacht durch Instabilitaten der Satellitenplattform, zu Bildverzerrungen, die mit Hilfe niederfrequenter Sternsensoren oder Neigungsmessungen mit Kreiseln nicht korrigiert werden konnen. Dieser Beitrag stellt eine hochfrequente Schwankungskorrektur der Neigungen vor, die auf Micro-Schwingungs-Beschleunigungsmessungen basiert. Fur die Verifizierung der Methode wurden drei Bilder des GaoFen-9 (GF-9) Satelliten uber Lijiang in China ausgewahlt. Die Korrektureffekte wurden mit Hilfe der Linearitat von Strassen und Fehlern der relativen Bildregistrierung abgeschatzt. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die vorgeschlagene Methode in der Lage ist, Bildverzerrungen durch hochfrequente Schwankungen zu eliminieren, womit es moglich wird Bilder von kleinen, agilen Satelliten Plattformen zu prozessieren.Resumen Con el creciente aumento de resolucion de las imagenes satelitales de observacion de la tierra, la precision de la actitud se ha convertido en un factor clave que influye en la precision geometrica de la imagen. Sin embargo, la alta frecuencia de la actitud causada por la inestabilidad de la plataforma del satelite lleva a distorsiones en la imagen que no pueden corregirse mediante la actitud medida por el sensor de seguimiento de estrellas (star tracker) de baja frecuencia y la medicion de la actitud del giroscopio. Por lo tanto, este articulo propone un metodo de correccion de la fluctuacion de fase de alta frecuencia basado en la medicion del acelerometro de microvibracion. Se seleccionaron tres imagenes del satelite GaoFen-9 (GF-9) sobre Lijiang en China para evaluar el metodo. El efecto de la correccion se evaluo en terminos de rectitud de carreteras y de error de registro relativo. Los resultados muestran que el metodo propuesto puede eliminar con efectividad las distorsiones de la imagen causadas por movimientos de alta frecuencia, proporcionando una forma factible de procesar imagenes desde plataformas de satelite pequenas y agiles.?? ??????????????????, ??????????????????????????????????????, ??????????, ?????????????, ??????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????, ?????????????????????????

TI  - Dual-Polarized Backscatter Features of Surface Currents in the Open Ocean during Typhoon Lan (2017)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean surface current measurements from satellites have historically been limited. We propose a new approach to detect ocean surface currents as observed by dual-polarized (VV and VH) spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This approach is based on the assumptions that the VH-polarized SAR signal is only generated by the effects of ocean winds creating surface waves, whereas the VV-polarization data are due to the effects of both ocean winds and surface currents. Therefore, the surface currents features may be extracted after retrieving the ocean winds from VH-polarized backscatter and inputting signal due to the wind to the VV-polarized backscatter data. To investigate the performance of this approach under extreme wind conditions, we consider a scene of C-band RADARSAT-2 dual-polarized ScanSAR images over Typhoon Lan (2017) in the open ocean, and we verify our results with current estimates from altimeter data. The ocean current features extracted from the backscatter data that were collected from the SAR images are shown to correspond to an area of strong currents and an oceanic front observed by altimeters. We suggest that the proposed method has the potential capacity to provide information about ocean surface currents from high-resolution dual-polarized ScanSAR images.

TI  - The CSLE model based soil erosion prediction: Comparisons of sampling density and extrapolation method at the county level
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) is an empirical equation commonly applied to predict soil erosion throughout the world. In China, the Chinese Soil Loss Equation (CSLE) has been developed for estimating annual soil erosion by water on the basis of the USLE. It is proven that two factors (i.e., sampling density and extrapolation method) are important in the application of CSLE for soil erosion survey and evaluation. In this study, based on the SPOT 6 image (1.5 m resolution) and the 1:10,000 topographic map in Yishui county of the Ylmeng Mountain Area (YMA), eastern China, two sampling densities (1% and 4%) were selected and three extrapolation methods (grid based calculation, direct extrapolation, and Kriging extrapolation based on sampling units) were adopted to compare their effect on the CSLE calculated soil erosion condition and status. Results showed that estimated soil erosion by direct extrapolation and Kriging extrapolation methods varies largely with sampling density. The discrepancy of the soil erosion area ratios calculated by the two methods are 6.5% and 7.7% under the 1% and 4% sampling density, and the relative discrepancies are 15.9% and 16.2%, respectively. But the grid calculation method is less affected by sampling density. The discrepancy of soil erosion area ratios is only 0.9% and 2.0%, respectively, under the 1% with 4% sampling density. Considering both field workload and prediction accuracy of soil erosion, the 1% sampling density with the grid calculation method is recommended when high resolution remotely sensed data are available. Otherwise, the 4% sampling density with either extrapolation method should be used. The research can provide useful reference information for ensuring the accuracy and reducing the survey workload on the application of CSLE in other areas.

TI  - Estimation of Grassland Canopy Height and Aboveground Biomass at the Quadrat Scale Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aboveground biomass is a key indicator of a grassland ecosystem. Accurate estimation from remote sensing is important for understanding the response of grasslands to climate change and disturbance at a large scale. However, the precision of remote sensing inversion is limited by a lack in the ground truth and scale mismatch with satellite data. In this study, we first tried to establish a grassland aboveground biomass estimation model at 1 m(2) quadrat scale by conducting synchronous experiments of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and field measurement in three different grassland ecosystems. Two flight modes (the new QUADRAT mode and the commonly used MOSAIC mode) were used to generate point clouds for further processing. Canopy height metrics of each quadrat were then calculated using the canopy height model (CHM). Correlation analysis showed that the mean of the canopy height model (CHM_mean) had a significant linear relationship with field height (R-2 = 0.90, root mean square error (RMSE) = 19.79 cm, rRMSE = 16.5%, p < 0.001) and a logarithmic relationship with field aboveground biomass (R-2 = 0.89, RMSE = 91.48 g/m(2), rRMSE = 16.11%, p < 0.001). We concluded our study by conducting a preliminary application of estimation of the aboveground biomass at a plot scale by jointly using UAV and the constructed 1 m(2) quadrat scale estimation model. Our results confirmed that UAV could be used to collect large quantities of ground truths and bridge the scales between ground truth and remote sensing pixels, which were helpful in improving the accuracy of remote sensing inversion of grassland aboveground biomass.

TI  - Estimation of spatially varying parameters in three-dimensional cohesive sediment transport models by assimilating remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on a three-dimensional cohesive sediment transport model with the adjoint data assimilation, the spatially varying parameters are estimated by assimilating satellite-retrieved suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) in the Hangzhou Bay, China. To reduce the ill-posedness of the inverse problem, an independent point scheme is developed and a combined independent point and Tikhonov regularization scheme (CIPTRS) is presented. The CIPTRS is calibrated in ideal twin experiments and the results reveal that the CIPTRS can restrict the influence of ill-posedness and improve the accuracy of parameter estimation. In practical experiments, the spatially varying settling velocity is estimated by assimilating the satellite-retrieved SSCs using different strategies, and the best modeling results are obtained when the CIPTRS is used. To further improve the modeling results, the spatially varying settling velocity and initial conditions are estimated simultaneously using the CIPTRS. The data misfit between observed and simulated SSCs is largely decreased and the simulated SSCs can reproduce the spatial and temporal features of observed SSCs. The experimental results indicate that the adjoint method is a useful method to estimate the poorly known parameters in practical applications and the CIPTRS can effectively improve the results of data assimilation and parameter estimation.

TI  - Eigenvector Spatial Filtering Regression Modeling of Ground PM<sub>2.5</sub> Concentrations Using Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes a regression model using the Eigenvector Spatial Filtering (ESF) method to estimate ground PM2.5 concentrations. Covariates are derived from remotely sensed data including aerosol optical depth, normal differential vegetation index, surface temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, height of planetary boundary layer and digital elevation model. In addition, cultural variables such as factory densities and road densities are also used in the model. With the Yangtze River Delta region as the study area, we constructed ESF-based Regression (ESFR) models at different time scales, using data for the period between December 2015 and November 2016. We found that the ESFR models effectively filtered spatial autocorrelation in the OLS residuals and resulted in increases in the goodness-of-fit metrics as well as reductions in residual standard errors and cross-validation errors, compared to the classic OLS models. The annual ESFR model explained 70% of the variability in PM2.5 concentrations, 16.7% more than the non-spatial OLS model. With the ESFR models, we performed detail analyses on the spatial and temporal distributions of PM2.5 concentrations in the study area. The model predictions are lower than ground observations but match the general trend. The experiment shows that ESFR provides a promising approach to PM2.5 analysis and prediction.

TI  - Spatial Scale Effect on Wind Speed Retrieval Accuracy Using Sentinel-1 Copolarization SAR
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - High-spatial-resolution wind fields derived from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instruments are crucial to a wide range of applications. However, the spatial scale effect on wind speed retrieval accuracy has seldom been reported. For the purpose of understanding this issue, this letter makes a quality assessment of wind speed retrieval accuracy based on four commonly used C-hand geophysical model functions (CMOD4, CMOD-IFR2, CMOD5, and CMOD5.N) at spatial resolutions ranging from 50 m to 50 km using Sentinel-1 interferometric wide (IW) swath mode images. Our results show that the CMOD5 function is the most effective among these functions, owing to a low root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.17 m/s and a bias of -0.28 m/s for wind speed retrieval at a spatial resolution of 500 m. It is further observed that the variance of wind speeds retrieved from copolarized SAR images decreases exponentially with the decrease of spatial resolutions. For Sentinel-1 IW mode images, the variance of wind speeds retrieved with CMOD5 decreases rapidly from 50 to 500 m, with a drop in RMSE of 40%, and thereafter levels off. Thus, a spatial resolution of 500 m, with the CMOD5 function, is recommended optimal in this letter, for wind speed retrieval using Sentinnel-1 IW mode data.

TI  - A Ship Detector Applying Principal Component Analysis to the Polarimetric Notch Filter
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship detection using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) data has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Polarimetry can provide information regarding the scattering mechanisms of targets, which helps discriminate between ships and sea clutter. This enhancement is particularly valuable when we aim at detecting smaller vessels in rough sea states. This work exploits a ship detector called the Geometrical Perturbation-Polarimetric Notch Filter (GP-PNF), and it is aimed at improving its performance especially when less polarimetric images are available (e.g., dual-polarimetric data). The idea is to design a new polarimetric feature vector containing more features that are renowned to allow separation between ships and sea clutter. Then, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is further used to reduce the dimensionality of the new feature space. Experiments on four real Sentinel-1 datasets are carried out to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method and compare it against other ship detectors. Analyses of the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can not only reduce the false alarms significantly, but also enhance the target-to-clutter ratio (TCR) so that it can more effectively detect weaker ships.

TI  - How Well Does the "Small Fire Boost' Methodology Used within the GFED4.1s Fire Emissions Database Represent the Timing, Location and Magnitude of Agricultural Burning?
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED)currently by far the most widely used global fire emissions inventoryis primarily driven by the 500 m MODIS MCD64A1 burned area (BA) product. This product is unable to detect many smaller fires, and the new v4.1s of GFED addresses this deficiency by using a small fire boost' (SFB) methodology that estimates the small fire' burned area from MODIS active fire (AF) detections. We evaluate the performance of this approach in two globally significant agricultural burning regions dominated by small fires, eastern China and north-western India. We find the GFED4.1s SFB can affect the burned area and fire emissions data reported by GFED very significantly, and the approach shows some potential for reducing low biases in GFED's fire emissions estimates of agricultural burning regions. However, it also introduces several significant errors. In north-western India, the SFB slightly improves the temporal distribution of agricultural burning, but the magnitude of the additional burned area added by the SFB is far too low. In eastern China, the SFB appears to have some positive effects on the magnitude of agricultural burning reported in June and October, but significant errors are introduced in the summer months via false alarms in the MODIS AF product. This results in a completely inaccurate August' burning period in GFED4.1s, where false fires are erroneously stated to be responsible for roughly the same amount of dry matter fuel consumption as fires in June and October. Even without the SFB, we also find problems with some of the burns detected by the MCD64A1 burned area product in these agricultural regions. Overall, we conclude that the SFB methodology requires further optimisation and that the efficacy of GFED4.1s' boosted' BA and resulting fire emissions estimates require careful consideration by users focusing in areas where small fires dominate.

TI  - The progradation and retrogradation of two newborn Huanghe (Yellow River) Delta lobes and its influencing factors
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, 342 Landsat satellite images were used to study the evolution of the Qingshuigou and Qing8 Lobes during 1976-2016. Sea-level correction and statistical analysis were used to eliminate the effect of sea-level fluctuations on the shoreline positions. The results revealed that the evolution of the two newborn Huanghe Delta lobes was mainly influenced by the river sediment discharges, river channel changes, course shifts, floods, droughts, and marine hydrodynamic forces.During 1976-2016, the total land gain of the two lobes was 377 km(2) according to mean-tide line, and the average epeirogenetic efficiency of river sediment discharge was 0.020 m(2)/ton, which was greatly less than that when the channels were natural. The artificial stabilization of the deltaic channels had negative impact on the land gain. Assuming no artificial adjustment to the deltaic channels, the total land gain would increase 435 km(2). The land gain of the two lobes was a function of the cumulative sediment discharges, shoreline lengths and Course Shift Bonuses under the circumstance of historical river channel changes. The critical sediment discharge maintaining the area balance of the two lobes was a function of historical shoreline lengths, which increased linearly from 61 M ton in 1976 to an average of 163 M ton during 1996-2016. In the future, there are two ways to increase the land gain under the less Huanghe sediment discharge: reducing artificial disturbance of deltaic channels and letting the river enter the sea through the southwest coast of Qingshuigou Lobe.

TI  - Recent Glacier Mass Balance and Area Changes from DEMs and Landsat Images in Upper Reach of Shule River Basin, Northeastern Edge of Tibetan Plateau during 2000 to 2015
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier changes in the Upper Reach of the Shule River Basin (URSRB) serve as a good indicator of climate change in the western part of the Qilian Mountains, located on the northeastern edge of the Tibetan Plateau. However, information on recent glacier changes in the URSRB is limited. In this study, the changes in ice surface elevation were determined using geodetic methods based on digital elevation models (DEMs) derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) (2000), and from pairs of Third Resources Satellite (ZY-3) of China (taken around 2013). In addition, glacier area changes from 2000-2015, were derived from Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images. The results suggest that 478 glaciers with an area of 375.1 +/- 2.68 km(2) remained in the URSRB in 2015. Ice cover diminished by 57.5 +/- 2.68 km(2) (11.9 +/- 0.60%), or 0.79 +/- 0.04% a(-1) and 35 small glaciers disappeared from 2000 to 2015 in the URSRB. The most pronounced glacier shrinkage occurred during 2004 to 2009. The average ice surface elevation of the URSRB from 1999 to 2013 reduced by about 4.98 +/- 0.6 m, which is equal to a mass loss of 0.383 +/- 0.046 ma(-1). This reduction indicates that the ice storage loss has accelerated since 1999, compared to a mass loss of 0.21 +/- 0.04 ma(-1) around Tuanjiefeng from 1966 to 1999, as reported by Xu et al. (2013).

TI  - Glacier variations at Aru Co in western Tibet from 1971 to 2016 derived from remote-sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Twin glaciers collapsed in 2016 near Aru Co, western Tibet and caused extreme loss to human beings. In this study, we attempted to track the dynamics of glaciers in the region, for example the glacier area and mass changes in Aru Co for the period 1971-2016, which were determined using topographic maps and Landsat images and ASTER-derived DEMs (2011-16), the Shuttle Radar Terrain Mission DEM (2000) and topographic maps (1971). Our results showed that the glacier area of Aru Co decreased by -0.4 +/- 4.1% during 1971-2016. The geodetic mass-balance results showed that the glaciers in Aru Co lost mass at a rate of -0.15 +/- 0.30 m w.e. a(-1) during 1971-99, while they gained mass at a rate of 0.33 +/- 0.61 m w.e. a(-1) for the period 1999-2016. The twin glaciers experienced a larger negative mass budget than the others in the region before 1999. This process produced large amounts of meltwater, followed by a sustained increase in the meltwater on the pressure melting point, possibly in response to a period of positive mass balance (1999-2016) and then, transferred to the glacier bed until the glaciers collapsed.

TI  - An Integrated Spatio-Spectral-Temporal Sparse Representation Method for Fusing Remote-Sensing Images With Different Resolutions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - t Different spectral, spatial, and temporal features have been widely used in the remote-sensing image analysis. The further development of multiple sensor remote-sensing technologies has made it necessary to explore new methods of remote-sensing image fusion using different optical image data sets which provide complementary image properties and a tradeoff among spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions. However, due to problems in assessing correlations between different types of satellite data with different resolutions, a few efforts have been made to explore spatio-spectral-temporal features. For this purpose, we propose a novel sparse representation model to generate synthesized frequent high-spectral and high-spatial resolution data by blending multiple types: spatio-temporal data fusion, spectral-temporal data fusion, spatio-spectral data fusion, and spatio-spectral-temporal data fusion. The proposed method exploits high-spectral correlation across spectral domains and high self-similarity across spatial domains to learn the spatio-spectral fusion basis. Then, it associates temporal changes using a local constraint sparse representation. The integrated spatio-spectral-temporal sparse representation model based on the learned spectral-spatial and temporal change features strengthens the model's ability to provide high-resolution data needed to address demanding work in real-world applications. Finally, the proposed method is not restricted to a certain type of data, but it can associate any type of remote-sensing data and be applied to dynamic changes in heterogeneous landscapes. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.

TI  - Landslide Monitoring Using Multi-Temporal SAR Interferometry with Advanced Persistent Scatterers Identification Methods and Super High-Spatial Resolution TerraSAR-X Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the most common and dangerous threats in the world that generate considerable damage and economic losses. An efficient landslide monitoring tool is the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) or Persistent Scatter Interferometry (PSI). However, landslides are usually located in mountainous areas and the area of interest can be partially or even heavily vegetated. The inherent temporal decorrelation that dramatically reduces the number of Persistent Scatters (PSs) of the scene limits in practice the application of this technique. Thus, it is crucial to be able to detect as much PSs as possible that can be usually embedded in decorrelated areas. High resolution imagery combined with efficient pixel selection methods can make possible the application of DInSAR techniques in landslide monitoring. In this paper, different strategies to identify PS Candidates (PSCs) have been employed together with 32 super high-spatial resolution (SHR) TerraSAR-X (TSX) images, staring-spotlight mode, to monitor the Canillo landslide (Andorra). The results show that advanced PSI strategies (i.e., the temporal sub-look coherence (TSC) and temporal phase coherence (TPC) methods) are able to obtain much more valid PSs than the classical amplitude dispersion (DA) method. In addition, the TPC method presents the best performance among all three full-resolution strategies employed. The SHR TSX data allows for obtaining much higher densities of PSs compared with a lower-spatial resolution SAR data set (Sentinel-1A in this study). Thanks to the huge amount of valid PSs obtained by the TPC method with SHR TSX images, the complexity of the structure of the Canillo landslide has been highlighted and three different slide units have been identified. The results of this study indicate that the TPC approach together with SHR SAR images can be a powerful tool to characterize displacement rates and extension of complex landslides in challenging areas.

T2  - PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rootstock and scion have significant effects on fruit production in sweet cherry, but their interplay has not been fully detected for the cellular mechanism at different fruiting stages. In this study, three sweet cherry scions of 'Lapins', '8-102' and 'Rainier' were planted with four rootstocks of 'Mahaleb', 'Dwarf', 'ZY-1', and 'Latin'resulting in 12 combined cultivars. Fruits were sampled at four growing stages. On 28 May, 2015 parameters of fruit weight, length, and diameter were greatest in trees with combined scion of '8-102' X rootstock of 'ZY-1', followed by the combination of '8-102' `Dwarf'. On 24 June, 2015 fruit cell number was found to have a positive correlation with fruit length and weight. In conclusion, scions of '8-102' and 'Rainier' is recommended for grafting on rootstock of 'Latin' for desired mature fruit quality through abundant mesocarp cell division.

TI  - The Temporal-Spatial Characteristics of Drought in the Loess Plateau Using the Remote-Sensed TRMM Precipitation Data from 1998 to 2014
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall gauges are always sparse in the arid and semi-arid areas of Northwest China, which makes it difficult to precisely study the characteristics of drought at a large scale in this region and similar areas. This study used the TRMM (The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) multi-satellite precipitation data to study the spatial-temporal evolution of drought in the Loess Plateau based on the SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) drought index for the period of 1998-2014. The results indicate that the monthly TRMM precipitation data are well matched with the observed precipitation, indicating that this remotely sensed data set can be reliably used to calculate the SPI drought index. Based on the study findings, the average precipitation in the Loess Plateau is showing a significant increasing trend at the rate of 4.46 mm/year. From the spatial perspective, the average annual precipitation in the Southeast is generally greater than that in the Northwest. However, the annual precipitation in the Southeast area is showing a decreasing trend, whereas, the annual precipitation in the northwest areas is showing an increasing trend. Through the SPI analysis, the 3-month SPI and 12-month SPI were both showing an increasing trend, which indicates that the drought severity in the Loess Plateau was a generally declining trend at a seasonal to annual time scale. From the spatial perspective, the SPI values in the Central and Northwest of the Loess Plateau were significantly increasing, whereas, the SPI values in the southern area of the Loess Plateau were slightly decreasing. From the seasonal characteristics, the high-risk area for drought in the spring was concentrated in the northeast and southwest part, and in the summer and autumn, the high-risk area was transferred to the south part. Through this study, it is concluded that the Loess Plateau was likely getting wetter during the time period since the Grain-for-Green Project (1999-2012) was implemented, which replaced much farmland with forestry. This is a positive signal for vegetation recovery and ecological restoration in the near future.

TI  - Direct Comparison Between Active C-Band Radar and Passive L-Band Radiometer Measurements: Extreme Event Cases
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Co-located over extreme events, C-band co-polarized and cross-polarized normalized radar cross sections (NRCS) and L-band ocean surface roughness brightness temperature (T-B,T-rough) are directly compared to analyze the similarities and differences between these two parameters at medium resolution (about 25 km). NRCS in VH-polarization and VV-polarization (sigma(0,VH), sigma(0,VV)) were acquired by Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar. T-B,T-rough is estimated from brightness temperatures (T-B) measured by the L-band radiometer on-board the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. When the rain rate is less than 20 mm/h, a striking linear relationship is found between active C-Band cross-polarized NRCS and passive L-Band T-B,T-rough sigma(0,VH)(theta(SAR)) proportional to tan(theta(SAR)) x T-B,T-rough(theta(SMAP) = 40 degrees), without any apparent saturation for T-B,T-rough ranging from 3.5 to 17 K. Compared to both high T-B,T-rough and sigma(0,VH), co-polarized sigma(0,VV) measurements saturate. As interpreted, this can correspond to a regime change of the air-sea interactions during extreme events. In heavy rain conditions, C-band co-polarized NRCS decreases for extreme situations. In these cases, the covariation between C-band cross-polarized NRCS and L-band T-B,T-rough is less evident. An accurate and unambiguous assessment of the impact of rain will deserve further investigations.

TI  - The Generalized Gamma-DBN for High-Resolution SAR Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increase of resolution, effective characterization of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image becomes one of the most critical problems in many earth observation applications. Inspired by deep learning and probability mixture models, a generalized Gamma deep belief network (g-DBN) is proposed for SAR image statistical modeling and land-cover classification in this work. Specifically, a generalized Gamma-Bernoulli restricted Boltzmann machine (gB-RBM) is proposed to capture high-order statistical characterizes from SAR images after introducing the generalized Gamma distribution. After stacking the gB-RBM and several standard binary RBMs in a hierarchical manner, a g-DBN is constructed to learn high-level representation of different SAR land-covers. Finally, a discriminative neural network is constructed by adding an additional predict layer for different land-covers over the constructed deep structure. Performance of the proposed approach is evaluated via several experiments on some high-resolution SAR image patch sets and two large-scale scenes which are captured by ALOS PALSAR-2 and COSMO-SkyMed satellites respectively.

TI  - A Practical Two-Stage Algorithm for Retrieving Land Surface Temperature from AMSR-E Data-A Case Study Over China
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)
CL  - Fort Worth, TX
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter that directly affects the water and heat balance between the Earth surface and atmosphere. Mapping the LST distribution at continuous temporal and wide spatial scales is very helpful for researching many physical and biochemical processes. Remotely sensed instruments are the key players in these studies. Passive microwave remotely sensed data have the advantage of retrieving the land parameters under nearly all weather conditions because of the power to penetrate clouds. In this study, a practical two-stage algorithm, which uses single-frequency and double-polarization passive microwave brightness temperature observations, is presented to retrieve the LST over China. The vertically polarized land surface emissivity (LSE) at 18.7 GHz is first estimated by a parameterization relationship with the polarization ratio (PR), which is defined as the ratio of the horizontal to the vertical brightness temperatures at the same frequency. Subsequently, the LST is retrieved using the estimated LSE by ignoring the atmospheric effect. The evaluation of the simulated data shows an RMSE of 1.45 K, which is very encouraging. The cross validations by the satellite thermal infrared products are from daily to monthly time scales. The daily accuracy is 3.04 K and the bimonthly accuracy is 4.43 K. A high positive bias in arid and semiarid regions and a negative bias in frequently cloudy regions are noticeable in both comparisons. These biases do not reveal the uncertainties of this LST retrieval algorithm; on the contrary, the retrieved the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer -EOS (AMSR-E) LST appears to be more reasonable compared to the thermal infrared LST under certain circumstances.

TI  - Canopy Reflectance Modeling of Aquatic Vegetation for Algorithm Development: Global Sensitivity Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing of aquatic vegetation in shallow water is an essential aid to ecosystem protection, but it is difficult because the spectral characteristics of the vegetation are sensitive to external features such as water background effects, atmospheric effects, and the structural properties of the canopy. A global sensitivity analysis of an aquatic vegetation radiative transfer model provides invaluable background for algorithm development for use in optical remote sensing. Here, we use the extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (EFAST) method for the modelling. Four different cases were identified by subdividing the ranges of water depth and leaf area index (LAI) involved. The results indicate that the reflectance of emergent vegetation is affected mainly by the concentrations of chlorophyll a + b in leaves (Cab), leaf inclination distribution function parameter (LIDFa) and LAI. The parameter LAI is influential in sparse vegetation cases whereas Cab and LIDFa are influential in dense vegetation cases. Canopy reflectance for submerged vegetation is dominated by water parameters. Relatively, LAI and Cab are highly sensitive vegetation parameters. The analysis is extended to vegetation index as well, which takes the Sentinel-2A as the reference sensor. It shows that NDAVI (Normalized Difference Aquatic Vegetation Index) is suitable for retrieving LAI in all cases except deep-sparse for emergent vegetation, whereas NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) would be better in the deep-sparse case. NDVI, NDAVI and WAVI (Water Adjusted Vegetation Index), respectively, are suitable for retrieving Cab, Car and LIDFa in dense cases. For submerged vegetation, the sensitivity of LAI to NDAVI is relatively high only in the shallow-sparse case. The adjustment factor L in SAVI and WAVI fails to suppress the sensitivity to water constituent parameters. The sensitivity of LAI and Cab to NDVI in deep cases is relatively higher than that to the other indices, which may provide clues for the construction of inversion algorithms in macrophyte remote sensing in the aquatic environment using spectral signatures in the visible and near infrared regions.

TI  - A Method for Monitoring Iron and Steel Factory Economic Activity Based on Satellites
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Chinese government has promulgated a de-capacity policy for economic growth and environmental sustainability, especially for the iron and steel industry. With these policies, this study aimed to monitor the economic activities and evaluate the production conditions of an iron and steel factory based on satellites via Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data and high-resolution images from January 2013 to October 2017, and propel next economic adjustment and environmental protection. Our methods included the construction of a heat island intensity index for an iron and steel factory (ISHII), a heat island radio index for an iron and steel factory (ISHRI) and a dense classifying approach to monitor the spatiotemporal changes of the internal heat field of an iron and steel factory. Additionally, we used GF-2 and Google Earth images to identify the main production area, detect facility changes to a factory that alters its heat field and verify the accuracy of thermal analysis in a specific time span. Finally, these methods were used together to evaluate economic activity. Based on five iron and steel factories in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, when the ISHII curve is higher than the seasonal changes in a time series, production is normal; otherwise, there is a shut-down or cut-back. In the spatial pattern analyses, the ISHRI is large in normal production and decreases when cut-back or shut-down occurs. The density classifying images and high-resolution images give powerful evidence to the above-mentioned results. Finally, three types of economic activities of normal production, shut-down or cut-back were monitored for these samples. The study provides a new perspective and method for monitoring the economic activity of an iron and steel factory and provides supports for sustainable development in China.

TI  - Glacier mass balance in the Qinghai Tibet Plateau and its surroundings from the mid-1970s to 2000 based on Hexagon KH-9 and SRTM DEMs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global warming, glacier changes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and its surroundings have attracted a great amount of public attention. To date, there have been many studies of glacier mass balance across the QTP. However, given that most of the previous studies have focused on a short observation period (2000-2015), and that long-term mass change measurements are available only for some local regions, we utilized declassified KH-9 images and 1 arc-second Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation models (DEMs) to provide the region-wide mass balance (from the mid-1970s to 2000) for a larger scale (including 11 sample regions) across the QTP and its surroundings. The final results indicate that the glaciers in the northwest of the QTP have shown a less negative or near-zero mass balance, ranging from-0.11 +/- 0.13 m w.e. a(-1) to 0.02 +/- 0.10 m w.e. a(-1), compared to those in the southeast part, with a mass balance range of-0.30 +/- 0.12 m w.e. a(-1) to-0.11 +/- 0.14 m w.e. a(-1). The most serious mass loss has emerged in the central eastern Himalaya. Integrating our results with the observations after 2000 suggests that, over the past four decades (mid-1970s to the mid-2010s), the glaciers in the Himalaya, Nyaingentanglha, and Tanggula mountains, as a whole, have exhibited accelerated mass loss, and the most significant acceleration has occurred in the eastern Nyaincientanglha. Moreover, the Hindu Raj glaciers have shown a stable rate of continuous mass loss, while a nearly stable or slight mass gain state in the western Kunlun region can be dated back to at least as far as the mid-1970s.

TI  - A numerical simulation study on the impact of smoke aerosols from Russian forest fires on the air pollution over Asia
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Serious forest fires were observed over Siberia, particularly in the vast area between Lake Baikal and the Gulf of Ob, during the period of 18-27 July 2016 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. The Cloud -Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite simultaneously detected a multitude of smoke aerosols surrounding the same area. Combing a Lagrangian Flexible Particle dispersion model (FLEXPART) executed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model output, the transport of smoke aerosols and the quantification of impact of Russian forest fires on the Asia were investigated. From model simulations, two transport paths were determined for the smoke plumes from the Russian forest fires. The first path was directed southwestward from Russia to Central Asia and eventually Xinjiang Province of China, furthermore, the second path was directed southeastward through Mongolia to Northeast China. The FLEXPART-WRF model simulations also revealed that the smoke aerosol concentrations entering the Central Asia, Mongolia and Northern China were approximately 60-300 mu g m(-3), 40-250 mu g m(-3) and 5-140 mu g m(-3), respectively. Meanwhile, the aerosol particles from these forest fires have an impact on the air quality in Asia. With the arrival of smoke aerosols from the Russian forest fires, the near-surface PM10 concentrations over Altay, Hulunbuir and Harbin increased to 61, 146 and 42 mu g m(-3), respectively. In conclusion, smoke aerosols from Russian forest fires can variably influence the air quality over Central Asia, Mongolia and Northern China.

TI  - A Cloud Detection Method for Landsat 8 Images Based on PCANet
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud detection for remote sensing images is often a necessary process, because cloud is widespread in optical remote sensing images and causes a lot of difficulty to many remote sensing activities, such as land cover monitoring, environmental monitoring and target recognizing. In this paper, a novel cloud detection method is proposed for multispectral remote sensing images from Landsat 8. Firstly, the color composite image of Bands 6, 3 and 2 is divided into superpixel sub-regions through Simple Linear Iterative Cluster (SLIC) method. Then, a two-step superpixel classification strategy is used to predict each superpixel as cloud or non-cloud. Thirdly, a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) model is used to refine the cloud detection result, and accurate cloud borders are obtained. In the two-step superpixel classification strategy, the bright and thick cloud superpixels, as well as the obvious non-cloud superpixels, are firstly separated from potential cloud superpixels through a threshold function, which greatly speeds up the detection. The designed double-branch PCA Network (PCANet) architecture can extract the high-level information of cloud, then combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, the potential superpixels are correctly classified. Visual and quantitative comparison experiments are conducted on the Landsat 8 Cloud Cover Assessment (L8 CCA) dataset; the results indicate that our proposed method can accurately detect clouds under different conditions, which is more effective and robust than the compared state-of-the-art methods.

TI  - Analyzing control of respiratory particulate matter on Land Surface Temperature in local climatic zones of English Bazar Municipality and Surroundings
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Local climatic zone (LCZ), a systematic classification of internal urban morphology based on physical and thermal, radiative, land cover and geometric properties of the urban area, is identified in English Bazar Municipality and its surrounding region. Spatial land surface temperature (LST) and respiratory particulate matter (RPM) are also identified in each LCZ for characterizing the ecological milieu for living. It is also attempted to correlate RPM and LST in each LCZ for determining the impact of RPM on LST. Landsat satellite images, google earth images are employed for extracting LST, RPM and LCZ characters. Validation process using both ground control points, air temperature data and data from Pollution Control Board are applied for establishing the degree of sensitivity of the LCZ, LST and RPM models. Nine LCZs e.g. compact low-rise, open mid-rise, open low-rise, light weight low-rise etc. zones are recognized in this study area. Relatively high LST and RPM with significant spatio-seasonal variation is recognized in compact low-rise, open mid-rise, open low-rise, light weight low-rise and bare soil zones. Positive linear regression model with strong coefficient of determination (R-2) is identified between RPM and LST in the built up dominated LCZ (R-2 > 0.8).

T2  - NEUE ZEITSCHRIFT FUR SYSTEMATISCHE THEOLOGIE UND RELIGIONSPHILOSOPHIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is devoted to the analysis of the last controversy between theist and pantheist worldview in German speculative thought, which took place in the 1870s. The protagonists of the controversy are theist Immanuel Hermann Fichte - the son of the great German idealist J. G. Fichte - on one side, and the famous pessimist Eduard von Hartmann, whose philosophy of the Unconscious reflects main pantheistic ideas, on the other side. Both philosophers develop speculative philosophic-theological doctrines. The author indicates the deep conceptual unity of these doctrines, which is present in spite of their numerous theoretical discrepancies. The central obstacle, however, that makes the theoretical reconciliation between two philosophers impossible is the different comprehension of the scope of human mind's competences.

TI  - MODIS NDVI trends and fractional land cover change for improved assessments of vegetation degradation in Burkina Faso, West Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Reduction of natural vegetation cover in the savannah of West Africa constitutes a pressing environmental concern that may lead to soil degradation. With the aim to assess the degradation of natural vegetation in the savannah of Burkina Faso, this study combined NDVI trends and fractional Land Use/Cover Change (LULCC). Fractional LULCC maps, derived from the aggregation of a 30 m Landsat LULCC map (1999-2011) to 250 m resolution of MODIS, were used to assess natural vegetation conversions in the small-scale spatial patterns of savannah landscapes. Mann-Kendall's monotonic trend test was applied to 250 m MODIS NDVI time series (2000-2011) to assess modifications of natural vegetation cover. Finally, the Spearman's correlation was employed to determine the relationship of natural vegetation degradation with environmental factors. The study revealed a vast conversion of natural vegetation into agriculture (15.9%) and non-vegetated area (1.8%) between 1999 and 2011. Significant decreasing NDVI trends (p < .05) indicated negative modifications of natural vegetation (2000-2011 period) occurring along the protected areas borders and in fragmented landscapes characterized by disruption of continuity in natural vegetation. Spearman's correlation showed that accessibility, climatic and topographic conditions favored natural vegetation degradation. The results can enable the development of efficient land degradation policies.

TI  - Global gridded anthropogenic emissions inventory of carbonyl sulfide
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric carbonyl sulfide (COS or OCS) is the most abundant sulfur containing gas in the troposphere and is an atmospheric tracer for the carbon cycle. Gridded inventories of global anthropogenic COS are used for interpreting global COS measurements. However, previous gridded anthropogenic data are a climatological estimate based on input data that is over three decades old and are not representative of current conditions. Here we develop a new gridded data set of global anthropogenic COS sources that includes more source sectors than previously available and uses the most current emissions factors and industry activity data as input. Additionally, the inventory is provided as annually varying estimates from years 1980-2012 and employs a source specific spatial scaling procedure. We estimate a global source in year 2012 of 406GgS y(-1) (range of 223-586 Gg S y(_1)), which is highly concentrated in China and is twice as large as the previous gridded inventory. Our large upward revision in the bottom-up estimate of the source is consistent with a recent top-down estimate based on air-monitoring and Antarctic firn data. Furthermore, our inventory time trends, including a decline in the 1990's and growth after the year 2000, are qualitatively consistent with trends in atmospheric data. Finally, similarities between the spatial distribution in this inventory and remote sensing data suggest that the anthropogenic source could potentially play a role in explaining a missing source in the global COS budget.

TI  - Mapping and modelling the impact of mass drug adminstration on filariasis prevalence in Myanmar
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is endemic in Myanmar and targeted for elimination. To highlight the National Programme to Eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis (NPELF) progress between 2000 and 2014, this paper describes the geographical distribution of LF, the scale-up and impact of mass drug administration (MDA) implementation, and the first evidence of the decline in transmission in five districts.Methods: The LF distribution was determined by mapping historical and baseline prevalence data collected by NPELF. Data on the MDA implementation, reported coverage rates and sentinel site surveillance were summarized. A statistical model was developed from the available prevalence data to predict prevalence at township level by year of measurement. Transmission assessment survey (TAS) methods, measuring antigenemia (Ag) prevalence in children, were used to determine whether prevalence was below a level where recrudescence is unlikely to occur.Results: The highest baseline LF prevalence was found in the Central Valley region. The MDA implementation activities scaled up to cover 45 districts, representing the majority of the endemic population, with drug coverage rates ranging from 60.0% to 98.5%. Challenges related to drug supply and local conflict were reported, and interrupted MDA in some districts. Overall, significant reductions in LF prevalence were found, especially after the first 2 to 3 rounds of MDA, which was supported by the corresponding model. The TAS activities in five districts found only two Ag positive children, resulting in all districts passing the critical threshold.Conclusion: Overall, the Myanmar NPELF has made positive steps forward in the elimination of LF despite several challenges, however, it needs to maintain momentum, drawing on international stakeholder support, to aim towards the national and global goals of elimination.

TI  - Validation of MODIS 3 km land aerosol optical depth from NASA's EOS Terra and Aqua missions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In addition to the standard resolution product (10 km), the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Collection 6 (C006) data release included a higher resolution (3 km). Other than accommodations for the two different resolutions, the 10 and 3 km Dark Target (DT) algorithms are basically the same. In this study, we perform global validation of the higher-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) over global land by comparing against AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measurements. The MODIS-AERONET collocated data sets consist of 161 410 high-confidence AOD pairs from 2000 to 2015 for Terra MODIS and 2003 to 2015 for Aqua MODIS. We find that 62.5 and 68.4% of AODs retrieved from Terra MODIS and Aqua MODIS, respectively, fall within previously published expected error bounds of +/-(0.05 + 0.2 x AOD), with a high correlation (R = 0.87). The scatter is not random, but exhibits a mean positive bias of similar to 0.06 for Terra and similar to 0.03 for Aqua. These biases for the 3 km product are approximately 0.03 larger than the biases found in similar validations of the 10 km product. The validation results for the 3 km product did not have a relationship to aerosol loading (i.e., true AOD), but did exhibit dependence on quality flags, region, viewing geometry, and aerosol spatial variability. Time series of global MODIS-AERONET differences show that validation is not static, but has changed over the course of both sensors' lifetimes, with Terra MODIS showing more change over time. The likely cause of the change of validation over time is sensor degradation, but changes in the distribution of AERONET stations and differences in the global aerosol system itself could be contributing to the temporal variability of validation.

TI  - 1399 H&E-stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients: the CAMELYON dataset
T2  - GIGASCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Background: The presence of lymph node metastases is one of the most important factors in breast cancer prognosis. The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results: We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. Conclusions: A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use.

TI  - Low cost, multiscale and multi-sensor application for flooded area mapping
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood mapping and estimation of the maximum water depth are essential elements for the first damage evaluation, civil protection intervention planning and detection of areas where remediation is needed.In this work, we present and discuss a methodology for mapping and quantifying flood severity over floodplains. The proposed methodology considers a multiscale and multisensor approach using free or low-cost data and sensors. We applied this method to the November 2016 Piedmont (north-western Italy) flood. We first mapped the flooded areas at the basin scale using free satellite data from low-to medium-high-resolution from both the SAR (Sentinel-1, COSMO-Skymed) and multispectral sensors (MODIS, Sentinel-2). Using very-and ultra-high-resolution images from the lowcost aerial platform and remotely piloted aerial system, we refined the flooded zone and detected the most damaged sector. The presented method considers both urbanised and non-urbanised areas. Nadiral images have several limitations, in particular in urbanised areas, where the use of terrestrial images solved this limitation. Very-and ultra-high-resolution images were processed with structure from motion (SfM) for the realisation of 3-D models. These data, combined with an available digital terrain model, allowed us to obtain maps of the flooded area, maximum high water area and damaged infrastructures.

TI  - Mapping Surface Temperatures on a Debris-Covered Glacier With an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A layer of debris cover often accumulates across the surface of glaciers in active mountain ranges with exceptionally steep terrain, such as the Andes, Himalaya, and New Zealand Alps. Such a supraglacial debris layer has a major influence on a glacier's surface energy budget, enhancing radiation absorption, and melt when the layer is thin, but insulating the ice when thicker than a few cm. Information on spatially distributed debris surface temperature has the potential to provide insight into the properties of the debris, its effects on the ice below and its influence on the near-surface boundary layer. Here, we deploy an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a thermal infrared sensor on three separate missions over one day to map changing surface temperatures across the debris-covered Lirung Glacier in the Central Himalaya. We present a methodology to georeference and process the acquired thermal imagery, and correct for emissivity and sensor bias. Derived UAV surface temperatures are compared with distributed simultaneous in situ temperature measurements as well as with Landsat 8 thermal satellite imagery. Results show that the UAV-derived surface temperatures vary greatly both spatially and temporally, with -1.4 +/- 1.8, 11.0 +/- 5.2, and 15.3 +/- 4.7 degrees C for the three flights (mean +/- sd), respectively. The range in surface temperatures over the glacier during the morning is very large with almost 50 degrees C. Ground-based measurements are generally in agreement with the UAV imagery, but considerable deviations are present that are likely due to differences in measurement technique and approach, and validation is difficult as a result. The difference in spatial and temporal variability captured by the UAV as compared with much coarser satellite imagery is striking and it shows that satellite derived temperature maps should be interpreted with care. We conclude that UAVs provide a suitable means to acquire surface temperature maps of debris-covered glacier surfaces at high spatial and temporal resolution, but that there are caveats with regard to absolute temperature measurement.

TI  - Tensions between direct measurements of the lens power spectrum from <i>Planck</i> data
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply a recently developed method to directly measure the gravitational lensing power spectrum from CMB power spectra to the Planck satellite data. This method allows us to analyze the tension between the temperature power spectrum and lens reconstruction in a model-independent way. Even when allowing for arbitrary variations in the lensing power spectrum, the tension remains at the 2.4 sigma level. By separating the lensing and unlensed high redshift information in the CMB power spectra, we also show that under Lambda CDM the two are in tension at a similar level, whereas the unlensed information is consistent with lensing reconstruction. These anomalies are driven by the smoother acoustic peaks relative to Lambda CDM at l similar to 1250-1500. Both tensions relax slightly when polarization data are considered. This technique also isolates the one combination of the lensing power spectrum multipoles that the Planck CMB power spectra currently constrain and can be straightforwardly generalized to future data when CMB power spectra constrain multiple aspects of lensing which are themselves correlated with lensing reconstruction.

T2  - BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVETo estimate long term survival, health, and educational/social functioning in patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis compared with the general population.DESIGNNationwide population based cohort study using national registers.SETTINGDenmark.PARTICIPANTSAll Danish residents diagnosed during 1986-2016 as having Lyme neuroborreliosis (n= 2067), defined as a positive Borrelia burgdorferi intrathecal antibody test and a clinical diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis, and a comparison cohort from the general population matched on sex and date of birth (n= 20 670).MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESMortality rate ratios, incidence rate ratios of comorbidities, and differences in educational and social outcomes.RESULTSMortality among patients with Lyme neuroborreliosis was not higher than in the general population (mortality rate ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 1.03). Lyme neuroborreliosis patients had increased risk of haematological (incidence rate ratio 3.07, 2.03 to 4.66) and non-melanoma skin cancers (1.49, 1.18 to 1.88). At diagnosis, Lyme neuroborreliosis patients had slightly higher employment and lower disability pension rates. After five years, patients and comparison cohort members had similar numbers of hospital contacts (difference -0.22, 95% confidence interval -0.45 to 0.02, in-hospital days/year; 0.37, -0.10 to 0.83, outpatient visits/year), employment rates (difference 1.5%, -2.1% to 5.1%), income (difference -1000, -20 000 to 18 000, Danish kroner), days of sick leave (difference -0.3, -3.5 to 3.0, per year), rates of receipt of a disability pension (difference -0.9%, -3.2% to 1.3%), and number of children (difference -0.10, -0.27 to 0.08). More patients were married (difference 4.8%, 2.2% to 7.4%) and had completed high school education (difference 7%, 1% to 12%).CONCLUSIONA verified diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis had no substantial effect on long term survival, health, or educational/social functioning. Nevertheless, the diagnosis decreased labour market involvement marginally and was associated with increased risk of haematological and non-melanoma skin cancers.

TI  - Ch'ol nomenclature for soil classification in the ejido Oxolotan, Tacotalpa, Tabasco, Mexico
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY AND ETHNOMEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The traditional ecological knowledge of land of the Ch'ol originary people from southeast Mexico forms part of their cultural identity; it is local and holistic and implies an integrated physical and spiritual worldview that contributes to improve their living conditions. We analyzed the nomenclature for soil classification used in the Mexican state of Tabasco by the Ch'ol farmers with the objective of contributing to the knowledge of the Maya soil classification.Methods: A map of the study area was generated from the digital database of parcels in the ejido Oxolotan in the municipality of Tacotalpa, to which a geopedological map was overlaid in order to obtain modeled topographic profiles (Zavala-Cruz et al., Ecosistemas y Recursos Agropecuarios 3: 161-171, 2016). In each modeled profile, a soil profile was made and classified according to IUSS Working Group WRB (181, 2014) in order to generate a map of soil groups, which was used to survey the study area with the participation of 245 local Ch'ol farmers for establishing an ethnopedological soil classification (Ortiz et al.: 62, 1990). In addition, we organized a participatory workshop with 35 people to know details of the names of the soils and their indicators of fertility and workability, from which we selected 15 participants for field trips and description of soil profiles.Results: The color, texture, and stoniness are attributes important in the Ch'ol nomenclature, although the names do not completely reflect the visible characteristic of the soil surface. On the other hand, the mere presence of stones is sufficient to name a land class, while according to IUSS Working Group WRB (181, 2014), a certain amount and distribution of stones in the soil profiles is necessary to be taken into consideration in the name. Perception of soil quality by local farmers considers the compaction or hardness of the cultivable soil layer, because of which black or sandy soils are perceived as better for cultivation of banana, or as secondary vegetation in fallow. Red, yellow, or brown soils are seen as of less quality and are only used for establishing grasslands, while maize is cultivated in all soil classes.Conclusions: Farmers provided the Ch'ol nomenclature, perceived problems, and uses of each class of soil. Translation of Ch'ol soil names and comparison with descriptions of soil profiles revealed that the Ch'ol soil nomenclature takes into account the soil profile, given it is based on characteristics of both surface and subsurface horizons including color of soil matrix and mottles, stoniness, texture, and vegetation.

TI  - Characteristics of aerosol vertical profiles in Tsukuba, Japan, and their impacts on the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Vertical profiles of the aerosol physical and optical properties, with a focus on seasonal means and on transport events, were investigated in Tsukuba, Japan, by a synergistic remote sensing method that uses lidar and sky radiometer data. The retrieved aerosol vertical profiles of the springtime mean and five transport events were input to our developed one-dimensional atmospheric model, and the impacts of the aerosol vertical profiles on the evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) were studied by numerical sensitivity experiments. The characteristics of the aerosol vertical profiles in Tsukuba are as follows: (1) the retrieval results in the spring showed that aerosol optical thickness at 532 nm in the free atmosphere (FA) was 0.13, greater than 0.08 in the ABL owing to the frequent occurrence of transported aerosols in the FA. In other seasons, optical thickness in the FA was almost the same as that in the ABL. (2) The aerosol optical and physical properties in the ABL showed a dependency on the extinction coefficient. With an increase in the extinction coefficient from 0.00 to 0.24 km(-1), the Angstrom exponent increased from 0.0 to 2.0, the single-scattering albedo increased from 0.87 to 0.99, and the asymmetry factor decreased from 0.75 to 0.50. (3) The large variability in the physical and optical properties of aerosols in the FA were attributed to transport events, during which the transported aerosols consisted of varying amounts of dust and smoke particles depending on where they originated (China, Mongolia, or Russia). The results of the numerical sensitivity experiments using the aerosol vertical profiles of the springtime mean and five transport events in the FA are as follows: (1) numerical sensitivity experiments based on simulations conducted with and without aerosols showed that aerosols caused the net downward radiation and the sensible and latent heat fluxes at the surface to decrease. The decrease in temperature in the ABL (0.2 to 0.6 K) and the direct heating of aerosols in the FA (0.0 to 0.4 K) strengthened the capping inversion around the top of the ABL. Consequently, the ABL height was decreased by 133 to 208 m in simulations with aerosols compared to simulations without aerosols. (2) We also conducted simulations in which all aerosols were compressed into the ABL but in which the columnar properties were the same and compared with the simulation results for uncompressed aerosol profiles. The results showed that the reductions in net downward radiation and in sensible and latent heat fluxes were the same in both types of simulations. However, the capping inversion in the simulations with compression was weakened owing to aerosol direct heating in the ABL and the lack of direct heating in the FA. This resulted in an increase in the ABL height, compared with that in the simulations without compression. (3) The dependencies of the 2 m temperature and ABL height on the optical thickness and Angstrom exponent in the FA were investigated using the results of the numerical sensitivity tests. The 2 m temperature and ABL height was decreased with an increase in the optical thickness, and their reduction rates increase with a decrease in the Angstrom exponent because the optical thickness in the near-infrared wavelength region was large when the Angstrom exponent was small. However, there was a case in which the Angstrom exponent was large but the decrease in the ABL height was the largest of all the simulation results.In this case, the strong capping inversion due to the large extinction coefficient around the top of the ABL was an import factor. These results suggest that the vertical profiles of the aerosol physical and optical properties, and the resulting direct heating has important effects on the ABL evolution.

TI  - Technical note: Evaluation of the simultaneous measurements of mesospheric OH, HO<sub>2</sub> , and O<sub>3</sub> under a photochemical equilibrium assumption - a statistical approach
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This Technical Note presents a statistical approach to evaluating simultaneous measurements of several atmospheric components under the assumption of photochemical equilibrium. We consider simultaneous measurements of OH, HO2, and O-3 at the altitudes of the mesosphere as a specific example and their daytime photochemical equilibrium as an evaluating relationship. A simplified algebraic equation relating local concentrations of these components in the 50-100 km altitude range has been derived. The parameters of the equation are temperature, neutral density, local zenith angle, and the rates of eight reactions. We have performed a one-year simulation of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere using a 3-D chemical-transport model. The simulation shows that the discrepancy between the calculated evolution of the components and the equilibrium value given by the equation does not exceed 3-4 % in the full range of altitudes independent of season or latitude. We have developed a statistical Bayesian evaluation technique for simultaneous measurements of OH, HO2, and O-3 based on the equilibrium equation taking into account the measurement error. The first results of the application of the technique to MLS/Aura data (Microwave Limb Sounder) are presented in this Technical Note. It has been found that the satellite data of the HO2 distribution regularly demonstrate lower altitudes of this component's mesospheric maximum. This has also been confirmed by model HO2 distributions and comparison with offline retrieval of HO2 from the daily zonal means MLS radiance.

TI  - An Updated Multi-Temporal Glacier Inventory for the Patagonian Andes With Changes Between the Little Ice Age and 2016
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a satellite-derived glacier inventory for the whole Patagonian Andes south of 45. 5 degrees S and Tierra del Fuego including recent changes. Landsat TM/ETM+ and OLI satellite scenes were used to detect changes in the glacierized area between 1986, 2005 and 2016 for all of the 11,209 inventoried glaciers using a semi-automated procedure. Additionally we used geomorphological evidence, such as moraines and trimlines to determine the glacierized area during the Little Ice Age for almost 90% of the total glacierized area. Within the last similar to 150 years the glacierized area was reduced from 28,091 +/- 890 km(2) to 22,636 +/- 905 km(2), marking an absolute area loss of 5,455 +/- 1,269 km(2) (19.4 +/- 4.5%). For the whole study region, the annual area decrease was moderate until 1986 with 0.10 +/- 0.04% a(-1). Afterwards the area reduction increased, reaching annual values of 0.33 +/- 0.28% a(-1) and 0.25 +/- 0.50% a(-1) for the periods of 1986-2005 and 2005-2016, respectively. There is a high variability of change rates throughout the Patagonian Andes. Small glaciers, especially in the north of the Northern Patagonian Icefield (NPI) and between the latter and the Southern Patagonian Icefield (SPI) had over all periods the highest rates of shrinkage, exceeding 0.92 +/- 1.22% a(-1) during 2005-2016. In the mountain range of the Cordillera Darwin (CD), and also accounting for small ice fields south of 52 degrees S, highest rates of shrinkage occurred during 1986-2005, reaching values up to 0.45 +/- 0.23% a(-1), but decreased during the 2005-2016 period. Across the Andean main crest, the eastern parts of the NPI, SPI and adjoined glaciers had in absolute values the highest area reduction exceeding 2,145 +/- 486 km(2) since the LIA. Large calving glaciers show a smaller relative decrease rate compared to land-terminating glaciers but account for the most absolute area loss. In general, glacier shrinkage is dependent on latitude, the initial glacier area, the environment of the glacial tongue (calving or non-calving glaciers) and in parts by glacial aspect.

TI  - Estimation of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) in maize canopies using LiDAR data and hyperspectral imagery
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR) for maize canopies are important for maize growth monitoring and yield estimation. The goal of this study is to explore the potential of using airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data to better estimate maize fPAR. This study focuses on estimating maize fPAR from (1) height and coverage metrics derived from airborne LiDAR point cloud data; (2) vegetation indices derived from hyperspectral imagery; and (3) a combination of these metrics. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationships among LiDAR metrics, hyperspectral metrics, and field-measured fPAR values. Then, multiple linear regression (MLR) models were developed using these metrics. Results showed that (1) LiDAR height and coverage metrics provided good explanatory power (i.e., R-2 = 0.81); ( 2) hyperspectral vegetation indices provided moderate interpretability (i.e., R-2 = 0.50); and ( 3) the combination of LiDAR metrics and hyperspectral metrics improved the LiDAR model (i.e., R-2 = 0.88). These results indicate that LiDAR model seems to offer a reliable method for estimating maize fPAR at a high spatial resolution and it can be used for farmland management. Combining LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics led to better performance of maize fPAR estimation than LiDAR or hyperspectral metrics alone, which means that maize fPAR retrieval can benefit from the complementary nature of LiDAR-detected canopy structure characteristics and hyperspectral-captured vegetation spectral information.

TI  - Searching for the proverbial needle in a haystack: advances in mosquito-borne arbovirus surveillance
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Review
AB  - Surveillance is critical for the prevention and control of mosquito-borne arboviruses. Detection of elevated or emergent virus activity serves as a warning system to implement appropriate actions to reduce outbreaks. Traditionally, surveillance of arboviruses has relied on the detection of specific antibodies in sentinel animals and/or detection of viruses in pools of mosquitoes collected using a variety of sampling methods. These methods, although immensely useful, have limitations, including the need for a cold chain for sample transport, cross-reactivity between related viruses in serological assays, the requirement for specialized equipment or infrastructure, and overall expense. Advances have recently been made on developing new strategies for arbovirus surveillance. These strategies include sugar-based surveillance, whereby mosquitoes are collected in purpose-built traps and allowed to expectorate on nucleic acid preservation cards which are submitted for virus detection. New diagnostic approaches, such as next-generation sequencing, have the potential to expand the genetic information obtained from samples and aid in virus discovery. Here, we review the advancement of arbovirus surveillance systems over the past decade. Some of the novel approaches presented here have already been validated and are currently being integrated into surveillance programs. Other strategies are still at the experimental stage, and their feasibility in the field is yet to be evaluated.

TI  - Estimation of different data compositions for early-season crop type classification
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate crop type distribution maps are an important inputs for crop yield estimation and production forecasting as multi-temporal images can observe phenological differences among crops. Therefore, time series remote sensing data are essential for crop type mapping, and image composition has commonly been used to improve the quality of the image time series. However, the optimal composition period is unclear as long composition periods (such as compositions lasting half a year) are less informative and short composition periods lead to information redundancy and missing pixels. In this study, we initially acquired daily 30 m Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series by fusing MODIS, Landsat, Gaofen and Huanjing (HJ) NDVI, and then composited the NDVI time series using four strategies (daily, 8-day, 16-day, and 32-day). We used Random Forest to identify crop types and evaluated the classification performances of the NDVI time series generated from four composition strategies in two studies regions from Xinjiang, China. Results indicated that crop classification performance improved as crop separabilities and classification accuracies increased, and classification uncertainties dropped in the green-up stage of the crops. When using daily NDVI time series, overall accuracies saturated at 113-day and 116-day in Bole and Luntai, and the saturated overall accuracies (OAs) were 86.13% and 91.89%, respectively. Cotton could be identified 40 similar to 60 days and 35 similar to 45 days earlier than the harvest in Bole and Luntai when using daily, 8-day and 16-day composition NDVI time series since both producer's accuracies (PAs) and user's accuracies (UAs) were higher than 85%. Among the four compositions, the daily NDVI time series generated the highest classification accuracies. Although the 8-day, 16-day and 32-day compositions had similar saturated overall accuracies (around 85% in Bole and 83% in Luntai), the 8-day and 16-day compositions achieved these accuracies around 155-day in Bole and 133-day in Luntai, which were earlier than the 32-day composition (170-day in both Bole and Luntai). Therefore, when the daily NDVI time series cannot be acquired, the 16-day composition is recommended in this study.

TI  - The biomass burning contribution to climate-carbon-cycle feedback
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature exerts strong controls on the incidence and severity of fire. All else equal, warming is expected to increase fire-related carbon emissions, and thereby atmospheric CO2. But the magnitude of this feedback is very poorly known. We use a single-box model of the land biosphere to quantify this positive feedback from satellite-based estimates of biomass burning emissions for 2000-2014 CE and from sedimentary charcoal records for the millennium before the industrial period. We derive an estimate of the centennial-scale feedback strength of 6.5 +/- 3.4 ppmCO(2) per degree of land temperature increase, based on the satellite data. However, this estimate is poorly constrained, and is largely driven by the well-documented dependence of tropical deforestation and peat fires (primarily anthropogenic) on climate variability patterns linked to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Palaeo-data from pre-industrial times provide the opportunity to assess the fire-related climate-carbon- cycle feedback over a longer period, with less pervasive human impacts. Past biomass burning can be quantified based on variations in either the concentration and isotopic composition of methane in ice cores (with assumptions about the isotopic signatures of different methane sources) or the abundances of charcoal preserved in sediments, which reflect landscape-scale changes in burnt biomass. These two data sources are shown here to be coherent with one another. The more numerous data from sedimentary charcoal, expressed as normalized anomalies (fractional deviations from the long-term mean), are then used -together with an estimate of mean biomass burning derived from methane isotope data -to infer a feedback strength of 5.6 +/- 3.2 ppmCO(2) per degree of land temperature and (for a climate sensitivity of 2.8 K) a gain of 0.09 +/- 0.05. This finding indicates that the positive carbon cycle feedback from increased fire provides a substantial contribution to the overall climate-carbon- cycle feedback on centennial timescales. Although the feedback estimates from palaeo- and satellite-era data are in agreement, this is likely fortuitous because of the pervasive influence of human activities on fire regimes during recent decades.

TI  - Weakened Lithosphere Beneath Greenland Inferred From Effective Elastic Thickness: A Hot Spot Effect?
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The effective elastic thickness (T-e) of the lithosphere provides geophysical information about long-term flexural strength and can be used to constrain thermorheological properties of the lithosphere. T-e is typically calculated from the spectral analysis of gravity and topography data; variations in T-e are, however, not well resolved in Greenland due to poor constraints on crustal structure (including crustal thickness) and complications due to ice loading. In addition, geological and geophysical constraints on the tectonic history of Greenland are sparse due to the thick ice cover. Here we use the global gravity model EIGEN-6C4 together with a new model of the crust-mantle boundary to obtain a high-resolution T-e map of Greenland. The distribution of T-e indicates reduced strength in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle beneath southern and central Greenland, which may be due to the passage of the Iceland hot spot during the last 100Ma. In contrast, the northern part of Greenland shows a large T-e, implying mechanical coupling between crust and uppermost mantle and suggesting the existence of a cold and strong tectonic unit. In a relative sense, the distribution of T-e values is consistent with estimates of lithospheric thickness based on seismic velocity models, indicating a dominantly thermal control on lithospheric structure and evolution.Plain Language Summary Greenland is covered by a large ice sheet; its geodynamic history is therefore mostly unknown as only the coastal areas are accessible for direct geological sampling. However, geophysical data can be used to investigate the lithospheric structure to infer its geodynamic history. Here we use satellite gravity data together with elevation data and a crustal density model to look at the distribution of the effective elastic thickness, which provides information about the variations in strength of the lithosphere. We find that most of Greenland's lithosphere is weaker than expected given its age of formation (approximate to 1 billion years), suggesting that it was affected by a thermal event within the last approximate to 400 million years. We interpret the weakness in the lithosphere as a result of the movement of Greenland with respect to hot mantle material, which is now located beneath Iceland leading to large volcanism there. The results of this study show for the first time the effect of the hot mantle material on the lithosphere of Greenland, which can help us identify the different possible tracks of the moving hot mantle material and understand the stability of the ice sheet.

TI  - Inferring Surface Albedo Prediction Error Linked to Forest Structure at High Latitudes
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Predicting the surface albedo of a forest of a given species composition or plant functional type is complicated by the wide range of structural attributes it may display. Accurate characterizations of forest structure are therefore essential to reducing the uncertainty of albedo predictions in forests, particularly in the presence of snow. At present, forest albedo parameterizations remain a nonnegligible source of uncertainty in climate models, and the magnitude attributable to insufficient characterization of forest structure remains unclear. Here we employ a forest classification scheme based on the assimilation of Fennoscandic (i.e., Norway, Sweden, and Finland) national forest inventory data to quantify the magnitude of the albedo prediction error attributable to poor characterizations of forest structure. For a spatial domain spanning similar to 611,000km(2) of boreal forest, we find a mean absolute wintertime (December-March) albedo prediction error of 0.02, corresponding to a mean absolute radiative forcing similar to 0.4W/m(2). Further, we evaluate the implication of excluding albedo trajectories linked to structural transitions in forests during transient simulations of anthropogenic land use/land cover change. We find that, for an intensively managed forestry region in southeastern Norway, neglecting structural transitions over the next quarter century results in a foregone (undetected) radiatively equivalent impact of similar to 178Mt-CO2-eq.year(-1) on average during this perioda magnitude that is roughly comparable to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of a country such as The Netherlands. Our results affirm the importance of improving the characterization of forest structure when simulating surface albedo and associated climate effects.Plain Language Summary Surface albedoor the ratio of reflected to incoming sunlightis an important physical property of the climate system and, as such, requires skillful prediction by climate models. Predicting the surface albedo in a forest during months with snow is complicated by many factors, among which is the sufficiency by which a forest's physical properties are represented in the model. This study makes use of detailed national forest inventory information to estimate the contribution to albedo prediction error that may be wholly attributed to insufficient characterizations of forest structure in a climate model, which we find to be nonnegligible. This study also investigates the consequence of ignoring structural transitions in forests when predicting future surface albedo impacts of forest management activities in climate modeling studies. For a case study region in southeast Norway, we find that not accounting for differences in surface albedo between forests in various development states can result in substantial climate effects going undetected, with magnitudes on the order of the annual greenhouse gas emissions of some European countries such as The Netherlands, or approximately 2days of current global CO2 emissions.

TI  - Retrieval of Aerosol Optical Depth From INSAT-3D Imager Over Asian Landmass and Adjoining Ocean: Retrieval Uncertainty and Validation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - An algorithm for aerosol optical depth () retrieval from imager data onboard geostationary Indian National Satellite (INSAT-3D) is described. The basic principles of the algorithm are adopted from Geostationary Observational Environmental Satellite Aerosol and Smoke Algorithm, where darkest observations over a time period and constant background aerosol optical depth () value are used to derive surface reflectance. However, in INSAT-3D algorithm spatially and temporally dynamic (b) derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-aqua is used. The theoretical simulations suggest retrieval uncertainty of around 30-45% depending on the certainty of aerosol optical properties and other parameters used in radiative transfer calculations. Retrieval uncertainty is less over dark regions and lower scattering angles. INSAT-3D at 0.55m is derived operationally for the first time over Asia and adjoining ocean at 30-min temporal resolution. The retrieval algorithm is validated against in situ Sun-sky radiometer measurements at 26 Aerosol Robotic Network sites and Sun-photometer measurements during Sagar-Sampada cruise in the northern Arabian Sea. The validation study encompassing 3,803 and 844 data points over land and ocean stations show correlations ranging from 0.70 to 0.91 and 0.79 to 0.91, respectively. The uncertainty of retrievals is within 45% over land and within 30% over ocean. The diurnal variability of INSAT-3D and Aerosol Robotic Network in India and southeast Asia is also presented. The comparison of INSAT-3D and MODIS-aqua monthly average shows correlation ranging from 0.74 to 0.89 and 0.65 to 0.97 over Indian landmass and adjoining ocean, respectively. The validation suggests that INSAT-3D can be used for aerosol monitoring and can be merged with MODIS-aqua/terra aerosol product to generate combined aerosol product at high temporal resolution.

TI  - The 20-22 February 2016 Mineral Dust Event in Tehran, Iran: Numerical Modeling, Remote Sensing, and In Situ Measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind erosion raises mineral dusts from dry and semidry lands and produces dust storms. Such dust masses have created numerous health and economic problems for the residents of southern, southwestern, and central parts of Iran. The main sources, movement, spread, and settlement of dust masses can be determined by solving the governing equations for aerosol transmission. Such information will be certainly useful in managerial decision-making. In this study, the dust event in Tehran on 20-22 February 2016 was studied using numerical model, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer satellite data, and data of ground-based stations. A comparison between the numerical results and in situ measurements as well as satellite data confirmed that present modeling can predict dust mass formation and its development toward Tehran. However, the values of dust concentration and aerosol optical depth were underpredicted with regard to in situ measurements and satellite data, respectively. The results indicated that a low-pressure system was formed in the central Iran on 19-20 February, which led to atmosphere instability, an increase in wind speed, and an increase in the planetary boundary layer height up to a height of 5km. On the other hand, this low-pressure system led to the transportation of dust mass created in the eastern Syria and central Iraq from the southwestern borders and cities like Ahwaz to the central parts of Iran such as Tehran. The study of the radiative forcing indicated that due to the absorption and scattering of radiation flux by aerosols, the atmosphere became stable and the height of the boundary layer decreased.

TI  - Global Character of Latent Heat Release in Oceanic Warm Rain Systems
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Warm rain plays an important role in Earth's water and energy cycles. Little is known, however, about the global character of latent heat release from warm rain regimes owing to a lack of satellite observations with sufficient sensitivity to this often light, sometimes isolated, precipitation. The Wisconsin Algorithm for Latent heating and Rainfall Using Satellites (WALSRUS) utilizes CloudSat's W-band Cloud Profiling Radar to estimate vertical profiles of latent heating, surface rainfall rate, and related processes across all oceanic warm rain regimes. This study examines a 4-year climatology of monthly mean WALRUS estimates to document the global character of latent heating in oceanic warm rain and quantify the sensitivity of underlying condensation and evaporation processes to bulk properties of the large-scale environment. Warm rain is found to make up 9.2% of oceanic global rainfall and 13.9% of oceanic tropical rainfall. Convective warm rain contributes 36% of rain accumulation and 50% of column latent heating even though its occurrence frequency is only 11%. Net pressure-weighted column-integrated latent heating from warm rain condensation averages 0.15Kday(-1) of atmospheric heating, with nearly equal contribution from convective and shallow warm rain. While warm rain is found throughout the globe, the Intertropical Convergence Zone is a notable warm rain hot spot peaking near 1Kday(-1). The mean height of the maximum condensation in warm rain is 1.50.6km and found to be generally invariant to atmospheric stability. On the other hand, the depth of the entrainment cooling layer decreases with increasing inversion strength.

TI  - Ash Metrics for European and Trans-Atlantic Air Routes During the Eyjafjallajokull Eruption 14 April to 23 May 2010
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Metrics for the risk associated with the threat that airborne volcanic ash particles pose to commercial jet aircraft are presented using simulations based on a Lagrangian particle transport and dispersion model driven by satellite measurements for the Eyjafjallajokull volcanic eruption, Iceland, for the period 14 April to 23 May 2010. The study utilizes a four-dimensional data set of simulated ash concentrations together with European and trans-Atlantic air routes to determine metrics corresponding to the total mass intercepted (defined as the dose), the mass interception rate (the dose rate), and the concentration (the exposure) over time (the dosage) that a jet aircraft encounters along the air route. The methodology can be used as a logistical and flight planning tool in a forecast mode and also in hindcast mode to assess the extent of airline fleet exposure to ash following an eruption, thereby providing operators with information useful for flight safety.Plain Language Summary Volcanic ash that is dispersing in the atmosphere is a hazard to jet aircraft. We suggest new metrics for quantifying volcanic ash as a hazard to aviation by using a three-dimensional model/satellite data set derived for the 14 April to 23 May 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajokull, Iceland. The metrics include dose rate, dose, dosage, and exposure. These are calculated for fictitious flight routes across Europe and for some trans-Atlantic routes. The methodology is globally applicable and may be of use to airlines, regulators, and other aviation stakeholders.

TI  - Synergistic Retrieval of Multitemporal Aerosol Optical Depth Over North China Plain Using Geostationary Satellite Data of Himawari-8
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - An N-Dimensional Cost Function (NDCF) method is introduced in this paper to simultaneously retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) at multiple time points by exploiting multitemporal data synergy from geostationary satellite. In the proposed method, the number of remote sensing observations used is flexible, the bidirectional reflectance effect is considered, and AOD variation in different observations is allowed. Sensitivity study shows that the relative error of the retrieved AOD decreases as the dimension of the cost function increases. The retrieval accuracy of NDCF method has been improved more than 3 times by changing the dimension of the cost function from 2 to 13. The relative error of the retrieved AOD is less than 20% if viewing zenith angle is less than 70 degrees for dark surface or 60 degrees for bright surface. The proposed method is applied to Advanced Himawari Imager data on board Himawari-8 over North China Plain. Case study shows that the retrieved AOD by NDCF method demonstrates the same time variation tendency with the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) AOD measurement as well as the similar spatial distribution characteristic with Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectrometer AOD product. The validation result shows that the NDCF method demonstrates the considerable AOD retrieval accuracy in all the three selected AERONET sites of Beijing-Chinese Academy of Meteorological Sciences (CAMS) (slope=0.826, R-2=0.832), XiangHe (slope=0.879, R-2=0.836), and XuZhou-China University of Mining and Technology (CUMT) (slope=0.889, R-2=0.730). The expected error of the NDCF method is estimated as =0.080.19. Compared to the official Himawari product, the NDCF method improves the AOD retrieval accuracy and retrieval applicability over North China Plain of Himawari-8/Advanced Himawari Imager data.

TI  - Sensitivity and Uncertainty of a Long-Term, High-Resolution, Global, Terrestrial Sensible Heat Flux Data Set
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sensible heat flux directly influences local and regional climate and can be estimated using remotely sensed satellite observations. Although significant efforts have been made to estimate sensitivity and uncertainty in energy flux estimates at the local and regional scales using both models and algorithms compatible with remotely sensed satellite data, few studies quantify the sensitivity or uncertainty at the global scale, enabling a global comparison among uncertainty drivers. This study uses the 10 percentile change from the mean value in the empirical cumulative distribution function for the distribution of each input data set to calculate the sensitivity of the unconstrained, terrestrial sensible heat flux to change in the input data sets and uses this sensitivity in a first-order analysis of the uncertainty in the sensible heat flux. The largest sensitivities to the Zilitinkevich empirical constant (C-zil) are in the Amazon, northern Australia, and the plains of North America, while the sensitivity of the sensible heat flux to the temperature gradient is largest in dry regions of shorter vegetation. The C-zil contributes most to the uncertainty of over 50-100W/m(2) in the Amazon and Indonesia, while the temperature gradient contributes most to the uncertainty elsewhere, producing an overall global average uncertainty of 24.8W/m(2). Future work should reduce the uncertainties in the temperature gradient and the C-zil to reduce the uncertainty in sensible heat flux estimates.

TI  - Evaluation of Agricultural Land Cover Representations on Regional Climate Model Simulations in the Brazilian Cerrado
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining interactions between large-scale land cover and land use change and regional climate in areas undergoing dynamic land transformations, like the Brazilian Cerrado, is crucial for understanding tradeoffs between human needs and ecosystem services. Yet regional climate models often do not include accurate land cover data of these complex landscapes. We use National Center for Atmospheric Research's Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to the Noah-Multiparameterization (Noah-MP) land surface model to run 10-year climate simulations across Brazil to assess (1) whether an accurate, regionally validated land cover data set with two, new agricultural land cover classifications improves model simulation results; (2) the ability of Noah-MP's dynamic vegetation option to model vegetation growth; and (3) the sensitivity of the model output to scale. The results of the simulations with the updated land surface perform better over intensive agricultural areas for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature, especially during the wet-to-dry season transition months. Evapotranspiration is overestimated during the start of the rainy season across all model simulations, which is likely due to the soil moisture model. We also find that using the Noah-MP dynamic vegetation significantly degrades agricultural leaf area index phenology simulations in Brazilian agricultural regions. Lastly, improving the model's resolution did not improve model output when compared to observational data. Incorporating more accurate representations of the landscape into regional climate models is essential for quantifying potential changes in climatological seasonality in dynamic, human-modified regions and making informed land use decisions.Plain Language Summary Humans are the largest drive of landscape change globally. One region that exemplifies this change is Brazil's Cerradoover half of it has been cleared for agriculture. Farmers in the region depend on a stable rainy season to cultivate crops like soy and corn, but, clearing Cerrado for agriculture may disturb regional climate and affect precipitation. The first step to assessing these impacts is determining whether a more accurate land surface improves simulation results and where the model still needs to be improved. We use the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to run 10-year-long climate simulations across Brazil with both the default U.S. Geological Survey land cover map and an updated land cover map with two new agricultural categories. Our results show that using an updated map improves model results over regions of intensive agriculture, especially in the dry-to-wet-season transition months. All simulation results show an overestimation in evapotranspiration rates and a cold bias during the rainy season. These biases seem to be the result of WRF's soil-moisture model. Understanding both these interactions and how we can use climate models to better study them is essential for making informed land use decisions.

TI  - Comparison of Cloudy-Sky Downward Longwave Radiation Algorithms Using Synthetic Data, Ground-Based Data, and Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud plays a crucial role in surface downward longwave radiation (DLR). To determine optimal algorithms for cloud-sky DLR calculation under various climates, three types of algorithms were assessed, (i) four empirical algorithms determining cloudy DLR by simple cloud correction using the cloud fraction, (ii) three parameterized algorithms determining the cloud contribution by cloud temperature, and (iii) a semiempirical algorithm, Zhou-Cess, parameterized by the cloud water path. A sensitivity study was conducted using a Moderate Resolution Transmittance (MODTRAN) code to first determine the sensitive cloud parameters of DLR. Then, these algorithms were validated using synthetic data simulated by MODTRAN, ground-observed data, and satellite-observed data. When all the input parameters were accurate, the cloud-correction algorithms showed poor performance. Cloud-temperature-based algorithms showed much better results but exhibited positive systematic biases. The Zhou-Cess algorithm performed best but could not precisely describe the effect caused by cloud variations. When these algorithms were applied to ground- and satellite-based data, the accuracies of DLR calculations were affected by the uncertainty in the atmospheric and cloud parameters. The simple empirical algorithms showed the poorest results. The cloud-temperature-based algorithms were greatly influenced by the uncertainty in cloud base temperature and cloud fraction and showed acceptable results when cloud fractions were accurate. The Zhou-Cess algorithm revealed the best results at most sites and was less impacted by cloud parameter uncertainties; therefore, this algorithm is suggested for cloudy-sky DLR calculation with poor-quality cloud parameters.

TI  - Improved discrimination of geological units via geomorphological classification of synthetic aperture radar images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geological mapping usually requires field visits, but the processing and interpretation of hyperspectral satellite images can also be very beneficial for this task. Microwave or radar remote sensing can obtain surface morphologies using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images and reduce the duration of field visits dramatically by discriminating geological units based on lithology and texture. This requires the surface roughness to be modeled against microwave signal backscattering. The integral equation model (IEM) is the most well-known rough scattering model, in which surface roughness is calculated using the roughness height statistical parameter (rms-height); however, this study uses an improved IEM based on power-law geometry. The roughness map of the Anaran anticline (located between Dehloran and Ilam in Iran) using TerraSAR images is computed and classified to generate a morphological map. Calculating the roughness map requires training the IEM model and the formation of the look-up-table for pure lithological sites. In situ microtopography measurement was performed on seven different sites containing the main lithologies in the study area, using total station surveying, to train the mathematical model and compare and evaluate the results. Comparing this roughness map with ground-truth data at test sites indicates that computations using the new IEM model results in a misclassification of <10% of the samples in the map. This error is acceptable, indicating that the new model could, in many cases, reduce the duration of field visits. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - A Query Workflow Design to Perform Automatable Distributed Regression Analysis in Large Distributed Data Networks.
T2  - EGEMS (Washington, DC)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patient privacy and data security concerns often limit the feasibility of pooling patient-level data from multiple sources for analysis. Distributed data networks (DDNs) that employ privacy-protecting analytical methods, such as distributed regression analysis (DRA), can mitigate these concerns. However, DRA is not routinely implemented in large DDNs.OBJECTIVE: We describe the design and implementation of a process framework and query workflow that allow automatable DRA in real-world DDNs that use PopMedNet, an open-source distributed networking software platform.METHODS: We surveyed and catalogued existing hardware and software configurations at all data partners in the Sentinel System, a PopMedNet-driven DDN. Key guiding principles for the design included minimal disruptions to the current PopMedNet query workflow and minimal modifications to data partners' hardware configurations and software requirements.RESULTS: We developed and implemented a three-step process framework and PopMedNet query workflow that enables automatable DRA: 1) assembling a de-identified patient-level dataset at each data partner, 2) distributing a DRA package to data partners for local iterative analysis, and 3) iteratively transferring intermediate files between data partners and analysis center. The DRA query workflow is agnostic to statistical software, accommodates different regression models, and allows different levels of user-specified automation.DISCUSSION: The process framework can be generalized to and the query workflow can be adopted by other PopMedNet-based DDNs.CONCLUSION: DRA has great potential to change the paradigm of data analysis in DDNs. Successful implementation of DRA in Sentinel will facilitate adoption of the analytic approach in other DDNs.

TI  - Himawari-8 infrared observations of the June-August 2015 Mt Raung eruption, Indonesia
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic activity involves processes that can change over short periods of time, which are sometimes closely related to the eruptive mode or the timing of its transitions. Eruptions bring high-temperature magma or gas to the surface; thermal observations of these eruptions can be used to determine the timeline of eruptive sequences or eruptive processes. In 2014, a new-generation meteorological satellite, Himawari-8, which carried a new sensor, the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), was launched. The AHI makes high-frequency infrared observations at a spatial resolution of 2 km during 10-min observation cycles. We analyzed an effusive eruption that occurred in 2015 at Mt Raung in Indonesia using these AHI images, which was the first attempt applying them to volcanological study. Based on the detailed analysis of the time-series variations in its thermal anomalies, this eruptive sequence was segmented into a Precursory Stage, Pulse 1, Pulse 2 and a Terminal Stage. Pulses 1 and 2 are effusive stages that exhibited a consecutive two-pulse pattern in their variations, reflecting changes in the lava effusion rate; the other stages are non-effusive. We were also able to determine the exact times of the onset and reactivation of lava flow effusion, as well as the precursory signals that preceded these events.

TI  - Urban growth dynamics and modelling using remote sensing data and multivariate statistical techniques
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, sprawl area of impervious surfaces and their spatial and temporal variability have been studied for Pune city over a period of 19 years, i. e. 1992-2011. Statistical techniques and image classification approach have been adopted to quantify the urban sprawl and its spatial and temporal characteristics. For this purpose, satellite images were obtained from various sensors, viz. Landsat Thematic Mapper and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus. To establish the relationship between urban sprawl and its causative factors, multivariate statistical technique has been used. The determinants of causal factors of urban sprawl such as population, alpha-population density, beta-population density, workforce engaged in secondary and tertiary sectors, road density, and gender gap in literacy collectively explain the 93.09% variation in urban growth. The result also depicts that incessant growth in the built-up area in Pune city has surpassed the rate of population growth. From 1992 to 2011, population in the region grew by 75.40% while the amount of built-up land grew by 227.3%, i. e. more than three times the rate of population growth. To understand the future urban growth of Pune city, a foresight approach is being developed that allows long-term projections. This depicts that by the year 2051, the built-up area in the municipal limits would rise to 212.27 sq. km, which may be nearly 50.0% more than that in 2011 (141.50 sq. km). The vegetative areas, open spaces and areas around the highways are expected to become major targets for urban sprawl due to further increase in the pressure on land.

TI  - What does the fox say? Monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment using wild red foxes as an indicator
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this study was to estimate and compare the occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in relation to human population densities. Samples from wild red foxes (n = 528) included in the Norwegian monitoring programme on antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from food, feed and animals were included. All samples were divided into three different groups based on population density in the municipality where the foxes were hunted. Of the 528 samples included, 108 (20.5%), 328 (62.1%) and 92 (17.4%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. A single faecal swab was collected from each fox. All samples were plated out on a selective medium for Enterobacteriaceae for culturing followed by inclusion and susceptibility testing of one randomly selected Escherichia colt to assess the overall occurrence of AMR in the Gram-negative bacterial population. Furthermore, the samples were subjected to selective screening for detection of E. colt displaying resistance towards extended-spectrum cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. In addition, a subset of samples (n = 387) were subjected to selective culturing to detect E. colt resistant to carbapenems and colistin, and enterococci resistant to vancomycin. Of these, 98 (25.3%), 200 (51.7%) and 89 (23.0%) originated from areas with low, medium and high population density, respectively. Overall, the occurrence of AMR in indicator E. colt from wild red foxes originating from areas with different human population densities in Norway was low to moderate (8.8%). The total occurrence of AMR was significantly higher; chi(2) (1,N = 336) = 6.53,p = 0.01 in areas with high population density compared to areas with medium population density. Similarly, the occurrence of fluoroquinolone resistant E. colt isolated using selective detection methods was low in areas with low population density and more common in areas with medium or high population density. In conclusion, we found indications that occurrence of AMR in wild red foxes in Norway is associated with human population density. Foxes living in urban areas are more likely to be exposed to AMR bacteria and resistance drivers from food waste, garbage, sewage, waste water and consumption of contaminated prey compared to foxes living in remote areas. The homerange of red fox has been shown to be limited thereby the red fox constitutes a good sentinel for monitoring antimicrobial resistance in the environment. Continuous monitoring on the occurrence of AMR in different wild species, ecological niches and geographical areas can facilitate an increased understanding of the environmental burden of AMR in the environment. Such information is needed to further assess the impact for humans, and enables implementation of possible control measures for AMR in humans, animals and the environment in a true "One Health" approach.

TI  - A time series of urban extent in China using DSMP/OLS nighttime light data
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban extent data play an important role in urban management and urban studies, such as monitoring the process of urbanization and changes in the spatial configuration of urban areas. Traditional methods of extracting urban-extent information are primarily based on manual investigations and classifications using remote sensing images, and these methods have such problems as large costs in labor and time and low precision. This study proposes an improved, simplified and flexible method for extracting urban extents over multiple scales and the construction of spatiotemporal models using DMSP/OLS nighttime light (NTL) for practical situations. This method eliminates the regional temporal and spatial inconsistency of thresholding NTL in large-scale and multi-temporal scenes. Using this method, we have extracted the urban extents and calculated the corresponding areas on the county, municipal and provincial scales in China from 2000 to 2012. In addition, validation with the data of reference data shows that the overall accuracy (OA), Kappa and F1 Scores were 0.996, 0.793, and 0.782, respectively. We increased the spatial resolution of the urban extent to 500 m (approximately four times finer than the results of previous studies). Based on the urban extent dataset proposed above, we analyzed changes in urban extents over time and observed that urban sprawl has grown in all of the counties of China. We also identified three patterns of urban sprawl: Early Urban Growth, Constant Urban Growth and Recent Urban Growth. In addition, these trends of urban sprawl are consistent with the western, eastern and central cities of China, respectively, in terms of their spatial distribution, socioeconomic characteristics and historical background. Additionally, the urban extents display the spatial configurations of urban areas intuitively. The proposed urban extent dataset is available for download and can provide reference data and support for future studies of urbanization and urban planning.

TI  - Vertical distribution of aerosols over the Maritime Continent during El Nino
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The vertical distribution of aerosols over Southeast Asia, a critical factor impacting aerosol lifetime, radiative forcing, and precipitation, is examined for the 2006 post El Nino fire burning season. Combining these measurements with remotely sensed land, fire, and meteorological measurements, and fire plume modeling, we have reconfirmed that fire radiative power (FRP) is underestimated over Southeast Asia by MODIS measurements. These results are derived using a significantly different approach from other previously attempted approaches found in the literature. The horizontally constrained Maritime Continent's fire plume median height, using the maximum variance of satellite observed aerosol optical depth as the spatial and temporal constraint, is found to be 2.04 +/- 1.52 km during the entirety of the 2006 El Nino fire season, and 2.19 +/- 1.50 km for October 2006. This is 0.83 km (0.98 km) higher than random sampling and all other past studies. Additionally, it is determined that 61 (C 6-10)% of the bottom of the smoke plume and 83 (C 8-11)% of the median of the smoke plume is in the free troposphere during the October maximum; while 49 (C 79)% and 75 (C 12-12)% of the total aerosol plume and the median of the aerosol plume, are correspondingly found in the free troposphere during the entire fire season. This vastly different vertical distribution will have impacts on aerosol lifetime and dispersal. Application of a simple plume rise model using measurements of fire properties underestimates the median plume height by 0.26 km over the entire fire season and 0.34 km over the maximum fire period. It is noted that the model underestimation over the bottom portions of the plume are much larger. The center of the plume can be reproduced when fire radiative power is increased by 20% (with other parts of the plume ranging from an increase of 0 to 60% depending on the portion of the plume and the length of the fire season considered). However, to reduce the biases found, improvements including fire properties under cloudy conditions, representation of small-scale convection, and inclusion of aerosol direct and semi-direct effects are required.

T2  - American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book. American Society of Clinical Oncology. Annual Meeting
M3  - Journal Article
M3  - Review
AB  - In this article, we will focus on the practice-changing developments for stage III melanoma, from the use of the sentinel node (SN) biopsy to complete lymph node dissection (CLND) and upcoming adjuvant therapies. MSLT-1 (Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy Trial-1) was the first and only prospective randomized controlled trial to examine whether the SN biopsy has any notable melanoma-specific survival benefit (primary endpoint). MSLT-1 randomly assigned 2,001 patients to undergo either wide local excision (WLE) and an SN biopsy or WLE and nodal observation. Two prospective randomized controlled trials have examined the potential benefit for immediate CLND versus delayed CLND after sequential observation. Both the DECOG-SLT and MSLT-2 trials failed to demonstrate a notable benefit for immediate CLND; therefore, sequential follow-up with ultrasonography and a delayed CLND in the case of relapse should be considered the new standard of care. The CheckMate 238 study demonstrated a notable benefit for adjuvant nivolumab in terms of 18-month relapse-free survival (RFS) rates compared with high-dose adjuvant ipilimumab. Single-agent adjuvant BRAF inhibition has been examined and failed to improve RFS. However, the COMBI-AD study did demonstrate a substantial benefit for combination BRAF and MEK inhibition for patients with BRAF-mutated resected stage IIIA to IIIC melanoma.

TI  - Seasonal and Regional Characteristics of Aerosol Pollution in East and Southeast Asia
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The atmospheric aerosol distribution in Asia is complex because it is influenced by both natural phenomena and human activities. In this article, multifaceted approach using satellite observations and numerical model simulation shows seasonal and regional variations of the aerosol distribution over Asia. Asia covers a large area; however, this article is limited to East and Southeast Asia. The aerosol optical thickness (AOT) in the inland desert area is normally high in spring and dusty aerosols are widely spread with the wind. The AOT values are high in summer over East Asia. A high AOT caused by biomass burning plumes is observed in autumn over Southeast Asia and in spring over Siberia and heavy air pollution occurs in Beijing in winter, a very well-known phenomenon. These phenomena caused by heavy aerosol concentration were determined based on Aqua/MODIS data and aerosol characteristics retrievals and estimated the aerosol characteristics. Furthermore, the impact of aerosols on the climate assessed by numerical model simulations suggest that aerosols reduce solar radiation and therefore the Earth's surface temperature. In addition to these influences on the radiation budget, aerosols have a significant potential to change the circulation fields.

TI  - [Clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence after breast conservation therapy].
T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the clinical features and prognosis of the ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) after breast conserving surgery. Methods: From 1999 to 2013, 63 women with IBTR after breast conserving surgery were retrospectively reviewed. All patients had adequate information on tumor location both at first presentation and at recurrence, with or without regional recurrence or distant metastasis. The histologic changes between true local recurrence and elsewhere recurrence groups were compared. The local recurrence, the overall survival after IBTR (IBTR-OS), the disease-free survival after IBTR (IBTR-DFS) were also compared. Results: All patients had undergone lumpectomy, including 38 cases with additional axillary lymph node dissection and 13 cases with sentinel lymph node biopsy. There were 11.3% (7/63) cases received neoadjuvant systemic therapy, 68.3% (43/63) had adjuvant radiotherapy, 60.3% (38/63) underwent adjuvant chemotherapy and 47.6% (30/63) received hormonal therapy. Forty-five cases (71.4%) had recurrence in the same quadrant, and 18 cases (28.6%) had elsewhere recurrence. Compared with histology at presentation, 10.3% of the patients (6/58) had different ones at recurrence and 28.9% of patients (13/45) had different molecular subtypes. The conversion rate of estrogen receptor status (33.3% vs 9.5%, P=0.012) and progesterone receptor status (56.3% vs 19.0%, P=0.005) in patients with elsewhere recurrence was significantly higher than that in patients with same quadrant recurrence. Fifty-nine cases had undergone surgery after IBTR, with 48 cases of secondary breast-conserving surgery and 11 cases of salvage mastectomy. The median time to IBTR of same quadrant recurrence and elsewhere recurrence groups were 26 months and 62 months (P=0.012), respectively. There were 84.4% and 44.4% cases who had local recurrence within 5 years after breast conserving surgery, respectively. Of all cases, the overall 5-year IBTR-OS and 5-year IBTR-DFS rates were 79.4% and 60.4%, respectively. There were no significant differences in 5-year IBTR-OS (77.4% vs. 83.6%, P=0.303) or 5-year IBTR-DFS (60.0% vs. 62.8%, P=0.780) between same quadrant recurrence and elsewhere recurrence groups. Univariate analysis showed that pN0-1 (P<0.001), luminal subtype (P=0.026), adjuvant endocrine therapy (P=0.007) at first presentation, recurrent tumor < 3 cm (P=0.036) and having surgery after IBTR(P=0.002) were favorable factors of IBTR-OS. pN0-1 (P<0.001) at first presentation, recurrent tumor stage Ⅰ-Ⅱ (P<0.001) and having surgery after IBTR(P=0.001) were favorable factors of IBTR-DFS. There was no significant difference between second breast-conserving surgery and salvage mastectomy in IBTR-OS and IBTR-DFS (P>0.05). Conclusions: The IBTR after breast conserving surgery mainly occurred at the original quadrant. Second breast-conserving surgery did not affect patient's prognosis. There were significant differences in biological features between the same quadrant recurrence and elsewhere recurrence, requiring different therapeutic strategies in the future.

TI  - Assessing snow extent data sets over North America to inform and improve trace gas retrievals from solar backscatter
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate representation of surface reflectivity is essential to tropospheric trace gas retrievals from solar backscatter observations. Surface snow cover presents a significant challenge due to its variability and thus snowcovered scenes are often omitted from retrieval data sets; however, the high reflectance of snow is potentially advantageous for trace gas retrievals. We first examine the implications of surface snow on retrievals from the upcoming TEMPO geostationary instrument for North America. We use a radiative transfer model to examine how an increase in surface reflectivity due to snow cover changes the sensitivity of satellite retrievals to NO2 in the lower troposphere. We find that a substantial fraction (> 50 %) of the TEMPO field of regard can be snow covered in January and that the average sensitivity to the tropospheric NO2 column substantially increases (doubles) when the surface is snow covered.We then evaluate seven existing satellite-derived or reanalysis snow extent products against ground station observations over North America to assess their capability of informing surface conditions for TEMPO retrievals. The Interactive Multisensor Snow and Ice Mapping System (IMS) had the best agreement with ground observations (accuracy of 93 %, precision of 87 %, recall of 83 %). Multiangle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) retrievals of MODIS-observed radiances had high precision (90% for Aqua and Terra), but underestimated the presence of snow (recall of 74% for Aqua, 75% for Terra). MAIAC generally outperforms the standard MODIS products (precision of 51 %, recall of 43% for Aqua; precision of 69 %, recall of 45% for Terra). The Near-real-time Ice and Snow Extent (NISE) product had good precision (83%) but missed a significant number of snow-covered pixels (recall of 45%). The Canadian Meteorological Centre (CMC) Daily Snow Depth Analysis Data set had strong performance metrics (accuracy of 91 %, precision of 79 %, recall of 82 %). We use the F score, which balances precision and recall, to determine overall product performance (F = 85 %, 82 (82) %, 81 %, 58 %, 46 (54)% for IMS, MAIAC Aqua (Terra), CMC, NISE, MODIS Aqua (Terra), respectively) for providing snow cover information for TEMPO retrievals from solar backscatter observations. We find that using IMS to identify snow cover and enable inclusion of snow-covered scenes in clear-sky conditions across North America in January can increase both the number of observations by a factor of 2.1 and the average sensitivity to the tropospheric NO2 column by a factor of 2.7.

TI  - A thirty year, fine-scale, characterization of area burned in Canadian forests shows evidence of regionally increasing trends in the last decade
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire as a dominant disturbance has profound implications on the terrestrial carbon cycle. We present the first ever multi-decadal, spatially-explicit, 30 meter assessment of fire regimes across the forested ecoregions of Canada at an annual time-step. From 1985 to 2015, 51 Mha burned, impacting over 6.5% of forested ecosystems. Mean annual area burned was 1,651,818 ha and varied markedly (sigma = 1,116,119), with 25% of the total area burned occurring in three years: 1989, 1995, and 2015. Boreal forest types contained 98% of the total area burned, with the conifer-dominated Boreal Shield containing one-third of all burned area. While results confirm no significant national trend in burned area for the period of 1985 to 2015, a significant national increasing trend (alpha = 0.05) of 11% per year was evident for the past decade (2006 to 2015). Regionally, a significant increasing trend in total burned area from 1985 to 2015 was observed in the Montane Cordillera (2.4% increase per year), while the Taiga Plains and Taiga Shield West displayed significant increasing trends from 2006 to 2015 (26.1% and 12.7% increases per year, respectively). The Atlantic Maritime, which had the lowest burned area of all ecozones (0.01% burned per year), was the only ecozone to display a significant negative trend (2.4% decrease per year) from 1985 to 2015. Given the century-long fire return intervals in many of these ecozones, and large annual variability in burned area, short-term trends need to be interpreted with caution. Additional interpretive cautions are related to year used for trend initiation and the nature and extents of spatial regionalizations used for summarizing findings. The results of our analysis provide a baseline for monitoring future national and regional trends in burned area and offer spatially and temporally detailed insights to inform science, policy, and management.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of particulate organic carbon in the Yellow-Bohai Sea over 2002-2016
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yellow-Bohai Sea (YBS) is a typical marginal sea in the Northwest Pacific Ocean; however, little is known about the dynamics of particulate organic carbon (POC) and underlying mechanisms. Here, we analyze the spatial and temporal variations of surface POC derived from MODIS-Aqua during 2002-2016. Overall, POC is higher in the Bohai Sea (315-588 mg m(-3)) than in the Yellow Sea (181-492 mg m(-3)), and higher in the nearshore than in the offshore. Surface POC is highest in spring in the YBS, and lowest in winter (summer) in the Bohai Sea (the Yellow Sea). The spatial and seasonal patterns of POC are due to combined influences of primary productivity, water exchange, sediment resuspension and terrestrial inputs. Surface POC shows an overall decreasing trend prior to 2012 followed by an upward trend until 2015 in the YBS, which is almost opposite to chlorophyll; the decrease (increase) may result from strengthened (weakened) water exchange with the East China Sea through the Yellow Sea Warm Current. Declined terrestrial runoff is also partly responsible for the decrease prior to 2012. Our study suggests that water exchange and sediment resuspension are dominant factors regulating the spatial and temporal variability of POC in the YBS.

TI  - Identifying ginkgo trees using spectrum and texture time series from very high resolution satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification of ginkgo is of great importance for the intelligent use and management of ginkgo resources. A texture and spectrum time series analysis (TeSTA) model was used to identify and map ginkgo trees as the vegetation spectral and textural properties change regularly during the growing period. The texture and spectrum time series were constructed from temporal remotely sensed images and then projected into a multidimensional measurement space in which the vector difference was used to determine the threshold to identify ginkgo trees. Using this approach, ginkgo trees in Beijing's Olympic Forest Park were extracted using six Gaofen-2 satellite images. In order to assess the accuracy of this method, two other classification methods were used for ginkgo identification. One method uses only the spectrum time series and the other method uses the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The results showed that the TeSTA model performed better than the SVM and spectrum time series model with lower commission errors and higher user's accuracy. Thus, the TeSTA model can be used for identifying ginkgo trees and providing an important tool for forestry management. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Nevus Blue as a Sporadic Finding in a Patient with a Blue Toe?
T2  - Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blue nevus is an interesting finding, which aetiology and risk of locoregional and distant metastasis have not yet been fully clarified. It may be inherited or acquired, with sporadic cases usually presented as solitary lesions. It is often localised in the area of the head and less often on the arms, legs or trunk. Blue nevi are formations with relatively low but still possible potential for switching to melanoma.CASE REPORT: The patient we described was hospitalised for pronounced cyanosis of the small toe of the right foot, accompanied by painful symptoms at rest and pain symptoms for a few weeks. Using inpatient paraclinical and instrumental tests, the patient was diagnosed with cholesterol microembolism. During the dermatological examination, blue nevus on the contralaterally localised limb was also diagnosed as a sporadic finding. According to the patient's medical history, the finding had existed for many years, but in the last few months, the patient has observed growth and progression in the peripheral zone of the nevus without any additional clinical symptoms.CONCLUSION: Due to the risk of progression to melanoma, the lesion was removed by radical excision, and the defect was closed by tissue advancement flap.

TI  - Comparison of total water vapour content in the Arctic derived from GNSS, AIRS, MODIS and SCIAMACHY
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric water vapour plays a key role in the Arctic radiation budget, hydrological cycle and hence climate, but its measurement with high accuracy remains an important challenge. Total column water vapour (TCWV) datasets derived from ground-based GNSS measurements are used to assess the quality of different existing satellite TCWV datasets, namely from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) and the SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY). The comparisons between GNSS and satellite data are carried out for three reference Arctic observation sites (Sodankyla, Ny-Alesund and Thule) where long homogeneous GNSS time series of more than a decade (2001-2014) are available. We select hourly GNSS data that are coincident with overpasses of the different satellites over the three sites and then average them into monthly means that are compared with monthly mean satellite products for different seasons. The agreement between GNSS and satellite time series is generally within 5 % at all sites for most conditions. The weakest correlations are found during summer. Among all the satellite data, AIRS shows the best agreement with GNSS time series, though AIRS TCWV is often slightly too high in drier atmospheres (i.e. high-latitude stations during autumn and winter). SCIAMACHY TCWV data are generally drier than GNSS measurements at all the stations during the summer. This study suggests that these biases are associated with cloud cover, especially at Ny-Alesund and Thule. The dry biases of MODIS and SCIAMACHY observations are most pronounced at Sodankyla during the snow season (from October to March). Regarding SCIAMACHY, this bias is possibly linked to the fact that the SCIAMACHY TCWV retrieval does not take accurately into account the variations in surface albedo, notably in the presence of snow with a nearby canopy as in Sodankyla. The MODIS bias at Sodankyla is found to be correlated with cloud cover fraction and is also expected to be affected by other atmospheric or surface albedo changes linked for instance to the presence of forests or anthropogenic emissions. Overall, the results point out that a better estimation of seasonally dependent surface albedo and a better consideration of vertically resolved cloud cover are recommended if biases in satellite measurements are to be reduced in the polar regions.

TI  - Study of interference localization using single satellite based on signal strength distribution in multi-beam antenna for satellite communications system
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS
M3  - Article
AB  - Large onboard antennas with multi-beams are used almost in all the Geostationary Earth Orbit satellite communications systems, which are always disturbed by jams and inferences. However, there are lots of factors restricting interference localization in satellite communications system because the system is not designed for location-oriented. This article makes use of the characteristic that each spot beam of multi-beams antenna has different gain at the position of interference, establishes the localization equations set by using the ground projection model of multi-beams antenna pattern, and gives two methods of solving equations. Thus, it proposes interference localization algorithm using single satellite, based on antenna gain and the distribution of signal strength in multi-beam space. Because of not depending on extra onboard equipments and other facilities, it has no effect on the construction and operation of satellite communications system. From the results of analyses and simulations, the localization precision can satisfy the general practical requirement. The algorithm could be used in checking the interference of the system, decision supporting of anti-jamming, and improving operation and management of the system.

TI  - Comparison of dust-layer heights from active and passive satellite sensors
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-layer height is essential for understanding the impact of aerosols on the climate system. As part of the European Space Agency Aerosol_cci project, aerosollayer height as derived from passive thermal and solar satellite sensors measurements have been compared with aerosollayer heights estimated from CALIOP measurements. The Aerosol_cci project targeted dust-type aerosol for this study. This ensures relatively unambiguous aerosol identification by the CALIOP processing chain. Dust-layer height was estimated from thermal IASI measurements using four different algorithms (from BIRA-IASB, DLR, LMD, LISA) and from solar GOME-2 (KNMI) and SCIAMACHY (IUP) measurements. Due to differences in overpass time of the various satellites, a trajectory model was used to move the CALIOP-derived dust heights in space and time to the IASI, GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY dust height pixels. It is not possible to construct a unique dust-layer height from the CALIOP data. Thus two CALIOP-derived layer heights were used: the cumulative extinction height defined as the height where the CALIOP extinction column is half of the total extinction column, and the geometric mean height, which is defined as the geometrical mean of the top and bottom heights of the dust layer. In statistical average over all IASI data there is a general tendency to a positive bias of 0.5-0.8 km against CALIOP extinction-weighted height for three of the four algorithms assessed, while the fourth algorithm has almost no bias. When comparing geometric mean height there is a shift of -0.5 km for all algorithms (getting close to zero for the three algorithms and turning negative for the fourth). The standard deviation of all algorithms is quite similar and ranges between 1.0 and 1.3 km. When looking at different conditions (day, night, land, ocean), there is more detail in variabilities (e.g. all algorithms overestimate more at night than during the day). For the solar sensors it is found that on average SCIAMACHY data are lower by -1.097 km (-0.961 km) compared to the CALIOP geometric mean (cumulative extinction) height, and GOME-2 data are lower by -1.393 km (-0.818 km).

TI  - Arctic lead detection using a waveform mixture algorithm from CryoSat-2 data
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a waveform mixture algorithm to detect leads from CryoSat-2 data, which is novel and different from the existing threshold-based lead detection methods. The waveform mixture algorithm adopts the concept of spectral mixture analysis, which is widely used in the field of hyperspectral image analysis. This lead detection method was evaluated with high-resolution (250 m) MODIS images and showed comparable and promising performance in detecting leads when compared to the previous methods. The robustness of the proposed approach also lies in the fact that it does not require the rescaling of parameters (i.e., stack standard deviation, stack skewness, stack kurtosis, pulse peakiness, and backscatter sigma(0)), as it directly uses L1B waveform data, unlike the existing threshold-based methods. Monthly lead fraction maps were produced by the waveform mixture algorithm, which shows interannual variability of recent sea ice cover during 2011-2016, excluding the summer season (i.e., June to September). We also compared the lead fraction maps to other lead fraction maps generated from previously published data sets, resulting in similar spatiotemporal patterns.

TI  - Crop classification from Sentinel-2-derived vegetation indices using ensemble learning
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The identification and mapping of crops are important for estimating potential harvest as well as for agricultural field management. Optical remote sensing is one of the most attractive options because it offers vegetation indices and some data have been distributed free of charge. Especially, Sentinel-2A, which is equipped with a multispectral sensor (MSI) with blue, green, red, and near-infrared-1 bands at 10 m; red edge 1 to 3, near-infrared-2, and shortwave infrared 1 and 2 at 20 m; and 3 atmospheric bands (band 1, band 9, and band 10) at 60 m, offer some vegetation indices calculated to assess vegetation status. However, sufficient consideration has not been given to the potential of vegetation indices calculated from MSI data. Thus, 82 published indices were calculated and their importance were evaluated for classifying crop types. The two most common classification algorithms, random forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM), were applied to conduct cropland classification from MSI data. Additionally, super learning was applied for more improvement, achieving overall accuracies of 90.2% to 92.2%. Of the two algorithms applied (RF and SVM), the accuracy of SVM was superior and 89.3% to 92.0% of overall accuracies were confirmed. Furthermore, stacking contributed to higher overall accuracies (90.2% to 92.2%), and significant differences were confirmed with the results of SVM and RF. Our results showed that vegetation indices had the greatest contributions in identifying specific crop types. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Endometrial cancer-how many patients could benefit from sentinel lymph node dissection?
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) may reduce morbidity in patients with endometrial cancer. The objective of this study is to estimate how many systematic lymph node dissections (LND) can be spared with an implementation of a SLN-procedure.Methods: Retrospective, single-center study, SLND according to NCCN-Guidelines.Results: In 109 patients of 154 consecutive patients, SLND was performed. The detection rate was 61% on both sides and 86% on at least one side. Classification of uterine risk factors is as follows: low risk 53, intermediate risk 25, high-intermediate risk 13, and high-risk 18. Stage IIIC: 0, 3, 7, 11, respectively. Under the assumption that 56 patients with "higher than low risk" factors would be treated by systematic LND, we spared 26 pelvic and paraaortic LND. After failures of SLN detection, unilateral pelvic LND was performed in 15 patients. Patients with "higher than low risk" factors and node-negative SLN are candidates for a randomized study to prove safety and efficacy. Only every third patient in our study met these criteria.Conclusions: In a cohort of patients with "higher than low risk" endometrial cancer, the implementation of SLND nearly divided the number of radical lymph node dissections in half. Further studies are required to define the best modalities for SLND.

TI  - Preliminary verification for application of a support vector machine-based cloud detection method to GOSAT-2 CAI-2
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) was launched in 2009 to measure global atmospheric CO2 and CH4 concentrations. GOSAT is equipped with two sensors: the Thermal And Near infrared Sensor for carbon Observations (TANSO)-Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and TANSO-Cloud and Aerosol Imager (CAI). The presence of clouds in the instantaneous field of view of the FTS leads to incorrect estimates of the concentrations. Thus, the FTS data suspected to have cloud contamination must be identified by a CAI cloud discrimination algorithm and rejected. Conversely, overestimating clouds reduces the amount of FTS data that can be used to estimate greenhouse gas concentrations. This is a serious problem in tropical rainforest regions, such as the Amazon, where the amount of useable FTS data is small because of cloud cover. Preparations are continuing for the launch of the GOSAT-2 in fiscal year 2018. To improve the accuracy of the estimates of greenhouse gases concentrations, we need to refine the existing CAI cloud discrimination algorithm: Cloud and Aerosol Unbiased Decision Intellectual Algorithm (CLAUDIA1). A new cloud discrimination algorithm using a support vector machine (CLAUDIA3) was developed and presented in another paper. Although the use of visual inspection of clouds as a standard for judging is not practical for screening a full satellite data set, it has the advantage of allowing for locally optimized thresholds, while CLAUDIA1 and -3 use common global thresholds. Thus, the accuracy of visual inspection is better than that of these algorithms in most regions, with the exception of snow-and ice-covered surfaces, where there is not enough spectral contrast to identify cloud. In other words, visual inspection results can be used as truth data for accuracy evaluation of CLAUDIA1 and -3. For this reason visual inspection can be used for the truth metric for the cloud discrimination verification exercise. In this study, we compared CLAUDIA1-CAI and CLAUDIA3-CAI for various land cover types, and evaluated the accuracy of CLAUDIA3-CAI by comparing both CLAUDIA1-CAI and CLAUDIA3-CAI with visual inspection (400 x 400 pixels) of the same CAI images in tropical rainforests. Comparative results between CLAUDIA1-CAI and CLAUDIA3-CAI for various land cover types indicated that CLAUDIA3-CAI had a tendency to identify bright surface and optically thin clouds. However, CLAUDIA3-CAI had a tendency to misjudge the edges of clouds compared with CLAUDIA1-CAI. The accuracy of CLAUDIA3-CAI was approximately 89.5 % in tropical rainforests, which is greater than that of CLAUDIA1-CAI (85.9 %) for the test cases presented here.

TI  - Soil Moisture Sensing Using Spaceborne GNSS Reflections: Comparison of CYGNSS Reflectivity to SMAP Soil Moisture
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper quantifies the relationship between forward scattered L-band Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, recorded by the Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture (SM). Although designed for tropical ocean surface wind sensing, the CYGNSS receivers also record GNSS reflections over land. The CYGNSS observations of reflection power are compared to SMAP SM between March 2017 and February 2018. A strong, positive linear relationship exists between changes in CYGNSS reflectivity and changes in SMAP SM, but not between the absolute magnitudes of the two observations. The sensitivity of CYGNSS reflectivity to SM varies spatially and can be used to convert reflectivity to estimates of SM. The unbiased root-mean-square difference between daily averaged CYGNSS-derived SM and SMAP SM is 0.045cm(3)/cm(3) and is similarly low between CYGNSS and in situ SM. These results show that CYGNSS, and future GNSS reflection missions, could provide global SM observations.

TI  - Summer Drivers of Atmospheric Variability Affecting Ice Shelf Thinning in the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data and a 35-year hindcast of the Amundsen Sea Embayment summer climate using the Weather Research and Forecasting model are used to understand how regional and large-scale atmospheric variability affects thinning of ice shelves in this sector of West Antarctica by melting from above and below (linked to intrusions of warm water caused by anomalous westerlies over the continental shelf edge). El Nino episodes are associated with an increase in surface melt but do not have a statistically significant impact on westerly winds over the continental shelf edge. The location of the Amundsen Sea Low and the polarity of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) have negligible impact on surface melting, although a positive SAM and eastward shift of the Amundsen Sea Low cause anomalous westerlies over the continental shelf edge. The projected future increase in El Nino episodes and positive SAM could therefore increase the risk of disintegration of West Antarctic ice shelves.

TI  - Footprint-weighted tile approach for a spruce forest and a nearby patchy clearing using the ACASA model
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ACASA (Advanced Canopy-AtmosphereSoil Algorithm) model, with a higher-order closure for tall vegetation, has already been successfully tested and validated for homogeneous spruce forests. The aim of this paper is to test the model using a footprint-weighted tile approach for a clearing with a heterogeneous structure of the underlying surface. The comparison with flux data shows a good agreement with a footprint-aggregated tile approach of the model. However, the results of a comparison with a tile approach on the basis of the mean land use classification of the clearing is not significantly different. It is assumed that the footprint model is not accurate enough to separate small-scale heterogeneities. All measured fluxes are corrected by forcing the energy balance closure of the test data either by maintaining the measured Bowen ratio or by the attribution of the residual depending on the fractions of sensible and latent heat flux to the buoyancy flux. The comparison with the model, in which the energy balance is closed, shows that the buoyancy correction for Bowen ratios > 1.5 better fits the measured data. For lower Bowen ratios, the correction probably lies between the two methods, but the amount of available data was too small to make a conclusion. With an assumption of similarity between water and carbon dioxide fluxes, no correction of the net ecosystem exchange is necessary for Bowen ratios > 1.5.

TI  - Burned Area Comparisons Between Prescribed Burning Permits in Southeastern United States and Two Satellite-Derived Products
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Prescribed burning (PB) is one of the most prominent sources of PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5m) in the southeastern United States. The PB emissions estimates may have significant uncertainty because they are based on the burned areas reported to the state agencies when burners apply for burn permits. When no permit records are available, satellite-derived products could be used as a substitute tool to provide burned area data. In order to evaluate burned areas from satellite-derived products, we conducted a comparison between PB permit records and two satellite-derived products, Blended Polar Geo Biomass Burning Emissions Product and Global Fire Emissions Database, in Georgia and Florida. The comparison results indicate that both satellite-derived products underestimate seriously the burned areas compared to permit record data. They can capture a cluster of fires better than isolated fires but may misinterpret those small fires together as one big fire. Overall, current satellite-derived products have limitations in estimating the burned areas of small fires and still need improvements.Plain Language Summary Prescribed burning is a preferred land management tool but also a prominent source of air pollution in the United States, and exposure to fire smoke is a growing health concern. Burned area is a direct input to the estimation of smoke emissions; therefore, it is critical to have accurate burned area data to be able to conduct reliable assessments of exposure to smoke. While some states like Florida and Georgia keep extensive prescribed burn records through permitting programs, other states may not even have a permitting system in place. In the absence of permit data, satellite products are the only recourse to obtaining burned area data. Previous studies have attempted to evaluate the uncertainty of burned areas by comparing different satellite products. In this study, we compared burned areas from prescribed burning permit records and two satellite products in Florida and Georgia during the 2015 and 2016 burning seasons. Burned areas in permit records are only preburn estimates, but a survey we conducted suggests that they are within 15% of the actual burned areas. Our comparison results show that current satellite products generally underestimate the burned areas of small fires and need several improvements for detection of prescribed burns.

TI  - Burden of bacterial meningitis in India: Preliminary data from a hospital based sentinel surveillance network
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundWorldwide, acute bacterial meningitis is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality among under five children, particularly in settings where vaccination for H. influenzae type b, S. pneumoniae and N. meningitidis is yet to be introduced in the national immunization programs. Estimation of disease burden of bacterial meningitis associated with these pathogens can guide the policy makers to consider inclusion of these newer vaccines in the immunization programs. A network of hospital based sentinel surveillance was established to generate baseline data on the burden of bacterial meningitis among children aged less than 5 years in India and to provide a platform for impact assessment following introduction of the Pentavalent and Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccines (PCV).MethodsDuring surveillance carried out in select hospitals across India in 2012 - 2013, information regarding demographics, immunization history, clinical history, treatment details and laboratory investigations viz. CSF biochemistry, culture, latex agglutination and PCR was collected from children aged 1 to 59 months admitted with suspected bacterial meningitis.ResultsA total of 3104 suspected meningitis cases were enrolled from 19,670 children admitted with fever at the surveillance hospitals. Of these, 257 cases were confirmed as cases of meningitis. They were due to S. pneumoniae (82.9%), H. influenzae type b (14.4%) and N. meningitidis (2.7%). Highest prevalence (55.3%) was observed among children 1 to 11 months. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed considerable resistance among S. pneumoniae isolates against commonly used antibiotics such as cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, penicillin, and cefotaxime. More commonly prevalent serotypes of S. pneumoniae in circulation included 6B, 14, 6A and 19F. More than 90% of serotypes identified were covered by Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine 13.ConclusionsWe observed that S. pneumoniae was the commonest cause of bacterial meningitis in hospitalized children under five years of age in India. Continued surveillance is expected to provide valuable information and trends in future, to take an informed decision on introduction of pneumococcal vaccination in Universal Immunization Programme in India and will also eventually help in post-vaccination impact evaluation.

The Brewer-Dobson circulation is not well constrained by observations and further investigation is required to resolve uncertainties related to the mechanisms driving the circulation. This study has assessed the specified dynamics mode of the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM30) by comparing to the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier transform spectrometer (ACE-FTS) profile measurements of CFC-11 (CCl3F), CFC-12 (CCl2F2), and N2O. In the CMAM30 specified dynamics simulation, the meteorological fields are nudged using the ERA-Interim reanalysis and a specified tracer was employed for each species, with hemispherically defined surface measurements used as the boundary condition. A comprehensive sampling technique along the line of sight of the ACE-FTS measurements has been utilized to allow for direct comparisons between the simulated and measured tracer concentrations. The model consistently overpredicts tracer concentrations of CFC-11, CFC-12, and N2O in the lower stratosphere, particularly in the northern hemispheric winter and spring seasons. The three mixing barriers investigated, including the polar vortex, the extratropical tropopause, and the tropical pipe, show that there are significant inconsistencies between the measurements and the simulations. In particular, the CMAM30 simulation underpredicts mixing efficiency in the tropical lower stratosphere during the June-July-August season.

TI  - Comparison of Fire Radiative Power Estimates From VIIRS and MODIS Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based active fire data are a viable tool to understand the role of global fires in the biosphere and atmosphere. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors on Aqua and Terra satellites are nearing the end of their lives. The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensor on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership satellite and the subsequent Joint Polar Satellite System series is expected to extend the MODIS active fire record. Thus, understanding the similarities of and discrepancies between the two data sets during their overlap period is important for existing applications. This study investigated the dependence of the MODIS and VIIRS fire characterization capabilities on satellite view zenith angle and the relationship between the two sensors' fire radiative power (FRP) from individual fire clusters to fire data on continental and global scales. The results indicate that the VIIRS fire characterization capability is similar across swath, whereas MODIS is strongly dependent on view zenith angle. Statistical analyses reveal that the VIIRS and MODIS FRP relationship varies between different spatial scales. In fire clusters, MODIS and VIIRS FRP estimates are very comparable, except for large boreal forest fires where VIIRS FRP is approximately 47% smaller. At the continental scale, the contemporaneous FRP retrievals from MODIS and VIIRS are generally comparable and strongly correlated, but VIIRS FRP is slightly larger and their differences vary across seasons. At global 1 degrees x1 degrees grids, the FRP difference between the two sensors is, on average, approximately 20% in fire-prone regions but varies significantly in fire-limited regions.

TI  - Cloud Feedback Key to Marine Heatwave off Baja California
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Between 2013 and 2015, the northeast Pacific Ocean experienced the warmest surface temperature anomalies in the modern observational record. This "marine heatwave" marked a shift of Pacific decadal variability to its warm phase and was linked to significant impacts on marine species as well as exceptionally arid conditions in western North America. Here we show that the subtropical signature of this warming, off Baja California, was associated with a record deficit in the spatial coverage of co-located marine boundary layer clouds. This deficit coincided with a large increase in downwelling solar radiation that dominated the anomalous energy budget of the upper ocean, resulting in record-breaking warm sea surface temperature anomalies. Our observation-based analysis suggests that a positive cloud-surface temperature feedback was key to the extreme intensity of the heatwave. The results demonstrate the extent to which boundary layer clouds can contribute to regional variations in climate.Plain Language Summary The northeast Pacific Ocean experienced a "marine heatwave" between 2013 and 2015. This was characterized by the highest surface temperatures ever recorded in a vast swath of the ocean from near the Gulf of Alaska to off the coast of Baja California. The unprecedented warming event was linked to significant impacts on marine life and a severe drought in western North America. We analyze satellite data to show that the heatwave was associated with a record decrease in the typically high cloudiness over an area of the Pacific off Baja California that is roughly half the size of the contiguous United States. Such a deficit in cloud cover coincided with a large increase in the amount of sunlight absorbed by the ocean surface, resulting in extremely warm temperatures. Our findings suggest that a reinforcing interaction (or positive feedback) between clouds and ocean surface temperature can strongly contribute to significant and difficult-to-predict changes in marine climate.

TI  - Denali Ice Core Methanesulfonic Acid Records North Pacific Marine Primary Production
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll region of the northeastern (NE) subarctic Pacific is one of the most biologically productive marine ecosystems in the world, supporting fisheries worth over $5 billion annually. Phytoplankton are the primary producers in this ecosystem and are also a major source of biogenic sulfur emissions, important in Earth's climate system. However, variability in marine primary production through time is not well constrained. Here we establish methanesulfonic acid (MSA) concentrations in the Denali ice core as a proxy for marine primary production in the NE Pacific. Using Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT; Stein et al., 2015, ) modeling, we identify moisture source regions for the core site and correlate Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor-derived chlorophyll a concentrations with ice core MSA. From 1998 to 2007 we find that areas of significant positive correlation overlap with the HYSPLIT-inferred moisture source region in the western Gulf of Alaska on an annual basis (r=0.85, p<0.001). We identify an MSA response to a localized bloom related to ash deposition from a 2009 Mt. Redoubt eruption. An anomalous upwelling-driven bloom in spring 2008 did not impact the ice core MSA record due to unfavorable transport conditions. Despite this, we observe that bloom events are rarely missed in the MSA record, which we attribute to the consistent and high snow accumulation rate at the ice core drill site. Our findings suggest that Denali ice core MSA is a reliable recorder of changes in marine primary production through time in the NE subarctic Pacific.Plain Language Summary The base of the marine food web is composed of single-celled photosynthetic organisms that are collectively termed primary producers. Because these microscopic organisms support all marine life, changes in their biomass can impact the entire food web. Over the past three decades, satellite data have shown that primary producers are declining around the world with some of the greatest declines occurring in the North Pacific Ocean. The reasons for these declines may include changes in ocean temperatures, nutrient availability, and wind-driven ocean mixing, all of which are related to climate. To place these changes within a longer-term context, we seek to validate regionally a proxy tool by measuring a chemical produced by phytoplankton called methanesulfonic acid (MSA). MSA is transported through the atmosphere by storms and deposited on mountain glaciers in the North Pacific region. We measured MSA in a new ice core from Denali National Park, Alaska. We describe strong, statistically significant correlations between ice core MSA concentrations and chlorophyll concentrations in the western Gulf of Alaska. We suggest that the ice core MSA proxy record can help us understand how primary production in this region has changed through time.

TI  - Geologic Slip-Rate Determinations on the Talas-Fergana Fault: Mismatch With Geodetic Slip Rate
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed new paleoseismic field investigations at two sites on the Talas-Fergana fault, a poorly known strike-slip structure that transects the Tien Shan mountain range, document late Holocene slip rates of 11-16 mma(-1). This prominent structure is distinctive in striking obliquely NW-SE across the Tien Shan, which is otherwise dominated by contractional structures striking generally E-W. Moreover, a satellite-based Global Positioning System network spanning the Tien Shan orogen records active N-S contraction rates of similar to 20 mm a(-1), but limits slip on the Talas-Fergana fault to <2 mm a(-1). This profound mismatch between long-term geologic and short-term geodetic slip rates, which may suggest temporal variability in slip, highlights the importance of field-based investigations as a complement to remotely sensed data, particularly in evaluating models of lithosphere behavior and earthquake probabilities on presently locked faults such as the Talas-Fergana.Plain Language Summary The 700 kmlong Talas-Fergana fault is one of several large faults linked to the collision between the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates and cuts obliquely across the Tien Shanmountain range north of the Himalayas. Satellite-based Global Positioning System data show that the Tien Shan range is being rapidly compressed tectonically, at the rate of about 20 mm per year, yet indicate a slip rate on the Talas-Fergana of less than 2 mm per year. However, our study employs intensive field geologic techniques to determine that the slip rate on this fault has averaged 11-16 mm per year over recentmillennia. With increasing reliance on satellite-based measurements investigating such a profound mismatch is important for reliable earthquake hazard assessments on the Talas-Fergana fault, which appears locked and is at an unknown point in its earthquake cycle. Reconciling the two data sets suggests significant variability in slip rate on the Talas-Fergana through time, a conclusion that may have additional implications for models of lithosphere behavior.

TI  - Regional Intensification of the Tropical Hydrological Cycle During ENSO
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides observational evidence for feedbacks that amplify the short-term hydrological response associated with the warm phase of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. Our analyses make use of a comprehensive set of independent satellite observations collected over decades to show that much larger local changes to cloud (similar to 50%/K) and precipitation (similar to 60%/K) occur than would be expected from the guidance of Clausius-Clapeyron theory (similar to 7%/K). This amplification comes from atmospheric feedbacks involving shifts in the patterns of latent and radiative heating that mutually act on the dynamics enhancing changes to the hydrological cycle. We also confirm the existence of an opposing negative flux feedback at the ocean surface, driven largely by solar radiation changes, that opposes the surface warming. Estimates of the strength of this and other feedback factors associated with warming in the Nino3 region are provided from observations. These observations are also used to examine comparative processes and feedbacks in model experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project.Plain Language Summary It is a widely held paradigm of a warming world the "wet gets wetter and dry drier." It is also argued that in this context precipitation in wet areas is expected to increase at a rate of approximately 7%/K, which is in accordance with expected increases in water vapor availability from elementary theory (the so-called Clausius-Clapeyron response). One of the main wet regions of the planet is the region of deep tropical convection organized into broad convective zones referred to as the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, and this region undergoes variability that is often used to test ideas thought to be relevant to climate change. Our study pieces together several independent measurements collected over multiple decades to reveal a strong, positive feedback on tropical convection associated with the short-term climate variations of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation. The feedback is a result of coupled dynamical-radiative processes that combine to produce intensification of the tropical hydrological cycle that is more than twice that expected from the CC response alone.

TI  - Radiance-Based Evaluation of WRF Cloud Properties Over East Asia: Direct Comparison With FY-2E Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiance-based comparison between model-simulated and satellite-observed atmosphere shows its unique advantage for model evaluation. This study couples a fast radiative transfer model, namely, the community radiative transfer model, and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) to generate synthetic satellite observed infrared (IR) brightness temperatures (BTs) over East Asia. Simulated IR BTs are used to evaluate WRF cloud properties by direct comparison with observations from the Visible and Infrared Spin-Scan Radiometer (onboard the FengYun-2E geostationary satellite). A deep cyclone over North China is investigated as our case study. The simulated and observed BTs in the 6.8-m channel demonstrate agreement with an averaged bias of <3K, whereas the performances in two IR window channels are relatively poor with averaged BT differences almost 10K. For typical precipitation regions, BT differences between the 6.8- and 10.8-m channels indicate that the WRF simulation underestimates low- to midlevel clouds but reproduces high-level clouds better. Overall, the WRF has solid capabilities to capture the cloud characteristics broadly, whereas some limitations are shown in the cloud temporal and variation cloud cover, especially 3days after the WRF initialization.

TI  - The Ascension Island Boundary Layer in the Remote Southeast Atlantic is Often Smoky
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observations from June to October 2016, from a surface-based ARM Mobile Facility deployment on Ascension Island (8 degrees S, 14.5 degrees W) indicate that refractory black carbon (rBC) is almost always present within the boundary layer. The rBC mass concentrations, light absorption coefficients, and cloud condensation nuclei concentrations vary in concert and synoptically, peaking in August. Light absorption coefficients at three visible wavelengths as a function of rBC mass are approximately double that calculated from black carbon in lab studies. A spectrally-flat absorption angstrom exponent suggests most of the light absorption is from lens-coated black carbon. The single-scattering-albedo increases systematically from August to October in both 2016 and 2017, with monthly means of 0.78 +/- 0.02 (August), 0.81 +/- 0.03 (September), and 0.83 +/- 0.03 (October) at the green wavelength. Boundary layer aerosol loadings are only loosely correlated with total aerosol optical depth, with smoke more likely to be present in the boundary layer earlier in the biomass burning season, evolving to smoke predominantly present above the cloud layers in September-October, typically resting upon the cloud top inversion. The time period with the campaign-maximum near-surface light absorption and column aerosol optical depth, on 13-16 August 2016, is investigated further. Backtrajectories that indicate more direct boundary layer transport westward from the African continent is central to explaining the elevated surface aerosol loadings.

TI  - Characterizing, monitoring, and simulating land cover dynamics using GlobeLand30: A case study from 2000 to 2030
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps provide us with a unique opportunity to monitor our environmental and anthropogenic resources over space and time. Temporal land cover maps increase the efficiency of land monitoring process by providing a set of observations so that any changes in the landscape can be tracked. So far, many land change monitoring efforts have been limited to small regions and analysing local processes, because there has been a lack of fine resolution global land cover maps for regional and global studies. Recently, the availability of bi-temporal GlobeLand30 product for years 2000 and 2010 has strengthened our land monitoring observations through a 10-year window at 30-meter resolution. The main objective of this study is to explore the land cover changes within 2000-2010 in one of the most dynamic regions in the Middle East. To do so, GlobeLand30 datasets were used for characterizing the regional landscapes and the distribution of the existing land cover types. Moreover, the study aims at predicting the future land cover patterns by 2030 based on the historical changes. The quantitative analysis reveals a high degree of changes from the majority of land types to barelands with the highest contribution from grasslands and shrublands. The vibrant spots of change are located on central Iran towards its eastern border while the persistent spots are located on its north and northwestern parts. The predictive measures using Markov chain analysis message forthcoming changes in favor of increasing barelands being taken from grasslands, cultivated lands, and shrublands. The findings are beneficial to a wide range of end users including academics, land managers, and environmentalists on a) which resources were available in the first decade of 21st century, and b) how they were treated within a decade, and c) how the resources will evolve within the following two decades. Further discussions on the achieved results and future directions of research are presented in the conclusions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spiky gold shells on magnetic particles for DNA biosensors
T2  - TALANTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Combined separation and detection of biomolecules has the potential to speed up and improve the sensitivity of disease detection, environmental testing, and biomolecular analysis. In this work, we synthesized magnetic particles coated with spiky nanostructured gold shells and used them to magnetically separate out and detect oligonucleotides using SERS. The distance dependence of the SERS signal was then harnessed to detect DNA hybridization using a Raman label bound to a hairpin probe. The distance of the Raman label from the surface increased upon complementary DNA hybridization, leading to a decrease in signal intensity. This work demonstrates the use of the particles for combined separation and detection of oligonucleotides without the use of an extrinsic tag or secondary hybridization step.

TI  - Impact of heavy metal bioaccumulation on antioxidant activities and DNA profile in two earthworm species and freshwater prawn from Ogun River
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of freshwater invertebrates as bioindicator of heavy metal pollution is an important tool for environmental biomonitoring. This study investigated antioxidant activities and DNA profile in two limicolous earthworms (Alma millsoni and Libyodrilus violaceus) and freshwater prawns (Macrobrachium vollenhovenii) at selected points of Ogun River, Abeokuta. Heavy metal concentrations and DNA profile in the earthworms and prawn tissues were measured using standard procedures. Zn concentration was higher than other heavy metals in A. millsoni (685.83 +/- 114.42 mg/kg), L violaceus (1913.3 +/- 1098.7 mg/kg) and M. vollenhovenii (134.7 +/- 13.61 mg/kg). Superoxide dismu lase activity ranged from 62.44 +/- 7.16-79.82 +/- 11.18 U/g tissues, 60.26 +/- 11.18-71.07 +/- 7.541.1/g tissues and 74.07 +/- 16.69-87.79 +/- 8.50 U/g tissues in A. millsoni, L violaceus and M. vollenhovenii respectively. RAPD-PCR revealed varying DNA profile among the earthworms samples; the UPGMA dendrogram formed two distinct clusters at genetic similarity coefficient of 0.15-0.2 with one duster consisting of Alma millsoni and Libyodrilus violaceus from Sokori, Enugada and Iberekodo sampling points and the second cluster forming two distinct sub-clusters comprising Arakanga and Ago-ika's L violaceus in one and A. millsoni in the other. High genetic variability was recorded among the earthworm species while the freshwater prawn showed no variability. Antioxidant activities and genetic variability in earthworms could serve as biomarkers of heavy metal pollution in freshwater environment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The impact of channel capture on estuarine hydro-morphodynamics and water quality in the Amazon delta
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to progressive erosion of the new Urucurituba Channel, the Amazon River has recently captured almost all discharge from the lower Araguari River (Amapa-AP, Brazil), which previously flowed directly to the Atlantic Ocean. These recent geomorphological changes have caused strong impacts on the landscape and hydrodynamic patterns near the Araguari River mouth, especially the alteration of the riverine drainage system and its water quality. Landsat images were used to assess the estuarine landscape morphodynamic, particularly the expansion of the Urucurituba Channel, 80 km from the Araguari River mouth, chronicling its connection to the Amazon River. The results suggest that the Urucurituba developed by headward migration across the Amazon delta; this is perhaps the first observation of estuarine distributary network development by headward channel erosion. The rate of Urucurituba Channel width increase has been approximate to 5 m/month since 2011, increasing drainage capacity of the channel. We also collected in situ hydrodynamic measurements and analyzed 17 water quality parameters. Having 2011 as baseline, the flowrate of Araguari River has been diverted by up to 98% through Urucurituba Channel, with substantial changes in net discharge recorded at 3 monitoring stations. Statistically significant differences in water quality (p < 0.05) were observed between 2011 and 2015, associated with the change in the flow pattern. Estuarine salinity and solids concentrations have increased. Overall, we demonstrate changes in landscape, hydrodynamics and water quality of the lower Araguari River. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Estimating the snowfall limit in alpine and pre-alpine valleys: A local evaluation of operational approaches
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The snowfall limit has important implications for different hazardous processes associated with prolonged or heavy precipitation such as flash floods, rain-on-snow events and freezing precipitation. To increase preparedness and to reduce risk in such situations, early warning systems are frequently used to monitor and predict precipitation events at different temporal and spatial scales. However, in alpine and pre-alpine valleys, the estimation of the snowfall limit remains rather challenging. In this study, we characterize uncertainties related to snowfall limit for different lead times based on local measurements of a vertically pointing micro rain radar (MRR) and a disdrometer in the Zulg valley, Switzerland. Regarding the monitoring, we show that the interpolation of surface temperatures tends to overestimate the altitude of the snowfall limit and can thus lead to highly uncertain estimates of liquid precipitation in the catchment. This bias is much smaller in the Integrated Nowcasting through Comprehensive Analysis (INCA) system, which integrates surface station and remotely sensed data as well as outputs of a numerical weather prediction model. To reduce systematic error, we perform a bias correction based on local MRR measurements and thereby demonstrate the added value of such measurements for the estimation of liquid precipitation in the catchment. Regarding the nowcasting, we show that the INCA system provides good estimates up to 6 h ahead and is thus considered promising for operational hydrological applications. Finally, we explore the medium-range forecasting of precipitation type, especially with respect to rain-on-snow events. We show for a selected case study that the probability for a certain precipitation type in an ensemble-based forecast is more persistent than the respective type in the high-resolution forecast (HRES) of the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF IFS). In this case study, the ensemble-based forecast could be used to anticipate such an event up up 7-8 days ahead, whereas the use of the HRES is limited to a lead time of 4-5 days. For the different lead times investigated, we point out possibilities of considering uncertainties in snowfall limit and precipitation type estimates so as to increase preparedness to risk situations.

TI  - Surface moisture area during rainfall-run-off events to understand the hydrological dynamics of a basin in a plain region
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The understanding of the hydrology of plain basins may be improved by the combined analysis of rainfall-run-off records and remote sensed surface moisture data. Our work evaluates the surface moisture area (SMA) produced during rainfall-run-off events in a plain watershed of the Argentine Pampas Region, and studies which hydrological variables are related to the generated SMA. The study area is located in the upper and middle basins of the Del Azul stream, characterized by the presence of small gently hilly areas surrounded by flat landscapes. Data from 9 rainfall-run-off events were analysed. MODIS surface reflectance data were processed to calculate SMA subsequent to the peak discharge (post-SMA), and previous to the rainfall events (prev-SMA), to consider the antecedent wetness. Rainfall-run-off data included total precipitation depth (P), maximum intensity of rainfall over 6 hr (I6max), surface runoff registered between the beginning of the event and the day previous to the analysed MODIS scene (R), peak flow (Qp), and flood intensity (IF). In contrast with other works, post-SMA showed a negative relationship with the R. Three groups of cases were identified: (a) Events of low I6max, high prev-SMA, and low R were associated with slow and weakly channelized flow over plain areas, leading to saturated overland flow (SOF), with large SMA; (b) events of high I6max, low prev-SMA, and medium to high R were rapidly transported along the gentle slopes of the basin, related to Hortonian overland flow (HOF) and low post-SMA; and (c) events of medium to high I6max and prev-SMA with medium R were related to heterogeneous input-antecedent-run-off conditions combined: Local spatial conditions may have produced HOF or SOF, leading to an averaged response with medium SMA. The interactions between the geomorphology of the basin, the characteristics of the events, and the antecedent conditions may explain the obtained results. This analysis is relevant for the general knowledge of the hydrology of large plains, whose functioning studies are still in their early stages.

TI  - Combining active learning and transductive support vector machines for sea ice detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice can cause some of the most prominent marine disasters in polar and high latitude regions, and remote sensing technology provides an important means to detect such hazards. The accuracy of sea ice detection depends on the number and quality of labeled samples, but because of environmental conditions in sea ice regions, acquisition of labeled samples can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. To solve this problem, we propose a combined active learning (AL) and semisupervised learning (SSL) classification framework for sea ice detection. At first, we acquire most informative and representative samples by AL; then labeled samples acquired by AL are used as the initial labeled samples for SSL, in this framework, we not only choose the most valuable samples but also use the large number of unlabeled samples to enhance the classification accuracy. In AL phase, we use two different sampling strategies: uncertainty and diversity. In the SSL phase, we utilize a sampling function integrating AL to acquire semilabeled samples, and we use a transductive support vector machine as a classification model. We analyze three remote sensing images (hyperspectral and multispectral) and conduct detailed comparative analyses between the proposed method and others. Our proposed method achieves the highest classification accuracies (89.9734%, 97.4919%, and 89.7166%) in both experiments. These results show that the proposed method exhibits better overall performance than other methods and can be effectively applied to sea ice detection using remote sensing.

TI  - Elucidation of inhibitory effects on metastatic sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer during One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is an established method for intraoperative diagnosis of breast cancer metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes, based on quantification of CK19 mRNA, specific to breast epithelial cells. Inhibitors interfere with the PCR amplification process of PCR. Thus, OSNA, based on gene amplification without RNA purification, might be impacted by numerous factors persisting in a sample, and thereby potentially acting as PCR inhibitors. However, neither the characteristics of breast cancers showing inhibitory effects during OSNA, nor any of the possible inhibitors, have as yet been identified. Inhibitory effects detected during OSNA in 72 metastatic lymph nodes and the patients' clinicopathological features were examined. Left-over OSNA samples were analyzed with mass spectrometry to identify proteins possibly acting as inhibitors. Most tumors showed inhibitory effects, though to varying degrees. Large tumor, young age and high tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte counts were related to stronger inhibitory effects. Proteome analysis revealed elevations in RPB9 protein and EIF2 signaling upregulation in samples showing strong inhibitory effects. Tumors showing strong inhibitory effects had clinically relevant characteristics, including large size and extensive tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte involvement. Identifying inhibitors in OSNA might provide new insights into breast cancer biology as well as advancing the current technology.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variations in climate, primary productivity and efficiency of water and carbon use of the land cover types in Sudan and Ethiopia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The impact of climate variability on the Net Primary Productivity (NPP) of different land cover types and the reaction of NPP to drought conditions are still unclear, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. This research utilizes public-domain data for the period 2000 through 2013 to analyze these aspects for several land cover types in Sudan and Ethiopia, as examples of data-scarce countries. Spatio-temporal variation in NPP, water use efficiency (WUE) and carbon use efficiency (CUE) for several land covers were correlated with variations in precipitation, temperature and drought at different time scales, i.e. 1, 3, 6 and 12 months using Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) datasets. WUE and CUE were estimated as the ratios of NPP to actual evapotranspiration and NPP to Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), respectively. Results of this study revealed that NPP, WUE and CUE of the different land cover types in Ethiopia have higher magnitudes than their counterparts in Sudan. Moreover, they exhibit higher sensitivity to drought and variation in precipitation. Whereas savannah represents the most sensitive land cover to drought, croplands and permanent wetlands are the least sensitive ones. The inter-annual variation in NPP, WUE and CUE in Ethiopia is likely to be driven by a drought of time scale of three months. No statistically significant correlation was found for Sudan between the inter-annual variations in these indicators with drought at any of the time scales considered in the study. Our findings are useful from the view point of both food security for a growing population and mitigation to climate change as discussed in the present study. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - ZHURNAL FRONTIRNYKH ISSLEDOVANII-JOURNAL OF FRONTIER STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the very important problem of cultural transformation of identity levels in the modern socio-cultural space. As a result of globalization processes, the traditional forms of identity are being blurred both at the individual and collective levels. We can see the formation of multiple, transcultural identity, which requiring the ability to freely maneuver among different cultural traditions.The coexistence of traditional and post-industrial worldview violates the usual forms of ethno-cultural identity, casting doubt on the confidence in one's own security. Active international contacts make isolation policy impossible, however, different levels of social and economic development, different worldviews do not contribute to the creation of the union transcultural space where the global tendencies of social development and local features of the cultural dynamics should coexist peacefully. The formation of such a space is a long process based on the overcoming of national (ethnic) identities and proposing a new way of multiple identity - "at the exit from one's culture and at a crossroads with strangers", which manifest themselves in the most diverse forms caused by a civilizational stage of their evolution .The article explores two opposing approaches: the preservation of traditionality outside the innovation space and the breaking of all traditional foundations. In the heterotopic space of modern society, the first approach is predominant for a number of reasons. The aspiration to preserve traditional culture contributes to the preservation of a traditional identity that does not correspond to the development of a postindustrial society. However, the heterotopic space of the frontier breaks the established stereotypes and constructs a new transcultural space that requires theoretical comprehension.

TI  - The SPAtial EFficiency metric (SPAEF): multiple-component evaluation of spatial patterns for optimization of hydrological models
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The process of model evaluation is not only an integral part of model development and calibration but also of paramount importance when communicating modelling results to the scientific community and stakeholders. The modelling community has a large and well-tested toolbox of metrics to evaluate temporal model performance. In contrast, spatial performance evaluation does not correspond to the grand availability of spatial observations readily available and to the sophisticate model codes simulating the spatial variability of complex hydrological processes. This study makes a contribution towards advancing spatial-pattern-oriented model calibration by rigorously testing a multiple-component performance metric. The promoted SPAtial EFficiency (SPAEF) metric reflects three equally weighted components: correlation, coefficient of variation and histogram overlap. This multiple-component approach is found to be advantageous in order to achieve the complex task of comparing spatial patterns. SPAEF, its three components individually and two alternative spatial performance metrics, i.e. connectivity analysis and fractions skill score, are applied in a spatial-pattern-oriented model calibration of a catchment model in Denmark. Results suggest the importance of multiple-component metrics because stand-alone metrics tend to fail to provide holistic pattern information. The three SPAEF components are found to be independent, which allows them to complement each other in a meaningful way. In order to optimally exploit spatial observations made available by remote sensing platforms, this study suggests applying bias insensitive metrics which further allow for a comparison of variables which are related but may differ in unit. This study applies SPAEF in the hydrological context using the mesoscale Hydrologic Model (mHM; version 5.8), but we see great potential across disciplines related to spatially distributed earth system modelling.

TI  - The effect of inflation on the morphology-derived rheological parameters of lava flows and its implications for interpreting remote sensing data - A case study on the 2014/2015 eruption at Holuhraun, Iceland
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Morphology-derived lava flow rheology is a frequently used tool in volcanology and planetary science to determine rheological parameters and deduce the composition of lavas on terrestrial planets and their moons. These calculations are usually based on physical equations incorporating 1) lava flow driving forces: gravity, slope and flow-rate and 2) morphological data such as lava flow geometry: flow-width,-height or shape of the flow outline. All available methods assume that no geometrical changes occur after emplacement and that the measured flow geometry reflects the lava's apparent viscosity and/or yield strength during emplacement. It is however well established from terrestrial examples that lava flows may inflate significantly after the cessation of flow advance. This inflation affects, in turn, the width-to-height ratio upon which the rheological estimates are based and thus must result in uncertainties in the determination of flow rheology, as the flow height is one of the key parameters in the morphology-based deduction of flow properties. Previous studies have recognized this issue but, to date, no assessment of the magnitude of this error has been presented. This is likely due to a lack of digital elevation models (DEMs) at sufficiently high spatial and temporal resolution.The 2014/15 Holuhraun eruption in central Iceland represents one of the best monitored large volume (1.5 km(3)) lava flow fields (85 km(2)) to date. An abundance of scientific field and remote sensing data were collected during its emplacement. Moreover, inflation plays a key role in the emplacement dynamics of the late stage of the lava field. Here, we use a time series of high resolution DEMs acquired by the TanDEM-X satellite mission prior, during and after the eruption to evaluate the error associated with the most common methods of deriving lava flow rheology from morphological parameters used in planetary science.We can distinguish two dominant processes as sources of error in the determination of lava flow rheology from morphology 1) wholesale inflation of lava channels and 2) post halting inflation of individual lava toes. These result in a 2.4- to 17 - fold overestimation of apparent viscosity and a 0.7- to 2.4 - fold overestimation of yield strength. When applied in planetary sciences, this overestimation in rheological parameters translates directly to an overestimation of the respective lavas silica content. We conclude that, although qualitatively informative, morphological analysis is insufficient to discern lava rheology and composition. Instead, in-situ analysis together with high resolution remote sensing data is needed to properly constrain the compositions involved in planetary volcanism. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A new method to quantify surface urban heat island intensity
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable quantification of urban heat island (UHI) can contribute to the effective evaluation of potential heat risk. Traditional methods for the quantification of UHI intensity (UHII) using pairs-measurements are sensitive to the choice of stations or grids. In order to get rid of the limitation of urban/rural divisions, this paper proposes a new approach to quantify surface UHII (SUHII) using the relationship between MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and impervious surface areas (ISA). Given the footprint of LST measurement, the ISA was regionalized to include the information of neighborhood pixels using a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method. Considering the footprint improves the LST-ISA relationship. The LST shows highly positive correlation with the KDE regionalized ISA (ISA(KDE)). The linear functions of LST are well fitted by the ISA(KDE) in both annual and daily scales for the city of Berlin. The slope of the linear function represents the increase in LST from the natural surface in rural regions to the impervious surface in urban regions, and is defined as SUHII in this study. The calculated SUHII show high values in summer and during the day than in winter and at night. The new method is also verified using finer resolution Landset data, and the results further prove its reliability. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Review of synthetic aperture radar frequency, polarization, and incidence angle data for mapping the inundated regions
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The use and importance of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data for flood area mapping studies have been proved beyond the doubts as SAR signals are able to penetrate the thick formation of clouds and are able to receive the reflected signals of surface objects even during extreme weather conditions. At the same time, the accuracies of an SAR image-based flood area mapping model has a direct relationship with the frequency of the source SAR signal, the polarization mode that has been used, and the incidence angle by which the disaster region has been sensed. In addition to this, while evolving SAR image-based flood area mapping models, it is a must to understand the response of the inundated regions of the different geographical regions, as well as the response of the same geographical region during different climatic and seasonal periods as the same object, produces different signatures in varying situations. As of this date, there is no single article that can synchronize such information, which is widely disseminated across various research publications. This article mainly focuses on gathering and reviewing such vital information as well as bringing out the details about the physical basis of the interaction of the radar signal with various water surfaces of different geographical conditions, the response of inundated regions under different frequency, polarization, and incidence angle. Such information is mainly used to understand the difficulties that arise when mapping the inundated regions using the SAR image. In the end, the significant observations of the literature reviews are highlighted, which is very useful for young researchers who are interested in building flood area application models using different sets of SAR data.

TI  - Exploiting the use of physical information for the calibration of a lumped hydrological model
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - In hydrological modelling, the challenge is to identify an optimal strategy to exploit tools and available observations in order to enhance model reliability. The increasing availability of data promotes the use of new calibration techniques able to make use of additional information on river basins. In the present study, a lumped hydrological model-designed with the aim of utilizing remotely sensed data-is introduced and calibrated, adopting four different schemes that adopt, to varying extents, available physical information. The physically consistent conceptualization of the hydrological model used allowed development of a step by step calibration based on a combination of information, such as remotely sensed data describing snow cover, recession curves obtained from streamflow measurements, and time series of surface run-off obtained with a baseflow mathematical filter applied to the streamflow time-series. Results suggest that the use of physical information in the calibration procedure tends to increase model reliability with respect to approaches where the parameters are calibrated using an overall statistic based, considerably or exclusively, on streamflow data.

TI  - Instability of the southern Canadian Shield during the late Proterozoic
T2  - EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cratons are generally considered to comprise lithosphere that has remained tectonically quiescent for billions of years. Direct evidence for stability is mainly founded in the Phanerozoic sedimentary record and low-temperature thermochronology, but for extensive parts of Canada, earlier stability has been inferred due to the lack of an extensive rock record in both time and space. We used 40Ar/39Ar multi-diffusion domain (MDD) analysis of K-feldspar to constrain cratonic thermal histories across an intermediate (-150-350 degrees C) temperature range in an attempt to link published high-temperature geochronology that resolves the timing of orogenesis and metamorphism with lower-temperature data suited for upper-crustal burial and unroofing histories. This work is focused on understanding the transition from Archean-Paleoproterozoic crustal growth to later intervals of stability, and how uninterrupted that record is throughout Earth's Proterozoic "Middle Age." Intermediate-temperature thermal histories of cratonic rocks at well-constrained localities within the southern Canadian Shield of North America challenge the stability worldview because our data indicate that these rocks were at elevated temperatures in the Proterozoic. Feldspars from granitic rocks collected at the surface cooled at rates of <0.5 degrees C/Ma subsequent to orogenesis, seemingly characteristic of aatonic lithosphere, but modeled thermal histories suggest that at ca. 1.1-1.0 Ga these rocks were still near similar to 200 degrees C - signaling either reheating, or prolonged residence at mid-crustal depths assuming a normal cratonic geothermal gradient. After 1.0 Ga, the regions we sampled then underwent further cooling such that they were at or near the surface (<< 60 degrees C) in the early Paleozoic. Explaining mid-crustal residence at 1.0 Ga is challenging. A widespread, prolonged reheating history via burial is not supported by stratigraphic information, however assuming a purely monotonic cooling history requires at the very least 5 km of exhumation beginning at ca. 1.0 Ga. A possible explanation may be found in evidence of magmatic underplating that thickened the crust, driving uplift and erosion. The timing of this underplating coincides with Mid-Continent extension, Grenville orogenesis, and assembly of the supercontinent Rodinia. 40Ar/39Ar MDD data demonstrate that this technique can be successfully applied to older rocks and fill in a large observational gap. These data also raise questions about the evolution of cratons during the Proterozoic and the nature of cratonic stability across deep time. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Wetland hydroperiod classification in the western prairies using multitemporal synthetic aperture radar
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands represent one of the world's most biodiverse and threatened ecosystem types and were diminished globally by about two-thirds in the 20th century. There is continuing decline in wetland quantity and function due to infilling and other human activities. In addition, with climate change, warmer temperatures and changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration are reducing wetland surface and groundwater supplies, further altering wetland hydrology and vegetation. There is a need to automate inventory and monitoring of wetlands, and as a study system, we investigated the Shepard Slough wetlands complex, which includes numerous wetlands in urban, suburban, and agricultural zones in the prairie pothole region of southern Alberta, Canada. Here, wetlands are generally confined to depressions in the undulating terrain, challenging wetlands inventory and monitoring. This study applied threshold and frequency analysis routines for high-resolution, single-polarization (HH) RADARSAT-2, synthetic aperture radar mapping. This enabled a growing season surface water extent hyroperiod-based wetland classification, which can support water and wetland resource monitoring. This 3-year study demonstrated synthetic aperture radar-derived multitemporal open-water masks provided an effective index of wetland permanence class, with overall accuracies of 89% to 95% compared with optical validation data, and RMSE between 0.2 and 0.7 m between model and field validation data. This allowed for characterizing the distribution and dynamics of 4 marsh wetlands hydroperiod classes, temporary, seasonal, semipermanent, and permanent, and mapping of the sequential vegetation bands that included emergent, obligate wetland, facultative wetland, and upland plant communities. Hydroperiod variation and surface water extent were found to be influenced by short-term rainfall events in both wet and dry years. Seasonal hydroperiods in wetlands were particularly variable if there was a decrease in the temporary or semipermanent hydroperiod classes. In years with extreme rain events, the temporary wetlands especially increased relative to longer lasting wetlands (84% in 2015 with significant rainfall events, compared with 42% otherwise).

TI  - Bisphenol A (BPA) modulates the expression of endocrine and stress response genes in the freshwater snail <i>Physa acuta</i>
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bisphenol A (BPA), a known endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) that can mimic the action of oestrogens by interacting with hormone receptors, is potentially able to influence reproductive functions in vertebrates and invertebrates. The freshwater pulmonate Physa acuta is a sensitive organism to xenobiotics appropriate for aquatic toxicity testing in environmental studies. This study was conducted to explore the effects of BPA on the Gastropoda endocrine system. The effects following a range of exposure times (5-96 h) to BPA in P. acuta were evaluated at the molecular level by analysing changes in the transcriptional activity of the endocrine-related genes oestrogen receptor (ER), oestrogen-related receptor (ERR), and retinoid X receptor (RXR), as well as in genes involved in the stress response, such as lisp70 and hsp90. Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that BPA induced a significant increase in the mRNA levels of ER, ERR, and RXR, suggesting that these receptors could be involved in similar pathways or regulation events in the endocrine disruptor activity of this chemical at the molecular level in Gastropoda. Additionally, the hsp70 expression was upregulated after 5 and 72 h of BPA exposures, but hsp90 was only upregulated after 5 h of BPA exposure. Finally, we assessed the glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity after BPA treatment and found that it was affected after 48 h. In conclusion, these data provide, for the first time, evidences of molecular effects produced by BPA in the endocrine system of Gastropoda, supporting the potential of ER, ERR and RXR as biomarkers to analyse putative EDCs in ecotoxicological studies. Moreover, our results suggest that P. acuta is an appropriate sentinel organism to evaluate the effect of EDCs in the freshwater environment.

TI  - Remote sensing analysis of vegetation at the San Carlos Apache Reservation, Arizona and surrounding area
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping of vegetation types is of great importance to the San Carlos Apache Tribe and their management of forestry and fire fuels. Various remote sensing techniques were applied to classify multitemporal Landsat 8 satellite data, vegetation index, and digital elevation model data. A multitiered unsupervised classification generated over 900 classes that were then recoded to one of the 16 generalized vegetation/land cover classes using the Southwest Regional Gap Analysis Project (SWReGAP) map as a guide. A supervised classification was also run using field data collected in the SWReGAP project and our field campaign. Field data were gathered and accuracy assessments were generated to compare outputs. Our hypothesis was that a resulting map would update and potentially improve upon the vegetation/land cover class distributions of the older SWReGAP map over the 24,000 km(2) study area. The estimated overall accuracies ranged between 43% and 75%, depending on which method and field dataset were used. The findings demonstrate the complexity of vegetation mapping, the importance of recent, high-quality-field data, and the potential for misleading results when insufficient field data are collected.

TI  - <i>Leishmania</i> in wolves in northern Spain: A spreading zoonosis evidenced by wildlife sanitary surveillance
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - ESCCAP Vector-Borne Diseases (VBD) Symposium
CL  - Granada, SPAIN
AB  - Leishmaniosis is, to date, considered the second most important emerging vector-borne protozoal disease in the world after malaria. The form of zoonotic visceral leishmaniosis found in the Mediterranean basin is caused by Leishmania infantum, and its life cycle includes the domestic dog and a phlebotomine sandfly vector. This complex epidemiological cycle and its high prevalence of subclinical infection, hinder the surveillance and control of L. infantum, and allows it to go unnoticed at the geographical endemicity limits of the parasite or in recently colonized areas. We, therefore, tested 102 wolves (Canis lupus) and 47 other wild carnivores in order to detect Leishmania DNA by means of PCR. Samples were collected from 2008 to 2014 in Asturias (northern Spain), a region considered non-endemic for the parasite. The results obtained provided valuable information regarding the prevalence of Leishmania in wild carnivores in Asturias and its geographic distribution in the region: an average prevalence of 33% for wolves and an overall prevalence of 40% for all the wild carnivores studied were reported, with a widespread presence of the parasite in the region and an apparent increase in its prevalence in wolves during the last decade. This suggests the usefulness of the wolf as a sentinel species for the detection and study of Leishmania in the field and confirms the value of wildlife sanitary surveillance programs for the detection and monitoring of hitherto disregarded diseases that affect domestic animals and humans.

TI  - Mars analog minerals' spectral reflectance characteristics under Martian surface conditions
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated the spectral reflectance properties of minerals under a simulated Martian environment. Twenty-eight different hydrated or hydroxylated phases of carbonates, sulfates, and silica minerals were selected based on past detection on Mars through spectral remote sensing data. Samples were ground and dry sieved to <45 mu m grain size and characterized by XRD before and after 133 days inside a simulated Martian surface environment (pressure 5Torr and CO2 fed). Reflectance spectra from 0.35 to 4 mu m were taken periodically through a sapphire (0.35-2.5 mu m) and zinc selenide (2.5-4 mu m) window over a 133-day period. Mineral stability on the Martian surface was assessed through changes in spectral characteristics. Results indicate that the hydrated carbonates studied would be stable on the surface of Mars, only losing adsorbed H2O while maintaining their diagnostic spectral features. Sulfates were less stable, often with shifts in the band position of the SO, Fe, and OH absorption features. Silicas displayed spectral shifts related to SiOH and hydration state of the mineral surface, while diagnostic bands for quartz were stable. Previous detection of carbonate minerals based on 2.3-2.5 mu m and 3.4-3.9 mu m features appears to be consistent with our results. Sulfate mineral detection is more questionable since there can be shifts in band position related to SO4. The loss of the 0.43 mu m Fe3+ band in many of the sulfates indicate that there are fewer potential candidates for Feat sulfates to permanently exist on the Martian surface based on this band. The gypsum sample changed phase to basanite during desiccation as demonstrated by both reflectance and XRD. Silica on Mars has been detected using band depth ratio at 1.91 and 1.96 mu m and band minimum position of the 1.4 mu m feature, and the properties are also used to determine their age. This technique continues to be useful for positive silica identifications, however, silica age appears to be less consistent with our laboratory data. These results will be useful in spectral libraries for characterizing Martian remote sensed data. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Apollo peak-ring impact basin: Insights into the structure and evolution of the South Pole-Aitken basin
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 492 km-diameter Apollo impact basin post-dates, and is located at the inner edge of, the similar to 2240 km diameter South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, providing an opportunity to assess the SPA substructure and lateral heterogeneity. Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory gravity data suggest an average crustal thickness on the floor of SPA of similar to 20 km and within the Apollo basin of similar to 5 km, yet remote sensing data reveal no conclusive evidence for the presence of exposed mantle material. We use the iSALE shock physics code to model the formation of the Apollo basin and find that the observational data are best fit by the impact of a 40 km diameter body traveling at 15 km/s into 20-40 km thick crustal material. These results strongly suggest that the Apollo impact occurred on ejecta deposits and collapsed crustal material of the SPA basin and could help place constraints on the location, size and geometry of the SPA transient cavity. The peak ring in the interior of Apollo basin is plausibly interpreted to be composed of inwardly collapsed lower crustal material that experienced peak shock pressures in excess of 35 GPa, consistent with remote sensing observations that suggest shocked plagioclase. Proposed robotic and/or human missions to SPA and Apollo would present an excellent opportunity to test the predictions of this work and address many scientific questions about SPA basin evolution and structure.

TI  - Transcriptomic responses of the freshwater snail (&ITParafossarulus striatulus&IT) following dietary exposure to cyanobacteria
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater snails are promising bioindicators that can be used in ecotoxicological testing and ecological risk assessments. To screen molecular responses following mollusk exposure to algal blooms, whole transcriptome sequencing was performed with the freshwater snail (Parafossarulus striatulus) fed with blue algae (Microcystis aeruginosa). A total of 86,848 unigenes were assembled, and 10,413 unigenes were annotated in the TrEMBL, Pfam, KEGG, and SwissProt databases. In snails fed with both green and blue algae, a total of 276 differentially expressed unigenes were identified, though there were limited differences in snails fed with only green algae. In addition, ten randomly selected differentially expressed unigenes were analyzed in snails collected from Taihu Lake, China. The expression of four unigenes exhibited a trend consistent with that observed in transcriptome profiling of laboratory snails. The results of this study provide an invaluable resource for enhancing our understanding of ecotoxicology following the occurrence of algal blooms in lakes. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of small-scale patchiness of alpine grassland on ecosystem carbon and nitrogen accumulation and estimation in northeastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-scale patchiness intensified the spatial heterogeneous distribution of soil and vegetation organic carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N), thereby inducing large uncertainty in estimating ecosystem C and N stocks. However, patchiness at this scale was difficult to identify by satellite remote sensing and measure in situ. Aerial photographing can provide high-precision images and can potentially improve estimating accuracy in ecosystem C and N stocks. In this study, using combined methods of field sampling, aerial photographing and satellite images, we investigated the characteristics of patchiness, quantified ecosystem C and N stocks in different patches at plot scale (similar to 1000 m(2)) and eventually estimated the uncertainty in ecosystem C and N stocks caused by small-scale patchiness at basin scale. Results showed that: 1) mosaic of vegetation and bald patches coexisted for swamp meadow and alpine meadow, whereas vegetation presented as spot for steppe meadow and alpine steppe; 2) average ecosystem respiration, C and N stocks in intact grassland patches were 2.05 and 1.65, 1.66 and 1.65, 2.01 and 1.69 times higher than those of large and medium bare patches (P < 0.05); and 3) neglecting the bare patches caused approximate 30%, 15% and 10% overestimation in estimations of ecosystem C emission, C and N stocks. We concluded that small-scale patchiness would result in ecosystem C loss due to decreasing in C input from vegetation and increasing in C output from soil erosion. Our study suggested that integration of field sampling, aerial photographing and satellite images could improve precision in estimation of ecosystem C emission, C and N stocks at basin scale.

TI  - Impact of the biomass burning on methane variability during dry years in the Amazon measured from an aircraft and the AIRS sensor
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study examines the spatiotemporal variability and interrelations of the atmospheric methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO) and biomass burning (BB) outbreaks retrieved from satellite data over the Amazon region during the 2003-2012 period. In the climatological context, we found consistent seasonal cycles of BB outbreaks and CO in the Amazon, both variables showing a peak during the dry season. The dominant CO variability mode features the largest positive loadings in the southern Amazon, and describes the interannual CO variations related to BB outbreaks along the deforestation arc during the dry season. In line with CO variability and BB outbreaks, the results show strong correspondence with the spatiotemporal variability of CH4 in the southern Amazon during years of intense drought. Indeed, the areas with the largest positive CH4 anomalies in southern Amazon overlap the areas with high BB outbreaks and positive CO anomalies. The analyses also showed that high (low) BB outbreaks in the southern Amazon occur during dry (wet) years. In consequence, the interannual climate variability modulates the BB outbreaks in the southern Amazon, which in turn have considerable impacts on CO and CH4 interannual variability in the region. Therefore, the BB outbreaks might play a major role in modulating the CH4 and CO variations, at least in the southern Amazon. This study also provides a comparison between the estimate of satellite and aircraft measurements for the CH4 over the southern Amazon, which indicates relatively small differences from the aircraft measurements in the lower troposphere, with errors ranging from 0.18% to 1.76%.

TI  - Landsat phenological metrics and their relation to aboveground carbon in the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The quantification and spatially explicit mapping of carbon stocks in terrestrial ecosystems is important to better understand the global carbon cycle and to monitor and report change processes, especially in the context of international policy mechanisms such as REDD+ or the implementation of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Especially in heterogeneous ecosystems, such as Savannas, accurate carbon quantifications are still lacking, where highly variable vegetation densities occur and a strong seasonality hinders consistent data acquisition. In order to account for these challenges we analyzed the potential of land surface phenological metrics derived from gap-filled 8-day Landsat time series for carbon mapping. We selected three areas located in different subregions in the central Brazil region, which is a prominent example of a Savanna with significant carbon stocks that has been undergoing extensive land cover conversions. Here phenological metrics from the season 2014/2015 were combined with aboveground carbon field samples of cerrado sensu stricto vegetation using Random Forest regression models to map the regional carbon distribution and to analyze the relation between phenological metrics and aboveground carbon.Results: The gap filling approach enabled to accurately approximate the original Landsat ETM+ and OLI EVI values and the subsequent derivation of annual phenological metrics. Random Forest model performances varied between the three study areas with RMSE values of 1.64 t/ha (mean relative RMSE 30%), 2.35 t/ha (46%) and 2.18 t/ha (45%). Comparable relationships between remote sensing based land surface phenological metrics and aboveground carbon were observed in all study areas. Aboveground carbon distributions could be mapped and revealed comprehensible spatial patterns.Conclusion: Phenological metrics were derived from 8-day Landsat time series with a spatial resolution that is sufficient to capture gradual changes in carbon stocks of heterogeneous Savanna ecosystems. These metrics revealed the relationship between aboveground carbon and the phenology of the observed vegetation. Our results suggest that metrics relating to the seasonal minimum and maximum values were the most influential variables and bear potential to improve spatially explicit mapping approaches in heterogeneous ecosystems, where both spatial and temporal resolutions are critical.

TI  - <i>Bradyrhizobium japonicum</i> USDA110: A representative model organism for studying the impact of pollutants on soil microbiota
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Photobacteria phosoreum or Escherichia coli are widely used in the scientific, industrial, and regulatory industries for evaluating the toxicity of pollutants against the soil microbial community. The organisms, however, are not part of the soil microbiota and the toxicity data obtained using these organisms could be misleading. Analysis of microbiota present in the soil obtained from across the world indicates that organisms from the Bradyrhizobium genus are the most ubiquitous of all microorganisms. Playing a critical role in nitrogen fixation and soil fertility, organisms from this genus should be used for studying the toxicity of pollutants. Indeed, we propose that Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA110 be used as a model organism for screening pollutants for toxicity against a soil microbial community. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - A modern robust approach to remotely estimate chlorophyll in coastal and inland zones
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The chlorophyll concentration of a water body is an important proxy for representing the phytoplankton biomass. Its estimation from multi or hyper-spectral remote sensing data in natural waters is generally achieved by using (i) the waveband ratioing in two or more bands in the blue-green or (ii) by using a combination of the radiance peak position and magnitude in the red-near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. The blue-green ratio algorithms have been extensively used with satellite ocean color data to investigate chlorophyll distributions in open ocean and clear waters and the application of red-NIR algorithms is often restricted to turbid productive water bodies. These issues present the greatest obstacles to our ability to formulate a modern robust method suitable for quantitative assessments of the chlorophyll concentration in a diverse range of water types. The present study is focused to investigate the normalized water-leaving radiance spectra in the visible and NIR region and propose a robust algorithm (Generalized ABI, GABI algorithm) for chlorophyll concentration retrieval based on Algal Bloom index (ABI) which separates phytoplankton signals from other constituents in the water column. The GABI algorithm is validated using independent in-situ data from various regional to global waters and its performance is further evaluated by comparison with the blue-green waveband ratios and red-NIR algorithms. The results revealed that GABI yields significantly more accurate chlorophyll concentrations (with uncertainties less than 13.5%) and remains more stable in different waters types when compared with the blue-green waveband ratios and red-NIR algorithms. The performance of GABI is further demonstrated using HICO images from nearshore turbid productive waters and MERIS and MODIS-Aqua images from coastal and offshore waters of the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal and East China Sea.

TI  - Spatiotemporal impact of land use/land cover changes on urban heat islands: A case study of Paco do Lumiar, Brazil
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization in Paco do Lumiar County has had a remarkable effect on the urban thermal environment and influenced the local climate, environment, and quality of life of residents. The intensity and accelerated growth of urban heat islands (UHI) were investigated, and changes in land use/land cover (LULC) were detected over 16 years based on multi-temporal Landsat TM satellite data. TM/Landsat images and OLI/Landsat images were used to assess the thermal characteristics of urban areas and the relationship between LULC changes and land surface temperature. The results of the multi-temporal analysis of the land surface and acquired monitoring data were used to evaluate the influences of vegetation cover and fragmentation on the urban environment. The results indicate that the city experienced extensive urban growth during the study period. UHIs fluctuated in the city, with the largest observed in the 2014 image. The UHI intensity and spatial distribution were higher and more dominant in urban zones compared to those in other areas of the city. Many areas experienced extensive urbanization over the 16-year study period, which resulted in the loss of green spaces and increased UHI effects.

TI  - Advantages of Measuring the <i>Q</i> Stokes Parameter in Addition to the Total Radiance / in the Detection of Absorbing Aerosols
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A simple but novel study was conducted to investigate whether an imager-type spectroradiometer instrument like MODIS, currently flying on board the Aqua and Terra satellites, or MERIS, which flew on board Envisat, could detect absorbing aerosols if they could measure the Q Stokes parameter in addition to the total radiance I, that is if they could also measure the linear polarization of the light. Accurate radiative transfer calculations were used to train a fast neural network forward model, which together with a simple statistical optimal estimation scheme was used to retrieve three aerosol parameters: aerosol optical depth at 869 nm, optical depth fraction of fine mode (absorbing) aerosols at 869 nm, and aerosol vertical location. The aerosols were assumed to be bimodal, each with a lognormal size distribution, located either between 0 and 2 km or between 2 and 4 km in the Earth's atmosphere. From simulated data with 3% random Gaussian measurement noise added for each Stokes parameter, it was found that by itself the total radiance I at the nine MODIS VIS channels was generally insufficient to accurately retrieve all three aerosol parameters (similar to 15-37% successful), but that together with the Q Stokes component it was possible to retrieve values of aerosol optical depth at 869 nm to +/- 0.03, single-scattering albedo at 869 nm to +/- 0.04, and vertical location in similar to 65% of the cases. This proof-of-concept retrieval algorithm uses neural networks to overcome the computational burdens of using vector radiative transfer to accurately simulate top-of-atmosphere (TOA) total and polarized radiances, enabling optimal estimation techniques to exploit information from multiple channels. Therefore such an algorithm could, in concept, be readily implemented for operational retrieval of aerosol and ocean products from moderate or hyperspectral spectroradiometers.

TI  - Assessment of 1D and 3D model simulated radiation flux based on surface measurements and estimation of aerosol forcing and their climatological aspects
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground reaching solar radiation flux was simulated using a 1-dimensional radiative transfer (SBDART) and a 3-dimensional regional climate (RegCM 4.4) model and their seasonality against simultaneous surface measurements carried out using a CNR4 net Radiometer over a sub-Himalayan foothill site of south-east Asia was assessed for the period from March 2013-January 2015. The model simulated incoming fluxes showed a very good correlation with the measured values with correlation coefficient R-2 similar to 0.97. The mean bias errors between these two varied from -40 W m(-2) to +7 W m(-2) with an overestimation of 2-3% by SBDART and an underestimation of 2-9% by RegCM. Collocated measurements of the optical parameters of aerosols indicated a reduction in atmospheric transmission path by similar to 20% due to aerosol load in the atmosphere when compared with the aerosol free atmospheric condition. Estimation of aerosol radiative forcing efficiency (ARFE) indicated that the presence of black carbon (BC, 10-15%) led to a surface dimming by -26.14 W m(-2) tau(-1) and a potential atmospheric forcing of + 43.04 W m(-2) tau(-1). BC alone is responsible for > 70% influence with a major role in building up of forcing efficiency of + 55.69 W m(-2) tau(-1) (composite) in the atmosphere. On the other hand, the scattering due to aerosols enhance the outgoing radiation at the top of the atmosphere (ARFE(TOA) similar to -12.60 W m(-2) omega(-1)), the absence of which would have resulted in ARFE(TOA) of similar to+16.91 W m(-2) tau(-1) (due to BC alone). As a result, similar to 3/4 of the radiation absorption in the atmosphere is ascribed to the presence of BC. This translated to an atmospheric heating rate of similar to 1.0 K day(-1), with similar to 0.3 K day(-1) heating over the elevated regions (2-4 km) of the atmosphere, especially during pre-monsoon season. Comparison of the satellite (MODIS) derived and ground based estimates of surface albedo showed seasonal difference in their magnitudes (R-2 similar to 0.98 during retreating monsoon and winter; similar to 0.65 during pre-monsoon and monsoon), indicating that the reliability of the satellite data for aerosol radiative forcing estimation is more during the retreating and winter seasons.

TI  - Three-dimensional information extraction from GaoFen-1 satellite images for landslide monitoring
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To more efficiently use GaoFen-1 (GF-1) satellite images for landslide emergency monitoring, a Digital Surface Model (DSM) can be generated from GF-1 across-track stereo image pairs to build a terrain dataset. This study proposes a landslide 3D information extraction method based on the terrain changes of slope objects. The slope objects are mergences of segmented image objects which have similar aspects; and the terrain changes are calculated from the post-disaster Digital Elevation Model (DEM) from GF-1 and the pre-disaster DEM from GDEM V2. A high mountain landslide that occurred in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province is used to conduct a 3D information extraction test. The extracted total area of the landslide is 22.58 ha; the displaced earth volume is 652,100 m(3); and the average sliding direction is 263.83 degrees. The accuracies of them are 0.89, 0.87 and 0.95, respectively. Thus, the proposed method expands the application of GF-1 satellite images to the field of landslide emergency monitoring.

TI  - Predicting effect of forthcoming population growth-induced impervious surface increase on regional thermal environment: Xiong'an New Area, North China
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Xiong'an New Area is a state-level new area to be established in the Baoding area of Hebei province, North China. The planning population growth goal for the area is going to reach 2.5 million and the area is planned to expand to 2000 km(2). The potential population growth and area expansion will result in massive increase in impervious surface (IS) dominated built land and thus may impact the area's thermal environment. Therefore, based on current land cover types and thermal environment status in the area, this study developed a statistical model to predict thermal effects responding to the forthcoming population and associated IS increase in the new area using remote sensing technology. This was achieved by relating population growth to IS area increase, exploring the relationships among population, land cover, and land surface temperature (LST), and developing a metric for estimating a balance amount of total IS area to be expanded. The prediction shows that IS has a noteworthy effect on regional thermal environment. The variation in the proportions of the IS in the new area can result in a significant shift of LST. A balance amount of total IS area in the 2000 km(2) new area is 433 km(2). Exceeding/reducing the amount would result in a rise/decline of the area's LST. Introducing a quantity of IS area-related population density (IPD) reveals that the area's LST is closely related to IPD when the total area and future population of the new area are given.

TI  - Detection of Pb-Zn mineralization zones in west Kunlun using Landsat 8 and ASTER remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The integration of Landsat 8 OLI and ASTER data is an efficient tool for interpreting lead-zinc mineralization in the Huoshaoyun Pb-Zn mining region located in the west Kunlun mountains at high altitude and very rugged terrain, where traditional geological work becomes limited and time-consuming. This task was accomplished by using band ratios (BRs), principal component analysis, and spectral matched filtering methods. It is concluded that some BR color composites and principal components of each imagery contain useful information for lithological mapping. SMF technique is useful for detecting lead-zinc mineralization zones, and the results could be verified by handheld portable X-ray fluorescence analysis. Therefore, the proposed methodology shows strong potential of Landsat 8 OLI and ASTER data in lithological mapping and lead-zinc mineralization zone extraction in carbonate stratum. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Spatial-temporal evolution of the eastern Nanhui mudflat in the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary under intensified human activities
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Nanhui mudflat (ENM), located in the southern flank of the Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary, plays a key role in storm protection, defense against sea level rise, and land resource provision for Shanghai, China's largest city. Recently, there has been a great deal of concern for its evolutionary fate, since a drastic reduction in the Changjiang sediment discharge rate and an increased number of estuarine enclosures might negatively impact the environmental protection functions that this mudflat provides. In this paper, a novel method, which employed the envelope lines of instantaneous shoreline positions identified in 436 Landsat satellite images from 1975 to 2016, was used to demonstrate the evolution of the mudflat high and low tide lines in a detailed, quantitative way. Our study reveals the southeast progradation rate of the mudflat doubled from 24 m/yr in 713-1974 CE to 49 m/yr in 1975-1995 CE, probably due to the influence of the estuarine turbidity maximum zone shifting to the ENM. Under the ample sediment input directly from the turbidity maximum zone, the spatial evolution of the ENM was governed predominantly by the changing morphology of the South Passage due to the quick progradation of the ENM, which narrowed the South Passage by pushing the South Passage Trumpet southeastward. Therefore, the ENM experienced rapid accretion during 1975-2016. The accretion rate of the high tide line increased 2-13 times due to vegetation and intertidal enclosures, resulting in the rapid reduction of the intertidal area. The area decreased from 97 km(2) in 1976 to 66 km(2) in 1995, mainly due to vegetation, and continued decreasing to 12 km(2) in 2006 due to the intertidal enclosures. In contrast, the accretion rate of the low tide line increased by 25 times due to subtidal enclosures and caused the intertidal area increased to 78 km(2) in 2015. The almost disappeared intertidal zones in 2006 reappeared. However, this reappearance might be a temporary transitional state, and once the subtidal enclosures are completed, most of the intertidal zones will be replaced by enclosure land. Our study reveals that the drastic reduction in the Changjiang sediment flow to the sea has not caused a decline in the ENM. In contrast, the ENM has experienced rapid accretion in the past 40 years, resulting in the strengthening of its functional abilities to protect Shanghai, an unexpected outcome.

TI  - Comparison of three ice cloud optical schemes in climate simulations with community atmospheric model version 5
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A newly implemented Baum-Yang scheme for simulating ice cloud optical properties is compared with existing schemes (Mitchell and Fu schemes) in a standalone radiative transfer model and in the global climate model (GCM) Community Atmospheric Model Version 5 (CAMS). This study systematically analyzes the effect of different ice cloud optical schemes on global radiation and climate by a series of simulations with a simplified standalone radiative transfer model, atmospheric GCM CAMS, and a comprehensive coupled climate model. Results from the standalone radiative model show that Baum-Yang scheme yields generally weaker effects of ice cloud on temperature profiles both in shortwave and longwave spectrum. CAMS simulations indicate that Baum-Yang scheme in place of Mitchell/Fu scheme tends to cool the upper atmosphere and strengthen the thermodynamic instability in low- and mid-latitudes, which could intensify the Hadley circulation and dehydrate the subtropics. When CAM5 is coupled with a slab ocean model to include simplified air-sea interaction, reduced downward longwave flux to surface in Baum-Yang scheme mitigates ice-albedo feedback in the Arctic as well as water vapor and cloud feedbacks in low- and mid-latitudes, resulting in an overall temperature decrease by 3.0/1.4 degrees C globally compared with Mitchell/Fu schemes. Radiative effect and climate feedback of the three ice cloud optical schemes documented in this study can be referred for future improvements on ice cloud simulation in CAM5.

TI  - Method to design a live coral cover sensitive index for multispectral satellite images
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Live coral cover (LCC) is regarded as the most efficient indicator of coral reef health. However, LCCs are usually sampled with standardized transect or photo quadrat techniques in field, which are incomplete and labour-intensive. To overcome such difficulties, we study a model to transfer the pixels of multispectral satellite images to quantitative LCCs. The idea is to extend band ratio-based (BR) indices to a novel index constructed using the ratio of different linear combinations (RDLC) of band reflectance and water depths. On the basis of field surveyed LCCs, an empirical process is further proposed to solve the unknown parameters of this RDLC. This approach provides new thinking for designing LCC-sensitive indices for given multispectral satellite images. The experimental results on Weizhou Island and Palmyra Atoll demonstrate that the method is effective and feasible, where the mean relative errors (MREs) arc improved from 45 to 56% for BRs to 23-29% for RDLCs for Weizhou Island.

TI  - Long-Term Changes in Forest Cover in Central Veracruz, Mexico (1993-2014)
T2  - TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and fragmentation are threats to the conservation of species and have consequences for ecosystem functions. The focus of this study was to elucidate forest cover change in the period of 1993 to 2014. Our study area is in the central region of Veracruz, Mexico. Land cover and land use classes for the Years 1993, 2000, and 2014 were derived from Landsat images applying supervised classification. Then, we quantified the net change in forest area, the loss of original forest area, and evaluated forest fragmentation using landscape metrics. Our results showed that the area covered by remnant forests decreased 57%. The annual net forest cover change rate for 1993 to 2000 was -0.44%; since then forest cover increased at a rate of 0.11% from 2000 to 2014. The decreasing total edge density and the mean proximity index during the entire period of the study indicate decreasing irregularity in the shape of remnant forest patches and a slight decrease of vulnerability to edge effects. Forest patches augmented in 2000 and decreased in 2014 demonstrating an 18% decrease in relation to the number of fragments existing in 1993. According to our study, this area demands an urgent attention on preservation initiatives because only 2% of the surface extent is below federal protection and 0.8% is under State protection. It is important to protect the larger forest areas left in the pine-oak and humid montane forest belt because of their importance to plant diversity conservation and particularly, as these are threatened by urban and agricultural expansion.

TI  - Detecting treeline dynamics in response to climate warming using forest stand maps and Landsat data in a temperate forest
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Treeline dynamics have inevitable impacts on the forest treeline structure and composition. The present research sought to estimate treeline movement and structural shifts in response to recent warming in Cehennemdere, Turkey. After implementing an atmospheric correction, the geo-shifting of images was performed to match images together for a per pixel trend analysis. We developed a new approach based on the NDVI, LST (land surface temperature) data, air temperature data, and forest stand maps for a 43-year period. The forest treeline border was mapped on the forest stand maps for 1970, 1992, 2002, and 2013 to identify shifts in the treeline altitudes, and then profile statistics were calculated for each period. Twenty sample plots (10 x 10 pixels) were selected to estimate the NDVI and LST shifts across the forest timberline using per-pixel trend analysis and non-parametric Spearman's correlation analysis. In addition, the spatial and temporal shifts in treeline tree species were computed within the selected plots for four time periods on the forest stand maps to determine the pioneer tree species.Results: A statistically significant increasing trend in all climate variables was observed, with the highest slope in the monthly average mean July temperature (tau = 0.62, rho < 0.00). The resultant forest stand maps showed a geographical expansion of the treeline in both the highest altitudes (22 m-45 m) and the lowest altitudes (20 m-105 m) from 1970 to 2013. The per pixel trend analysis indicated an increasing trend in the NDVI and LST values within the selected plots. Moreover, increases in the LST were highly correlated with increases in the NDVI between 1984 and 2017 (r = 0.75, rho < 0.05). Cedrus libani and Juniperus communis spp. were two pioneer tree species that expanded and grew consistently on open lands, primarily on rocks and soil-covered areas, from 1970 to 2013.Conclusion: The present study illustrated that forest treeline dynamics and treeline structural changes can be detected using two data sources. Additionally, the results will have a significant contribution to and implication for treeline movement studies and forest landscape change investigations attempting to project climate change impacts on tree species in response to climate warming. The results will assist forest managers in establishing some developmental adaptation strategies for forest treeline ecotones.

TI  - Slope three-layer scattering model for forest height estimation over mountain forest areas from L-band single-baseline PolInSAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A slope three-layer scattering model (STSM) for retrieving forest height in mountain forest region using L-band polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PolInSAR) data is proposed in this paper. The proposed model separates the vertical structure of forest into three layers: canopy, tree trunk, and ground layer, which account for the effect of topography for forest height calculation in a sloping forest area. Compared to the conventional two-layer random volume over ground model, the STSM improves substantial for modeling of actual mountain forest, allowing better understanding of microwave scattering process in sloping forest area. The STSM not only enables the accuracy improvement of the forest height estimation in sloping forest area but also provides the potential to isolate more accurately the direct scattering, double-bounce ground trunk interaction, and volume contribution, which usually cannot be achieved in the previous forest height estimation methods. The STSM performance is evaluated with simulated data from PolSARProSim software and ALOS/PALSAR L-band spaceborne PolInSAR data over the Kalimantan areas, Indonesia. The experimental results indicate that forest height could be effectively extracted by the proposed STSM. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

TI  - Challenging local realism with human choices
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - A Bell test is a randomized trial that compares experimental observations against the philosophical worldview of local realism(1), in which the properties of the physical world are independent of our observation of them and no signal travels faster than light. A Bell test requires spatially distributed entanglement, fast and high-efficiency detection and unpredictable measurement settings(2,3). Although technology can satisfy the first two of these requirements(4-7), the use of physical devices to choose settings in a Bell test involves making assumptions about the physics that one aims to test. Bell himself noted this weakness in using physical setting choices and argued that human 'free will' could be used rigorously to ensure unpredictability in Bell tests(8). Here we report a set of local-realism tests using human choices, which avoids assumptions about predictability in physics. We recruited about 100,000 human participants to play an online video game that incentivizes fast, sustained input of unpredictable selections and illustrates Bell-test methodology(9). The participants generated 97,347,490 binary choices, which were directed via a scalable web platform to 12 laboratories on five continents, where 13 experiments tested local realism using photons(5,6), single atoms(7), atomic ensembles(10) and superconducting devices(11). Over a 12-hour period on 30 November 2016, participants worldwide provided a sustained data flow of over 1,000 bits per second to the experiments, which used different human-generated data to choose each measurement setting. The observed correlations strongly contradict local realism and other realistic positions in bipartite and tripartite(12) scenarios. Project outcomes include closing the 'freedom-of-choice loophole' (the possibility that the setting choices are influenced by 'hidden variables' to correlate with the particle properties(13)), the utilization of video-game methods(14) for rapid collection of human-generated randomness, and the use of networking techniques for global participation in experimental science.

AB  - Nam Co (Heavenly Lake) not only responds sensitively to climate change, but also exerts significant influences on climate change. Previous studies revealed that the lake effects from the North American Great Lakes shown interaction with climate changes. However, the lakes effect of more than 1200 lakes with an area of 47,000 km(2) on the Tibetan Plateau remains less studied. In this study, we analyzed the spatial distribution of precipitation in the Nam Co Basin during July-August and November-December to clarify the lake effect. We found that the lake cooling effect during July-August and lake heating effect during November-December resulted in the spatial differences of precipitation within the Nam Co Basin. These effects generally caused more precipitation in the south than in the north during July-August, and more precipitation in the east than in the west during November-December. Weakening Indian monsoon and climate warming led to an increased north-south precipitation difference in the Nam Co Basin. However, the precipitation differences between the west and east during November-December decreased with climate warming. The intensification of the westerly might be responsible for the particular phenomenon. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI  - Glacier variations in response to climate change in the eastern Nyainqentanglha Range, Tibetan Plateau from 1999 to 2015
T2  - ARCTIC ANTARCTIC AND ALPINE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in glaciers in response to climate change in the eastern Nyainqentanglha Range were studied using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI. The entire mountain range contained approximately 6,426 glaciers, covering an area of 6508.03 +/- 252.02 km(2) in 1999. The glaciers shrank from 1999 to 2015 and the total ice cover was reduced by 1285.99 +/- 6.01 km(2), accounting for 19.76 +/- 3.78% of the glacierized area in 1999. The mean loss of glacier area was 1.24%.a(-1) during 1999-2015. The analysis of meteorological data showed a remarkable pattern in mean annual air temperature (especially after 1998), whereas the annual precipitation displayed a stable pattern from 1989 to 2011. The glacier shrinkage in the region can probably be attributed to the increase in air temperature. The largest glaciers in the area show a maximum elevation of about 5,200-5,400 m a.s.l. in 1990, 2013, and 2015. The altitude of glaciers varied from 4,000 m a.s.l. to 6,000 m a.s.l. and the majority of the glaciers were distributed between 4,800 m and 5,800 m. All glaciers, regardless of their orientation, have shrunk, but glaciers mainly south-facing retreated faster than those facing others directions.

TI  - Monitoring river ice cover development using the Freeman-Durden decomposition of quad-pol Radarsat-2 images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring of river ice development is a crucial guidance indicator to establish safe crossings along river ice covers. This is the first study, based on our knowledge, to understand the interactions between river ice cover structures and radar signals and to further monitor ice development using C-band synthetic aperture radar images. The study was applied to the Slave River, Canada, using the Freeman-Durden decomposition of quad-pol C-band Radarsat-2 FQ14W images and ice core crystallography analysis. Results demonstrate that the combination of volume and surface scattering can be used to monitor ice cover development that cannot be interpreted from single polarization images, such as Radarsat-2 spotlight images used in this study. These results indicate that the decomposed quad-pol Radarsat-2 images can provide a more effective guide than the single-pol Radarsat-2 SLA images to select safe ice transportation routes. This decomposition approach can be extended to other snow and ice covered rivers. (C) 2018 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Factors of runoff generation in the Dongting Lake basin based on a SWAT model and implications of recent land cover change
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Sino-German Symposium on Lake-Catchment Interactions and their Responses to Hydrological Extremes
CL  - Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The Dongting Lake basin in China has been changed substantially by human activity. Environmental issues like land reclamation, land cover change, flood and droughts and the effects of climate change call for a deep understanding of the hydrological system to enable stakeholders to plan mitigation and adaptation strategies. For this study a SWAT model of the watershed was created and calibrated to the runoff of the four main tributaries. The simulated reaction of the computational units (HRU) to rainfall was then linked to the physical attributes that defined the respective HRU to find the main effects of runoff generation. The results showed that surface runoff and Evapotranspiration are mainly determined by land cover under the same rainfall conditions, while interflow and ground water flow also depend on slope angle. Soil effects were minor due to the utilized soil data. Recent land cover change as detected from Landsat scenes of the years 2000 and 2013 has brought an increase in the forested area in the Dongting basin, especially on higher slope inclinations. This increase led to an increase in interflow and ground water flow, slowing down the overall response of the basin to rainfall. This balances the discharge between periods with high and low rainfall and helps to mitigate flood and drought severity. Cross effects between the factors, the size of the research area and the quality of input data were limiting factors of the used method. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.

TI  - Decadal surface temperature trends in India based on a new high-resolution data set
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A new comprehensive surface temperature data set for India is used to document changes in Indian temperature over seven decades, in order to examine the patterns and possible effects of global warming. The data set is subdivided into pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon categories in order to study the temperature patterns in each of these periods. When the decade means in maximum, minimum and daily mean temperature for the 2000s are compared to those of the 1950s, a consistent pattern of warming is found over northwestern and southern India, and a pattern of cooling is seen in a broad zone anchored over northeastern India and extending southwestward across central India. These patterns are explained by the presence of a large region of anthropogenic brown haze over India and adjacent ocean regions. These aerosols absorb solar radiation, leading to warming of the haze layer over northeastern and central India and to cooling of the surface air beneath. The heated air rises and then sinks to the north and south of the haze region over northwestern and southern India, warming the air by compression as it sinks in those regions. The possible impact of these temperature patterns on Indian agriculture is considered.

TI  - Observing vegetation phenology through social media
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The widespread use of social media has created a valuable but underused source of data for the environmental sciences. We demonstrate the potential for images posted to the website Twitter to capture variability in vegetation phenology across United States National Parks. We process a subset of images posted to Twitter within eight U.S. National Parks, with the aim of understanding the amount of green vegetation in each image. Analysis of the relative greenness of the images show statistically significant seasonal cycles across most National Parks at the 95% confidence level, consistent with springtime green-up and fall senescence. Additionally, these social media-derived greenness indices correlate with monthly mean satellite NDVI (r = 0.62), reinforcing the potential value these data could provide in constraining models and observing regions with limited high quality scientific monitoring.

CP  - Sino-German Symposium on Lake-Catchment Interactions and their Responses to Hydrological Extremes
CL  - Nanjing, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - The Erdos Larus Relictus National Nature Reserve is the only internationally important lake wetland for the protection of the Larus Relictus and its breeding habitat. With Bojiang Lake shrinkage in the reserve in the last decade, the breeding ground had been seriously endangered. In order to investigate the dynamic changes and driving forces of the lake area, this paper studied the changes of the lake area from 1973 to 2013 using the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index from the Landsat remote sensing data, and then analyzed the relations between the lake area and the basin precipitation, temperature and vegetation by cumulative departure from the mean analysis and correlation analysis. The results suggested that Bojiang Lake area mainly experienced the three periods: the rapidly expanding period (1973-1979), the stable period (1980-1998) and the shrinking period (1999-2013). Bojiang Lake water area ranged from 0 to 13.38 km(2). As the suitable breeding habitat for Larus Relictus, the lake area should be in the range of 5.49-11.31 km(2). In the corresponding three periods, precipitation, temperature and vegetation changes had the different characteristics, and the correlations between lake area and precipitation, temperature and vegetation had obvious differences. Precipitation changes were the main factor of Bojiang Lake area variations in the period of 1973-979 and 1980-1998, while vegetation changes were the main driving forces during 1999-2013. The influences of the other anthropogenic interventions (water consumption, the building of silt-trap dams, etc.) on the lake area variations should be further investigated.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of urban wetland dynamics using high spatial resolution satellite imagery between 2000 and 2013
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely information describing urban wetland resources and their changes over time, especially in rapidly urbanizing areas, is becoming more important. We applied an object-based image analysis and nearest neighbour classifier to map and monitor changes in land use/cover using multitemporal high spatial resolution satellite imagery in an urban wetland area (Hangzhou Xixi Wetland) from 2000, 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2013. The overall eight-class classification accuracies averaged 84.47% for the five years. The maps showed that between 2000 and 2013 the amount of non-wetland (urban) area increased by approximately 100%. Herbaceous (32.22%), forest (29.57%) and pond (23.85%) are the main land-cover types that changed to non-wetland, followed by cropland (6.97%), marsh (4.04%) and river (3.35%). In addition, the maps of change patterns showed that urban wetland loss is mainly distributed west and southeast of the study area due to real estate development, and the greatest loss of urban wetlands occurred from 2007 to 2013. The results demonstrate the advantages of using multitemporal high spatial resolution satellite imagery to provide an accurate, economical means to map and analyse changes in land use/cover over time and the ability to use the results as inputs to urban wetland management and policy decisions.

TI  - SAR-revealed slip partitioning on a bending fault plane for the 2014 Northern Nagano earthquake at the northern Itoigawa-Shizuoka tectonic line
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - By applying conventional cross-track synthetic aperture radar interferometry (InSAR) and multiple aperture InSAR techniques to ALOS-2 data acquired before and after the 2014 Northern Nagano, central Japan, earthquake, a three-dimensional ground displacement field has been successfully mapped. Crustal deformation is concentrated in and around the northern part of the Kamishiro Fault, which is the northernmost section of the Itoigawa-Shizuoka tectonic line. The full picture of the displacement field shows contraction in the northwest-southeast direction, but northeastward movement along the fault strike direction is prevalent in the northeast portion of the fault, which suggests that a strike-slip component is a significant part of the activity of this fault, in addition to a reverse faulting. Clear displacement discontinuities are recognized in the southern part of the source region, which falls just on the previously known Kamishiro Fault trace. We inverted the SAR and GNSS data to construct a slip distribution model; the preferred model of distributed slip on a two-plane fault surface shows a combination of reverse and left-lateral fault motions on a bending east-dipping fault surface with a dip of 30 degrees in the shallow part and 50 degrees in the deeper part. The hypocenter falls just on the estimated deeper fault plane where a left-lateral slip is inferred, whereas in the shallow part, a reverse slip is predominant, which causes surface ruptures on the ground. The slip partitioning may be accounted for by shear stress resulting from a reverse fault slip with left-lateral component at depth, for which a left-lateral slip is suppressed in the shallow part where the reverse slip is inferred. The slip distribution model with a bending fault surface, instead of a single fault plane, produces moment tensor solution with a non-double couple component, which is consistent with the seismically estimated mechanism.

TI  - Spatial variation and linkages of soil and vegetation in the Siberian Arctic tundra - coupling field observations with remote sensing data
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic tundra ecosystems will play a key role in future climate change due to intensifying permafrost thawing, plant growth and ecosystem carbon exchange, but monitoring these changes may be challenging due to the heterogeneity of Arctic landscapes. We examined spatial variation and linkages of soil and plant attributes in a site of Siberian Arctic tundra in Tiksi, northeast Russia, and evaluated possibilities to capture this variation by remote sensing for the benefit of carbon exchange measurements and landscape extrapolation. We distinguished nine land cover types (LCTs) and to characterize them, sampled 92 study plots for plant and soil attributes in 2014. Moreover, to test if variation in plant and soil attributes can be detected using remote sensing, we produced a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and topographical parameters for each study plot using three very high spatial resolution multispectral satellite images. We found that soils ranged from mineral soils in bare soil and lichen tundra LCTs to soils of high percentage of organic matter (OM) in graminoid tundra, bog, dry fen and wet fen. OM content of the top soil was on average 14 g dm(-3) in bare soil and lichen tundra and 89 g dm(-3) in other LCTs. Total moss biomass varied from 0 to 820 gm(-2), total vascular shoot mass from 7 to 112 gm(-2) and vascular leaf area index (LAI) from 0.04 to 0.95 among LCTs. In late summer, soil temperatures at 15 cm depth were on average 14 degrees C in bare soil and lichen tundra, and varied from 5 to 9 degrees C in other LCTs. On average, depth of the biologically active, unfrozen soil layer doubled from early July to mid-August. When contrasted across study plots, moss biomass was positively associated with soil OM % and OM content and negatively associated with soil temperature, explaining 14-34% of variation. Vascular shoot mass and LAI were also positively associated with soil OM content, and LAI with active layer depth, but only explained 6-15% of variation. NDVI captured variation in vascular LAI better than in moss biomass, but while this difference was significant with late season NDVI, it was minimal with early season NDVI. For this reason, soil attributes associated with moss mass were better captured by early season NDVI. Topographic attributes were related to LAI and many soil attributes, but not to moss biomass and could not increase the amount of spatial variation explained in plant and soil attributes above that achieved by NDVI. The LCT map we produced had low to moderate uncertainty in predictions for plant and soil properties except for moss biomass and bare soil and lichen tundra LCTs. Our results illustrate a typical tundra ecosystem with great fine-scale spatial variation in both plant and soil attributes. Mosses dominate plant biomass and control many soil attributes, including OM % and temperature, but variation in moss biomass is difficult to capture by remote sensing reflectance, topography or a LCT map. Despite the general accuracy of landscape level predictions in our LCT approach, this indicates challenges in the spatial extrapolation of some of those vegetation and soil attributes that are relevant for the regional ecosystem and global climate models.

TI  - A Dual Interaction Between the 5′- and 3′-Ends of the Melon Necrotic Spot Virus (MNSV) RNA Genome Is Required for Efficient Cap-Independent Translation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In eukaryotes, the formation of a 5'-cap and 3'-poly(A) dependent protein-protein bridge is required for translation of its mRNAs. In contrast, several plant virus RNA genomes lack both of these mRNA features, but instead have a 3'-CITE (for cap-independent translation enhancer), a RNA element present in their 3'-untranslated region that recruits translation initiation factors and is able to control its cap-independent translation. For several 3'-CITEs, direct RNA-RNA long-distance interactions based on sequence complementarity between the 5'- and 3'-ends are required for efficient translation, as they bring the translation initiation factors bound to the 3'-CITE to the 5'-end. For the carmovirus melon necrotic spot virus (MNSV), a 3'-CITE has been identified, and the presence of its 5'-end in cis has been shown to be required for its activity. Here, we analyze the secondary structure of the 5'-end of the MNSV RNA genome and identify two highly conserved nucleotide sequence stretches that are complementary to the apical loop of its 3'-CITE. In in vivo cap-independent translation assays with mutant constructs, by disrupting and restoring sequence complementarity, we show that the interaction between the 3'-CITE and at least one complementary sequence in the 5'-end is essential for virus RNA translation, although efficient virus translation and multiplication requires both connections. The complementary sequence stretches are invariant in all MNSV isolates, suggesting that the dual 5'-3' RNA: RNA interactions are required for optimal MNSV cap-independent translation and multiplication.

TI  - Influences of climate change on area variation of Qinghai Lake on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau since 1980s
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau is the most sensitive region to global warming on Earth. Qinghai Lake, the largest lake on the plateau, has experienced evident area variation during the past several decades. To quantify the area changes of Qinghai Lake, a satellite-based survey based on Landsat images from the 1980s to 2010s has been performed. In addition, meteorological data from all the seven available stations on Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has been analyzed. Area of Qinghai Lake shrank similar to 2% during 1987-2005, and then increased similar to 3% from 2005-2016. Meanwhile, the average annual temperature increased 0.319 degrees C/10 y in the past 50 years, where the value is 0.415 degrees C/10 y from 2005-2016. The structural equation modeling (SEM) shows that precipitation is the primary factor influencing the area of Qinghai Lake. Moreover, temperature might be tightly correlated with precipitation, snow line, and evaporation, thereby indirectly causes alternations of the lake area. This study elucidated the significant area variation of water body on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau under global warming since 1980s.

TI  - <i>Bacteroides fragilis</i> Protects Against Antibiotic-Associated Diarrhea in Rats by Modulating Intestinal Defenses
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) is iatrogenic diarrhea characterized by disruption of the gut microbiota. Probiotics are routinely used to treat AAD in clinical practice; however, the effectiveness and mechanisms by which probiotics alleviate symptoms remain poorly understood. We previously isolated a non-toxic Bacteroides fragilis strain ZY-312, which has been verified to be beneficial in certain infection disorders. However, the precise role of this commensal bacterium in AAD is unknown. In this study, we successfully established an AAD rat model by exposing rats to appropriate antibiotics. These rats developed diarrhea symptoms and showed alterations in their intestinal microbiota, including overgrowth of some pathogenic bacteria. In addition, gastrointestinal barrier defects, indicated by compromised aquaporin expression, aberrant tight junction proteins, and decreased abundance of mucus-filled goblet cells, were also detected in ADD rats compared with control animals. Of note, oral treatment with B. fragilis strain ZY-312 ameliorated AAD-related diarrhea symptoms by increasing the abundance of specific commensal microbiota. Interestingly, we demonstrated that these changes were coincident with the restoration of intestinal barrier function and enterocyte regeneration in AAD rats. In summary, we identified a potential probiotic therapeutic strategy for AAD and identified the vital roles of B. fragilis strain ZY-312 in modulating the colonic bacterial community and participating in microbiota-mediated epithelial cell proliferation and differentiation.

TI  - Comparison of MODIS and SWAT evapotranspiration over a complex terrain at different spatial scales
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In most hydrological systems, evapotranspiration (ET) and precipitation are the largest components of the water balance, which are difficult to estimate, particularly over complex terrain. In recent decades, the advent of remotely sensed data based ET algorithms and distributed hydrological models has provided improved spatially upscaled ET estimates. However, information on the performance of these methods at various spatial scales is limited. This study compares the ET from the MODIS remotely sensed ET dataset (MOD16) with the ET estimates from a SWAT hydrological model on graduated spatial scales for the complex terrain of the Sixth Creek Catchment of the Western Mount Lofty Ranges, South Australia. ET from both models was further compared with the coarser-resolution AWRA-L model at catchment scale. The SWAT model analyses are performed on daily timescales with a 6-year calibration period (2000-2005) and 7-year validation period (2007-2013). Differences in ET estimation between the SWAT and MOD16 methods of up to 31, 19, 15, 11 and 9% were observed at respectively 1, 4, 9, 16 and 25 km(2) spatial resolutions. Based on the results of the study, a spatial scale of confidence of 4 km2 for catchment-scale evapotranspiration is suggested in complex terrain. Land cover differences, HRU parameterisation in AWRA-L and catchment-scale averaging of input climate data in the SWAT semi-distributed model were identified as the principal sources of weaker correlations at higher spatial resolution.

TI  - Preclinical outcomes of Intratumoral Modulation Therapy for glioblastoma
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Glioblastoma (GBM) is the leading cause of high fatality cancer arising within the adult brain. Electrotherapeutic approaches offer new promise for GBM treatment by exploiting innate vulnerabilities of cancer cells to low intensity electric fields. This report describes the preclinical outcomes of a novel electrotherapeutic strategy called Intratumoral Modulation Therapy (IMT) that uses an implanted stimulation system to deliver sustained, titratable, low intensity electric fields directly across GBM-affected brain regions. This pilot technology was applied to in vitro and animal models demonstrating significant and marked reduction in tumor cell viability and a cumulative impact of concurrent IMT and chemotherapy in GBM. No off target neurological effects were observed in treated subjects. Computational modeling predicted IMT field optimization as a means to further bolster treatment efficacy. This sentinel study provides new support for defining the potential of IMT strategies as part of a more effective multimodality treatment platform for GBM.

TI  - Analysis of air pollution over Hanoi, Vietnam using multi-satellite and MERRA reanalysis datasets
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Air pollution is one of the major environmental concerns in Vietnam. In this study, we assess the current status of air pollution over Hanoi, Vietnam using multiple different satellite datasets and weather information, and assess the potential to capture rice residue burning emissions with satellite data in a cloud-covered region. We used a timeseries of Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) Ultraviolet Aerosol Index (UVAI) satellite data to characterize absorbing aerosols related to biomass burning. We also tested a timeseries of 3-hourly MERRA-2 reanalysis Black Carbon (BC) concentration data for 5 years from 2012-2016 and explored pollution trends over time. We then used MODIS active fires, and synoptic wind patterns to attribute variability in Hanoi pollution to different sources. Because Hanoi is within the Red River Delta where rice residue burning is prominent, we explored trends to see if the residue burning signal is evident in the UVAI or BC data. Further, as the region experiences monsoon-influenced rainfall patterns, we adjusted the BC data based on daily rainfall amounts. Results indicated forest biomass burning from Northwest Vietnam and Laos impacts Hanoi air quality during the peak UVAI months of March and April. Whereas, during local rice residue burning months of June and October, no increase in UVAI is observed, with slight BC increase in October only. During the peak BC months of December and January, wind patterns indicated pollutant transport from southern China megacity areas. Results also indicated severe pollution episodes during December 2013 and January 2014. We observed significantly higher BC concentrations during nighttime than daytime with peaks generally between 2130 and 0030 local time. Our results highlight the need for better air pollution monitoring systems to capture episodic pollution events and their surface-level impacts, such as rice residue burning in cloud-prone regions in general and Hanoi, Vietnam in particular.

TI  - Continuous, semi-automatic monitoring of ground deformation using Sentinel-1 satellites
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the continuous monitoring of ground deformation at regional scale using ESA (European Space Agency) Sentinel-1constellation of satellites. We discuss this operational monitoring service through the case study of the Tuscany Region (Central Italy), selected due to its peculiar geological setting prone to ground instability phenomena. We set up a systematic processing chain of Sentinel-1 acquisitions to create continuously updated ground deformation data to mark the transition from static satellite analysis, based on the analysis of archive images, to dynamic monitoring of ground displacement. Displacement time series, systematically updated with the most recent available Sentinel-1 acquisition, are analysed to identify anomalous points (i.e., points where a change in the dynamic of motion is occurring). The presence of a cluster of persistent anomalies affecting elements at risk determines a significant level of risk, with the necessity of further analysis. Here, we show that the Sentinel-1 constellation can be used for continuous and systematic tracking of ground deformation phenomena at the regional scale. Our results demonstrate how satellite data, acquired with short revisiting times and promptly processed, can contribute to the detection of changes in ground deformation patterns and can act as a key information layer for risk mitigation.

T2  - Zhonghua bing li xue za zhi = Chinese journal of pathology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To investigate the difference between routine hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry in diagnosing metastatic melanoma in sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastases, and to evaluate the association of SLN tumor burden with the status of non-sentinel lymph nodes (NSLN). Methods: 126 melanoma patients were treated with SLN biopsy and further examined with immunohistochemistry at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center between 2010 and 2016, and the status of SLN was respectively estimated by HE stain and immunohistochemistry (S-100 protein, HMB45, Melan A and SOX10). In 39 patients who were treated with complete lymph node dissection, characteristics of SLN tumor burden (maximum diameter of the tumor deposit, tumor penetrative depth and the microanatomic location of the metastasis) and the associations of SLN tumor burden with the involvement of NSLN were all evaluated. Results: Of the total 126 cases, 33 (26.2%) were positive by HE staining and 49 (38.3%) were positive by immunohistochemistry. S-100 protein was positive in 48 out of 49 cases (98.0%). HMB45 was positive in 46 out of 49 cases (93.9%). Melan A was positive in 47 out of 49 cases (96.0%). SOX10 was positive in 8 out of 8 cases. The outcome indicated that the application of immunohistochemistry identified positive SLN missed by HE stain in about 12.1% of cases. Of the 39 patients who were treated with complete lymph node dissection, six showed metastases in NSLN. The frequency of metastases in NSLN was 15.4% (6/39) when SLN was positive. Additionally, the frequency of metastases in NSLN in cases with SLN metastatic deposits ≤2 mm was significantly lower than that in cases with SLN metastatic deposits >2 mm; eight cases with SLN metastatic deposits <0.2 mm had no additional positive NSLN. Conclusions: The findings suggest that immunohistochemistry could effectively improve the detection of positive SLN in melanoma. Cases with SLN metastatic deposits ≤2 mm are less likely to have further metastases in NSLN. There is a need for prospective large-population based studies to identify a subgroup of SLN positive patients who can safely be spared complete lymph node dissection.
AB  - 目的： 探讨常规HE及免疫组织化学染色在确定恶性黑色素瘤前哨淋巴结(SLN)转移率方面的差异，进一步研究SLN中转移负荷与非前哨淋巴结(NSLN)转移的相关性。 方法： 收集2010至2016年间于复旦大学附属肿瘤医院进行SLN活检并行免疫组织化学(S－100蛋白、HMB45、Melan A、SOX10)检查的126例恶性黑色素瘤病例，分别统计常规HE染色和联合免疫组织化学检查确定SLN转移率的情况。对其中39例进行区域淋巴结清扫的病例，采用转移灶最大径、转移灶距被膜距离及转移灶组织学位置三种分级方法评估SLN转移负荷，分别统计各组之间的NSLN转移率有无差异。 结果： 126例病例中，仅通过HE染色确定SLN转移的为33例(阳性率26.2%)，联合使用免疫组织化学检查可确定SLN转移的为49例(阳性率为38.3%)，联合免疫组织化学检查与常规HE染色相比可提高SLN阳性检出率(12.1%)。其中S－100蛋白阳性率98.0%(48/49)，HMB45阳性率93.9%(46/49)，Melan A阳性率为96.0%(47/49)，SOX10阳性比例为8/8。39例进行区域淋巴结清扫的病例中，6例结果为阳性，得出SLN阳性时NSLN的转移率约为15.4%(6/39)。SLN转移负荷分级评价统计结果显示，SLN转移灶最大径≤2 mm病例组与>2 mm病例组相比，NSLN转移率显著降低(P＝0.042)，且转移灶最大径<0.2 mm的8例病例NSLN结果均为阴性。 结论： 免疫组织化学检查可有效提高恶性黑色素瘤患者SLN阳性检出率。SLN转移负荷分组研究显示转移灶最大径≤2 mm时，NSLN转移率显著降低，但对于哪一类SLN阳性患者可以安全的免除区域淋巴结清扫，需要更多大样本前瞻性试验进一步研究。.

TI  - Setup errors and effectiveness of Optical Laser 3D Surface imaging system (Sentinel) in postoperative radiotherapy of breast cancer
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) plus postoperative radiotherapy has become the standard treatment for early-stage breast cancer. The aim of this study was to compare the setup accuracy of optical surface imaging by the Sentinel system with cone-beam computerized tomography (CBCT) imaging currently used in our clinic for patients received BCS. Two optical surface scans were acquired before and immediately after couch movement correction. The correlation between the setup errors as determined by the initial optical surface scan and CBCT was analyzed. The deviation of the second optical surface scan from the reference planning CT was considered an estimate for the residual errors for the new method for patient setup correction. The consequences in terms for necessary planning target volume (PTV) margins for treatment sessions without setup correction applied. We analyzed 145 scans in 27 patients treated for early stage breast cancer. The setup errors of skin marker based patient alignment by optical surface scan and CBCT were correlated, and the residual setup errors as determined by the optical surface scan after couch movement correction were reduced. Optical surface imaging provides a convenient method for improving the setup accuracy for breast cancer patient without unnecessary imaging dose.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance and molecular characterization of diarrheagenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> and non-typhoidal <i>Salmonella</i> strains isolated from infections in Southwest China
T2  - INFECTIOUS DISEASES OF POVERTY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Bacterial diarrhea is one of the most common causes for medical consultations, mortality and morbidity in the world. Diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) and non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) are major intestinal pathogens in developing countries, and the indiscriminate use of antibiotics has greatly contributed to resistant strains. Hence, the aim of the present study is to identify the antimicrobial resistance patterns and the molecular characteristics of DEC and NTS in southwest, China.Methods: 1121 diarrheal patients and 319 non-diarrheal subjects across all age groups were recruited from four sentinel hospitals from June 2014 to July 2015 in Kunming City, Yunnan Province. Each stool specimen was collected to detect DEC and NTS with standard microbiological and molecular methods. Antimicrobial resistance testing was performed with the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method, and the standards for antimicrobial susceptibility testing complied with the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute ( CLSI). Molecular characterization of strains was carried out using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A structured questionnaire was used to record basic epidemiological data (e.g. sex, age, residence, season, etc.). Data were analyzed using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test.Results: DEC was detected in 127 (11.33%) diarrhea cases and 9 (2.82%) non-diarrheal cases (chi(2) = 20.69, P < 0.001, OR = 4.36, 95% CI: 2.19-8.65), and the prevalence of NTS isolated from diarrhea cases was higher than that of non-diarrheal cases across all age groups (n = 42, 3.75%, n = 1, 0.31%, chi(2) = 10.10, P = 0.002, OR = 12.38, 95% CI: 1.70-90.29). The rates of resistance to ten antibiotics of DEC and NTS showed significant differences (chi(2) = 386.77, P < 0.001; chi(2) = 191.16, P < 0.001). The rates of resistance to Amoxicillin and Clavulafiate (AMC), Cephalothin (CEP), Gentamicin (GEN) and Sulfamethoxazole-Trimethoprim (SXT) of DEC isolated from diarrhea cases were higher than those of NTS isolated from diarrhea patients (37.01% vs 14.29%, chi(2) = 7.57, P = 0.006; 29.92% vs 11.90%, chi(2) = 5.40, P = 0.02; 37.01% vs 11.90%, chi(2) = 5.80, P = 0.016; 62.20% vs 26.19%, chi(2) = 16.44, P < 0.001; respectively). Ciprofloxacin (CIP) was the most sensitive antibiotic for DEC and NTS strains isolated from diarrhea cases. Resistance rates of DEC isolates from cases and controls to more than three kinds antimicrobials (multidrug resistance, MDR) showed no significant differences (81.10% vs 88.89%, P = 0.33). Pulsotype patterns of DEC strains were highly diverse; however, the pulsotype pattern of NTS strains was closely related to the serotype. The pattern of S. enteritidis was highly similar, but the S. enterica Typhimurium strain was discrete.Conclusions: Antibiotic resistance of Enterobacteriaceae is of great concern. The societal effects of antibiotic use justify strict monitoring to combat increases in antimicrobial resistance. Molecular epidemiology and systematic epidemiological investigation can provide accurate evidence for tracking the infection source.

TI  - Numerical reference plane algorithm for effectively solving tilt distortion of a phase image in digital off-axis holography
T2  - ACTA PHYSICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a simple and commonly-used approach to use an inclined plane reference wave to remove zero-order diffraction and conjugated image in digital off-axis holography. However, this method is encountering a difficulty, since an additional carrier frequency is incorporated into the inclined reference wave and it is difficult to accurately obtain this additional carrier frequency via experimental measurement, a certain tilt distortion of the phase image will occur in the hologram reconstruction. In this paper, a numerical reference plane algorithm is proposed to solve this problem. This method innovatively constructs a numerical reference plane which is able to exactly characterize the tilt of the phase image by choosing three different points from a local flat of the reconstructed image, and establishes a mathematical relation between the plane parameters and the carrier frequency of the reference wave, which is used as a criterion of correcting the tilt distortion of the phase image in the subsequent iterative computation. The procedures of the algorithm are as follows. 1) Input the nominal carrier frequencies, (f '(x), f '(y)) of the plane reference wave and reconstruct the hologram. 2) Unwrap the phase with PUMA algorithm and suppress the noise using bilateral filtering and short time Fourier transform with wavelet shrinkage. 3) Construct the numerical reference plane reflecting the image inclination and establish the mathematical relation between the plane parameters and the carrier frequencies of the reference wave. 4) Perform the iterative computation to correct the nominal carrier frequencies, (f '(x), f '(y)) by using the differential coefficients, (a, b) of the reference plane equation as the criterion. 5) Output the computation result and the corrected phase image. The algorithm is simple and effective. It is able not only to achieve accurate correction to the tilt phase distortion, but also to exactly obtain the additional carrier frequency of the inclined plane reference wave. Since in the phase unwrapping reconstruction, the proposed approach combines with bi-lateral filtering processing, wavelet shrinking and short time Fourier transform to remove the noise influence while the image details are preserved, the method would still be valid under the influences of environmental and system noise. The experimental result supports the theoretical prediction very well.

TI  - On the need for a time- and location-dependent estimation of the NDSI threshold value for reducing existing uncertainties in snow cover maps at different scales
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of current snow cover extent is essential for characterizing energy and moisture fluxes at the Earth's surface. The snow-covered area (SCA) is often estimated by using optical satellite information in combination with the normalized-difference snow index (NDSI). The NDSI thereby uses a threshold for the definition if a satellite pixel is assumed to be snow covered or snow free. The spatiotemporal representativeness of the standard threshold of 0.4 is however questionable at the local scale. Here, we use local snow cover maps derived from ground-based photography to continuously calibrate the NDSI threshold values (NDSIthr) of Landsat satellite images at two European mountain sites of the period from 2010 to 2015. The Research Catchment Zugspitzplatt (RCZ, Germany) and Vernagtferner area (VF, Austria) are both located within a single Landsat scene. Nevertheless, the long-term analysis of the NDSIthr demonstrated that the NDSIthr at these sites are not correlated (r = 0.17) and different than the standard threshold of 0.4. For further comparison, a dynamic and locally optimized NDSI threshold was used as well as another locally optimized literature threshold value (0.7). It was shown that large uncertainties in the prediction of the SCA of up to 24.1% exist in satellite snow cover maps in cases where the standard threshold of 0.4 is used, but a newly developed calibrated quadratic polynomial model which accounts for seasonal threshold dynamics can reduce this error. The model minimizes the SCA uncertainties at the calibration site VF by 50% in the evaluation period and was also able to improve the results at RCZ in a significant way. Additionally, a scaling experiment shows that the positive effect of a locally adapted threshold diminishes using a pixel size of 500m or larger, underlining the general applicability of the standard threshold at larger scales.

TI  - Early warning and response system (EWARS) for dengue outbreaks: Recent advancements towards widespread applications in critical settings
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundDengue outbreaks are increasing in frequency over space and time, affecting people's health and burdening resource-constrained health systems. The ability to detect early emerging outbreaks is key to mounting an effective response. The early warning and response system (EWARS) is a toolkit that provides countries with early-warning systems for efficient and cost-effective local responses. EWARS uses outbreak and alarm indicators to derive prediction models that can be used prospectively to predict a forthcoming dengue outbreak at district level.MethodsWe report on the development of the EWARS tool, based on users' recommendations into a convenient, user-friendly and reliable software aided by a user's workbook and its field testing in 30 health districts in Brazil, Malaysia and Mexico.Findings34 Health officers from the 30 study districts who had used the original EWARS for 7 to 10 months responded to a questionnaire with mainly open-ended questions. Qualitative content analysis showed that participants were generally satisfied with the tool but preferred open-access vs. commercial software. EWARS users also stated that the geographical unit should be the district, while access to meteorological information should be improved. These recommendations were incorporated into the second-generation EWARS-R, using the free R software, combined with recent surveillance data and resulted in higher sensitivities and positive predictive values of alarm signals compared to the first-generation EWARS. Currently the use of satellite data for meteorological information is being tested and a dashboard is being developed to increase user-friendliness of the tool. The inclusion of other Aedes borne viral diseases is under discussion.ConclusionEWARS is a pragmatic and useful tool for detecting imminent dengue outbreaks to trigger early response activities.

TI  - Encoding of Sucrose's Palatability in the Nucleus Accumbens Shell and Its Modulation by Exteroceptive Auditory Cues
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the palatability of sucrose is the primary reason for why it is over consumed, it is not well understood how it is encoded in the nucleus accumbens shell (NAcSh), a brain region involved in reward, feeding, and sensory/motor transformations. Similarly, untouched are issues regarding how an external auditory stimulus affects sucrose palatability and, in the NAcSh, the neuronal correlates of this behavior. To address these questions in behaving rats, we investigated how food-related auditory cues modulate sucrose's palatability. The goals are to determine whether NAcSh neuronal responses would track sucrose's palatability (as measured by the increase in hedonically positive oromotor responses lick rate), sucrose concentration, and how it processes auditory information. Using brief-access tests, we found that sucrose's palatability was enhanced by exteroceptive auditory cues that signal the start and the end of a reward epoch. With only the start cue the rejection of water was accelerated, and the sucrose/water ratio was enhanced, indicating greater palatability. However, the start cue also fragmented licking patterns and decreased caloric intake. In the presence of both start and stop cues, the animals fed continuously and increased their caloric intake. Analysis of the licking microstructure confirmed that auditory cues (either signaling the start alone or start/stop) enhanced sucrose's oromotor-palatability responses. Recordings of extracellular single-unit activity identified several distinct populations of NAcSh responses that tracked either the sucrose palatability responses or the sucrose concentrations by increasing or decreasing their activity. Another neural population fired synchronously with licking and exhibited an enhancement in their coherence with increasing sucrose concentrations. The population of NAcSh's Palatability-related and Lick-Inactive neurons were the most important for decoding sucrose's palatability. Only the Lick-Inactive neurons were phasically activated by both auditory cues and may play a sentinel role monitoring relevant auditory cues to increase caloric intake and sucrose's palatability. In summary, we found that auditory cues that signal the availability of sucrose modulate its palatability and caloric intake in a task dependent-manner and had neural correlates in the NAcSh. These findings show that exteroceptive cues associated with feeding may enhance positive hedonic oromotor-responses elicited by sucrose's palatability.

TI  - Detection of carbon monoxide pollution from cities and wildfires on regional and urban scales: the benefit of CO column retrievals from SCIAMACHY 2.3 μm measurements under cloudy conditions
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the perspective of the upcoming TROPOMI Sentinel-5 Precursor carbon monoxide data product, we discuss the benefit of using CO total column retrievals from cloud-contaminated SCIAMACHY 2.3 mu m shortwave infrared spectra to detect atmospheric CO enhancements on regional and urban scales due to emissions from cities and wildfires. The study uses the operational Sentinel-5 Precursor algorithm SICOR, which infers the vertically integrated CO column together with effective cloud parameters. We investigate its capability to detect localized CO enhancements distinguishing between clear-sky observations and observations with low (< 1.5 km) and medium-high clouds (1.5-5 km). As an example, we analyse CO enhancements over the cities Paris, Los Angeles and Tehran as well as the wildfire events in Mexico-Guatemala 2005 and Alaska- Canada 2004. The CO average of the SCIAMACHY full-mission data set of clear-sky observations can detect weak CO enhancements of less than 10 ppb due to air pollution in these cities. For low-cloud conditions, the CO data product performs similarly well. For medium-high clouds, the observations show a reduced CO signal both over Tehran and Los Angeles, while for Paris no significant CO enhancement can be detected. This indicates that information about the vertical distribution of CO can be obtained from the SCIAMACHY measurements. Moreover, for the Mexico-Guatemala fires, the low-cloud CO data captures a strong outflow of CO over the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean and so provides complementary information to clear-sky retrievals, which can only be obtained over land. For both burning events, enhanced CO values are even detectable with medium-high-cloud retrievals, confirming a distinct vertical extension of the pollution. The larger number of additional measurements, and hence the better spatial coverage, significantly improve the detection of wildfire pollution using both the clear-sky and cloudy CO retrievals. Due to the improved instrument performance of the TROPOMI instrument with respect to its precursor SCIAMACHY, the upcoming Sentinel-5 Precursor CO data product will allow improved detection of CO emissions and their vertical extension over cities and fires, making new research applications possible.

TI  - National outbreak of Shiga toxin-producing <i>Escherichia</i> <i>coli</i> O157: H7 linked to mixed salad leaves, United Kingdom, 2016
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigated a large outbreak of Escherichia coli O157 in the United Kingdom (UK) with 165 cases between 31 May and 29 July 2016. No linked cases were reported in other countries. Cases were predominately female (n = 128) and adult (n = 150), 66 attended hospital and nine had features of haemorrhagic uraemic syndrome. A series of epidemiological studies (case-control, case-case, ingredients-based and venue-based studies) and supply chain investigations implicated mixed salad leaves from Supplier A as the likely outbreak vehicle. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) indicated a link with strains from the Mediterranean and informed the outbreak control team to request that Supplier A cease distributing salad leaves imported from Italy. Microbiological tests of samples of salad leaves from Supplier A were negative. We were unable to confirm the source of contamination or the contaminated constituent leaf although our evidence pointed to red batavia received from Italy as the most likely vehicle. Variations in Shiga toxin-producing E. coli surveillance and diagnosis may have prevented detection of cases outside the UK and highlights a need for greater standardisation. WGS was useful in targeting investigations, but greater coverage across Europe is needed to maximise its potential.

TI  - An automated cirrus classification
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cirrus clouds play an important role in determining the radiation budget of the earth, but many of their properties remain uncertain, particularly their response to aerosol variations and to warming. Part of the reason for this uncertainty is the dependence of cirrus cloud properties on the cloud formation mechanism, which itself is strongly dependent on the local meteorological conditions.In this work, a classification system (Identification and Classification of Cirrus or IC-CIR) is introduced to identify cirrus clouds by the cloud formation mechanism. Using reanalysis and satellite data, cirrus clouds are separated into four main types: orographic, frontal, convective and synoptic. Through a comparison to convection-permitting model simulations and back-trajectory-based analysis, it is shown that these observation-based regimes can provide extra information on the cloud-scale updraughts and the frequency of occurrence of liquid-origin ice, with the convective regime having higher updraughts and a greater occurrence of liquid-origin ice compared to the synoptic regimes. Despite having different cloud formation mechanisms, the radiative properties of the regimes are not distinct, indicating that retrieved cloud properties alone are insufficient to completely describe them.This classification is designed to be easily implemented in GCMs, helping improve future model-observation comparisons and leading to improved parametrisations of cirrus cloud processes.

TI  - Multiple solutions with constant sign for a (<i>p</i>, <i>q</i>)-elliptic system Dirichlet problem with product nonlinear term
T2  - BOUNDARY VALUE PROBLEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we consider the existence of multiple solutions of the homogeneous Dirichlet problem for a (p,q)-elliptic system with nonlinear product term as follows:{-Delta(p)u = lambda alpha(x)vertical bar u vertical bar (alpha(x)-2) u vertical bar v vertical bar(beta(x)) + F-u (x,u,v) in Omega,-Delta(q)u = lambda beta(x)vertical bar u vertical bar (alpha(x)) vertical bar v vertical bar(beta(x)-2)v + F-v (x,u,v) in Omega,u = 0 = v on partial derivative OmegaWe emphasize that the potential F(x,u,v) might contain a nonlinear product term which includes F(x,u,v) = vertical bar u vertical bar(theta 1(x)) vertical bar v vertical bar(theta 2(x))ln(1 + vertical bar u vertical bar)ln(1 + vertical bar v vertical bar) as a prototype, and does not require F(x,u,v) -> +infinity as vertical bar u vertical bar +vertical bar n vertical bar +infinity. With novel growth conditions on F(x,u,v), we develop a new method to check the Cerami compactness condition. Through arguments of critical point theory, we prove the existence of multiple constant-sign solutions for our elliptic system without requiring the well-known Ambrosetti-Rabinowitz condition. Moreover, we also give a result guaranteeing the existence of infinitely many solutions.

TI  - Tumour mutation status and melanoma recurrence following a negative sentinel lymph node biopsy
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: A proportion of patients develop recurrence following a tumour-negative sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). This study aimed to explore whether melanoma patients with BRAF or NRAS mutant tumours have an increased risk of developing disease recurrence following a negative SLNB compared to patients with wild-type tumours.METHODS: Prospective cohort study of melanoma patients at three tertiary referral centres in Melbourne, who underwent SLNB. Clinical, pathological and molecular characteristics and recurrence data were prospectively recorded. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between mutation status and development of recurrence following a negative-SLNB.RESULTS: Overall, 344/477 (72.1%) patients had a negative SLNB. Of these, 54 (15.7%) developed subsequent recurrence. The risk of disease recurrence following a negative SLNB was increased for patients with either a BRAF or NRAS mutant tumour compared to wild-type tumours (aHR 1.92, 95% CI: 1.02-3.60, p = 0.04).CONCLUSION: Melanoma patients with BRAF or NRAS mutant tumours had an increased risk compared to patients with BRAF/NRAS wild-type tumours of developing disease recurrence following a tumour-negative SLNB. The findings also confirm the importance of continued surveillance to monitor for disease recurrence among SLNB-negative patients.

TI  - Prospective Randomized Trial of Use of In-House Prepared Low-Cost Radiopharmaceutical Versus Commercial Radiopharmaceutical for Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Patients with Early Stage Invasive Breast Cancer
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGERY

AB  - The current standard-of-care for surgical staging of the axilla in clinically node-negative (N0) early breast cancers is sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), which requires expensive radiopharmaceuticals for efficacious results. In-house produced low-cost radiopharmaceuticals may be the solution and have shown efficacy in earlier observational/pilot studies. We compared SLNB using in-house prepared radiopharmaceutical (Tc-99m-Antimony-colloid) versus commercially marketed radiopharmaceutical (Tc-99m-Sulphur-colloid) in this prospective randomized study.78 clinically N0 early breast cancer patients (T1/2, N0 stages), undergoing primary surgery were prospectively randomized 1:1 into two groups; to receive SLNB using methylene blue, and either Tc-99m-Antimony colloid (Group-1) or Tc-99m-Sulphur colloid (Group-2). Completion axillary dissection was done in all (validation SLNB). SLNB indices were compared between the groups.The groups were comparable with regard to age, stage, tumour size, hormone receptors and HER2neu status. Cost of the in-house prepared Tc-99m-antimony colloid was 16-times lesser compared to Tc-99m-sulphur colloid. SLN identification rates (IR) in Groups 1 and 2 were 100 and 97.4% respectively, (p > 0.05). False negative rates (FNR) in Group 1 and 2 were 6.3% (1/16 patients) and 7.7% (1/13 patients), respectively, (p > 0.05). There were no major allergic reactions in either group.In this prospective randomized trial on early breast cancer patients, accuracy of SLNB was comparable using in-house prepared, Tc-99m-antimony colloid and commercially marketed Tc-99m-sulphur colloid as radiopharmaceutical, while Tc-99m-antimony colloid was much cheaper than Tc-99m-sulphur colloid.

TI  - A Cloud-Based Multi-Temporal Ensemble Classifier to Map Smallholder Farming Systems
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Smallholder farmers cultivate more than 80% of the cropland area available in Africa. The intrinsic characteristics of such farms include complex crop-planting patterns, and small fields that are vaguely delineated. These characteristics pose challenges to mapping crops and fields from space. In this study, we evaluate the use of a cloud-based multi-temporal ensemble classifier to map smallholder farming systems in a case study for southern Mali. The ensemble combines a selection of spatial and spectral features derived from multi-spectral Worldview-2 images, field data, and five machine learning classifiers to produce a map of the most prevalent crops in our study area. Different ensemble sizes were evaluated using two combination rules, namely majority voting and weighted majority voting. Both strategies outperform any of the tested single classifiers. The ensemble based on the weighted majority voting strategy obtained the higher overall accuracy (75.9%). This means an accuracy improvement of 4.65% in comparison with the average overall accuracy of the best individual classifier tested in this study. The maximum ensemble accuracy is reached with 75 classifiers in the ensemble. This indicates that the addition of more classifiers does not help to continuously improve classification results. Our results demonstrate the potential of ensemble classifiers to map crops grown by West African smallholders. The use of ensembles demands high computational capability, but the increasing availability of cloud computing solutions allows their efficient implementation and even opens the door to the data processing needs of local organizations.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Wildland Fire-Induced Risk Assessment at the Community Level
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildland fires are some of the critical natural hazards that pose a significant threat to the communities located in the vicinity of forested/vegetated areas. In this paper, our overall objective was to study the structural damages due to the 2016 Horse River Fire (HRF) that happened in Fort McMurray (Alberta, Canada) by employing primarily very high spatial resolution optical satellite data, i.e., WorldView-2. Thus, our activities included the: (i) estimation of the structural damages; and (ii) delineation of the wildland-urban interface (WUI) and its associated buffers at certain intervals, and their utilization in assessing potential risks. Our proposed method of remote sensing-based estimates of the number of structural damages was compared with the ground-based information available from the Planning and Development Recovery Committee Task Force of Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo (RMWB); and found a strong linear relationship (i.e., r(2) value of 0.97 with a slope of 0.97). Upon delineating the WUI and its associated buffer zones at 10 m, 30 m, 50 m, 70 m and 100 m distances; we found existence of vegetation within the 30 m buffers from the WUI for all of the damaged structures. In addition, we noticed that the relevant authorities had removed vegetation in some areas between 30 m and 70 m buffers from the WUI, which was proven to be effective in order to protect the structures in the adjacent communities. Furthermore, we mapped the wildland fire-induced vulnerable areas upon considering the WUI and its associated buffers. Our analysis revealed that approximately 30% of the areas within the buffer zones of 10 m and 30 m were vulnerable due to the presence of vegetation; in which, approximately 7% were burned during the 2016 HRF event that led the structural damages. Consequently, we suggest to remove the existing vegetation within these critical zones and also monitor the region at a regular interval in order to reduce the wildland fire-induced risk.

TI  - Surface Downward Longwave Radiation Retrieval Algorithm for GEO-KOMPSAT-2A/AMI
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study contributes to the development of an algorithm to retrieve the Earth's surface downward longwave radiation (DLR) for 2nd Geostationary Earth Orbit KOrea Multi-Purpose SATellite (GEO-KOMPSAT-2A; GK-2A)/Advanced Meteorological Imager (AMI). Regarding simulation data for algorithm development, we referred to Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA-interim reanalysis data. The clear sky DLR calculations were in good agreement with the Gangneung-Wonju National University (GWNU) Line-By-Line (LBL) model. Compared with CERES data, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 10.14Wm(-2). In the case of cloudy sky DLR, we estimated the cloud base temperature empirically by utilizing cloud liquid water content (LWC) according to the cloud type. As a result, the correlation coefficients with CERES all sky DLRs were greater than 0.99. However, the RMSE between calculated DLR and CERES data was about 16.67Wm(-2), due to ice clouds and problems of mismatched spatial and temporal resolutions for input data. This error may be reduced when GK-2A is launched and its products can be used as input data. Accordingly, further study is needed to improve the accuracy of DLR calculation by using high-resolution input data. In addition, when compared with BSRN surface-based observational data and retrieved DLR for all sky, the correlation coefficient was 0.86 and the RMSE was 31.55 Wm(-2), which indicates relatively high accuracy. It is expected that increasing the number of experimental Cases will reduce the error.

T2  - Journal of Applied Sciences & Environmental Management
M3  - Article
AB  - This study utilized the ability of remote sensing and aeromagnetic data of the Continental Terminal, Northwestern Nigeria, to accentuate structural and lithological geologic features as well as depth estimation and mineral potential for exploitation purposes. The analytic signal and source parameter imaging filtering techniques on the magnetic data helped to identify causative magnetic bodies and space-depth relationship, two important indices in regional and ore body modelling. Depth interpretation result ranged from 120m to 2000m in the entire regolith cover where the basement rocks are overlain by elastic materials. Areas of deeper depths coincided well with regions of higher magnetic anomalies while areas of shallow depth coincided well with regions of lower magnetic anomalies with magnetic values ranging from 33121nT to 32980nT suggestive of a likelihood of having the magnetic unit of the basement at the top of the basement surface. The study identified the structural trend from the aeromagnetic map, showing a perfect agreement with the geologic map and Landsat-8 imagery. The Landsat-8 data was used for structural and lithological mapping and in general geological interpretation. Single band combination of 764 representing Red, Green and Blue were processed from the false colour composite image and pan-sharpened using the pan chromatic band to enhance structural features on the map. The study area showed no promise of hydrocarbon accumulation from the structural interpretation for economic benefits. However, economic-grade minerals were inferred due to magnetic anomalies that suggested accumulation of magnetic materials located within the proximity of lineaments.

TI  - Estimation of Precipitable Water Using Numerical Prediction Data
T2  - ENGINEERING JOURNAL-THAILAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitable water (PW) is an important variable in the climate system. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a powerful remote sensing technique for measuring the topography and deformation of the Earth's surface. However, variations in atmospheric water vapor content affect the accuracy of InSAR measurements. Therefore, it is important to understand the distribution of PW to mitigate atmospheric effects on remote sensing data. Herein, we estimated the PW distribution with high spatial resolution using numerical prediction data and digital elevation model (DEM) data from the Kanto region of Japan. We estimated the PW distribution at a resolution of 90 m from mesoscale model grid point value data while accounting for the difference in surface elevation within pixels using DEM data with a resolution of 90 m. The PW distribution at 90-m resolution could be estimated using the proposed method with good accuracy (root-mean-square difference within 4.0 mm) throughout the year. The proposed method provides high-resolution information on atmospheric water vapor content and its variation at 3-h intervals. This method is expected to be applicable in climate research and for the atmospheric correction of remote sensing data, which can improve the accuracy of remote sensing measurements.

The plants are usually under dense planting, which makes them prone to pest infestation. The main pest attacking date palm crops in Oman is the Dubas bug Ommatissus lybicus. This study integrated modern technology, remote sensing and geographic information systems to determine the number of date palm trees in traditional agriculture locations to find the relationship between date palm tree density and O. lybicus infestation. A local maxima method for tree identification was used to determine the number of date palm trees from high spatial resolution satellite imagery captured by WorldView-3 satellite. Window scale sizes of 3, 5 and 7 m were tested and the results showed that the best window size for date palm trees number detection was 7 m, with an overall estimation accuracy 88.2%. Global regression ordinary least square (OLS) and local geographic weighted regression (GWR) were used to test the relationship between infestation intensity and tree density. The GWR model showed a good positive significant relationship between infestation and tree density in the spring season with R-2 = 0.59 and medium positive significant relationship in the autumn season with R-2 = 0.30. In contrast, the OLS model results showed a weak positive significant relationship in the spring season with R-2 = 0.02, p < 0.05 and insignificant relationship in the autumn season with R-2 = 0.01, p > 0.05. The results indicated that there was a geographic effect on the infestation of O. lybicus, which had a greater impact on infestation severity, and that the impact of tree density was higher in the spring season than in autumn season.

TI  - Analysis of Aerosol Optical Properties due to a Haze Episode in the Himalayan Foothills: Implications for Climate Forcing
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - A super haze episode occurred over the Himalayan region in October 2010. This haze reduced the air quality in the region and spread across India and Pakistan. The purpose of this study is to investigate the optical and radiative properties of aerosols during this episode using data from the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET). Maximum Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) values on 19 October exceeded two at various locations in Pakistan (Sialkot = 2.56, Faisalabad = 2.67) and India (Ambala = 2.03, Amritsar = 3.4, Ludhiana = 4.29). Maximum AOD values recorded on 20 October were slightly lower in parts of Pakistan (Lahore = 2.5) and India (Gurdaspur = 1.89, New Delhi = 1.90, Batala = 2.89, Bathinda = 1.89, Kanpur = 1.6). Data for aerosol properties such as Volume Size Distributions (VSD), Single Scattering Albedo (SSA), Refractive Index (RI), and ASYmmetry parameter (ASY) suggest that fine mode aerosols were predominant relative to coarse mode aerosols during the haze episode. The dominant aerosol types were classified by analyzing AOD vs. Angstrom Exponent (AE) and Extinction Angstrom Exponent (EAE) vs. Absorption Angstrom Exponent (AAE). The results revealed that during the haze episode, the prevailing aerosol types were biomass burning and urban/industrial aerosol. The Aerosol Radiative Forcing (ARF) values were computed during the hazy and non-hazy days using the Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) model. The shortwave ARF values at the Top Of the Atmosphere (TOA), SuRFace (SRF), and within the atmosphere were found to be in the range of -17.6 to -81.6, -64 to -193, and +47 to +119 W m(-2), respectively, over Lahore. Likewise, over Kanpur, the ARF values were found to be in the range of +15.32 to -91.6, -38 to -134 and +33 to +75.91 W m(-2), respectively.

TI  - Modelling habitat and planning surveillance using Landsat imagery: a case study using Imported Red Fire ants
T2  - BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a Bayesian mixture model approach for detecting areas of habitat that are suitable for S. invicta infestation, aiding the ongoing surveillance for early detection of these exotic pests. We show that Landsat imagery is an affordable and valuable tool to assist in determining an informed surveillance strategy. In this paper, we use Landsat band 3 (visible red), Landsat band 6 (mid infrared) and a soil brightness index, in various combinations, to assess the probability that the area associated with each pixel is habitable terrain, either in a multivariate analysis, or as a univariate spatial temporal model. The multivariate analysis allows researchers to create meaningful clusters that reflect the sometimes complex combinations of conditionsnof conditions that form suitable habitat, rather then relying on single derived indices.

TI  - Feature Extraction From Multitemporal SAR Images Using Selforganizing Map Clustering and Object-Based Image Analysis
T2  - IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a new architecture for feature extraction from multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Its the purpose is to combine classic SAR processing and geographical object-based image analysis to provide a robust unsupervised tool for information extraction from time series images. The architecture takes advantage from the characteristics of the recently introduced RGB products of the Level-1 alpha and Level-1 beta families, and employs self-organizing map clustering and object-based image analysis. In particular, the input products are clustered using color homogeneity and automatically enriched with a semantic attribute referring to clusters' color, providing a preclassification mask. Then, in the frame of an application-oriented object-based image analysis, opportune layers measuring scattering and geometric properties of candidate objects are evaluated, and an appropriate rule-set is implemented in a fuzzy system to extract the feature of interest. The obtained results have been compared with those given by existing techniques and turned out to provide high degree of accuracy and negligible false alarms. The discussion is supported by an example concerning small reservoir mapping in semiarid environment.

TI  - Influence of River-Induced Fronts on Hydrocarbon Transport: A Multiplatform Observational Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Taylor Energy Site is located in the vicinity of the Mississippi Delta region over the Northern Gulf of Mexico (NGoM). Surface oil patches have been persistently observed within this site since 2004, when an oil rig was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan. A multiplatform observational experiment was conducted in April 2017 to investigate, for the first time, the main hydrocarbon pathways from the Taylor Energy Site toward the NGoM continental shelves, and the Gulf interior, under the influence of local and regional physical processes. Results indicate that the Mississippi River (MR)-induced fronts over the Taylor Energy Site, in combination with local circulation, prevailing winds and broader regional dynamics determine the hydrocarbon transport. The drifters deployed during the field experiment, in tandem with satellite data, drone imagery, wind measurements, and radar-derived data, efficiently described three major hydrocarbon pathways, associated with MR plume dynamics (downstream/upstream coastal currents) and basin-wide circulation (offshore pathway). Two different types of drifters, drogued and undrogued, showed clearly different pathways, which suggest potential differences in the expected advection of oil, depending on whether it forms a surface slick or whether it is partially mixed below the surface. The existence of multiple river fronts influenced the fate of oiled waters, preventing the hydrocarbons from reaching the Delta, like a natural boom barrier, trapping and directing the oil either westward or eastward. Thermohaline measurements showed that the MR plume near Taylor was 5-10 m deep, while the clearer ocean was characterized by a 40 m upper ocean homogenous layer.

TI  - Multidisciplinary strategy to reduce errors with the use of medical gases
T2  - FARMACIA HOSPITALARIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Lack of awareness of the risks associated with the use of medical gases amongst health professionals and health organizations is concerning. The objective of this study is to redefine the use process of medical gases in a hospital setting.Method: A sentinel event took place in a clinical unit, the incorrect administration of a medical gas to an inpatient. A multidisciplinary cause root analysis of the sentinel event was carried out. Different improvement points were identified for each error detected and so we defined a good strategy to ensure the safe use of these drugs.Results: 9 errors were identified and the following improvement actions were defined: storage (gases of clinical use were separated from those of industrial use and proper identification signs were placed), prescription (6 protocols were included in the hospital's Computerized Physician Order Entry software), validation (pharmacist validation of the prescription to ensure appropriate use of these), dispensation (a new protocol for medical gases dispensation and transportation was designed and implemented) and administration (information on the pressure gauges used for each type of gas was collected and reviewed). 72 Signs with recommendations for medical gases identification and administration were placed in all the clinical units. Specific training on the safe use of medical gases and general safety training was imparted.Conclusions: The implementation of a process that integrates all phases of use of medical gases and applies to all professionals involved is presented here as a strategy to increase safety in the use of these medicines.

TI  - Dynamics of land change: insights from a three-level intensity analysis of the Legedadie-Dire catchments, Ethiopia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earlier studies on land change (LC) have focused on size and magnitude, gains and losses, or land transfers between categories. Therefore, these studies have failed to simultaneously show the complete LC processes. This paper examines LCs in the LegedadieDire catchments in Oromia State, Ethiopia, using land category maps with intensity analysis (IA) at three points in time. We comprehensively analyze LC to jointly encompass the rate, intensity, transition, and process. Thirty-meter US Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat imagery from 1986, 2000, and 2015 (< 10% cloud) is processed using TerrSet-LCM and ArcGIS. Six categories are identified using a maximum likelihood classification technique: settlement, cultivation, forest, water, grassland, and bare land. Then, classified maps are superimposed on the images to statistically examine changes with an IA. Considerable changes are observed among categories, except for water, between 1986-2000 and 2000-2015. Overall land change occurred quickly at first and then slowly in the second time interval. The total land area that exhibited change (1st approximate to 54% and 2nd approximate to 51%) exceeded the total area of persistence (1st approximate to 46% and 2nd approximate to 49%) across the landscape. Cultivation and human settlements were the most intensively increased categories, at the expense of grassland and bare ground. Hence, when grassland was lost, it tended to he displaced by cultivation more than other categories, which was also true with bare land. Annual intensity gains were active for forest but minimal for cultivation, implying that the gains of forest were associated with in situ reforestation practices and that the gains in cultivation were caused by its relatively large initial area under a uniform intensity concept. This study demonstrates that IA is valuable for investigating LC across time intervals and can help distinguish dormant vs. active and targeted vs. avoided land categories.

TI  - Using satellite radar amplitude imaging for monitoring syn-eruptive changes in surface morphology at an ice-capped stratovolcano
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based measurements of synthetic aperture radar amplitude provide a method for monitoring volcanoes during unrest and eruptions even when visual observations are not possible, for example due to poor weather or at night, and when radar phase measurements are noisy or decorrelated. Here, we use high resolution radar amplitude images from the TerraSAR-X and COSMO SkyMed satellites to investigate surface changes associated with explosive eruptions of Cotopaxi volcano, Ecuador in August 2015. We generate change difference and amplitude ratio maps spanning the start of explosive activity at Cotopaxi, which show complex spatial variations in radar amplitude both on and around the summit ice-cap that we attribute to a number of processes related to the eruption. Observed amplitude decreases are caused by crater deepening, ashfall onto ice and surface smoothing by ashfall onto slopes facing away from the satellite, while amplitude increases are due to deposition of coarse lapilli and wet tephra, increased soil saturation due to geothermally driven glacier melting, and smoothing of slopes facing towards the satellite. We discuss the potential applications of radar amplitude images for monitoring and hazard evaluation at active volcanoes.

This work also touches upon the pre-processing of satellite data, particularly brightness and geometric transformations, geocoding, and compilation of survey installation. Thematic processing of multispectral satellite images by software for object recognition (without and with training), detection and mapping of lineaments and circular structures, as well as determination of spatial displacements of natural objects (ice fields, water masses, and cloud formations in the atmosphere) over time-different satellite images is described. This software is used to solve a number of applied problems of Earth remote sensing.

TI  - Investigating Snow Cover and Hydrometeorological Trends in Contrasting Hydrological Regimes of the Upper Indus Basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Upper Indus basin (UIB) is characterized by contrasting hydrometeorological behaviors; therefore, it has become pertinent to understand hydrometeorological trends at the sub-watershed level. Many studies have investigated the snow cover and hydrometeorological modeling at basin level but none have reported the spatial variability of trends and their magnitude at a sub-basin level. This study was conducted to analyze the trends in the contrasting hydrological regimes of the snow and glacier-fed river catchments of the Hunza and Astore sub-basins of the UIB. Mann-Kendall and Sen's slope methods were used to study the main trends and their magnitude using MODIS snow cover information (2001-2015) and hydrometeorological data. The results showed that in the Hunza basin, the river discharge and temperature were significantly (p 0.05) decreased with a Sen's slope value of -2.541 m(3<bold>)s(</bold>-1<bold>)year(</bold>-1) and -0.034 degrees C<bold>year(</bold>-1), respectively, while precipitation data showed a non-significant (p 0.05) increasing trend with a Sen's slope value of 0.023 mm<bold>year(</bold>-1). In the Astore basin, the river discharge and precipitation are increasing significantly (p 0.05) with a Sen's slope value of 1.039 m(3<bold>)s(</bold>-1<bold>)year(</bold>-1) and 0.192 mm<bold>year(</bold>-1), respectively. The snow cover analysis results suggest that the Western Himalayas (the Astore basin) had a stable trend with a Sen's slope of 0.07% year(-1) and the Central Karakoram region (the Hunza River basin) shows a slightly increasing trend with a Sen's slope of 0.394% year(-1). Based on the results of this study it can be concluded that since both sub-basins are influenced by different climatological systems (monsoon and westerly), the results of those studies that treat the Upper Indus basin as one unit in hydrometeorological modeling should be used with caution. Furthermore, it is suggested that similar studies at the sub-basin level of the UIB will help in a better understanding of the Karakoram anomaly.

TI  - HIV epidemiology in Nigeria
T2  - SAUDI JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Nigeria realizes the devastating effects of HIV/AIDS on its people, health, economic, and social progress fairly recently. This paper analyses descriptively the HIV epidemiology in Nigeria based on the sentinel surveillance system in place. Recently, it is estimated that about 3, 229, 757 people live with HIV in Nigeria and about 220, 393 new HIV infections occurred in 2013 and 210,031 died from AIDS related cases. People practicing low-risk sex are the driving force of HIV epidemic in Nigeria while the high risk groups involving female sex workers, men who have sex with men and injecting drug users contribute substantially to new infections. In conclusion, HIV prevalence among adults in Nigeria is relatively low (3.2%), yet Nigeria is an enormous country where HIV infection remains an issue that demands a systematic and highly tailored intervention.

TI  - What about sentinel lymph node biopsy for early breast cancer during pregnancy?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Pregnancy-associated breast cancer is rare, but this clinical situation arises in 1/10,000-1/3000 pregnancies. In patients presenting an early-stage breast tumor devoid of clinically pathological lymph node, sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has not yet been validated as a routine procedure for pregnant women due to the lack of data in the literature. The blue dye injection is not recommended because of 2% theoretical risk of anaphylactic shock. Several studies have shown that Tc-99m injection at conventional dose between 12.1 and 18.5 MBq exposed the fetus to an irradiation between 0.011 and 0.0245 mSv much below the 50 mSv recommended threshold. As evidenced by lymphoscintigraphy scans, the dose of injected Tc-99m is localized at the injection site and in the SLN. According to the literature, the SLN technique does not seem to impact the fetal or obstetrical prognosis. Studies involving larger cohorts are required to confirm these data and to indicate this technique in pregnant women. Considering the benefit for the patient and the low risk incurred on both fetal and obstetrical levels, it appears reasonable to discuss the indication of SLN on a case-by-case basis in multidisciplinary oncologic meetings.

TI  - Gap-enhanced Raman tags for high-contrast sentinel lymph node imaging
T2  - BIOMATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - The sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is gaining in popularity as a procedure to investigate the lymphatic metastasis of malignant tumors. The commonly used techniques to identify the SLNs in clinical practice are blue dyes-guided visualization, radioisotope-based detection and near-infrared fluorescence imaging. However, all these methods have not been found to perfectly fit the clinical criteria with issues such as short retention time in SLN, poor spatial resolution, autofluorescence, low photostability and high cost. In this study, we have reported a new type of nanoprobes, named, gap-enhanced Raman tags (GERTs) for the SLN Raman imaging. With the advantageous features including unique "fingerprint" Raman signal, strong Raman enhancement, high photostability, good biocompatibility and extra-long retention time, we have demonstrated that GERTs are greatly favorable for high-contrast and deep SLN Raman imaging, which meanwhile reveals the dynamic migration behavior of the probes entering the SLN. In addition, a quantitative volumetric Raman imaging (qVRI) data-processing method is employed to acquire a high resolution 3-dimensional (3D) margin of SLN as well as the content variation of GERTs in the SLN. Moreover, SLN detection could be realized via a cost-effective commercial portable Raman scanner. Therefore, GERTs hold the great potential to be translated in clinical application for accurate and intraoperative location of the SLN. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanisation impacts on environment, climate, agriculture, water resources trigger several problems to human beings. The present study is carried out to estimate intensity and trend of Urban Heat Island (UHI) as Surface UHI (SUHI) over towns/cities of the Gangetic plain of the state of Bihar, India, in which urban areas show relatively greater Land Surface Temperature (LST) than its rural surroundings especially during night times. The LST data (2001-14) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is used for five major towns/cities of Bihar namely, Bhagalpur, Gaya, Patna, Purnea and Muzzaffarpur. Each city is classified into Urban, Suburban and Rural zones as per land cover of the area. During winter months (January, February, November and December), UHI is more intense over all towns/cities. Mann-Kendall Test is applied on Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) in which MK-Test Statistic (S) shows a significant increasing trend. This trend would alarm a risk to increase in air pollution, heat related biohazards, energy demand in the region. This study shows the need of urban greening and proper town planning over the considered areas to mitigate the changes.

TI  - Dynamic surface water distributions influence wetland connectivity within a highly modified interior landscape
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Animal movements are inherently linked to landscape structure. Understanding this relationship for highly-mobile species requires documenting their responses to spatiotemporal variability of resources. To that end, characterizing movement behaviors and resource distributions using the principles of habitat connectivity facilitates coordinated landscape planning efforts within highly modified landscapes.Objectives and methods We tracked locations and movements for 156 dunlin (Calidris alpina) and 109 long-billed dowitchers (Limnodromus scolopaceus) overwintering in two regions with distinct water distributions in California's Central Valley. We then compared residency rates, functional connectivity to other regions, and associations between movement distances and average habitat availability and structural connectivity of habitat at multiple temporal and spatial scales.Results A widespread yet highly variable regional water distribution was associated with lower residency rates and substantially higher functional connectivity to nearby regions when compared to a stable regional water distribution characterized by a large, contiguous wetland complex. Longer movements were associated with decreasing average availability and spatial aggregation of surface water. Movement models suggested shorebirds primarily responded to habitat availability at smaller scales (< 10 km) and structural connectivity at larger scales (>= 10 km).Conclusions Differences in movement behaviors suggested that wintering shorebirds will avoid long distance movements and remain resident within a wetland region when possible. Conservation and management efforts should reliably flood individual wetlands and agricultural lands from November to April and prioritize locations that maximize structural wetland connectivity and limit spatiotemporal variability of surface water throughout the Central Valley.

TI  - A Multi-Temporal Analyses of Land Surface Temperature Using Landsat-8 Data and Open Source Software: The Case Study of Modena, Italy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon, namely urban areas where the atmospheric temperature is significantly higher than in the surrounding rural areas, is currently a very well-known topic both in the scientific community and in public debates. Growing urbanization is one of the anthropic causes of UHI. The UHI phenomenon has a negative impact on the life quality of the local population (thermal discomfort, summer thermal shock, etc.), thus investigations and analyses on this topic are really useful and important for correct and sustainable urban planning; this study is included in this context. A multi-temporal analysis was performed in the municipality of Modena (Italy) to identify and estimate the Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI, strictly correlated to the UHI phenomenon) from 2014 to 2017. For this purpose, Landsat-8 satellite images were processed with Quantum Geographic Information System (QGIS) to obtain the Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). For every pixel, LST and NDVI values of three regions of interest (ROI, i.e., Countryside, Suburbs, and City Center) were extracted and their correlations were investigated. A maximum variation of 6.4 degrees C in the LST values between City Center and Countryside was highlighted, confirming the presence of the SUHI phenomenon even in a medium-sized municipality like Modena. The implemented procedure demonstrates that satellite data are suitable for SUHI identification and estimation, therefore it could be a useful tool for public administration for urban planning policies.

TI  - Three-dimensional computer-assisted dissection of pancreatic lymphatic anatomy on human fetuses: a step toward automatic image alignment
T2  - SURGICAL AND RADIOLOGIC ANATOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - Pancreatic cancer is the fourth cause of death by cancer worldwide. Lymph node (LN) involvement is known to be the main prognostic factor. However, lymphatic anatomy is complex and only partially characterized. The aim of the study was to study the pancreatic lymphatic system using computer-assisted anatomic dissection (CAAD) technique and also to update CAAD technique by automatizing slice alignment.We dissected three human fetuses aged from 18 to 34 WA. 5-A mu m serial sections of duodeno-pancreas and spleen blocks were stained (hematoxylin-eosin, hematoxylin of Mayer and Masson trichrome), scanned, aligned and modeled in three dimensions.We observed a rich, diffuse but not systematized lymphatic network in the peri-pancreatic region. There was an equal distribution of LNs between the cephalic and body-tail portions. The lymphatic vascularization appeared in continuity from the celiac trunk to the distal ends of its hepatic and splenic arterial branches parallel to the nerve ramifications of the celiac plexus. We also observed a continuity between the drainage of the pancreatic head and the para-aortic region posteriorly.In view of the wealth of peri-pancreatic LNs, the number of LNs to harvest could be increased to improve nodal staging and prognostic evaluation. Pancreatic anatomy as described does not seem to be compatible with the sentinel LN procedure in pancreatic surgery. Finally, we are now able to offer an alternative to manual alignment with a semi-automated alignment.

TI  - Thermal IR satellite data application for earthquake research in Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The scientific progress in space research indicates earthquake-related processes of surface temperature growth, gas/aerosol exhalation and electromagnetic disturbances in the ionosphere prior to seismic activity. Among them surface temperature growth calculated using the satellite thermal infrared images carries valuable earthquake precursory information for near/distant earthquakes. Previous studies have concluded that such information can appear few days before the occurrence of an earthquake. The objective of this study is to use MODIS thermal imagery data for precursory analysis of Kashmir (Oct 8, 2005; M-w 7.6; 26 km), Ziarat (Oct 28, 2008; M-w 6.4; 13 km) and Dalbandin (Jan 18, 2011; M-w 7.2; 69 km) earthquakes. Our results suggest that there exists an evident correlation of Land Surface Temperature (thermal; LST) anomalies with seismic activity. In particular, a rise of 3-10 degrees C in LST is observed 6, 4 and 14 days prior to Kashmir, Ziarat and Dalbandin earthquakes. In order to further elaborate our findings, we have presented a comparative and percentile analysis of daily and five years averaged LST for a selected time window with respect to the month of earthquake occurrence. Our comparative analyses of daily and five years averaged LST show a significant change of 6.5-7.9 degrees C for Kashmir, 8.0-8.1 degrees C for Ziarat and 2.7-5.4 degrees C for Dalbandin earthquakes. This significant change has high percentile values for the selected events i.e. 70-100% for Kashmir, 87-100% for Ziarat and 84-100% for Dalbandin earthquakes. We expect that such consistent results may help in devising an optimal earthquake forecasting strategy and to mitigate the effect of associated seismic hazards.

TI  - The "Other" Geographies in Latin America: Alternatives from the Landscapes of the Chatino People
T2  - ICONOS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article focuses on "other" geographies, as understood through the spatial-temporal experiences of indigenous peoples. We argue that these experiences are equally valid subjective understandings of human/ non-human relations and should be heard and valued within a framework of horizontal dialogue. This argument is based on research that was conducted in conjunction with the inhabitants of Chatina communities of San Juan Lachao in Oaxaca, Mexico. The research examined relations between humans, the landscape and other non-humans, that is, landscapes comprehended through the Chatino language, cosmological worldview, local knowledge and everyday life in Chatino territory. The theoretical and critical discussion we present is based on the study of the Chatino understanding of territory and landscape. Our critical and theoretical analysis draws on this understanding of landscape and points to the need to rethink and decolonize modernist constructions and make way for new epistemic and ontological understandings of human and other-than-human relations. We put forward alternatives that confront the dominant and unequal dynamics that persist in the production of knowledge in the field of critical geography.

TI  - Pouteria torta: a native species of the Brazilian Cerrado as a bioindicator of glyphosate action
T2  - BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In Brazil, the expansion of agricultural activity and the associated indiscriminate use of herbicides such as glyphosate is directly related to the loss of biodiversity in the Cerrado. The identification of plant species as bio indicators of herbicide action, especially species native to the area, can help in monitoring the impacts of xenobiotics in the remaining Cerrado. Thus, this study was designed to evaluate the possible use of the native Cerrado species Pouteria torta as a bioindicator of glyphosate action via changes in physiological performance. At 16 months after sowing, the effect of glyphosate was evaluated by applying the following doses: 0 (control), 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, and 1200 g a.e. ha(-1). In response to glyphosate, P. torta exhibited reductions in photosynthesis and chloroplastid pigment content, as well as accumulation of shikimic acid and the occurrence of chlorosis and necrosis. These changes demonstrate the high sensitivity of P. torta to glyphosate and its potential for use as a bio indicator of this herbicide.

TI  - Simulation of Soil Water Content in Mediterranean Ecosystems by Biogeochemical and Remote Sensing Models
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study assesses the potential of two modeling approaches to simulate the daily site water budget in Mediterranean ecosystems. Both models utilize a simplified one-bucket approach but are fed with different drivers. The first model, BIOME-BGC, simulates all main biogeochemical fluxes based on conventional meteorological and ancillary data, while the second uses evapotranspiration estimates derived from the combination of meteorological data and satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. The two models were tested for three Italian sites which are characterized by different vegetation types and ecoclimatic conditions: (i) low mountain coniferous forest; (ii) hilly deciduous forest; (iii) urban grassland. The soil water balance simulated by the two models was evaluated through comparison with daily measurements of soil water content (SWC) taken during a growing season. Satisfactory results were obtained in all cases by both approaches; the SWC estimates are significantly correlated with the measurements (correlation coefficient, r, higher than 0.74), and the mean errors are lower than 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3). The second model, however, generally shows a higher accuracy, which is dependent on the quality of the NDVI data utilized (r higher than 0.79 and errors lower than 0.059 cm(3) cm(-3)). The study therefore provides useful indications for the application of these and similar simulation methods in different environmental situations.

TI  - Integrating satellite optical and thermal infrared observations for improving daily ecosystem functioning estimations during a drought episode
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite optical and thermal infrared (TIR) spectra are linked to vegetation properties and, therefore, carry valuable information needed for estimating vegetation functioning as expressed in canopy photosynthesis [gross primary production (GPP)] and evapotranspiration (ET). The joint effort is required to fully exploit this satellite spectral information and to demonstrate its capability to reveal ecosystem functioning in various environmental conditions. We investigated the relationship between Landsat (TM5 and ETM7) optical/thermal data and canopy daily functioning of annual C3 grasses at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) during a prolonged drought episode. By using the 'Soil-Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes' (SCOPE) model, reference GPP and ET were simulated via locally measured weather data, and then actual GPP and ET were simulated twice: first using the vegetation properties retrieved only from the optical bands, and second using information from both the optical and thermal bands. The outputs of last two simulations were compared to flux tower measurements. For the first simulation, we used the MODTRAN atmospheric model and the optical radiative transfer (RT) routine in SCOPE, RTMo, to perform atmospheric correction and retrieve vegetation properties [notably Leaf Area Index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab), leaf water content (C-w), leaf dry matter content (C-dm,), the leaf inclination distribution function (LIDF) and the senescent material content (C-s] by model inversion through optimization. We used the optical bands of 20 Landsat images covering the period from January to August 2004. The model inversion performance was assessed by R-2 (0.86) and RMSE (0.13) between the retrieved and ground-measured LAI. All the retrieved vegetation properties were linearly interpolated over time and were used, together with locally measured weather variables, to simulate GPP and ET at half-hourly time steps with SCOPE. For the second simulation, we additionally used TIR information to retrieve the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax), the Ball-Berry stomatal conductance parameter (m) and soil surface and boundary resistances (r(ss) and r(bs),) by inversion of the energy balance and thermal radiative transfer routines of SCOPE, RTMt, through separate look-up tables. The comparison between simulations and measurements shows that most drought effects on ET, GPP and transpiration are "visible" in the Landsat optical bands. However, the accurate simulation of soil evaporation requires TIR information. The results from this study indicate that the integration of optical and TIR information has a great potential to capture the drought effects on the grass canopy in terms of reductions in daily GPP and ET.

TI  - Deformation responses of slow moving landslides to seasonal rainfall in the Northern Apennines, measured by InSAR
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Slow moving landslides are widespread geomorphological features in the Northern Apennines of Italy where they represent one of the main landscape forming processes. The lithology of the Northern Apennines fold and thrust belt is characterized by alternations of sandstone, siltstone and clayshales, also known as flysch, and clay shales with a chaotic block in matrix fabric, which are often interpreted as tectonic or sedimentary melanges. While flysch rocks with a high pelitic fraction host earthslides that occasionally evolve into flow like movements, earthflows are the dominant landslide type in chaotic clay shales. In the present work, we document the kinematic response to rainfall of landslides in these different lithologies using radar interferometry. The study area includes three river catchments in the Northern Apennines. Here, the Mediterranean climate is characterized by two wet seasons during autumn and spring respectively, separated by dry summers and winters with moderate precipitation. We use SAR imagery from the X-band satellite COSMO SkyMed and from the C-band satellite Sentinel 1 to retrieve spatial displacement measurements between 2009 and 2016 for 25 landslides in our area of interest. We also document detailed temporal and spatial deformation signals for eight representative landslides, although the InSAR derived deformation signal is only well constrained by our dataset during the years 2013 and 2015. In spring 2013, long enduring rainfalls struck the study area and numerous landslide reactivations were documented by the regional authorities. During 2013, we measured higher displacement rates on the landslides in pelitic flysch formations compared to the earthflows in the clay shales. Slower mean velocities were measured on most landslides during 2015. We analyse the temporal deformation signal of our eight representative landslides and compare the temporal response to precipitation. We show that earthslides in pelitic flysch formations accelerate faster than earthflows in chaotic clay shales and reach higher velocities, while the kinematic behaviour of the earthflows can be described as rather steady with only minor accelerations. Although we have no detailed pore pressure measurements for the period of interest, the observed behaviour can be explained in our view by the morphological and hydrological characteristics of the different landslide types. On the one hand landslide material and bedrock in the pelitic flysch rocks are more resistant, which is why slope angles are higher in this lithology. On the other hand, landslides in the pelitic flysch formations have often deeper slip surfaces and landslide material is more permeable. This is why long persistent rainfall is necessary to saturate the landslide material and induce pore pressures that are high enough to trigger displacement. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Elevated Humidity in the Stratosphere as a Gain Factor of Ozone Depletion in the Arctic According to Aura MLS Observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of Aura MLS data showed that the temperature in the Arctic stratosphere was much lower than normal throughout the period from January to March 2011 in the altitude range 20-35 km. That led to a considerable spread of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), which were formed most intensely in periods and at altitudes of minimal temperatures (maximal temperature drop below PSC formation threshold). The main ozone losses were observed in March. They were due to a photochemical release of chlorine that avoided deactivation in view of the nitrogen deficit caused by denitrification in the course of frequent dehydration events indicated by oscillations of the altitude of maximal humidity distortion. Elevated humidity in the stratosphere had raised the threshold temperature of formation of PSCs that persisted until late March; this promoted the chlorine activation and, thereby, delayed the chlorine deactivation, resulting in an even higher level of overall ozone losses during March 2011.

TI  - Landscape-scale lidar analysis of aboveground biomass distribution in secondary Brazilian Atlantic Forest
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Secondary forests account for more than half of tropical forests and represent a growing carbon sink, but rates of biomass accumulation vary by a factor of two or more even among plots in the same landscape. To better understand the drivers of this variability, we used airborne lidar to measure forest canopy height and estimate biomass over 4529ha at Serra do Conduru Park in Southern Bahia, Brazil. We measured trees in 30 georeferenced field plots (0.25-ha each) to estimate biomass using allometry. Then we estimated aboveground biomass density (ABD) across the lidar study area using a statistical model developed from our field plots. This model related the 95th percentile of the distribution of lidar return heights to ABD. We overlaid this map of ABD on a Landsat-derived forest age map to determine rates of biomass accumulation. We found rapid initial biomass regeneration (similar to 6Mg/ha yr), which slowed as forests aged. We also observed high variability in both height and biomass across the landscape within forests of similar age. Nevertheless, a regression model that accounted for spatial autocorrelation and included forest age, slope, and distance to roads or open areas explained 62 and 77 percent of the landscape variation in ABD and canopy height, respectively. Thus, while there is high spatial heterogeneity in forest recovery, and the drivers of this heterogeneity warrant further investigation, we suggest that a relatively simple set of predictor variables is sufficient to explain the majority of variance in both height and ABD in this landscape.RESUMO Florestas secundarias constituem mais da metade das florestas tropicais e representam um importante sumidouro de carbono; entretanto taxas de acumulo de biomassa variam por fator superior a dois mesmo entre parcelas numa mesma paisagem. Para compreender quais fatores controlam esta variabilidade, utilizamos lidar aerotransportado para medir altura de dossel florestal e estimar biomassa em 4529ha no Parque Estadual da Serra do Conduru, Bahia, Brasil. Nos medimos arvores em 30 parcelas georreferenciadas (0.25-ha cada) para estimar biomassa com equacoes alometricas. Posteriormente, estimamos densidade de biomassa acima do solo (ABD) na area sobrevoada utilizando um modelo estatistico desenvolvido a partir das parcelas de campo. Este modelo relacionou o 95 degrees percentil da distribuicAo de alturas de retorno do lidar a ADB. Este mapa de ABD foi sobreposto a um mapa de idades de floresta baseado no Landsat, para determinar taxas de acumulo de biomassa. Verificaram-se taxas de regeneracAo inicialmente rapidas (similar to 6 Mg/ha ano), que diminuiram conforme as florestas envelheceram. Observamos tambem grande variabilidade em altura e biomassa ao longo da paisagem entre florestas de idade semelhantes. Apesar disto, um modelo de regressAo considerando autocorrelacAo espacial e incluindo idade da floresta, declividade e distancia ate estradas ou areas abertas explicou 62% e 77% da variacAo em escala de paisagem para ABD e altura do dossel, respectivamente. Embora haja grande heterogeneidade espacial em recuperacAo florestal, e determinantes desta heterogeneidade requeiram investigacoes adicionais, nossos resultados sugerem que conjuntos relativamente simples de variaveis preditoras sAo suficientes para explicar grande parte da variancia de altura e ABD nesta paisagem.

TI  - Machine Learning Regression Approaches for Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM) Retrieval with S2-MSI and S3-OLCI Simulated Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) variable is the standard measure of humic substance in waters optics. CDOM is optically characterized by its spectral absorption coefficient, aCDOM at at reference wavelength (e.g., approximate to 440 nm). Retrieval of CDOM is traditionally done using bio-optical models. As an alternative, this paper presents a comparison of five machine learning methods applied to Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 simulated reflectance (Rrs) data for the retrieval of CDOM: regularized linear regression (RLR), random forest regression (RFR), kernel ridge regression (KRR), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machines (SVR). Two different datasets of radiative transfer simulations are used for the development and training of the machine learning regression approaches. Statistics comparison with well-established polynomial regression algorithms shows optimistic results for all models and band combinations, highlighting the good performance of the methods, especially the GPR approach, when all bands are used as input. Application to an atmospheric corrected OLCI image using the reflectance derived form the alternative neural network (Case 2 Regional) is also shown. Python scripts and notebooks are provided to interested users.

TI  - 15M and the youth: entry and exit in activist spaces and biographical impacts of activism
T2  - PENSAMIENTO AL MARGEN
M3  - Article
AB  - We reflect on the youth activist trajectories in 15M and the biographical impacts of this activism based on the results of qualitative research carried out between 2012 and 2015. We use a qualitative methodology based on the technique of semi-directed interviews and an extensive documentary analysis. And we focus on processes of activation, reactivation and political deactivation of young activists in the cities of Madrid, Salamanca and Santander in the period 2012-2015.We start from a typology of participants based on two axes (previous political trajectory and permanence in 15M), the experiences, motivations, concrete implications and consequences of biographies derived from their relationship with 15M are presented. The conclusions are directed towards the 15M as a new space and climate of rupture of youth activism. We hypothesize it as a new historical-generational space that generates lasting biographical effects over time, mainly to activists who remain in spaces of activism (at the time of research). We also perceive other effects such as a change in worldview and acquisition or reinforcement of a militant capital in these cases.

TI  - Upper limb lymphedema in breast cancer patients in the era of Z0011, sentinel lymph node biopsy and breast conservation
T2  - IRISH JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical techniques in breast cancer (BCa) have seen a dramatic change recently with breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The ACOSOG-Z0011 trial reported equivalence in outcomes for certain patients with SLN metastases treated with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) or SLNB alone. Our aim was to investigate changes in lymphedema referral patterns in BCa patients over the last 3 years in a specialist unit and to elucidate effects of SLNB, BCS, and Z0011 trial publication on such patterns.A retrospective study was performed over a 3-year period (May 2012-May 2015). Patients were identified using a prospectively maintained lymphedema database and newly referred BCa patients with data availability were included.Overall lymphedema incidence was 11% (19.2% in ALND and 5.1% in SLNB cohort). There was a statistically significant difference in lymphedema referral patterns after Z0011, new referrals reduced by 20% (chi-sq; p = 0.001). Volume of referrals post ALND was reduced by 40% with concomitant 31% rise in those post SLNB alone, reflecting changing surgical patterns. There was a significant change in extent of lymphnode dissection during ALND (p = 0.003).The Z0011 trial in association with wider implementation of SLNB has led to significant changes in the lymphedema referral patterns and extent of ALND.

TI  - Estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration in Lake Erhai based on OLCI data
T2  - Hupo Kexue
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean and land colour instrument(OLCI) is a new ocean colour remote sensor mounted on Sentinel-3, and its applicability to water quality monitoring of inland clean water is to be verified. Chlorophyll-a (Chl.a) concentration is an important water quality parameter for measuring the eutrophication of Lake Erhai. Based on the in-situ samples taken from April 19, 2017, the performance of three Chl.a estimation models (including Band-Ratio Model, Three-Band Model and FLH Model) was evaluated in this study and the spatial distribution of Chl.a concentrations in Lake Erhai was estimated. The results showed that: (1) The Three-Band Model by Oa8, Oa11 and Oa12 was most suitable for the estimation of Chl.a concentration in Lake Erhai, the mean absolute percent error was 12.37%, lower than the Band-Ratio Model(16.04%) and FLH Model(13.50%) ; (2) Among atmospheric correction methods for OLCI, the application of the dark pixel method based on the rayleigh-scattering correction was better than that of the 6S, FLAASH and QUAC methods; (3) The near shore water pixels in the OLCI image of Lake Erhai were affected seriously by the land adjacency effect, and the distance of the land adjacency effect at the near-infrared band (Oa12) was 1 similar to 2 pixels while the Oa8, Oa10 and Oa11 bands were 1 pixel; (4) On April 19, 2017, the average Chl.a concentration of the whole Lake Erhai was 12.15 +/- 5.72 mu g/L with the lowest in the middle waters (9.00-12.00 mu g/L) and the highest in the northern waters (12.00-22.76 mu g/L). Although the Chl.a concentration of the southern waters (12.00-14.00 mu g/L) was a little higher than that of the middle waters, the lowest concentration in the estuary of the Yangnan River and the Boluo River was around 8.33 mu g/L due to the "River Plume" caused by rainfall.

TI  - Modeling the Distributions of Brightness Temperatures of a Cropland Study Area Using a Model that Combines Fast Radiosity and Energy Budget Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperatures (LSTs) obtained from remote sensing data are crucial in monitoring the conditions of crops and urban heat islands. However, since retrieved LSTs represent only the average temperature states of pixels, the distributions of temperatures within individual pixels remain unknown. Such data cannot satisfy the requirements of applications such as precision agriculture. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a model that combines a fast radiosity model, the Radiosity Applicable to Porous IndiviDual Objects (RAPID) model, and energy budget methods to dynamically simulate brightness temperatures (BTs) over complex surfaces. This model represents a model-based tool that can be used to estimate temperature distributions using fine-scale visible as well as near-infrared (VNIR) data and temporal variations in meteorological conditions. The proposed model is tested over a study area in an artificial oasis in Northwestern China. The simulated BTs agree well with those measured with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). The results reflect root mean squared errors (RMSEs) less than 1.6 degrees C and coefficients of determination (R-2) greater than 0.7. In addition, compared to the leaf area index (LAI), this model displays high sensitivity to wind speed during validation. Although simplifications may be adopted for use in specific simulations, this proposed model can be used to support in situ measurements and to provide reference data over heterogeneous vegetation surfaces.

TI  - Is There Really a Closure Gap Between 183.31-GHz Satellite Passive Microwave and <i>In Situ</i> Radiosonde Water Vapor Measurements?
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new closure study between radiosonde and microwave satellite humidity measurements. The radiosonde data are from the Global Climate Observing System Reference Upper-Air Network. The satellite data are from the radiometers: MHS, Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder, and Sondeur Atmospherique du Profil d'Humidite Intertropicale par Radiometrie. Like previous studies, we find the satellite data to be "colder" than simulated radiosonde data. But the mean bias value (0.4 K) is smaller than previously reported and, according to our analysis, not significant. The error budget suggests an uncertainty of 0.52-1.06 K. We also show that the improvement in closure can be attributed to improvements in the intercomparison methodology.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatology, trends and variability of cloud fraction cover (CFC) data over the Arctic (north of 70A degrees N), were analysed over the 1982-2009 period. Data, available from the Climate Monitoring Satellite Application Facility (CM SAF), are derived from satellite measurements by AVHRR. Climatological means confirm permanent high CFC values over the Atlantic sector during all the year and during summer over the eastern Arctic Ocean. Lower values are found in the rest of the analysed area especially over Greenland and the Canadian Archipelago, nearly continuously during all the months. These results are confirmed by CFC trends and variability. Statistically significant trends were found during all the months over the Greenland Sea, particularly during the winter season (negative, less than -5 % dec (-1)) and over the Beaufort Sea in spring (positive, more than +5 % dec (-1)). CFC variability, investigated by the Empirical Orthogonal Functions, shows a substantial "non-variability" in the Northern Atlantic Ocean. Statistically significant correlations between CFC principal components elements and both the Pacific Decadal Oscillation index and Pacific North America patterns are found.

TI  - Performance Assessment of the COMET Cloud Fractional Cover Climatology across Meteosat Generations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The CM SAF Cloud Fractional Cover dataset from Meteosat First and Second Generation (COMET, https://doi.org/10.5676/EUM_SAF_CM/CFC_METEOSAT/V001) covering 1991-2015 has been recently released by the EUMETSAT Satellite Application Facility for Climate Monitoring (CM SAF). COMET is derived from the MVIRI and SEVIRI imagers aboard geostationary Meteosat satellites and features a Cloud Fractional Cover (CFC) climatology in high temporal (1 h) and spatial (0.05 degrees x 0.05 degrees) resolution. The CM SAF long-term cloud fraction climatology is a unique long-term dataset that resolves the diurnal cycle of cloudiness. The cloud detection algorithm optimally exploits the limited information from only two channels (broad band visible and thermal infrared) acquired by older geostationary sensors. The underlying algorithm employs a cyclic generation of clear sky background fields, uses continuous cloud scores and runs a naive Bayesian cloud fraction estimation using concurrent information on cloud state and variability. The algorithm depends on well-characterized infrared radiances (IR) and visible reflectances (VIS) from the Meteosat Fundamental Climate Data Record (FCDR) provided by EUMETSAT. The evaluation of both Level-2 (instantaneous) and Level-3 (daily and monthly means) cloud fractional cover (CFC) has been performed using two reference datasets: ground-based cloud observations (SYNOP) and retrievals from an active satellite instrument (CALIPSO/CALIOP). Intercomparisons have employed concurrent state-of-the-art satellite-based datasets derived from geostationary and polar orbiting passive visible and infrared imaging sensors (MODIS, CLARA-A2, CLAAS-2, PATMOS-x and CC4CL-AVHRR). Averaged over all reference SYNOP sites on the monthly time scale, COMET CFC reveals (for 0-100% CFC) a mean bias of -0.14%, a root mean square error of 7.04% and a trend in bias of -0.94% per decade. The COMET shortcomings include larger negative bias during the Northern Hemispheric winter, lower precision for high sun zenith angles and high viewing angles, as well as an inhomogeneity around 1995/1996. Yet, we conclude that the COMET CFC corresponds well to the corresponding SYNOP measurements, and it is thus useful to extend in both space and time century-long ground-based climate observations.

TI  - Performance Analysis of Satellite Missions for Multi-Temporal SAR Interferometry
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal InSAR (MTI) applications pose challenges related to the availability of coherent scattering from the ground surface, the complexity of the ground deformations, atmospheric artifacts, and visibility problems related to ground elevation. Nowadays, several satellite missions are available providing interferometric SAR data at different wavelengths, spatial resolutions, and revisit time. A new and interesting opportunity is provided by Sentinel-1, which has a spatial resolution comparable to that of previous ESA C-band sensors, and revisit times improved by up to 6 days. According to these different SAR space-borne missions, the present work discusses current and future opportunities of MTI applications in terms of ground instability monitoring. Issues related to coherent target detection, mean velocity precision, and product geo-location are addressed through a simple theoretical model assuming backscattering mechanisms related to point scatterers. The paper also presents an example of a multi-sensor ground instability investigation over Lesina Marina, a village in Southern Italy lying over a gypsum diapir, where a hydration process, involving the underlying anhydride, causes a smooth uplift and the formation of scattered sinkholes. More than 20 years of MTI SAR data have been processed, coming from both legacy ERS and ENVISAT missions, and latest-generation RADARSAT-2, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1A sensors. Results confirm the presence of a rather steady uplift process, with limited to null variations throughout the whole monitored time-period.

TI  - On the detectability of adjacency effects in ocean color remote sensing of mid-latitude coastal environments by SeaWiFS, MODIS-A, MERIS, OLCI, OLI and MSI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The detectability of adjacency effects (AE) in ocean color remote sensing by SeaWiFS, MODIS-A, MERIS, OLCI, OLI and MSI is theoretically assessed for typical observation conditions up to 36 km offshore (20 km for MSI). The methodology detailed in Bulgarelli et al. (2014) is applied to expand previous investigations to the wide range of terrestrial land covers and water types usually encountered in mid-latitude coastal environments. Simulations fully account for multiple scattering within a stratified atmosphere bounded by a non-uniform reflecting surface, sea surface roughness, sun position and off-nadir sensor view. A harmonized comparison of AE is ensured by adjusting the radiometric sensitivity of each sensor to the same input radiance. Results show that average AE in data from MODIS-A, and from MERIS and OLCI in reduced spatial resolution, are still above the sensor noise level (NL) at 36 km offshore, except for AE caused by green vegetation at the red wavelengths. Conversely, in data from the less sensitive SeaWiFS, OLI and MSI sensors, as well as from MERIS and OLCI in full spatial resolution, sole AE caused by highly reflecting land covers (such as snow, dry vegetation, white sand and concrete) are above the sensor NL throughout the transect, while AE originated from green vegetation and bare soil at visible wavelengths may become lower than NL at close distance from the coast. Such a distance increases with the radiometric resolution of the sensor. It is finally observed that AE are slightly sensitive to the water type only at the blue wavelengths. Notably, for an atmospheric correction scheme inferring the aerosol properties from NIR data, perturbations induced by AE at NIR and visible wavelengths might compensate each other. As a consequence, biases induced by AE on radiometric products (e.g., the water-leaving radiance) are not strictly correlated to the intensity of the reflectance of the nearby land.

TI  - A remote sensing-based model of tidal marsh aboveground carbon stocks for the conterminous United States
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing based maps of tidal marshes, both of their extents and carbon stocks, have the potential to play a key role in conducting greenhouse gas inventories and implementing climate mitigation policies. Our objective was to generate a single remote sensing model of tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon that represents nationally diverse tidal marshes within the conterminous United States (CONUS). We developed the first calibration-grade, national-scale dataset of aboveground tidal marsh biomass, species composition, and aboveground plant carbon content (%C) from six CONUS regions: Cape Cod, MA, Chesapeake Bay, MD, Everglades, FL, Mississippi Delta, LA, San Francisco Bay, CA, and Puget Sound, WA. Using the random forest machine learning algorithm, we tested whether imagery from multiple sensors, Sentinel-1 C-band synthetic aperture radar, Landsat, and the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP), can improve model performance. The final model, driven by six Landsat vegetation indices and with the soil adjusted vegetation index as the most important (n = 409, RMSE = 310 g/m2, 10.3% normalized RMSE), successfully predicted biomass for a range of marsh plant functional types defined by height, leaf angle and growth form. Model results were improved by scaling field-measured biomass calibration data by NAIP-derived 30 m fraction green vegetation. With a mean plant carbon content of 44.1% (n = 1384, 95% C.I. = 43.99%-44.37%), we generated regional 30 m aboveground carbon density maps for estuarine and palustrine emergent tidal marshes as indicated by a modified NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program map. We applied a multivariate delta method to calculate uncertainties in regional carbon densities and stocks that considered standard error in map area, mean biomass and mean %C. Louisiana palustrine emergent marshes had the highest C density (2.67 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha) of all regions, while San Francisco Bay brackish/saline marshes had the highest C density of all estuarine emergent marshes (2.03 +/- 0.004 Mg/ha). Estimated C stocks for predefined jurisdictional areas ranged from 1023 +/- 39 Mg in the Nisqually National Wildlife Refuge in Washington to 507,761 +/- 14,822 Mg in the Terrebonne and St. Mary Parishes in Louisiana. This modeling and data synthesis effort will allow for aboveground C stocks in tidal marshes to be included in the coastal wetland section of the U.S. National Greenhouse Gas Inventory. With the increased availability of free post-processed satellite data, we provide a tractable means of modeling tidal marsh aboveground biomass and carbon at the global extent as well.

TI  - Increased nutrients from aeolian-dust and riverine origin decrease the CO<sub>2</sub>-sink capacity of coastal South Atlantic waters under UVR exposure
T2  - LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increases in ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels due to the ongoing stratification of water bodies and higher nutrient concentrations either through riverine or aeolian-dust-inputs are expected in the near future in coastal surface waters. Here, we combined remote-sensing data of particulate organic carbon (POC; 1997-2016 period), observational data of solar radiation (1999-2015 period), and a mid-term experimental approach with coastal plankton communities from South Atlantic Ocean (SAO) to test how the interaction between increased nutrients by riverine and aeolian-dust inputs and high UVR may alter the community dynamics and the CO2 sink capacity of these ecosystems in the future. Our results show a decline similar to 27% in the sink capacity of the coastal ecosystems regardless of the nutrient source considered and under high UVR levels. This decreased CO2 uptake was coupled with a high dynamic photoinhibition and dark recovery of photosystem II and shifts in the community structure toward the dominance by nano-flagellates. Moreover, remote-sensing data also evidences an incipient tipping point with decreasing POC values in this area over the annual planktonic succession. Therefore, we propose that to continue this climate and human-mediated pressure, these metabolic responses could be strengthened and extended to other productive coastal areas.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Variations in NO<sub>2</sub> and PM<sub>2.5</sub> over the Central Plains Economic Region of China during 2005-2015 Based on Satellite Observations
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Central Plains Economic Region (CPER) is located in central eastern China and has experienced tremendous economic growth in the last decade. Like many areas in China, the rapid economic development of the CPER has led to serious air pollution problems, including extremely high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 jam (PM2.5). However, the current air pollution monitoring system lacks good spatial and temporal coverage. Therefore, we used high-resolution satellite remote sensing techniques to analyze the variation in NO2 and PM2.5 in the CPER from 2005 through 2015. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to retrieve the tropospheric NO2 columns and ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. High NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were mainly located in the central and northern areas of the CPER. The highest 11-year average concentrations were found in the city of Jiaozuo for NO2 (19.54 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2)) and in the city of Hebi for PM2.5 (107.8 mu g m(-3)). The western and southern mountainous areas had lower NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations. The average seasonal NO2 and PM2.5 concentrations were both highest in winter and lowest in summer The average monthly concentrations of NO2 and PM2.5 were as high as 24.60 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) and 152.2 mu g m(-3), respectively, in January 2013 and as low as 43.86 x 10(15) molecules cm(-2) and 40.2 mu g respectively, in July 2006. During the 11-year study period (2005-2015), the CPER concentrations of both NO2 and PM2.5 decreased from 2011 to 2015 by 31.5% and 36.8%, respectively. This study successfully applies satellite remote sensing data to quantitatively analyze the spatial-temporal distributions of tropospheric NO2 and ground-level PM2.5. This approach can support air pollution monitoring in the CPER, and the estimated concentrations can provide references for environmental policymaking.

TI  - Do water bodies play an important role in the relationship between urban form and land surface temperature?
T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water bodies are considered an effective factor in mitigating urban heat island (UHI) effects in large cities. In Chongqing, the largest city in western China, using Landsat 8 data obtained in the daytime during the summer, we analyzed the potential influence of the cooling effects of water bodies on the urban land surface temperature (LST) based on the gradient of the distance to the water bodies (DIST). The results indicate that the cooling effect of water bodies can reach one kilometer (horizontal distance) and have a great impact on the relationship between the urban form factors and LST, particularly at a DIST less than 500 m. The sampling was performed in a 250 m x 250 m grid size, and correlations between four urban form factors (i.e., sky view factor, building density, mean building height and floor area ratio) and the LST gradually increased as the DIST increased. According to the multiple linear regression model, the DIST is an important independent variable at a DIST less than 500 m. This study may help researchers better understand the influence of urban form factors on thermal comfort considering water bodies.

TI  - Remote sensing data to assess compositional and structural indicators in dry woodland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Integrating field-based and remotely sensed data has proven valuable for assessing on-the-ground diversity of plants across a range of spatial scales. Here we assessed whether remotely sensed data is a good indicator of vegetation composition and structure in dry, Prosopis flexuosa-dominated woodlands. Our objectives were (1) to quantify on-the-ground vegetation composition and structure using (A) field-based methods and (B) remotely sensed images and analysis techniques, and (2) to evaluate how well the data extracted from remotely sensed data estimate field-based measures of vegetation composition and structure. We selected 40 individuals of P. flexuosa in Ischigualasto Provincial Park (San Juan, Argentina) and its influence zone. Each individual was the center of a plot (1500-m(2)) where we recorded richness (compositional indicator) and abundance (structural indicator) of trees, shrubs and other plants (i.e. cacti, grasses and forbs). To assess woodland structure, we evaluated canopy area of each P. fiexuosa and the proportion of adult P. flexuosa trees in a plot. In addition, we used Landsat 8 OLI to calculate SATVI (Soil Adjusted Total Vegetation Index) values from the pixel that corresponds with the center of each sample plot, and then estimated first- and second-order texture measures (in 3 x 3 and 5 x 5 moving window sizes). We fitted generalized linear models with different error distributions. Vegetation richness was significantly and directly related to range and entropy (3 x 3 and 5 x 5 windows). Both trees and shrubs, were related to SATVI values and first- and second-order means (3 x 3 and 5 x 5 windows). Moreover, shrub abundance was inversely related to range and entropy (5 x 5 window); and the "other plants" group was inversely related to first- and second-order means in the same window. Variance of the canopy area was directly related to range (5 x 5 window); however, proportion of adults was not related to remote sensing data. Our findings suggest satellite imagery-derived image texture is a valuable tool for management and conservation, and can indicate areas of high plant species richness and abundance of trees and shrubs and help differentiate areas of different canopy sizes in dry P. fiexuosa-dominated woodlands of Argentina.

TI  - A Critical Comparison of Remote Sensing Leaf Area Index Estimates over Rice-Cultivated Areas: From Sentinel-2 and Landsat-7/8 to MODIS, GEOV1 and EUMETSAT Polar System
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical variable fundamental in natural vegetation and agricultural land monitoring and modelling studies. This paper is aimed at comparing, validating and discussing different LAI satellite products from operational services and customized solution based on innovative Earth Observation (EO) data such as Landsat-7/8 and Sentinel-2A. The comparison was performed to assess overall quality of LAI estimates for rice, as a fundamental input of different scale (regional to local) operational crop monitoring systems such as the ones developed during the An Earth obseRvation Model based RicE information Service (ERMES) project. We adopted a multiscale approach following international recognized protocols of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Land Product Validation (LPV) guidelines in different steps: (1) acquisition of representative field sample measurements, (2) validation of decametric satellite product (10-30 m spatial resolution), and (3) exploitation of such data to assess quality of medium-resolution operational products (similar to 1000 m). The study areas were located in the main European rice areas in Spain, Italy and Greece. Field campaigns were conducted during three entire rice seasons (2014, 2015 and 2016from sowing to full-flowering) to acquire multi-temporal ground LAI measurements and to assess Landsat-7/8 LAI estimates. Results highlighted good correspondence between Landsat-7/8 LAI estimates and ground measurements revealing high correlations (R-2 0.89) and low root mean squared errors (RMSE 0.75) in all seasons. Landsat-7/8 as well as Sentinel-2A high-resolution LAI retrievals, were compared with satellite LAI products operationally derived from MODIS (MOD15A2), Copernicus PROBA-V (GEOV1), and the recent EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) LAI product. Good agreement was observed between high- and medium-resolution LAI estimates. In particular, the EPS LAI product was the most correlated product with both Landsat/7-8 and Sentinel-2A estimates, revealing R-2 0.93 and RMSE 0.53 m(2)/m(2). In addition, a comparison exercise of EPS, GEOV1 and MODIS revealed high correlations (R-2 0.90) and RMSE 0.80 m(2)/m(2) in all cases and years. The temporal assessment shows that the three satellite products capture well the seasonality during the crop phenological cycle. Discrepancies are observed mainly in absolute values retrieved for the peak of rice season. This is the first study that provides a quantitative assessment on the quality of available operational LAI product for rice monitoring to both the scientific community and users of agro-monitoring operational services.

TI  - Comparison of remotely sensed PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations between developed and developing countries: Results from the US, Europe, China, and India
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the modern trend toward globalization and economic integration, the prevention and control of PM2.5 pollution is not a problem that is unique to particular regions or countries; instead, it is a common challenge for the whole world. In this context, studies that perform comparative analyses of spatiotemporal changes in PM2.5 concentrations between developed and developing countries play an important role in the prevention and control of PM2.5 pollution globally. Remote sensing is an appropriate technique to carry out inter -country comparisons of PM2.5 concentrations. Here, we select the US and Europe, which represent developed countries, and China and India, which represent developing countries, for study. Remotely sensed data, including PM2.5 concentration, land use/cover, and gridded population data, are then collected. We systematically compare the differences in the PM2.5 concentrations and their trends among the four selected countries from 2000 to 2015. Further, the impact of urbanization on PM2.5 concentrations and the risks of exposure to PM2.5 are discussed. We find that PM2.5 concentrations have decreased over time in the US and Europe, whereas rapid increases have occurred in China and India. Trend analysis shows that the PM2.5 concentrations have been stable in most regions of the US and Europe, whereas they have increased rapidly in most regions of China and India, especially in urban regions and new expansions of urban regions. An analysis of the risk of exposure to PM2.5 shows that, as of 2015, large proportions of the populations of China, India, the US, and Europe (>99.00%, >99.00%, similar to 46.53%, and similar to 88.00%, respectively) live in conditions that exceed the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guideline of 10 mu g/m(3). The risk of exposure to PM2.5 cannot be ignored. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Water Balance-Based, Spatiotemporal Evaluation of Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Products across the Contiguous United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate gridded estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) are essential to the analysis of terrestrial water budgets. In this study, ET estimates from three gridded energy balance-based products (ETEB) with independent model formations and data forcings are evaluated for their ability to capture long-term climatology and interannual variability in ET derived from a terrestrial water budget (ETEB) for 671 gauged basins across the contiguous United States. All three ETEB products have low spatial bias and accurately capture interannual variability of ETEB in the central United States, where ETEB and ancillary estimates of change in total surface water storage (Delta TWS) from the GRACE satellite project appear to close terrestrial water budgets. In humid regions, ETEB products exhibit higher long-term bias, and the covariability of ETEB and ETEB decreases significantly. Several factors related to either failure of ETEB, such as errors in Delta TWS and precipitation, or failure of ETEB, such as treatment of snowfall and horizontal heat advection, explain some of these discrepancies. These results mirror and build on conclusions from other studies: on interannual time scales, Delta TWS and error in precipitation estimates are nonnegligible uncertainties in ET estimates based on a terrestrial water budget, and this confounds their comparison to energy balance ET models. However, there is also evidence that in at least some regions, climate and landscape features may also influence the accuracy and long-term bias of ET estimates from energy balance models, and these potential errors should be considered when using these gridded products in hydrologic applications.

TI  - Two-source energy balance modeling of evapotranspiration in Alpine grasslands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - This work aims to assess a diagnostic approach which links evapotranspiration (ET) to land surface temperature (LST) measured by thermal remote sensing in the Alps. We estimated gridded ET, from field (30 m) to regional (1 km) scales, and we performed a specific study on grassland ecosystems in the Alps in South Tyrol (Italy), to evaluate the model sensitivity to different types of land management. The energy balance model TSEB ALEXI (Two Source Energy Balance Atmosphere Land EXchange Inverse) was first applied to Meteosat satellite data. Then ET was estimated by the flux disaggregation procedure DisALEXI, driven by MODIS and Landsat LST retrievals, which has never been applied before in a mountain region. We evaluated the model against eddy covariance (EC) measurements from established stations in the Alps, and analyzed the main limitations which affect the model performance in mountainous regions. The TSEB model, applied in plot-scale mode using tower based meteorological and LST input data, performed well with errors in daytime (6-18 UTC + 1) latent heat flux around 30-60 W m(-2) in comparison with flux measurements corrected for the lack of closure in the energy balance. For landscape ET retrievals, while Landsat resolution (30 m) is preferable for capturing small-scale heterogeneity in landscape moisture conditions, and for direct comparison with tower fluxes, persistent cloud cover resulted in no clear Landsat scenes during the study period. MODIS-based retrievals at 1 km resolution are too coarse to resolve the flux tower footprint in this complex landscape, yielding discrepancies of 100 W m(-2) in model-measurement comparisons. Still, MODIS DisALEXI partitioning of the energy budget was reasonable and enabled to detect evaporative stress at regional scale expressed as the ratio between actual and potential ET, WET. We evaluated WET in comparison with a crop stress index based on cumulative air temperature and precipitation at different stations in the study area, and investigated ability to capture differential responses between managed and unmanaged grasslands. Results show that in the Alps i) moderate resolution thermal data can be used to monitor evaporative stress at the regional scale; ii) the spatial-temporal evolution of ET can be characterized from MODIS and Landsat thermal data with limitations which are due to the low availability of clear-sky scenes and to the small-scale (similar to 10 m) changes in soil moisture, topography and canopy density, which control ET patterns in mountainous regions; iii) solar radiation and leaf area index are critical variables which strongly affect the accuracy of the modeled energy fluxes.

TI  - Effect of Cyclone Thane in the Bay of Bengal Explored Using Moored Buoy Observations and Multi-platform Satellite Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work examines the response of the upper ocean during the passage of cyclone Thane (December 25-30, 2011) over the Bay of Bengal. Observations from a moored buoy are employed to assess the changes in the upper 100 m depth of the ocean. Observations revealed strong temperature inversion prevailing in this region. The temperature inversion resulted in varying response in the subsurface, with warming in the upper 40 m depth and cooling in the depths of 40-80 m at the moored buoy location. Analysis of subsurface temperature and salinity revealed the signatures of vertical mixing induced by Thane. The subsurface currents are observed as strongly responding to the cyclone winds. Analysis revealed that the influence of Thane was generally confined to within 100 m depth. Intense biological response is revealed along the track of the cyclone. However, the bloom is localized in two distinct regions: one in the central Bay and other off the south-western coastal region. This is attributed to the intense Ekman pumping velocity, slow translation speed and the availability of nitrate concentration in the shallow coastal waters.

TI  - Assessment of MODIS-derived indices (2001-2013) to drought across Taiwan's forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical and subtropical ecosystems, the largest terrestrial carbon pools, are very susceptible to the variability of seasonal precipitation. However, the assessment of drought conditions in these regions is often overlooked due to the preconceived notion of the presence of high humidity. Drought indices derived from remotely sensed imagery have been commonly used for large-scale monitoring, but feasibility of drought assessment may vary across regions due to climate regimes and local biophysical conditions. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the feasibility of 11 commonly used MODIS-derived vegetation/drought index in the forest regions of Taiwan through comparison with the station-based standardized precipitation index with a 3-month time scale (SPI3). The drought indices were further transformed (standardized anomaly, SA) to make them better delineate the spatiotemporal variations of drought conditions. The results showed that the Normalized Difference Infrared Index utilizing the near-infrared and shortwave infrared bands (NDII6) may be more superior to other indices in delineating drought patterns. Overall, the NDII6 SA-SPI3 pair yielded the highest correlation (mean r +/- standard deviation = 0.31 +/- 0.13) and was most significant in central and south Taiwan (r = 0.50-0.90) during the cold, dry season (January and April). This study illustrated that the NDII6 is suitable to delineate drought conditions in a relatively humid region. The results suggested the better performance of the NDII6 SA-SPI3 across the high climate gradient, especially in the regions with dramatic interannual amplifications of rainfall. This synthesis was conducted across a wide bioclimatic gradient, and the findings could be further generalized to a much broader geographical extent.

TI  - System Noise Removal for Gaofen-4 Area-Array Camera
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Gaofen-4 is a geostationary orbit area array imaging satellite. Due to the difficulty of the on-orbit radiometric calibration of area array cameras, there is system noise in the images. This paper analyzes the source of the system noise, constructs a noise model of Gaofen-4, and proposes a practical method to remove the system noise using multiple images. Gaussian filtering is used to remove radiometric characteristics, and the Grubbs criterion is used to remove gradient characteristics, thereby transforming the images into noise images. System noise can be removed using correction coefficients obtained by superimposing multiple noise images. Using a variety of denoising methods to perform contrast experiments, the results show that the proposed method can effectively maintain image edge details and texture information while removing image noise.

TI  - Climate and anthropogenic contributions to the desiccation of the second largest saline lake in the twentieth century
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urmia Lake, once the second largest saline lake in the world, is on the verge of complete desiccation. It has been suggested that the desiccation is caused by intensified human activities, especially irrigation, and prolonged droughts in the lake basin, but there is a lack of quantitative analysis to attribute the observed water level decline to natural and anthropogenic causes. In this study, we use remote sensing data, ground observations, and a hydrological model with human impact assessment capabilities (HiGW-MAT) to investigate the natural and human-induced changes in the hydrology of Urmia Lake basin from 1980 to 2010. Based on the analysis of remote sensing data, we find a similar to 98% and similar to 180% increase in agricultural lands and urban areas, respectively, from 1987 through 2016, with a corresponding shrinkage in lake area by similar to 86%. Further, we use model results to examine the changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) over the basin including the lake. Results indicate that TWS declined over the lake region and the lake lost water at a faster rate than the watershed did. Comparison of river inflow to the lake from two simulations-one with and the other without human activities-suggests that human water management activities caused a reduction in streamfiow of similar to 1.74 km(3)/year from 1995 to 2010, which accounts for similar to 86% of the total depletion in lake volume during the same period. It is also found that irrigation water requirement almost tripled, causing high withdrawals from rivers. These results demonstrate that the on-going depletion of Urmia Lake is not solely due to prolonged droughts but also due to direct anthropogenic alterations which caused significant changes in land use, streamflow, and water storage within the basin. This study provides important insights on the natural and human-induced changes in the hydrology of Urmia Lake and highlights the need for a high resolution regional scale modeling approach for better understanding potential future changes toward restoring the lake and putting forth a course of action to stop further desiccation and avoid a major environmental catastrophe.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of the Poyang Lake wetland by integrating Landsat and MODIS observations
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion models (STARFM) have limited practical applications, because they often enforce the invalid assumption that land cover change does not occur between prior/posterior and target dates. To deal with this challenge, we proposed a spatiotemporal adaptive fusion model for NDVI products (STAFFN), to better blend highly resolved spatial and temporal information from multiple sensors. Compared with existing spatiotemporal fusion models, the proposed model integrates an initial prediction into a hierarchical selection strategy of similar pixels, and can capture landscape changes very well. Experiments using spatial details and temporal abundance comparison among MODIS, Landsat, and fusion results show that the predicted data can accurately capture temporal changes while preserving fine-spatial-resolution details. Model comparison also shows that STAFFNs produce consistently lower biases than STARFMs and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion models (FSDAFs). A synthetic NDVI product (342 scenes in total) was produced with STAFFNs having a 16-day revisit frequency at 30-m spatial resolution from 2000 to 2014. With this product, we further provided a 15-year spatiotemporal change monitoring map of the Poyang Lake wetland. Results show that the water area in the dry season tended to lose 38.3 km(2) yr(-1) in coverage over the past 15 years, decreasing by 18.24% of the lake area between 2001 and 2014. The wetland vegetation group tended to increase in coverage, increasing by 10.08% of the lake area in the past 15 years. Our study indicates the STAFFN model can be reasonably applied in monitoring wetland dynamics, and can be easily adapted for the use with other ecosystems.

TI  - Does Surveillance Bias Influence the Validity of Measures of Inpatient Complications? A Systematic Review
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF MEDICAL QUALITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Surveillance bias may threaten the accuracy of inpatient complication measures. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine whether surveillance bias influences the validity of selected Patient Safety Indicator- and health care associated infection-related measures. Ten venous thromboembolism (VTE) articles were identified: 7 trauma related, 3 postoperative, and 1 central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) article. Nine VTE articles found positive associations between deep vein thrombosis imaging and VTE diagnoses. Because imaging also may be symptom driven, most studies performed additional analyses to corroborate findings. Six trauma-related and 2 postoperative VTE studies concluded that surveillance bias was present, the latter based on circumstantial evidence. The non-VTE study found a significant positive correlation between surveillance aggressiveness and intensive care unit CLABSI rates. Even considering VTE, relatively little is known about the impact of surveillance bias on inpatient complication measures. Given the implications of misclassifying hospitals on quality, this issue requires further investigation using more direct measurement methods.

For this purpose, at first, landslide locations were identified by earlier reports, aerial photographs, and field surveys and a total of 348 landslides were mapped from various sources in GIS. Then, the landslide inventory was randomly split into a training dataset (70% = 244 landslides) and the remaining (30% = 104 landslides) were used for validation. In this study, 12 landslide conditioning factors were applied to detect the most susceptible areas. These factors were slope aspect, altitude, distance to faults, lithology, normalized difference vegetation index, plan curvature, profile curvature, distance to rivers, distance to roads, slope angle, stream power index, and topographic wetness index. The relationship between each conditioning factor and landslide was finalized using a frequency ration (FR) model. Subsequently, landslide-susceptible areas were mapped using the MARS and RF models. The results revealed that the most important conditioning factors according to the accuracy measure (mean decrease) of the RF model are lithology (23.47%), distance to faults (22.21%), and altitude (19.58%). We also notice that altitude (19.04%), distance to faults (18.83%), and distance to roads (15.29%) have the highest importance according to the Gini measure. Finally, the accuracy of the landslide susceptibility maps produced from the two models was verified using a receiver operating characteristics curve. The results showed that the landslide susceptibility map produced using the MARS model has a higher prediction rate than RF by area under the curve values of 87.51 and 77.32%, respectively. According to the validation results, the map produced by the MARS model exhibits the better accuracy and could be proposed for land-use planning in the study area.

TI  - Multilevel Cloud Detection for High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery Using Multiple Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In high-resolution image data, multilevel cloud detection is a key task for remote sensing data processing. Generally, it is difficult to obtain high accuracy for multilevel cloud detection when using satellite imagery which only contains visible and near-infrared spectral bands. So, multilevel cloud detection for high-resolution remote sensing imagery is challenging. In this paper, a new multilevel cloud detection technique is proposed based on the multiple convolutional neural networks for high-resolution remote sensing imagery. In order to avoid input the entire image into the network for cloud detection, the adaptive simple linear iterative clustering (A-SCLI) algorithm was applied to the segmentation of the satellite image to obtain good-quality superpixels. After that, a new multiple convolutional neural networks (MCNNs) architecture is designed to extract multiscale features from each superpixel, and the superpixels are marked as thin cloud, thick cloud, cloud shadow, and non-cloud. The results suggest that the proposed method can detect multilevel clouds and obtain a high accuracy for high-resolution remote sensing imagery.

TI  - Extraction of Urban Water Bodies from High-Resolution Remote-Sensing Imagery Using Deep Learning
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate information on urban surface water is important for assessing the role it plays in urban ecosystem services in the context of human survival and climate change. The precise extraction of urban water bodies from images is of great significance for urban planning and socioeconomic development. In this paper, a novel deep-learning architecture is proposed for the extraction of urban water bodies from high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) imagery. First, an adaptive simple linear iterative clustering algorithm is applied for segmentation of the remote-sensing image into high-quality superpixels. Then, a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is designed that can extract useful high-level features of water bodies from input data in a complex urban background and mark the superpixel as one of two classes: an including water or no-water pixel. Finally, a high-resolution image of water-extracted superpixels is generated. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved higher accuracy for water extraction from the high-resolution remote-sensing images than traditional approaches, and the average overall accuracy is 99.14%.

TI  - A framework of Afrocentric hope: Rural South African children's conceptualizations of hope
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNITY PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a growing need to explore and understand indigenous knowledge and subjective experiences around hope from children raised in rural African communities. This engagement sought to address the question: What are rural South African primary school children's conceptualizations of hope? A visual participatory methodology (using collage-making, drawing, Mmogo method, and photovoice) enabled an exploration of hope with 12 children (9-13 years) attending an aftercare center in rural QwaQwa region of South Africa. Using evidence generated from the study, and drawing on Scioli's theory of integrated hope, this article posits a framework of Afrocentric hope that develops along four interdependent and interrelated levels: contextual, personal, relational, and collective. These interactions are mediated by the spiritual/cultural worldview dimension. Understanding rural South African children's perspectives of hope contributes toward engagements aimed at nurturing, shaping, and strengthening hope in collective-oriented communities.

TI  - Land use change detection using remote sensing approach
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover changes is one of the driving factor of global environmental change which is hotly debated and reflect the changes in development that occurs at a location. This study was conducted to analyze the changes in land use of UKM Bangi campus and Bandar Baru Bangi for 1990 and 2016. The remote sensing and GIS application were used to examine the land use changes. Data used in this study consist of two Landsat satellite imagery, which were taken from Landsat 5 TM (1990), and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (2016). Based on selected Landsat images the supervised classification process was applied to classify the land use types of the study area. Land uses have been divided into seven categories; built-up area, palm oil, forest, rubber, recreational, cleared land and water bodies. Accuracy assessment was carried out by using Kappa Koefficient calculation to test the reliability of the thematic maps. The Kappa Koefficient value of 70% was achieved and it indicates high reliability. The result of the study found that built-up area increased the most (2130.84 ha), followed by the forest (469.44 ha). Both land use increased by 32.92% and 7.25% respectively. Whereas oil palm land use decreased the most (1385.01 ha), followed by water bodies (124.38 ha) where both declined 21.40% dan 1.92% respectively. The majority of palm oil and rubber plantations were converted to built-up land use. The study shows that remote sensing approach is suitable for the study of land use and land cover changes.

T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Development in mountainous areas is inevitable in countries with high population densities, but the actual relationship between development and landslides remains uncertain. Clarifying the key current or historical factors resulting in landslides is crucial for hazard prevention and mitigation. This study focused on the Shihmen Reservoir catchment in Taiwan. Two combinations of explanatory variables in five different years (1946, 1971, 2001, 2004, and 2012) collected from a geodatabase and digital archives were used to conduct proximity and discrete logistic regression analyses. The results demonstrate that landslides increased dramatically from 1946 to 2012 in the catchment area. The proximity and overlapping of human development with landslides increased. However, the logistic regression results indicated that variation in susceptibility to landslides was due to natural causes, with the exception of historical deforestation and newly constructed road systems. Therefore, well-recovered historical woodland sites might currently be landslide-prone areas. We suggest that cumulative historical events should be considered as explanatory variables in future landslide prediction analysis. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the article, the notion of the body is viewed in the context of an anthropocentric view of Manakovsky. Analyze the concept of "human body" - "The body of heaven", which is depicted in Poem "Clouds in Trousers". The poetic speaker of Mayakovsky contrasts with the ordinary people, is in the form of Demiur, and his fate is to reform reality.The state of mind and the psychological wounds are depicted through the shapes of the body that characterize definitive forms. In manifesting the extraordinary nature of the situation of love, Mayakovsky created the code of avant-garde body of avant-garde (eyes, eyelids, nerves, forehead, head). Mayakovsky paints a picture of the immense body of the universe that corresponds to the concept of the Body of the Body. The celestial bodies and heavenly bodies being reflected are the repeated shapes of the "Cloud in the Trousers".Man is the central phenomenon of worldview in the poetic perception of Mayakovsky and is the norm of fundamental existence.

TI  - Normalized Difference Flood Index for rapid flood mapping: Taking advantage of EO big data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change projections foresee an increasing number of intense precipitation events with consequent flash and riverine floods. An accurate and rapid mapping of these phenomena is a key component of effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans. Earth Observation big data such as the ones acquired by the Copernicus programme, are providing unprecedented opportunities to detect changes and assess economic impacts in case of disasters.This paper presents an innovative flood mapping technique based on an index which is computed using multi temporal statistics of Synthetic Aperture Radar images. The index compares a large amount of reference scenes to those acquired during the investigated flood and allows an easy categorization of "flooded" areas; either areas solely temporarily covered by water or areas with mixed water and vegetation. The method has been developed specifically to exploit Sentinel-1 data but can be applied to any other sensor. It has been tested for the 2010 flood of Veneto (Italy) and the floods of 2015 in Malawi and Uganda. Extensive qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with other state-of-the art methods, proved the proposed approach highly reliable and particularly effective, allowing a precise, simple and fast flood mapping. Compared to the maps produced for emergency management for the event analyzed, we obtained an overall agreement of 96.7% for Malawi and an average of 96.5% for Veneto for the 5 maps presented.

TI  - Tale of Two Storms: Impact of Extreme Rain Events on the Biogeochemistry of Lake Superior
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is expected to profoundly affect the Great Lakes region of North America. An increase in intensity and frequency of rain events is anticipated to deliver more runoff and to increase riverine inputs to Lake Superior's ecosystem. The effects of these changes on key biogeochemical parameters were analyzed by coupling satellite data, water column sensor profiles, and discrete surface-water sampling after two 500-year flood events in the Lake Superior basin. This study provides both a spatial and a temporal sense of how plumes interacted within the ecosystem. We also determined the significant differences in water quality parameters for plume versus nonplume waters. These two plumes were important for delivery of nutrients, with variable transport of sediments and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM). Data from the 2012 storm event showed a significant input of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and CDOM to the system. In the 2016 storm event, carbon cycling parameters (acidity, total inorganic carbon, and dissolved organic carbon) and ammonia levels were elevated within the plume. In neither storm event was there a significant difference in chlorophyll a between plume and nonplume waters during our sampling cruises. These two plume events were similar in amount of precipitation, but their effect on the biogeochemistry of Lake Superior varied due to differences in the watersheds where the rain fell. The studied plume events were dynamic, changing with currents, winds, and the settling of suspended sediments.

AB  - When people think about landslides, they usually imagine large mud streams which cause considerable loss of life. Whereas such large-scale disasters are rare, smaller landslides are a much more frequent occurrence and pose a danger for traffic and housing in thousands of cities worldwide. In Italy, Google News is used to calibrate the 24-hour prediction models and slope-instability risk maps are produced every six days based on Sentinel-1 radar images. In fact, Prof Nicola Casagli from Florence University has high hopes for a geostationary European InSAR satellite which will enable the daily production of a map for assessing ground displacements of 1mm.

TI  - Heat island effect and its relationship with land use in Chengdu City
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat island effect, a typical feature of urban climate, plays an important role in urban planning and people's production and life. Based on the Landsat 8 TIRS data, we adopted the split window algorithm to estimate the surface temperature of the central urban area of Chengdu City at four different time points, and then analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of heat island effect and its influence factors. The algorithm achieved an accuracy of 1.6 K without synchronous meteorological observation data to adjust the atmospheric transmissivity. There was an obvious heat island effect in the central area of Chengdu, with the area of such lands accounting for about 30% of the total area. The spatial variation of surface temperature in spring and summer was obviously larger than that in winter. The heat island effect out of the third. ring was more obvious than that of the area within it. There was a high temperature area between Wuhou District and Shuangliu District. The negative correlation between normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) was the most obvious in summer, suggesting that urban heat island effect could be alleviated by planting green plants. The correlation between LST and modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) in summer was lower than that in spring and winter, indicating that water may have limited effect in alleviating urban heat island effect in summer. The positive correlation between normalized difference build. up index (NDBI) and LST at four time points showed that human activities may be an important cause of urban heat island effect, and thus NDBI is an effective index for urban heat island effect.
