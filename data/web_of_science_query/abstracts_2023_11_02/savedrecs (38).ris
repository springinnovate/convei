TI  - Fusing Retrievals of High Resolution Aerosol Optical Depth from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Observations over Urban Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have shown that the high-resolution satellite Landsat-8 has the capability to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) over urban areas at a 30 m spatial resolution. However, its long revisiting time and narrow swath limit the coverage and frequency of the high resolution AOD observations. With the increasing number of Earth observation satellites launched in recent years, combining the observations of multiple satellites can provide higher temporal-spatial coverage. In this study, a fusing retrieval algorithm is developed to retrieve high-resolution (30 m) aerosols over urban areas from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 A/B satellite measurements. The new fusing algorithm was tested and evaluated over Beijing city and its surrounding area in China. The validation results show that the retrieved AODs show a high level of agreement with the local urban ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD measurements, with an overall high coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.905 and small root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.119. Compared with the operational AOD products processed by the Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC-AOD), Sentinel Radiative Transfer Atmospheric Correction code (SEN2COR-AOD), and MODIS Collection 6 AOD (MOD04) products, the AOD retrieved from the new fusing algorithm based on the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 A/B observations exhibits an overall higher accuracy and better performance in spatial continuity over the complex urban area. Moreover, the temporal resolution of the high spatial resolution AOD observations was greatly improved (from 16/10/10 days to about two to four days over globe land in theory under cloud-free conditions) and the daily spatial coverage was increased by two to three times compared to the coverage gained using a single sensor.

TI  - An optimized machine learning approach to water pollution variation monitoring with time-series Landsat images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Non-point source (NPS) pollution has greatly threatened socio-economic development and human health due to water environment degradation. It is very important to quantitatively analyze spatio-temporal variation rules of NPS pollution sources surrounding drinking water source area (DWSA) and their impact on the water environment with time-series satellite images. In this paper, we study a systematic remote sensing monitoring method on DWSA of upper Huangpu River, Shanghai. Firstly, an optimized Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) classification algorithm, namely Mixed Kernel ELM with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO-MK-ELM) was constructed. Based on the PSO-MK-ELM, four NPS pollution sources- farmland, building land, woodland, and water were identified accurately and efficiently. Then their corresponding spatiotemporal analysis was performed with 30 years (1989-2019) Landsat images. On the basis of NPS pollution source area and census data from 1989 to 2017, the principal pollutants discharged into DWSA were also calculated with the common Export Coefficient Model (ECM). Finally, the contributions of the spatial and temporal changes of NPS pollution sources on pollutant emissions were analyzed. The result indicates the PSO-MK-ELM has an advantage of efficiency and accuracy in NPS pollution source extraction and our results are expected to provide a scientific basis and data support for NPS pollution control and DWSA protection for better practices for environmental management in megacities worldwide.

TI  - Long-term remote sensing monitoring on LUCC around Chaohu Lake with new information of algal bloom and flood submerging
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Human settlements are guided by the proximity or availability of a natural resource such as river or lake basins containing set of streams. The harmonious development of human activity and natural conditions along watershed areas needs close attention and in-depth study. In this paper, the urban agglomerations and ecological spaces in the Yangtze River Delta, China, the Chao Lake Basin and its surrounding watershed ecosystem is taken as research subject for its serious environmental degradation problems during social and economic development. This paper adopted an effective machine learning algorithm (kernel-ELM) to extract land use and land /cover information, and to analyze the land use/cover pattern evolution rules of the Chao Lake Basin with long term Landsat imagery. Subsequent studies were then carried out to demonstrate the flood-affected area and its ecological impact in the basin in 2020, to reveal the occupation on land cover types. The results indicate Conclusions are drawn from the experiment results: (1) There has been significant change in cultivated land, forest land and construction land out of six key land cover types with dynamic degree of -10.17%, 4.61, 67.04% respectively. (2) Algae bloom pollution was extracted from pattern classification results and it was up to 15% of the total water area by the year 2018. (3) The occupation on land use/cover types of the flood was revealed. The results prove effective application of remote sensing technology in environmental analysis and planning for datadriven evaluation of governing policy. This work serves as a scientific basis for environmental management and regional planning in the Chao Lake Basin and can be served as a basis and a reference for evaluating an ecological policy and its impact for other economic developing watershed human settlements with ecological issues.

TI  - Anthropogenic and Climatic Factors Differentially Affect Waterbody Area and Connectivity in an Urbanizing Landscape: A Case Study in Zhengzhou, China
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization alters the distribution and characteristics of waterbodies, potentially affecting both the habitat availability and connectivity for aquatic wildlife. We used Landsat satellite imagery to observe temporal and spatial changes in open-water habitats in Zhengzhou, a rapidly growing city in central China. We classified open water into six categories: perennial rivers, seasonal rivers and streams, canals, lakes, ponds, and reservoirs. From 1990 to 2020, in 5-year intervals, we identified, counted, and measured the area of each kind of waterbody, and we used a model selection approach with linear regressions to ask which climate and anthropogenic drivers were associated with these changes. We also used Conefor software to examine how these changes affected the landscape connectivity for waterfowl. Over the study period, lakes and canals were the only waterbody types to show statistically significant changes in surface area, increasing by 712% and 236%, respectively. Changes in lakes and canals were positively correlated with the length of water pipeline in the city. The connectivity of waterbodies fluctuated over the same period, mirroring fluctuations in the perennial Yellow River. Ponds contributed very little to landscape connectivity, and the importance of reservoirs decreased over time. Conversely, canals played an increasingly important role in landscape connectivity over time. Counterintuitively, the connectivity of waterbodies increased in the built-up part of the city. Our results show that urbanization can have unexpected effects-both positive and negative-on the connectivity and area of open-water habitats. These effects are likely to be important for waterfowl and other aquatic organisms.

TI  - Feasibility of the Spatiotemporal Fusion Model in Monitoring Ebinur Lake's Suspended Particulate Matter under the Missing-Data Scenario
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-frequency monitoring of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration can improve water resource management. Missing high-resolution satellite images could hamper remote-sensing SPM monitoring. This study resolved the problem by applying spatiotemporal fusion technology to obtain high spatial resolution and dense time-series data to fill image-data gaps. Three data sources (MODIS, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2) and two spatiotemporal fusion methods (the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data fusion (FSDAF)) were used to reconstruct missing satellite images. We compared their fusion accuracy and verified the consistency of fusion images between data sources. For the fusion images, we used random forest (RF) and XGBoost as inversion methods and set "fusion first " and "inversion first " strategies to test the method's feasibility in Ebinur Lake, Xinjiang, arid northwestern China. Our results showed that (1) the blue, green, red, and NIR bands of ESTARFM fusion image were better than FSDAF, with a good consistency (R-2 >= 0.54) between the fused Landsat 8, Sentinel 2 images, and their original images; (2) the original image and fusion image offered RF inversion effect better than XGBoost. The inversion accuracy based on Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 were R-2 0.67 and 0.73, respectively. The correlation of SPM distribution maps of the two data sources attained a good consistency of R-2 0.51; (3) in retrieving SPM from fused images, the "fusion first " strategy had better accuracy. The optimal combination was ESTARFM (Landsat 8)_RF and ESTARFM (Sentinel 2)_RF, consistent with original SPM maps (R-2 = 0.38, 0.41, respectively). Overall, the spatiotemporal fusion model provided effective SPM monitoring under the image-absence scenario, with good consistency in the inversion of SPM. The findings provided the research basis for long-term and high-frequency remote-sensing SPM monitoring and high-precision smart water resource management.

TI  - Analysis of the time-lag effects of climate factors on grassland productivity in Inner Mongolia
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the time-lag responses of grassland productivity to climate change is crucial for revealing grassland ecosystem behavior, predicting future grassland productivity, and guiding animal husbandry practices. This study developed a new analytical method to examine lag effects of climate change by integrating three techniques of time-lag effect analysis, time-lag accumulation computation and partial least-square regression. Net primary productivity (NPP) of vegetation was used as an evaluation indicator for grassland productivity. Based on the monthly scale of the continuous growing season (with a delay of 0-3 months), the effects of temperature and precipitation on grassland productivity of Inner Mongolia were assessed. The results showed that the correlation coefficient between the estimated NPP based on the CASA (Carnegie-AmesStanford Approach) model and the MOD17A3-NPP data reached 0.949. Compared with the estimation using CASA, the proportion of correlation coefficients for NPP derived from the PLS regression against temperature or precipitation was over 90% at P < 0.01. The lag effect of temperature and precipitation on grassland productivity was approximately 3 months. The contribution rates over 0-3 months gradually decreased from positive to negative. Over 89% of the study areas, the temperature and precipitation of the current month had the most considerable contribution to NPP. In the remaining areas, the strongest lag effect occurred in the second or third month.

TI  - Elevation change of the Urumqi Glacier No.1 derived from Sentinel-1A data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate measurements of glacier elevation changes play a crucial role in various glaciological studies related to glacier dynamics and mass balance. In this paper, glacier elevation changes of Urumqi Glacier No.1 between August 2015 and August 2017 were investigated using Sentinel-1A data and DInSAR technology. Meanwhile, the atmospheric delay error was corrected with the MODIS MOD05_L2 products. The weight selection iteration method was applied to calibrate the glacier elevation changes in the mass balance years 2015-2016 and 2016-2017. Finally, the geodetic method was employed to calculate the elevation change values of individual stakes of Urumqi Glacier No.1. Moreover, the elevation change values corrected by the weight selection iteration method were verified. Results showed as follows: (1) the elevation of Urumqi Glacier No.1 glacier affected by atmospheric delay was 1.270 cm from 2015 to 2016. The glacier elevation affected by atmospheric delay from 2016 to 2017 was 1.071 cm. (2) The elevation change value of Urumqi Glacier No.1 was -1.101 m from 2015 to 2016, and the elevation of Urumqi Glacier No.1 decreased by 1.299 m from 2016 to 2017. The overall thickness of Urumqi Glacier No. 1 was thinning. (3) By comparing the elevation change results of individual stakes with corresponding points corrected by the weight selection iteration method, the mean squared errors of difference were 0.343 m and 0.280 m between the two mass balance years, respectively. (4) The accuracy of elevation change in non-glaciated areas was 0.039 m from 2015 to 2016 and 0.034 m from 2016 to 2017. Therefore, it is reliable to use Sentinel-1A data and the study method proposed in this paper to calculate the elevation change of mountain glaciers with very low horizontal movement.

TI  - Monitoring Meteorological Drought in Southern China Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Severe meteorological drought is generally considered to lead to crop damage and loss. In this study, we created a new standard value by averaging the values distributed in the middle 30-70% instead of the traditional mean value, and we proposed a new index calculation method named Normalized Indices (NI) for meteorological drought monitoring after normalized processing. The TRMM-derived precipitation data, GLDAS-derived soil moisture data, and MODIS-derived vegetation condition data from 2003 to 2019 were used, and we compared the NI with commonly used Condition Indices (CI) and Anomalies Percentage (AP). Taking the mid-to-lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR) as an example, the drought monitoring results for paddy rice and winter wheat showed that (1) NI can monitor well the relative changes in real precipitation/soil moisture/vegetation conditions in both arid and humid regions, while meteorological drought was overestimated with CI and AP, and (2) due to the monitoring results of NI, the well-known drought event that occurred in the MLRYR from August to October 2019 had a much less severe impact on vegetation than expected. In contrast, precipitation deficiency induced an increase in sunshine and adequate heat resources, which improved crop growth in 78.8% of the area. This study discusses some restrictions of CI and AP and suggests that the new NI index calculation provides better meteorological drought monitoring in the MLRYR, thus offering a new approach for future drought monitoring studies.

TI  - High-resolution mapping of mainland China's urban floor area
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization studies are of global interest and mainly focus on mapping urban areas and areas of expansion using remote sensing data. However, information about the 3-dimensional characteristics or expansion of urban buildings is absent due to difficulties in data acquisition. Quantifying the urban floor area is crucial for assessing urban 3-D morphology. We used a random forest regression model to predict the first urban floor area of mainland China at a 130-m spatial resolution based on high spatial resolution nighttime light LUOJIA 1-01 images (130-m), a population map (100-m), and a single building dataset encompassing 71 cities. The predicted floor area (PFA) map for mainland China was estimated from the single building dataset of 50 cities, and data from the other 21 cities were used to estimate the accuracy. The results showed that the total accuracy of the PFA map is strong (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 7277.46 m2/ha). The PFA map overestimated the values in low value areas and underestimated the values in high value areas. The accuracy was also acceptable at the single city scale based on the results from six cities (R2 > 0.6). The calculated floor area map for 71 cities was merged with the PFA map by replacing the values in the corresponding locations to generate the final predicted floor area (FPFA) map, which enabled higher accuracy. The total floor area is 76038.39 km2, which is 0.79% of the total area of China. The general distribution of the floor area amount and intensity showed that the coastline had a higher intensity than the inner region of the country and the southern region had a higher intensity than the northern urban area along the coastline. The floor area distribution was extremely uneven among the provinces. The top six provinces represent 50.01% of the total floor area; however, the last six provinces represent only 3.31%. The high spatial resolution FPFA map of mainland China calculated by us has great potential application in urban ecology research, such as the impact of FPFA on heat island and haze.

TI  - Assessment and Comparison of Six Machine Learning Models in Estimating Evapotranspiration over Croplands Using Remote Sensing and Meteorological Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) over croplands on a regional scale can provide useful information for agricultural management. The hybrid ET model that combines the physical framework, namely the Penman-Monteith equation and machine learning (ML) algorithms, have proven to be effective in ET estimates. However, few studies compared the performances in estimating ET between multiple hybrid model versions using different ML algorithms. In this study, we constructed six different hybrid ET models based on six classical ML algorithms, namely the K nearest neighbor algorithm, random forest, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting algorithm, artificial neural network (ANN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), using observed data of 17 eddy covariance flux sites of cropland over the globe. Each hybrid model was assessed to estimate ET with ten different input data combinations. In each hybrid model, the ML algorithm was used to model the stomatal conductance (G(s)), and then ET was estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation, along with the ML-based G(s). The results showed that all hybrid models can reasonably reproduce ET of cropland with the models using two or more remote sensing (RS) factors. The results also showed that although including RS factors can remarkably contribute to improving ET estimates, hybrid models except for LSTM using three or more RS factors were only marginally better than those using two RS factors. We also evidenced that the ANN-based model exhibits the optimal performance among all ML-based models in modeling daily ET, as indicated by the lower root-mean-square error (RMSE, 18.67-21.23 W m(-2)) and higher correlations coefficient (r, 0.90-0.94). ANN are more suitable for modeling G(s) as compared to other ML algorithms under investigation, being able to provide methodological support for accurate estimation of cropland ET on a regional scale.

TI  - Heat Islands of Small Towns and Villages in Moscow Region
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat island, which are thermal anomalies in the field of surface temperatures, have been studied for the first time for different towns and villages of Moscow region and its surroundings. The studies have been carried out on the basis of radiometric measurements from Terra and Aqua satellites for the example of one year. The intensity of this phenomenon Delta T-S has been defined as the temperature difference between the average surface temperature in urban places and in the surrounding rural places. The intensity varies from weakly negative values for small villages including the surrounding forest edge, close to zero values for the smallest towns (Vereya), and up to 2.6 degrees C for the biggest city in the region (Moscow). According to the more precise data of the Landsat satellite, Delta T-S > 0 degrees C even in the smallest settlements. The intensity of the urban heat islands depends on both the population (ranging from 10(1) to 10(7) ppl.) and the area of settlements (ranging from 10(-1) to 10(3) km(2)). These dependencies are reliably described by exponential functions. In most places, the annual course of Delta T-S is characterized by a maximum in summer during active plant vegetation and a minimum in fall or winter. The differences in the intensity of the surface urban heat islands between Moscow and the small towns of the Moscow region are statistically reliable. The influence of the edge effects for the satellite data with spatial resolution of 1 km(2) leads to significant underestimation of the real intensity of the urban heat island if the town area is less than 20-25 km(2).

TI  - Mapping the vegetation distribution and dynamics of a wetland using adaptive-stacking and Google Earth Engine based on multi-source remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland vegetation is susceptible to climate change and human disturbance, and has experienced significant losses and degradation. However, the spatial patterns of dynamics for China's inland lake wetlands remain unknown. In this paper, an adaptive-stacking algorithm based on Google Earth Engine was proposed to map the vegetation distribution of Dongting Lake wetland using Sentinel-1/2 and DEM data. Subsequently, LandTrendr was utilized to analyze vegetation dynamics over the 1999-2018 based on Landsat normalized combustion ratio time-series. By overlaying the latest vegetation types and spatial distribution of vegetation dynamics, the main types of vegetation change were examined. Results showed that the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of adaptive-stacking classification were 94.59% and 0.92, respectively, which were higher than those of support vector machine and random forest. The overall accuracy of change detection for three types (vegetation gain, vegetation loss, and no changes) was 83.67%. In the past 20 years, 2,604.43 and 5,458.84 km2 land has experienced vegetation loss and gain, respectively. The increase in the areas of forest, reed, and sedge in wetland were 1330.39, 86.42, 136.97 km2, respectively. We found that the overall recovery condition of the wetland vegetation around Dongting Lake was good, which demonstrated the key role played by the national wetland ecological protection policy.

TI  - Remote Sensing Estimation of Suspended Solids Concentrations in Coastal and Inland Waters Based on Quasi-Analytical Algorithm
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended solids (TSS) in water plays a key role in aquatic ecosystems, due to its influences on light propagation in waters and the biological functions of waters. With the bio-optical data collected during 2009-2011 from Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake, Poyang Lake, Pearl River Estuary, and Daya Bay, this work analyzed the remote sensing response bands for variations of TSS concentrations and constructed a remote sensing-based quantitative estimation model for TSS concentrations in coastal and inland waters. The visible infrared imaging radiometer suite (VIIRS) satellite remote sensing data were employed to obtain the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of the TSS concentrations. The results show that the model of the band ratio [R-rs (865)/k(d) (555)] contributed by different components of water can explain 81% of the TSS concentration changes. In the model, the R-rs(865) is the remote sensing reflectance at 865 nm and the k(d)(555) is the attenuation coefficient of the waters at 555 nm. Compared with other empirical models that have been reported, this model has significantly improved estimation accuracy. The verification results show that the model can be applied to coastal and inland waters. When applied to pre-processed VIIRS satellite remote sensing data, it can reveal the spatial and seasonal variations of TSS concentrations of in waters from Taihu Lake and the Pearl River Estuary.

TI  - Long-Term Projection of Water Cycle Changes over China Using RegCM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The global water cycle is becoming more intense in a warming climate, leading to extreme rainstorms and floods. In addition, the delicate balance of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff affects the variations in soil moisture, which is of vital importance to agriculture. A systematic examination of climate change impacts on these variables may help provide scientific foundations for the design of relevant adaptation and mitigation measures. In this study, long-term variations in the water cycle over China are explored using the Regional Climate Model system (RegCM) developed by the International Centre for Theoretical Physics. Model performance is validated through comparing the simulation results with remote sensing data and gridded observations. The results show that RegCM can reasonably capture the spatial and seasonal variations in three dominant variables for the water cycle (i.e., precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff). Long-term projections of these three variables are developed by driving RegCM with boundary conditions of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model under the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The results show that increased annual average precipitation and evapotranspiration can be found in most parts of the domain, while a smaller part of the domain is projected with increased runoff. Statistically significant increasing trends (at a significant level of 0.05) can be detected for annual precipitation and evapotranspiration, which are 0.02 and 0.01 mm/day per decade, respectively, under RCP4.5 and are both 0.03 mm/day per decade under RCP8.5. There is no significant trend in future annual runoff anomalies. The variations in the three variables mainly occur in the wet season, in which precipitation and evapotranspiration increase and runoff decreases. The projected changes in precipitation minus evapotranspiration are larger than those in runoff, implying a possible decrease in soil moisture.

TI  - Seasonal Surface Fluctuation of a Slow-Moving Landslide Detected by Multitemporal Interferometry (MTI) on the Huafan University Campus, Northern Taiwan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A slow-moving landslide on the Huafan University campus, which is located on a dip slope in northern Taiwan, has been observed since 1990. However, reliable monitoring data are difficult to acquire after 2018 due to the lack of continuous maintenance of the field measurement equipment. In this study, the multitemporal interferometry (MTI) technique is applied with Sentinel-1 SAR images to monitor the slow-moving landslide from 2014-2019. The slow-moving areas detected by persistent scatterer (PS) pixels are consistent with the range of previous studies, which are based on in situ monitoring data and field surveys. According to the time series of the PS pixels, a long period gravity-induced deformation of the slow-moving landslide can be clearly observed. Moreover, a short period seasonal surface fluctuation of the slow-moving landslide, which has seldom been discussed before, can also be detected in this study. The seasonal surface fluctuation is in-phase with precipitation, which is inferred to be related to the geological and hydrological conditions of the study area. The MTI technique can compensate for the lack of surface displacement data, in this case, the Huafan University campus, and provide information for evaluating and monitoring slow-moving landslides for possible landslide early warning in the future.

TI  - Extraction of Offshore Aquaculture Areas from Medium-Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is important for aquaculture monitoring, scientific planning, and management to extract offshore aquaculture areas from medium-resolution remote sensing images. However, in medium-resolution images, the spectral characteristics of offshore aquaculture areas are complex, and the offshore land and seawater seriously interfere with the extraction of offshore aquaculture areas. On the other hand, in medium-resolution images, due to the relatively low image resolution, the boundaries between breeding areas are relatively fuzzy and are more likely to 'adhere' to each other. An improved U-Net model, including, in particular, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) structure and an up-sampling structure, is proposed for offshore aquaculture area extraction in this paper. The improved ASPP structure and up-sampling structure can better mine semantic information and location information, overcome the interference of other information in the image, and reduce 'adhesion'. Based on the northeast coast of Fujian Province Sentinel-2 Multispectral Scan Imaging (MSI) image data, the offshore aquaculture area extraction was studied. Based on the improved U-Net model, the F1 score and Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of the classification results were 83.75% and 73.75%, respectively. The results show that, compared with several common classification methods, the improved U-Net model has a better performance. This also shows that the improved U-Net model can significantly overcome the interference of irrelevant information, identify aquaculture areas, and significantly reduce edge adhesion of aquaculture areas.

TI  - A Multilevel World and a Flat Worldview: A Realist and Progressive Synthesis for Russia
T2  - RUSSIAN POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is about the challenges that face Russia when reflecting on her obligations to the UN system, and on the limits of what is possible in trying to `master' globalization. These challenges are not simply practical questions about the choice of foreign policy. They are deeper questions about worldview and how best to understand and navigate contemporary world politics. Several schemes have been presented to help identify and explain the foundations of our contemporary world order: geopolitical frameworks, civilizational ones, and some that are explicitly ideological. In engaging with and critiquing some of the best-known of these frameworks, the article makes the case for a worldview for Russia that is realist and progressive. This worldview recognizes the hierarchy of states and the logic of power politics in a UN-centered world, but it also moves beyond this pragmatic focus to consider the possibilities for a global dialogue of `pluralistic convergence' and peaceful change that is facilitated by Russia.

TI  - Land cover change in low-warming scenarios may enhance the climate role of secondary organic aerosols
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Most socioeconomic pathways compatible with the aims of the Paris Agreement include large changes to land use and land cover. The associated vegetation changes can interact with the atmosphere and climate through numerous mechanisms. One of these is emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), which may lead to the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) and atmospheric chemistry changes. Here, we use a modeling framework to explore potential future global and regional changes in SOA and tropospheric ozone following idealized, large-scale vegetation perturbations, and their resulting radiative forcing (RF). Guided by projections in low-warming scenarios, we modify crop and forest cover, separately, and in concurrence with changes in anthropogenic emissions and CO2 level. We estimate that increasing global forest cover by 30% gives a 37% higher global SOA burden, with a resulting forcing of -0.13 W m(-2). The effect on tropospheric ozone is relatively small. Large SOA burden changes of up to 48% are simulated for South America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Conversely, increasing crop cover at the expense of tropical forest, yields similar changes but of opposite sign. The magnitude of these changes is strongly affected by the concurrent evolution of anthropogenic emissions. Our land cover perturbations are representative of energy crop expansion and afforestation, two key mitigation measures in 1.5 degrees C compatible scenarios. Our results hence indicate that depending on the role of these two in the underlying mitigation strategies, scenarios with similar long-term global temperature levels could lead to opposite effects on SOA. Combined with the complexity of factors that control SOA, this highlights the importance of including BVOC effects in further studies and assessments of climate and air quality mitigation involving the land surface.

TI  - Modeling of winter wheat fAPAR by integrating Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle-based optical, structural and thermal measurement
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) is a critical biophysical parameter for crop growth monitoring and yield estimation. Remote sensing provides an efficient way for measuring fAPAR over large areas, compared with the time-consuming and labor-intensive field measurements. However, the optical remote sensing signals usually saturate over dense vegetation (e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI) > 5 or fAPAR > 0.7), limiting the performance of optical remote sensing in modeling fAPAR. Multi-source remote sensing data fusion has proven to be a feasible method to overcome the saturation problem of optical remote sensing in vegetation monitoring, but little is known about the performance of optical, structural and thermal features fusion for modeling winter wheat fAPAR. Also, the modeling powers of optical, structural, and thermal features for fAPAR estimation have seldom been compared. To fill in these knowledge gaps, the very high spatial resolution RGBoptical and thermal imagery collected by Unmanned Aircraft Vehicle (UAV) were used to quantify the powers of RGB-derived vegetation indices (VIs), Structural Indices (SIs, crop height/canopy cover), and Canopy Temperature (CT) and their combinations in modeling winter wheat fAPAR in this study. The modeling powers of different remote sensing features were compared with the commonly used hyperspectral vegetation indices (HVIs) from field spectrometer measurements. Results showed that (1) multi-source data fusion that integrates optical, structural, and thermal features provided the best model in winter wheat fAPAR mapping (R2 = 0.907 and RMSE = 0.041) ; (2) the RGB imagery-derived optical (i.e., RGB VIs) and structural features (i.e., RGB SIs) were important preditors for winter wheat fAPAR modeling, and their combination can steadily improve the modeling accuracy (-2% improvement in R2 compared to optical-only model); (3) the thermal feature alone performed the worst among all experiments, but it still can complement other types of remote sensing features (i. e., RGB VIs&SIs) and further improve the modeling accuracy within the framework of data fusion (-3% improvement in R2 compared to optical-only model). In general, this study indicates that the framework of multisource remote sensing data fusion can provide more accurate, efficient measurements of winter wheat fAPAR for crop management in precision agriculture, which can help improve resource utilization efficiency (e.g., determine where and when to apply nitrogen fertilizer) and ensure food security in the face of climate change.

TI  - Global Sensitivity Analysis of a Water Cloud Model toward Soil Moisture Retrieval over Vegetated Agricultural Fields
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The release of high-spatiotemporal-resolution Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to the public has provided an unprecedented opportunity to map soil moisture at watershed and agricultural field scales. However, the existing retrieval algorithms fail to derive soil moisture with expected accuracy. Insufficient understanding of the effects of soil and vegetation parameters on the backscatters is an important reason for this failure. To this end, we present a Sensitivity Analysis (SA) to quantify the effects of parameters on the dual-polarized backscatters of Sentinel-1 based on a Water Cloud Model (WCM) and multiple global SA methods. The identification of the incidence angle and polarization of Sentinel-1 and the description scheme of vegetation parameters (A, B and alpha) in WCM are especially emphasized in this analysis towards an optimal estimation of parameters. Multiple SA methods derive identical parameter importance ranks, indicating that a highly reasonable and reliable SA is performed. Comparison between two existing vegetation description schemes shows that the scheme using Vegetation Water Content (VWC) outperforms the scheme combing particle moisture content and VWC. Surface roughness, soil moisture, VWC, and B, are most sensitive on the backscatters. Variation of parameter sensitivity indices with incidence angle at different polarizations indicates that VV- and VH- polarized backscatters at small incidence angles are the optimal options for soil moisture and surface roughness estimation, respectively, while VV-polarized backscatter at larger incidence angles is well-suited for VWC and B estimation and HH-polarized backscatter is well suited for roughness estimation. This analysis improves the understanding of the effects of vegetated surface parameters on multi-angle and multi-polarized backscatters of Sentinel-1 SAR, informing improvement in SAR-based soil moisture retrieval.

T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we use the extraction method of multi-factors fusion to extract the Highland barley cultivation area on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The study results indicate that: (1) the method (extracting through multi-factors fusion) is efficient during the extracting process and is highly accurate in extraction results. This extraction scheme allows for not only the spatial heterogeneity of different physical geographic units, but also the impact of multi-factors on crop cultivation; (2) according to our research, the total Highland barley cultivation area on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is about 2.74 x 10(5) ha. Based on the statistics, we draw the first distribution map of the Highland barley cultivation area on Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, which upgrades its spatial distribution pattern from administrative unit to patch unit; (3) Highland barley in various divisions has a distinct spatial heterogeneity in elevation. On the whole, the Highland barley on the plateau is planted at an elevation of 2500-4500 m, up to 5200 m. Due to the impact of topography diversity, temperature, moisture, light, arable land and irrigation conditions, its cultivation area at the same elevation varies in different divisions.</p>

TI  - A Regional Spatiotemporal Downscaling Method for CO<sub>2</sub> Columns
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of the distribution of the CO2 dry-air mixing ratio (XCO2) is crucial for understanding the carbon cycle. However, clouds and aerosols in the line of light create spectral interference with CO2 signals. This interference can result in a low yield of XCO2 retrievals, thus limiting the application of these valuable satellite data. In this study, we developed an innovative methodology to obtain XCO2 maps of high spatial and temporal resolution using satellite data. The method first interpolates the spatial properties using an empirical Bayesian kriging (EBK) algorithm. Then, the temporal properties are modulated based on a CO2 curve database that was constructed using temporal contours and transfer learning techniques. We applied this method to obtain spatiotemporal XCO2 maps over mainland China using the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) data product OCO-2_L2_Lite_FP 9r for the period from January 1 to December 31, 2019. The correlation coefficient (R-2) was 0.8056, and the average absolute prediction error [root-mean-square error (RMSE)] was 0.9951. In the research area of mainland China, the vacancy validation strategy was adopted and yielded R-2 and RMSE of 0.8230 and 0.9746, respectively. We used the 2018-2019 ground-based data from four Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites in Europe and 2016 Hefei sites in mainland China to evaluate the performance of this new mapping method, respectively. Also, we obtained R-2 of 0.8690 and the RMSE of 0.9056 in Europe and R-2 of 0.8473 and the RMSE of 0.7026 in mainland China, proving the robustness and high precision of our method. This mapping technique is capable of filling the spatiotemporal gaps of satellite measurements with the high accuracy and resolution needed for its scientific application; thus, it has the potential to augment the scientific returns of satellite missions (e.g., USA OCO-2 Japan GOSAT and Chinese TanSat).

TI  - Evaluation and Intercomparison of Topographic Correction Methods Based on Landsat Images and Simulated Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic effects in medium and high spatial resolution remote sensing images greatly limit the application of quantitative parameter retrieval and analysis in mountainous areas. Many topographic correction methods have been proposed to reduce such effects. Comparative analyses on topographic correction algorithms have been carried out, some of which drew different or even contradictory conclusions. Performances of these algorithms over different terrain and surface cover conditions remain largely unknown. In this paper, we intercompared ten widely used topographic correction algorithms by adopting multi-criteria evaluation methods using Landsat images under various terrain and surface cover conditions as well as images simulated by a 3D radiative transfer model. Based on comprehensive analysis, we found that the Teillet regression-based models had the overall best performance in terms of topographic effects' reduction and overcorrection; however, correction bias may be introduced by Teillet regression models when surface reflectance in the uncorrected images do not follow a normal distribution. We recommend including more simulated images for a more in-depth evaluation. We also recommend that the pros and cons of topographic correction methods reported in this paper should be carefully considered for surface parameters retrieval and applications in mountain regions.

TI  - Diagnostic yield of sentinel lymph node biopsy in oral squamous cell carcinoma T1/T2-N0: systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta -analysis on the efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in T1/T2-N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A systematic review of the literature on SLNB until March 2019 was conducted. The review was organized according to the PRISMA protocol, considering the following PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) question: What is the sensitivity of sentinel lymph node biopsy in OSCC? 'P' was patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma T1/ 2-N0; 'I' was SLNB; 'C' was neck treated with elective neck dissection and haematoxylin-eosin histopathology; 'O' was sensitivity and specificity. A meta -analysis and meta-regression were performed on the selected studies. The sensitivity of SLNB was up to 88% (95% confidence interval (CI) 72-96%) and specificity was up to 99% (95% CI 96-100%). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00). In the four studies where immunohistochemistry was performed, both the sensitivity and specificity were higher than in the studies without immunohistochemistry: 93% (95% CI 88- 97%) and 98% (95% CI 96-100%), respectively. In conclusion, SLNB is an effective technique for treating patients with some types of stage T1/2-N0 OSCC. Some parameters such as immunohistochemistry could determine the level of diagnostic accuracy.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN GREEK STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Christoforos Savva, one of the most significant Cypriot artists of the 1960s, was also a highly politicized individual whose leftist worldview paralleled his artistic development. Nevertheless, this side of Savva has not been thoroughly explored. Savva created two forms of art: cementografia and ifasmatografia. Ifasmatografies were based on the vernacular tradition of weaving, while cementografies used modern cement, which was coming to replace stone in building construction. Savva's art departed from contemporary nationalist art production, such as that of the painter Adamantios Diamantis, and it also diverged from the Western colonial/orientalist projections depicting a premodern Cyprus. Overall, Savva's oeuvre bore all the hallmarks of contesting both Cypriot nationalisms-the Greek and the Turkish-since it was inclusive and anti-nationalist in its essence.

T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use-land cover (LULC) alteration is primarily associated with land degradation, especially in recent decades, and has resulted in various harmful changes in the landscape. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has the prospective capacity to classify the vegetative characteristics of many ecological areas and has proven itself useful as a remote sensing (RS) tool in recording vegetative phenological aspects. Likewise, the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) is used for quoting built-up areas. The current research objectives include identification of LULC, NDVI, and NDBI changes in Jhelum District, Punjab, Pakistan, during the last 30 years (1990-2020). This study targeted five major LULC classes: water channels, built-up area, barren land, forest, and cultivated land. Satellite imagery classification tools were used to identify LULC changes in Jhelum District, northern Punjab, Pakistan. The perception data about the environmental variations as conveyed by the 500 participants (mainly farmers) were also recorded and analyzed. The results depict that the majority of farmers (54%) believe in the appearance of more drastic changes such as less rainfall, drought, and decreased water availability for irrigation during 2020 compared to 30 years prior. Overall accuracy assessment of imagery classification was 83.2% and 88.8% for 1990, 88.1% and 85.7% for 2000, 86.5% and 86.7% for 2010, and 85.6% and 87.3% for 2020. The NDVI for Jhelum District was the highest in 1990 at +0.86 and the lowest in 2020 at +0.32; similarly, NDBI values were the highest in 2020 at +0.72 and the lowest in 1990 at -0.36. LULC change showed a clear association with temperature, NDBI, and NDVI in the study area. At the same time, variations in the land area of barren soil, vegetation, and built-up from 1990 to 2020 were quite prominent, possibly resulting in temperature increases, reduction in water for irrigation, and changing rainfall patterns. Farmers were found to be quite responsive to such climatic variations, diverting to framing possible mitigation approaches, but they need government assistance. The findings of this study, especially the causes and impacts of rapid LULC variations in the study area, need immediate attention from related government departments and policy makers.</p>

TI  - Monitoring of Spatiotemporal Change of Green Spaces in Relation to the Land Surface Temperature: A Case Study of Belgrade, Serbia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the relationship between land use and land cover and thermal environment has recently become an emerging issue for urban planners and policy makers. We chose Belgrade, as a case study, to present a cost- and time-effective framework for monitoring spatiotemporal changes of green spaces in relation to the land surface temperature (LST). Time series analysis was performed using Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery from 1991 to 2019 with an approximate 5-year interval (18 images in total). Spectral vegetation indices and supervised land cover classifications were used to examine changes of green spaces. The results showed a fluctuating trend of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference water index (NDWI). The highest values were recorded in 2019, indicating vegetation recovery in the last decade. A significant positive correlation was determined between the spectral vegetation indices and the amount of precipitation during growing season. The land cover classification showed that the share of vegetated and bare land decreased by 11.74% during the study period. The most intensive conversion of green and bare land into built-up land cover occurred in the first decade (1991-2000). To assess spatiotemporal changes in the LST, Landsat Collection 2 Surface Temperature products were used. We found a negative correlation between change in the spectral vegetation indices and change in the LST. This indicates that the reduction in vegetation was associated with an increase in the LST. The municipalities that were the most affected in each decade were also identified with our framework. The findings of this study are of great relevance for actions targeting an improvement in urban thermal comfort and climate resilience.

TI  - A Global Thermal Conductivity Model for Lunar Regolith at Low Temperatures
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although some of the coldest surface temperatures in the entire Solar System are found near the poles of our own Moon, the thermophysical properties of lunar regolith at these ultracold temperatures (i.e., below similar to 150 K) are not well understood. Standard lunar thermal models generally match the surface temperatures observed by global orbital remote sensing data but are inconsistent with infrared data collected from ultracold polar terrain. We build upon previous theoretical work on the low-temperature physics of lunar regolith to introduce a global thermal conductivity model consistent with the temperature trends observed by the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (Diviner). This updated thermophysical model primarily affects nighttime surface temperatures, subsurface temperatures at high latitudes, and permanently shadowed regions (PSRs). An additional outcome of this thermophysical model is the ability to accommodate the surface temperature trends observed by Diviner both in warm low latitudes and cold high latitudes. Subsurface temperatures in near-polar craters are similar to 5-10 K warmer than previous thermal models, and cooler nighttime surface temperatures are observed globally. Model results of PSRs reveal larger surface temperature amplitudes (as observed by Diviner) and steeper geothermal gradients. A comprehensive understanding of lunar regolith's low-temperature thermal behavior is an essential step in modeling the potential location and quantity of cold trapped volatiles in the lunar south pole. Here, we hope to provide theoretical support and motivation for more complete low-temperature thermal conductivity laboratory measurements.

TI  - A Review of Irrigation Information Retrievals from Space and Their Utility for Users
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Irrigation represents one of the most impactful human interventions in the terrestrial water cycle. Knowing the distribution and extent of irrigated areas as well as the amount of water used for irrigation plays a central role in modeling irrigation water requirements and quantifying the impact of irrigation on regional climate, river discharge, and groundwater depletion. Obtaining high-quality global information about irrigation is challenging, especially in terms of quantification of the water actually used for irrigation. Here, we review existing Earth observation datasets, models, and algorithms used for irrigation mapping and quantification from the field to the global scale. The current observation capacities are confronted with the results of a survey on user requirements on satellite-observed irrigation for agricultural water resources' management. Based on this information, we identify current shortcomings of irrigation monitoring capabilities from space and phrase guidelines for potential future satellite missions and observation strategies.

TI  - <i>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</i> in Multiple Tissue Samples of Wild Carnivores in Romania
T2  - JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wild vertebrate hosts can serve as reservoirs or amplification hosts for tick-borne pathogens (TBPs). Wild carnivores due to their large size have an increased risk for harboring large numbers of ticks. Moreover, their large home ranges and long lives may increase the risk of exposure to ticks and TBPs. Wild carnivores therefore may be good sentinel species with which to monitor the distribution of TBPs. We aimed to evaluate the presence of rickettsial DNA in wild carnivores and to compare its presence in different types of samples. In total, 95 wild carnivores from nine species, originating from 17 counties of Romania collected during 2014-18, were included in the study. From each animal, DNA was extracted from multiple tissue samples, including blood clot, heart, liver, lungs, spleen, kidney, lymph node, and bone marrow, and screened for the presence of rickettsial pathogen DNA (Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia canis, and Rickettsia spp.). Samples from 10 animals from six species (Canis aureus, Ursus arctos, Canis lupus, Felis sylvestris, Lutra lutra, and Martes foina) were found to be positive for A. phagocytophilum. The most frequently positive sample was the spleen. No animal was positive for Ehrlichia spp. or Rickettsia spp. Wild carnivores may be involved in the ecoepidemiology of A. phagocytophilum by maintaining the infection in synanthropic environments.

TI  - Survival in Patients With Sentinel Node-Positive Melanoma With Extranodal Extension
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CANCER NETWORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Prognostic parameters in sentinel node (SN)-positive melanoma are important indicators to identify patients at high risk of recurrence who should be candidates for adjuvant therapy. We aimed to evaluate the presence of melanoma cells beyond the SN capsule-extranodal extension (ENE)-as a prognostic factor in patients with positive SNs. Methods: Data from 1,047 patients with melanoma and positive SNs treated from 2001 to 2020 at the Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori in Milano, Italy, were retrospectively investigated. Kaplan-Meier survival and crude cumulative incidence of recurrence curves were estimated. A multivariable logistic model was used to investigate the association between ENE and selected predictive factors. Cox models estimated the effect of the selected predictors on survival endpoints. Results: Median follow-up was 69 months. The 5-year overall survival rate was 62.5% and 71.7% for patients with positive SNs with and without ENE, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival rate was 54.0% and 64.0% for patients with positive SNs with and without ENE, respectively. The multivariable logistic model showed that age, size of the main metastatic focus in the SN, and numbers of metastatic non-SNs were associated with ENE (all P<.0001). The multivariable Cox regression models showed the estimated prognostic effects of ENE associated with age, ulceration, size of the main metastatic focus in the SN, and number of metastatic non-SNs (all P<.0001) on disease-free survival and overall survival. Conclusions: ENE was a significant prognostic factor in patients with positive-SN melanoma. This parameter may be useful in clinical practice as a selection criterion for adjuvant treatment in patients with stage IIIA disease with a tumor burden <1 mm in the SN. We recommend its inclusion as an independent prognostic determinant in future updates of melanoma guidelines.

TI  - <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i> Allelic Diversity: A Comparison of DNA Extraction from Isolates Collected on Rapid Diagnostic Tests (Rdts) and Filter Paper
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To perform molecular epidemiologic studies based on large cohorts, material such as RDTs or filter papers are useful for biological sample collection and extraction of RNA or DNA of good quality. Thus, we aimed to assess the quality of DNA extracted from malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) stored at various temperatures for the analysis of Plasmodium falciparum genetic diversity.Methods: Febrile patients benefitted from free malaria diagnosis using microscopy in a malaria sentinel site, at the Regional Hospital Estuaire-Melen, in Gabon, in 2015. P. falciparum isolates were collected onto one filter paper and 2 similar RDTs devices (Acon (R)) per patient. Nucleic acids were extracted with QiAmp Qiagen kit from paper and RDTs and the quality of the DNA was analyzed by msp1 gene amplification.Results: Msp1gene amplification was achieved in nucleic acids extracted from all filter papers and RDTs devices (n = 45, 100%). K1 alleles were detected in 93.3% (n = 42/45) of the samples and Mad20 alleles in 73.3% (n = 33/45). The number and the intensity of K1 and/or Mad20 fragments were comparable according to the sample collection material and the storage conditions (room temperature vs -20 degrees C) of the samples. The size of the fragments indicating allelic diversity was comparable in 80% (n=36) of the samples.Conclusion: These data show that RDTs are a valuable source of DNA for malaria parasite genetic polymorphism analysis. Storage conditions of the devices did not influence the quality of DNA extracted from RDTs device, although some alleles may be missed.

TI  - Diagnostic Value, Oncologic Outcomes, and Safety Profile of Image-Guided Surgery Technologies During Robot-Assisted Lymph Node Dissection with Sentinel Node Biopsy for Prostate Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite good sensitivity and a good negative predictive value, the implementation of sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in robot-assisted radical prostatectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection (ePLND) for prostate cancer is still controversial. For this reason, we aimed to define the added value of SNB (with different tracer modalities) to ePLND in the identification of nodal metastases. Complication rates and oncologic outcomes were also assessed. Methods: From January 2006 to December 2019, prospectively collected data were retrospectively analyzed from a single-institution database regarding prostate cancer patients treated with robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and ePLND with or without additional use of SNB, either with the hybrid tracer indocyanine green (ICG)-Tc-99m-nanocolloid or with free ICG. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression models tested the impact of adding SNB (either with the hybrid tracer or with free ICG) on lymph nodal invasion detection, complications, and oncologic outcomes. Results: Overall, 1,680 patients were included in the final analysis: 1,168 (69.5%) in the non-SNB group, 161 (9.6%) in the ICG-SNB group, and 351 (20.9%) in the hybrid-SNB group. The hybrid-SNB group (odds ratio, 1.61; 95%CI, 1.18-2.20; P = 0.002) was an independent predictor of nodal involvement, whereas the ICG-SNB group did not reach independent predictor status when compared with the non-SNB group (odds ratio, 1.35; 95%CI, 0.89-2.03; P = 0.1). SNB techniques were not associated with higher rates of complications. Lastly, use of hybrid SNB was associated with lower rates of biochemical recurrence (0.79; 95%CI, 0.63-0.98) and of clinical recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.76, P = 0.035) than were seen in the non-SNB group. Conclusion: The implementation of hybrid-SNB technique with ICG-Tc-99m-nanocolloid in prostate cancer improves detection of positive nodes and potentially lowers recurrence rates with subsequent optimization of patient management, without harming patient safety.

TI  - On the Use of Tri-Stereo Pleiades Images for the Morphometric Measurement of Dolines in the Basaltic Plateau of Azrou (Middle Atlas, Morocco)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hundreds of large and deep collapse dolines dot the surface of the Quaternary basaltic plateau of Azrou, in the Middle Atlas of Morocco. In the absence of detailed topographic maps, the morphometric study of such a large number of features requires the use of remote sensing techniques. We present the processing, extraction, and validation of depth measurements of 89 dolines using tri-stereo Pleiades images acquired in 2018-2019 (the European Space Agency (ESA) (c) CNES 2018, distributed by Airbus DS). Satellite image-derived DEMs were field-verified using traditional mapping techniques, which showed a very good agreement between field and remote sensing measures. The high resolution of these tri-stereo images allowed to automatically generate accurate morphometric datasets not only regarding the planimetric parameters of the dolines (diameters, contours, orientation of long axes), but also for what concerns their depth and altimetric profiles. Our study demonstrates the potential of using these types of images on rugged morphologies and for the measurement of steep depressions, where traditional remote sensing techniques may be hindered by shadow zones and blind portions. Tri-stereo images might also be suitable for the measurement of deep and steep depressions (skylights and collapses) on Martian and Lunar lava flows, suitable targets for future planetary cave exploration.

TI  - Remote sensing data to support the structural monitoring of RC buildings affected by ground instability phenomena
T2  - ITALIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI GEOTECNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The building stock around the world is exposed to different types of natural actions such as earthquakes or landslides. Italy is one of the countries worldwide most affected by landslides. Mitigation of landslide risk is a topic of great interest with specific focusing on the assessment and management of their consequences. The periodical monitoring of ground instability phenomena and the field surveys for recognizing and identifying the landslide-induced damage on structures and infrastructures, require high costs due to the large amounts of exposed elements. As known from literature, slow-moving landslides can lead to a progressive damage over time. With respect to the Reinforced Concrete (RC) structures, these actions can affect primary structural elements, but more frequently damage occurs on the most vulnerable elements of the structure, such as infills. The aim of this work is to assess the potential utility of the data derived from a remote sensing technique, known as Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR), in order to support the structural health monitoring of RC buildings affected by slow-moving landslides. The paper shows the assessment of the structural behaviour of a RC infilled building through the years and with the progression of the damage, within a landslide affected area and monitored by using DInSAR data. The evidence of a visual survey made in 2015 was available, showing a significant damage pattern in some infill panels. A good agreement has been found between the analytical previsions and the existing damage pattern for the infills of which a visual survey existed, showing the potential use of the remote sensing technique data in order to make a structural assessment. Moreover, an overall analytical assessment of all infills' state of health has been presented, in order to have a complete picture of the damage situation.

TI  - Complementary Differences in Primary Production and Phenology among Vegetation Types Increase Ecosystem Resilience to Climate Change and Grazing Pressure in an Iconic Mediterranean Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant primary production is a key factor in ecosystem dynamics. In environments with high climatic variability such as the Mediterranean region, plant primary production shows strong seasonal and inter-annual fluctuations, which both drive and interplay with herbivore grazing. Knowledge on the responses of different vegetation types to the variability in both rainfall and grazing pressure by wild and domestic ungulates is a necessary starting point for the sustainable management of these ecosystems. In this work we combine a 15 year series of remote sensing data on plant production (NDVI) with meteorological (daily precipitation data) and ungulate abundance (annual counts of four species of wild and domestic ungulates: red deer, fallow deer, cattle, and horses) in an iconic protected area (the Donana National Park, SW Spain) to (i) estimate the impact of intra- and inter-annual variation in rainfall and herbivore pressure on primary production, for each of four main vegetation types; and (ii) evaluate the potential impact of different policy (i.e., herbivore management) strategies under expected climate change scenarios. Our results show that the production of different vegetation types differed strongly in their responses to phenology (a surrogate of the effect of climatology on vegetation development), water availability (rainfall accumulated until the phenological peak), and grazing pressure. Although the density of domestic ungulates shows a linear, negative effect on the primary production of three of the four vegetation types, differences in primary production and phenology among vegetation types increase ecosystem resilience to both climatological variability and grazing pressure. Such resilience may, however, be reduced under the conditions predicted by climate change models, if the moderate predicted reduction in rainfall levels combines with moderate to high densities of domestic ungulates, resulting in important reductions in primary production that may compromise plant regeneration, leading to irreversible degradation. New management strategies taking advantage of habitat heterogeneity and phenological alternation, more flexible stocking rates, and the redistribution of management units should be considered to mitigate these effects. The use of available remote sensing data and techniques in combination with statistical models represents a valuable tool for developing, monitoring, and refining such strategies.

TI  - Time evolution of mining-related residual subsidence monitored over a 24-year period using InSAR in southern Alsace, France
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - From 1910 to 2002, the Mines Domaniales de Potasse d'Alsace (MDPA) exploited two potash layers, located at depths greater than 400 m in the southern Upper Rhine Graben. This mining activity has caused surface subsidence, investigated here using SAR interferometry (InSAR) and Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) approach is used to follow mining induced surface displacements over the Alsatian potassic basin. The SAR images acquired by three distinct satellites (ERS, ENVISAT, Sentinel-1) over the last 24 years cover both mining and post-mining periods. Until 1996/1997, InSAR results do not fit the high vertical displacement deduced from levelling campaigns due to unwrapping errors and are therefore not reliable to quantify the mining subsidence. From 1996/1997, InSAR results and levelling measurements become consistent, allowing us to study the subsidence following the activity of the mine. The surface subsidence decreases quickly after the end of mining operations, with current subsidence estimated below 5 mm/yr in 2018. The InSAR results obtained for the postmining period show a correlation between residual subsidence amplitude and the mined thickness. Taking together the InSAR and levelling measurements for the whole 24 years period, the combined time series are approximated by a sum of two exponential terms, which reveals the role of the goaf compaction at depth. The study shows that SAR interferometry is well suited for monitoring small amplitude mining-induced subsidence over the residual phase, helping to better mitigate the related risk in these regions.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of North America
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America is an extremely important habitat for a diverse range of wetland ecosystems that provide a wealth of socio-economic value. This paper describes the ecological characteristics and importance of PPR wetlands and the use of remote sensing for mapping and monitoring applications. While there are comprehensive reviews for wetland remote sensing in recent publications, there is no comprehensive review about the use of remote sensing in the PPR. First, the PPR is described, including the wetland classification systems that have been used, the water regimes that control the surface water and water levels, and the soil and vegetation characteristics of the region. The tools and techniques that have been used in the PPR for analyses of geospatial data for wetland applications are described. Field observations for ground truth data are critical for good validation and accuracy assessment of the many products that are produced. Wetland classification approaches are reviewed, including Decision Trees, Machine Learning, and object versus pixel-based approaches. A comprehensive description of the remote sensing systems and data that have been employed by various studies in the PPR is provided. A wide range of data can be used for various applications, including passive optical data like aerial photographs or satellite-based, Earth-observation data. Both airborne and spaceborne lidar studies are described. A detailed description of Synthetic Aperture RADAR (SAR) data and research are provided. The state of the art is the use of multi-source data to achieve higher accuracies and hybrid approaches. Digital Surface Models are also being incorporated in geospatial analyses to separate forest and shrub and emergent systems based on vegetation height. Remote sensing provides a cost-effective mechanism for mapping and monitoring PPR wetlands, especially with the logistical difficulties and cost of field-based methods. The wetland characteristics of the PPR dictate the need for high resolution in both time and space, which is increasingly possible with the numerous and increasing remote sensing systems available and the trend to open-source data and tools. The fusion of multi-source remote sensing data via state-of-the-art machine learning is recommended for wetland applications in the PPR. The use of such data promotes flexibility for sensor addition, subtraction, or substitution as a function of application needs and potential cost restrictions. This is important in the PPR because of the challenges related to the highly dynamic nature of this unique region.

TI  - Vegetable mapping using fuzzy classification of Dynamic Time Warping distances from time series of Sentinel-1A images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetable production is important because of the food security, diet improvement and socio-economic value. Mapping the location and extent of vegetable fields is therefore important in agricultural policy, food security and farmer support. Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) is a common way to map crops from time series of satellite images. However, as all hard classifications, it does not show the spatial distribution of uncertainty in the classification. In fuzzy classification, where memberships to multiple classes are assigned to each pixel, differ-ences in membership between the first and the runners-up class can be used to assess classification uncertainty at the pixel level. This research formulates a fuzzy classifier based upon Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) distances to map vegetable types from time series of Sentinel-1A SAR images. For each pixel, the TWDTW distances to the classes was normalised by dividing them by the sum of all TWDTW distances to all the classes for that pixel. The normalized distances were then used to compute fuzzy memberships for each pixel to each class, using the Gaussian membership function. Based on these memberships, fuzzy measures such as Confusion Index (CI), Ambiguity Index (AI), fuzziness and fuzzy membership were calculated and different thresholds applied on each of the measures during subsequent defuzzification. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the defuzzified output results were 0.86 and 0.83, respectively, which was an improvement with regard to the crisp Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping with SPRING strategy for subsequence searching (TWDTWS) algorithm with 0.73 and 0.68 for overall accuracy and kappa, respectively. This study concludes that this new approach improves classification accuracy in image classification by excluding pixels with high un-certainty, which is especially relevant when only a limited number of classes are sampled and mapped.

TI  - Rift Focusing and Magmatism During Late-Stage Rifting in Afar
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Processes that facilitate the transition between continental rifting and sea-floor spreading remain unclear. Variations in the spatial distribution of extension and magmatism through Afar and into the Red Sea are indicative of temporal evolution of the rifting process. We develop a time series of Sentinel-1 interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations of ground deformation covering the whole Afar rift zone from 2014 to 2019, to study the distribution of extension. By incorporating Global Navigation Satellite System observations, we resolve 3D average velocities in the vertical, rift-perpendicular, and rift-parallel directions. Results show the spatial distribution of long-wavelength deformation over the rift zone, as well as deformation at individual volcanic centers, including Dallol, Nabro, and Erta 'Ale. We find that in northern and central Afar, the majority of extension is accommodated close to the rift axis (+/- 15-30 km). In southern Afar, near the Nubia-Arabia-Somalia triple junction, amagmatic extension is distributed over 80-160 km, which may indicate an increase in rift focusing with rift maturity. We also observe rapid surface uplift and rift-perpendicular extension at the Dabbahu-Manda-Hararo rift segment with velocities of 33 +/- 4 mm/yr and 37 +/- 4 mm/yr respectively. These are higher than the background extension rate of 18-20 mm/yr, but have decreased by 55%-70% since 2006-2010. The data suggests that this is due to an ongoing long-lived response to the 2005-2010 rifting episode, with potential continued processes below the rift segment including a lower-crustal viscous response and magma movement. Continued observations of surface deformation provide key constraints on tectono-magmatic processes involved in rift development.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Agriculture Land Loss in Qena City, Upper Egypt
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOSPATIAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although urbanization presents opportunities for new urban developments, it may have serious problems on environment and land use/cover patterns. The present study aims to evaluate the performance of built-up delineation index set (BDIS) for mapping agricultural land loss in Upper Egypt. Three Landsat images were obtained for the years 1986, 2000, and 2016 and utilized as inputs to calculate the BDIS variables. Then a supervised classification technique (i.e., support vector machine) was used to classify the images. The findings showed that urban areas have witnessed a dramatic expansion at a growing rate of 44.1% during the 30 years. As a result, the loss of the agricultural land was found to be approximately 64.83 ha, which represents- 4%, during the same period because of the urban expansion and the illegal construction of settlements. These findings would support the local decision makers in urban and agriculture land management authorities to develop sustainable development plans that control the spatiotemporal urban expansion and agricultural land loss.

TI  - Estimating the Soil Erosion Cover-Management Factor at the European Part of Russia
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluation of the vegetation and agricultural-management factor (C-factor) is an important task, the solution of which affects the correct assessment of the intensity of soil erosion. For the vast area of the European part of Russia (EPR), this task is particularly relevant since no products allow taking into account the C-factor. An approach based on automated interpretation of the main crop groups based on MODIS satellite imaging data from Terra and Aqua satellites with the LSTM machine-learning method was used to achieve this goal. The accuracy of crop group recognition compared to the open data of the Federal State Statistics Service of Russia was 94%. The resulting crop maps were used to calculate the C-factor for each month of a particular year from 2014 to 2019. After that, summaries were made at the regional and landscape levels. The average C-factor value for the EPR was 0.401, for the forest landscape zone 0.262, for the forest-steppe zone 0.362, and for the steppe zone 0.454. The obtained results are in good correlation with the results of previous field studies and provide up-to-date (based on 2014-2019 data) estimates of C-factor for rainfall erosion (monthly, annual) with high spatial detail (250 m).</p>

TI  - CXCR6 by increasing retention of memory CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells in the ovarian tumor microenvironment promotes immunosurveillance and control of ovarian cancer
T2  - JOURNAL FOR IMMUNOTHERAPY OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Resident memory CD8 T cells, owing to their ability to reside and persist in peripheral tissues, impart adaptive sentinel activity and amplify local immune response, and have beneficial implications for tumor surveillance and control. The current study aimed to clarify the less known chemotactic mechanisms that govern the localization, retention, and residency of memory CD8 T cells in the ovarian tumor microenvironment. Experimental design RNA and protein expressions of chemokine receptors in CD8(+) resident memory T cells in human ovarian tumor-infiltrating CD8(+) T cells and their association with survival were analyzed. The role of CXCR6 on antitumor T cells was investigated using prophylactic vaccine models in murine ovarian cancer. Results Chemokine receptor profiling of CD8(+)CD103(+) resident memory tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in patients with ovarian cancer revealed high expression of CXCR6. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (ovarian cancer database revealed CXCR6 to be associated with CD103 and increased patient survival. Functional studies in mouse models of ovarian cancer revealed that CXCR6 is a marker of resident, but not circulatory, tumor-specific memory CD8(+) T cells. CXCR6-deficient tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells showed reduced retention in tumor tissues, leading to diminished resident memory responses and poor control of ovarian cancer. Conclusions CXCR6, by promoting retention in tumor tissues, serves a critical role in resident memory T cell-mediated immunosurveillance and control of ovarian cancer. Future studies warrant exploiting CXCR6 to promote resident memory responses in cancers.

TI  - Harmony and Tension in Integrating Indigenous Responses to COVID-19 in Uganda
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT SPIRITUALITY & RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus poses a global health challenge. Amidst uncertainties associated with the pandemic, effective response requires multiple stakeholder involvement. The performance of ryemo gemo, an indigenous epidemic control measure among the Acholi in Uganda as part of the response to COVID-19 evoked responses that highlighted both harmony and tension in integrating a traditional response in the national efforts. We review the directives, the cultural context of the practice of ryemo gemo and reactions it evoked on social and print media, and discuss points of convergence and divergence in integrating the traditional practice, and compounding factors of tension. The complexity of the social challenges, the lack of shared worldview in regards to the indigenous measure, cultural disconnect and lack of clear impact assessment underlie the tension. The power of indigenous measures for sensitization and mobilization can be harnessed in the COVID-19 fight by strengthening appropriate behavioral outputs consistent with the pandemic control.

TI  - Vegetation Greenness Variations and Response to Climate Change in the Arid and Semi-Arid Transition Zone of the Mongo-Lian Plateau during 1982-2015
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation greenness dynamics in arid and semi-arid regions are sensitive to climate change, which is an important phenomenon in global climate change research. However, the driving mechanism, particularly for the longitudinal and latitudinal changes in vegetation greenness related to climate change, has been less studied and remains poorly understood in arid and semi-arid areas. In this study, we investigated changes in vegetation greenness and the vegetation greenness line (the mean growing season normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) = 0.1 contour line) and its response to climate change based on AVHRR-GIMMS NDVI3g and the fifth and latest global climate reanalysis dataset from 1982 to 2015 in the arid and semi-arid transition zone of the Mongolian Plateau (ASTZMP). The results showed that the mean growing season NDVI increased from the central west to east, northeast, and southeast in ASTZMP. The vegetation greenness line migrated to the desert during 1982-1994, to the grassland during 1994-2005, and then to the desert during 2005-2015. Vegetation greenness was positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with temperature. The latitudinal variation of the vegetation greenness line was mainly affected by the combination of precipitation and temperature, while the longitudinal variation was mainly affected by precipitation. In summary, precipitation was a key climatic factor driving rapid changes in vegetation greenness during the growing season of the transition zone. These results can provide meaningful information for research on vegetation coverage changes in arid and semi-arid regions.</p>

TI  - SAR-Based Flood Monitoring for Flatland with Frequently Fluctuating Water Surfaces: Proposal for the Normalized Backscatter Amplitude Difference Index (NoBADI)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Space-based synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a powerful tool for monitoring flood conditions over large areas without the influence of clouds and daylight. Permanent water surfaces can be excluded by comparing SAR images with pre-flood images, but fluctuating water surfaces, such as those found in flat wetlands, introduce uncertainty into flood mapping results. In order to reduce this uncertainty, a simple method called Normalized Backscatter Amplitude Difference Index (NoBADI) is proposed in this study. The NoBADI is calculated from a post-flood SAR image of backscatter amplitude and multiple images on non-flooding conditions. Preliminary analysis conducted in the US state of Florida, which was affected by Hurricane Irma in September 2017, shows that surfaces frequently covered by water (more than 20% of available data) have been successfully excluded by means of C-/L-band SAR (HH, HV, VV, and VH polarizations). Although a simple comparison of pre-flood and post-flood images is greatly affected by the spatial distribution of the water surface in the pre-flood image, the NoBADI method reduces the uncertainty of the reference water surface. This advantage will contribute in making quicker decisions during crisis management.

TI  - Approach to Short Stature in Children and Adolescent
T2  - EWHA MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Growth represents a sentinel for general health state in children and adolescent. Linear growth in children and adolescent is a complex process influenced by numerous factors including genetic, prenatal, postnatal, and environmental factors. When children less than 2 standard deviation score below the average height for age and sex, they are considered as short stature. Accurate measurement of body profile and determination of height velocity over time are fundamental step. Whether the growth pattern is appropriate or deviated from standardized growth chart is a key point in approaching to short stature in children. Evaluation includes a detailed past medical and family history, physical examination, laboratory test and radiologic evaluation. Recent advances in genetic approaches are allowing for improved diagnosis for idiopathic short stature and various genetic syndromes. Growth hormone is the main treatment option for short stature. It is generally safe but has potential side effects. Individualized growth hormone treatment should be initiated under consideration of both efficacy and safety by pediatric endocrinologists. Early diagnosis and prompt initiation of treatment result in a good prognosis. This article reviews an overview of the diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature, and summarizes etiologies and growth hormone treatment.

TI  - Mapping of major river terraces and assessment of their characteristics in Upper Pindar River Basin, Uttarakhand: A geospatial approach
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper, an attempt has been made to trace out the major terraces and analyse their characteristics in the Upper Pindar valley of the Uttarakhand state. The study is based on digital elevation model (DEM), satellite data-based terrain characterisation with field and ground truth investigations. The results are derived from the data, which shows the preservation of river terraces along the trunk and tributary streams of the Pindar River. The terraces are formed because of the combined effect of local structural, geological, lithological, and tectonic control along with the climatic influence on landform development. Among the eight surveyed terraces, seven are cut and fill type and influenced by climate, tributaries, formed by both glacial and fluvio-glacial processes, whereas the rest terrace is developed because of tectonic uplift and creates a strath type. The terrace of Upthar and T3 of Langari has gone through the past tectonic events operated within this region. The analysis through cross-section profiles also exhibits the fact that the Upper Pindar basin has experienced a maximum of three stages of terrace development during different phases of the Holocene period and Late Pleistocene period. The alternative river aggradation, degradation, local landsliding, and a sudden increase in sediment flux caused by the monsoonal surge, tectonic uplift, and rapid incision in three separate times are the prime factors that are responsible for the generation of maximum three-tiered terrace landform in the study area. The sequence of terrace development reveals that the trunk of the Pindar River creates the highest number of terraces followed by the tributary rivers, which are generated in the later phase. The three phases of river aggradation in 33.5 ka, 17.5-13 ka, and 8-3.6 ka separated by a deep incision of different timescale are remarkable in this area, mainly around Langri and Khati, which creates the ordering of a maximum of three levels of terrace development. The results concluded that the dominance of local processes plays a vital role in the formation and characterization of river terraces in the Upper Pindar valley. The present study gives a detailed idea of the valley development and the result can also be used as an identification of suitable areas for human interactions with the environment.

TI  - A Review on Sustainability of Watershed Management in Indonesia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper provides an overview of the implementation and obstacles of watershed management, and the alternative solutions based on a synoptic review of related studies and experiences across Indonesia. The review found that problems in the institutional aspect were hierarchical confusion, discrepancy, and asynchrony among regulations, and weak (participation, synchronization, and coordination) among watershed management stakeholders. The weaknesses in the planning stage are integration among sectors, a lack of community participation, and limited readiness to integrate watershed planning into regional planning. Stakeholders' involvement is also a critical factor in successful implementation of degraded watershed rehabilitation, including in peatland and mangrove areas. Failure should be minimized by providing adequate information on degraded watershed characteristics, appropriate species choices, and effective mechanical construction for soil and water conservation. Community participation as the main factor in driving watershed management should be achieved by strengthening public awareness of the importance of a sustainable watershed and providing access for the community to be involved in each stage of watershed management. Another problem is data gaps which are essential to address from the planning to evaluation stages. The gaps can be bridged by using remotely sensed data and by applying hydrological-based simulation models. Simplified criteria for watershed assessment may also be required, depending on site-specific issues and the watershed scale.

TI  - Estimation and Forecasting of Rice Yield Using Phenology-Based Algorithm and Linear Regression Model on Sentinel-II Satellite Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is a primary food for more than three billion people worldwide and cultivated on about 12% of the world's arable land. However, more than 88% production is observed in Asian countries, including Pakistan. Due to higher population growth and recent climate change scenarios, it is crucial to get timely and accurate rice yield estimates and production forecast of the growing season for governments, planners, and decision makers in formulating policies regarding import/export in the event of shortfall and/or surplus. This study aims to quantify the rice yield at various phenological stages from hyper-temporal satellite-derived-vegetation indices computed from time series Sentinel-II images. Different vegetation indices (viz. NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and REP) were used to predict paddy yield. The predicted yield was validated through RMSE and ME statistical techniques. The integration of PLSR and sequential time-stamped vegetation indices accurately predicted rice yield (i.e., maximum R-2 = 0.84 and minimum RMSE = 0.12 ton ha(-1) equal to 3% of the mean rice yield). Moreover, our results also established that optimal time spans for predicting rice yield are late vegetative and reproductive (flowering) stages. The output would be useful for the farmer and decision makers in addressing food security.

TI  - A Comparative Estimation of Maize Leaf Water Content Using Machine Learning Techniques and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-Based Proximal and Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining maize water content variability is necessary for crop monitoring and in developing early warning systems to optimise agricultural production in smallholder farms. However, spatially explicit information on maize water content, particularly in Southern Africa, remains elementary due to the shortage of efficient and affordable primary sources of suitable spatial data at a local scale. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), equipped with light-weight multispectral sensors, provide spatially explicit, near-real-time information for determining the maize crop water status at farm scale. Therefore, this study evaluated the utility of UAV-derived multispectral imagery and machine learning techniques in estimating maize leaf water indicators: equivalent water thickness (EWT), fuel moisture content (FMC), and specific leaf area (SLA). The results illustrated that both NIR and red-edge derived spectral variables were critical in characterising the maize water indicators on smallholder farms. Furthermore, the best models for estimating EWT, FMC, and SLA were derived from the random forest regression (RFR) algorithm with an rRMSE of 3.13%, 1%, and 3.48%, respectively. Additionally, EWT and FMC yielded the highest predictive performance and were the most optimal indicators of maize leaf water content. The findings are critical towards developing a robust and spatially explicit monitoring framework of maize water status and serve as a proxy of crop health and the overall productivity of smallholder maize farms.

TI  - HYDRODYNAMIC INFLUENCES ON SEDIMENTOLOGY AND GEOMORPHOLOGY OF NEARSHORE PARTS OF CARBONATE RAMPS: HOLOCENE, NE YUCATAN SHELF, MEXICO
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEDIMENTARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Although carbonate ramps are ubiquitous in the geologic record, the impacts of oceanographic processes on their facies patterns are less well constrained than with other carbonate geomorphic forms such as isolated carbonate platforms. To better understand the role of physical and chemical oceanographic forces on geomorphic and sedimentologic variability of ramps, this study examines in-situ field measurements, remote-sensing data, and hydrodynamic modeling of the nearshore inner ramp of the modern northeastern Yucata acute accent n Shelf, Mexico. The results reveal how sediment production and accumulation are influenced by the complex interactions of the physical, chemical, and biological processes on the ramp. Upwelled, cool, nutrient-rich waters are transported westward across the ramp and concentrated along the shoreline by cold fronts (Nortes), westerly regional currents, and longshore currents. This influx supports a mix of both heterozoan and photozoan fauna and flora in the nearshore realm. Geomorphically, the nearshore parts of this ramp system in the study area include lagoon, barrier island, and shoreface environments, influenced by the mixed-energy (wave and tidal) setting. Persistent trade winds, episodic tropical depressions, and winter storms generate waves that propagate onto the shoreface. Extensive shore-parallel sand bodies (beach ridges and subaqueous dune fields) of the high-energy, wave-dominated upper shoreface and foreshore are composed of fine to coarse skeletal sand, lack mud, and include highly abraded, broken and bored grains. The large shallow lagoon is mixed-energy: wave-dominated near the inlet, it transitions to tide-dominated in the more protected central and eastern regions. Lagoon sediment consists of Halimeda-rich muddy gravel and sand. Hydrodynamic forces are especially strong where bathymetry focuses water flow, as occurs along a promontory and at the lagoon inlet, and can form subaqueous dunes.Explicit comparison among numerical models of conceptual shorefaces in which variables are altered and isolated systematically demonstrates the influences of the winds, waves, tides, and currents on hydrodynamics across a broad spectrum of settings (e.g., increased tidal range, differing wind and wave conditions). Results quantify how sediment transport patterns are determined by wave height and direction relative to the shoreface, but tidal forces locally control geomorphic and sedimentologic character. Similarly, the physical oceanographic processes acting throughout the year (e.g., daily tides, episodic winter Nortes, and persistent easterly winds and waves) have more impact on geomorphology and sedimentology of comparable nearshore systems than intense, but infrequent, hurricanes. Overall, this study provides perspectives on how upwelling, nutrient levels, and hydrodynamics influence the varied sedimentologic and geomorphic character of the nearshore areas of this high-energy carbonate ramp system. These results also provide for more accurate and realistic conceptual models of the depositional variability for a spectrum of modern and ancient ramp systems.

TI  - Assessing Urban Landslide Dynamics through Multi-Temporal InSAR Techniques and Slope Numerical Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides threaten more than before the urbanized areas and are a worldwide growing problem for the already affected communities and the local authorities committed to landslide risk management and mitigation. For this reason, it is essential to analyze landslide dynamics and environmental conditioning factors. Various techniques and instruments exist for landslide investigation and monitoring. Out of these, Multi-temporal Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (MT-InSAR) techniques have been widely used in the last decades. Their capabilities are enhanced by the availability of the active Sentinel-1 mission, whose 6-day revisiting time enables near real-time monitoring of landslides. Interferometric results, coupled with ground measurements or other approaches such as numerical modeling, significantly improve the knowledge of the investigated surface processes. In this work, we processed the C-band SAR images of the available European Space Agency (ESA) satellite missions, using MT-InSAR methods to identify the surface deformations related to landslides affecting the Iasi Municipality (Eastern Romania). The results (i.e., velocity maps) point out the most active landslides with velocities of up to 20 mm/year measured along the satellite Line of Sight (LOS). Following, we focused on the most problematic landslide that affects the ?icau neighborhood and is well-known for its significant implications that it had. To better understand its behavior and the sensitivity of the displacements to the environmental factors (i.e., rainfall), we carried out 2D numerical modeling using a finite difference code. The simulated displacement field is consistent with the InSAR displacements and reveals the most active sectors of the landslide and insights about its mechanism.</p>

TI  - Investigations on Vector-Borne and Aerosol Transmission Potential of Kaeng Khoi Virus in Cave-Dwelling Wrinkle-Lipped Free-Tailed Bats (Chaerephon plicatus) in Thailand
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Kaeng Khoi virus (KKV; Order: Bunyavirales, Family: Peribunyaviridae, Genus: Orthobunyavirus), is an endemic viral infection of the wrinkle-lipped free-tailed bat (Chaerephon plicatus; also known as Tadarida plicata plicata). Viral isolates from bat bugs (Family: Cimicidae) suggest vector-borne transmission, but in general little is known about the ecology of KKV and seroprevalence in the local human and animal populations. Transmission studies and a serosurvey were carried out in Kaeng Khoi cave, Saraburi province, Thailand, during 1973-1974. Experimental transmission studies were performed with bat bugs captured within the cave to determine the potential for vector-borne transmission, and sentinel laboratory mice placed inside arthropod-proof cages within the cave to assess the potential for aerosolized transmission. Antibodies to KKV were detected in roof rats (Rattus rattus) inhabiting the cave, in dogs living in the valley, and in humans. Freshly collected cimicids were positive for KKV, but the virus did not replicate in laboratory-inoculated bugs. Sentinel mice placed in Kaeng Khoi cave in open cages consistently became infected with KKV, as determined by the development of neutralizing antibodies. Mice placed in arthropod-proof cages also developed antibodies, indicating the possibility of airborne transmission of KKV.</p>

TI  - Thermal infrared remote sensing of vegetation: Current status and perspectives
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays a vital role in the ecological functioning of terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. Remote sensing generally provides timely and accurate information to manage ecosystems sustainably and effectively. In this respect, thermal infrared (TIR, 3-14 mu m) remote sensing data form a valuable data source for vegetation studies. The TIR data provides unique information compared to other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. This article aims to gather and review the most relevant information obtained using TIR remote sensing data for terrestrial vegetation at leaf and canopy levels using laboratory/field-based, airborne and spaceborne platforms. We address this topic from various angles, particularly focusing on vegetation discrimination as well as the quantification of water stress by means of canopy temperature and spectral emissivity. In addition, attempts to associate TIR spectral features with vegetation biochemical compounds, as well as the retrieval of vegetation biochemical and biophysical parameters, are reviewed. Research needs and requirements for successful use of remote sensing in vegetation studies across the TIR region, as well as significant challenges, are also discussed. Our review reveals that, despite the increasing interest among remote sensing experts in using TIR data, there are still large gaps in our understanding and interpretation of TIR imagery. Some inconsistent findings and contradictory observations have come to light in different levels (i.e., leaf and canopy levels). In addition, our review shows that airborne and TIR hyperspectral-based studies are currently limited due to cost, particularly across large spatial extents. It can be concluded that TIR remote sensing of vegetation offers unique insights in understanding terrestrial vegetation (e.g., vegetation water stress and retrieval of biophysical parameters). TIR is complementary to other remote sensing data sources, with a high potential for fusing data from different parts of the spectrum. However, we highlight challenges obtaining consistent, meaningful and accurate results for land surface temperature and land surface emissivity retrieval.

TI  - Machine Learning techniques for solar irradiation nowcasting: Cloud type classification forecast through satellite data and imagery
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most important modern challenges in making the renewable energy sources more reliable is the development of new tools to better manage their non programmable nature and avoid economic losses, to ensure compliance with network constraints and to improve the management of congestion. The solar energy at ground level exhibits a continuous variation in time and space. This fluctuation has a deterministic component generated by the movements of rotation and revolution of the earth, and a random one generated by weather conditions. Solar energy variations at ground level have a great influence on the output power of a photovoltaic plant, which can fluctuate significantly in short intervals due to the random component. This work presents a new model to detect in real time the clouds which potentially obstruct the sunrays directed to a specific geographic target. Moreover, a novel procedure for the forecasting of the clearness sky index on the target in the fifteen minutes is proposed, levereging on Machine Learning techniques, exploiting satellite and weather data.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Mixed Pixel Analysis of Savanna Ecosystems: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Reliable estimates of savanna vegetation constituents (i.e., woody and herbaceous vegetation) are essential as they are both responders and drivers of global change. The savanna is a highly heterogenous biome with high variability in land cover types while also being very dynamic at both temporal and spatial scales. To understand the spatial-temporal dynamics of savannas, using Earth Observation (EO) data for mixed-pixel analysis is crucial. Mixed pixel analysis provides detailed land cover data at a sub-pixel level which are essential for conservation purposes, understanding food supply for herbivores, quantifying environmental change, such as bush encroachment, and fuel availability essential for understanding fire dynamics, and for accurate estimation of savanna biomass. This review paper consulted 197 studies employing mixed-pixel analysis in savanna ecosystems. The review indicates that studies have so far attempted to resolve the savanna mixed-pixel issues by using mainly coarse resolution data, such as Terra-Aqua MODIS and AVHRR and medium resolution Landsat, to provide fractional cover data. Hence, there is a lack of spatio-temporal mixed-pixel analysis for savannas at high spatial resolutions. Methods used for mixed-pixel analysis include parametric and non-parametric methods which range from pixel-unmixing models, such as linear spectral mixture analysis (SMA), time series decomposition, empirical methods to link the green vegetation parameters with Vegetation Indices (VIs), and machine learning methods, such as regression trees (RT) and random forests (RF). Most studies were undertaken at local and regional scale, highlighting a research gap for savanna mixed pixel studies at national, continental, and global level. Parametric methods for modeling spatio-temporal mixed pixel analysis were preferred for coarse to medium resolution remote sensing data, while non-parametric methods were preferred for very high to high spatial resolution data. The review indicates a gap for long time series spatio-temporal mixed-pixel analysis of savannas using high resolution data at various scales. There is potential to harmonize the available low resolution EO data with new high-resolution sensors to provide long time series of the savanna mixed pixel, which, according to this review, is missing.

TI  - Burden of Influenza-Associated Respiratory Hospitalizations, Vietnam, 2014-2016
T2  - EMERGING INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza burden estimates are essential to informing prevention and control policies. To complement recent influenza vaccine production capacity in Vietnam, we used acute respiratory infection (ARI) hospitalization data, severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) surveillance data, and provincial population data from 4 provinces representing Vietnam's major regions during 2014-2016 to calculate provincial and national influenza-associated ARI and SARI hospitalization rates. We determined the proportion of ARI admissions meeting the World Health Organization SARI case definition through medical record review. The mean influenza-associated hospitalization rates per 100,000 population were 218 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 197-238) for ARI and 134 (95% UI 119-149) for SARI. Influenza-associated SARI hospitalization rates per 100,000 population were highest among children <5 years of age (1,123; 95% UI 946-1,301) and adults >65 years of age (207; 95% UI 186-227), underscoring the need for prevention and control measures, such as vaccination, in these at-risk populations.

TI  - Identification of resident memory CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells with functional specificity for SARS-CoV-2 in unexposed oropharyngeal lymphoid tissue
T2  - SCIENCE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cross-reactive CD4(+) T cells that recognize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more commonly detected in the peripheral blood of unexposed individuals compared with SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD8(+) T cells. However, large numbers of memory CD8(+) T cells reside in tissues, feasibly harboring localized SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses. To test this idea, we performed a comprehensive functional and phenotypic analysis of virus-specific T cells in tonsils, a major lymphoid tissue site in the upper respiratory tract, and matched peripheral blood samples obtained from children and adults before the emergence of COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019). We found that SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD4(+) T cells could be found at similar frequencies in the tonsils and peripheral blood in unexposed individuals, whereas functional SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8(+) T cells were almost only detectable in the tonsils. Tonsillar SARS-CoV-2-specific memory CD8(+) T cells displayed a follicular homing and tissue-resident memory phenotype, similar to tonsillar Epstein-Barr virus-specific memory CD8(+) T cells, but were functionally less potent than other virus-specific memory CD8(+) T cell responses. The presence of preexisting tissue-resident memory CD8(+) T cells in unexposed individuals could potentially enable rapid sentinel immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The absence of a wastewater collection, management, and disposal scheme is one of Kabul's most serious environmental issues. This has resulted in both health and ecological problems. This research used Arc GIS and SewerGEMS tools to assess the viability of a decentralized sewerage collection model in the research area. The research area was chosen as the city's 5th district. Land-use and land-cover, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and Satellite data were used to construct the network's geometry in the Arc map environment. SewerGEMS software was used to perform hydraulic simulation and modeling. The variables were regulated based on the results of the study using conventional wastewater topology guidelines. Based on the outputs of hydraulic analysis, it is concluded that the decentralized wastewater collection system would be the best option for the area. It can be deduced from hydraulic design findings that the hydraulic model was successfully developed and built. The methodology can be applied for the development of future wastewater master plans of the city.

TI  - Development and Demonstration of a Method for GEO-to-LEO NDVI Transformation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a new method that mitigates biases between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from geostationary (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites for Earth observation. The method geometrically and spectrally transforms GEO NDVI into LEO-compatible GEO NDVI, in which GEO's off-nadir view is adjusted to a near-nadir view. First, a GEO-to-LEO NDVI transformation equation is derived using a linear mixture model of anisotropic vegetation and nonvegetation endmember spectra. The coefficients of the derived equation are a function of the endmember spectra of two sensors. The resultant equation is used to develop an NDVI transformation method in which endmember spectra are automatically computed from each sensor's data independently and are combined to compute the coefficients. Importantly, this method does not require regression analysis using two-sensor NDVI data. The method is demonstrated using Himawari 8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data at off-nadir view and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data at near-nadir view in middle latitude. The results show that the magnitudes of the averaged NDVI biases between AHI and MODIS for five test sites (0.016-0.026) were reduced after the transformation (< 0.01). These findings indicate that the proposed method facilitates the combination of GEO and LEO NDVIs to provide NDVIs with smaller differences, except for cases in which the fraction of vegetation cover (FVC) depends on the view angle. Further investigations should be conducted to reduce the remaining errors in the transformation and to explore the feasibility of using the proposed method to predict near-real-time and near-nadir LEO vegetation index time series using GEO data.</p>

TI  - Basic and deep learning models in remote sensing of soil organic carbon estimation: A brief review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - Understanding soil organic carbon (SOC) is critical to, among others, atmospherics and terrestrial carbon balance and climate change mitigation. This has necessitated development of novel analytical approaches to determine SOC. The use of neural network (NN) models for analysis of landscape biophysical and biochemical properties based on remotely sensed data has become popular in the last decade. This has been facilitated by the proliferation of "big data" from earth observation systems as well as the advances in machine learning (ML). Specifically, the use of traditional neural networks (TNN) and transition to deep learning (DL) frameworks offers considerable improvement in the performance and accuracy of SOC retrieval from remotely sensed data. This paper seeks to provide a brief review on the use of TNN and DL-based remote sensing strategies in SOC estimation, with focus on the progression, application, potential and limitations. The review concludes by providing major challenges impeding the wide adoption of DL frameworks in remote sensing applications of SOC, as well as the potential future research direction.

T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article aims to explain Leo Tolstoy's approach to representing the French ideas about Russia in the epic novel War and Peace. Previously created works of Russian literature about the Patriotic War of 1812 are analyzed: M.N. Zagoskin's Roslavlev, or the Russians in 1812 (1831) and F.V. Bulgarin's Peter Ivanovich Vyzhigin (1831). A comparative analysis allows making a conclusion that both works are characterized by the belles-lettres modeling of negative and derogatory French stereotypes about Russia. Zagoskin, trying to convince the reader that the disregard of Russia is a typical feature of the French worldview, puts cliched negative comments about Russia and Russians into almost all French characters' mouths. As a result, the reader perceives the presence of negative stereotypes as a circumstance no less significant than the real tragedy of hostilities, and which became the basis of Napoleon's invasion. In a similar vein, the theme of the French's biased attitude towards Russia is also developed in the novel by Bulgarin. Imitating French judgments about Russia, the author suggests that the basis of the war was the neglect of the French towards Russia, and the victory over Napoleon was the result of the Russians' desire to debunk the foreigners' unjust opinions about Russia. Since the regular aggravation of Russian-French relations constantly kept up to date the topic of negative French stereotypes, the reader had reason to believe that in the novel by Leo Tolstoy significant attention would be paid to the French reception of Russia. However, Tolstoy touched on this problem only with a glimpse, avoiding modeling negative French stereotypes about Russia. The French image of Russia has traditional exotic features, but this image cannot be perceived as a cause of military aggression. This can be explained by a combination of two reasons. Firstly, the experience of the writer's participation in the Crimean War suggested that the explanation of the logic of military history should be sought in the bivouac truth, in the movement of combat everyday routine, and in a combination of many individual characters involved into the events, but not in the exceptional abilities of historical persons or stencils of national mutual perception. The absolute priority given to the role of national stereotypes contradicted Tolstoy's historiosophical concept. In addition, by the time of the creation of War and Peace, the French reception of Russia had widely been comprehended in Russian scholarly, journalistic, and belles-lettres literature, which turned this topic into a "locus communis" not explaining the deep historical processes. Tolstoy's use of stereotypes of the French perception of Russia would have referred the reader to already familiar texts about the French in Russia and bated the sharpness of the reader's perception. Based on all this, the writer preferred to minimize the embodiment of the French reception of Russia to laconicism, allowing us to evaluate this reception as a real feature of national mutual representations, but not a key factor of historical upheavals.

TI  - Impact of Assimilating Advanced Himawari Imager Channel 16 Data on Precipitation Prediction over the Haihe River Basin
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assimilation of high-resolution geostationary satellite data is of great value for precise precipitation prediction in regional basins. The operational geostationary satellite imager carried by the Himawari-8 satellite, Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), has two additional water vapor channels and four other channels compared with its predecessor, MTSAT-2. However, due to the uncertainty in surface parameters, AHI surface-sensitive channels are usually not assimilated over land, except for the three water vapor channels. Previous research showed that the brightness temperature of AHI channel 16 is much more sensitive to the lower-tropospheric temperature than to surface emissivity, which is similar to the three water vapor channels 8-10. As a follow-up work, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of assimilating brightness temperature observations over land from both the three AHI water vapor channels and channel 16 to improve watershed precipitation forecasting through both case analysis (in the Haihe River basin, China) and batch tests. It is found that assimilating AHI channel 16 can improve the upstream near-surface atmospheric temperature forecast, which in turn affects the development of downstream weather systems. The precipitation forecasting test results indicate that adding the terrestrial observations of channel 16 to the assimilation of AHI data can improve short-term precipitation forecasting in the basin.

TI  - Clinical and cost characterization of hospitalization associated with varicella in children from the Metropolitan Region and Valparaiso, Chile
T2  - REVISTA CHILENA DE INFECTOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Varicella is a relevant infection in Chile and may cause serious complications and death, which could he associated with significant health care resource utilization and associated costs. In Chile, sentinel surveillance is carried out only on an outpatient basis, without knowing the impact of varicella in serious cases who need to be hospitalized, Aim: To describe the clinical characteristics id the costs associated with hospitalized children with diagnosis of varicella prior to the vaccine introduction in the National Immuization Program in Chile. Patients and Methods: A multicenter, observational, and retrospective study in hospitalized children (0-15 years) with a diagnosis of varicella, were conducted in five hospitals i Chile between January 2011 and December 2015. A review of the clinical records was performed to evaluate the clinical characteristics f the disease and costs associatal with hospitalization episodes for varicella. Results: A total of 68:5 hospitalized children for varicella ere included in this study. The median age was 3 years (IQR: 1-5), ost children were between 1 and 4 years of age (52% of total cases). 56% were male, and only 7 patients (1%) had a history of previous varicella vaccination. The median lenght of days of hospitalization was 3 days (IQR: 2-5). 13% of the cases required hospitalization in a more complex care unit, 6% in the intermediate unit and 7% in the iediatric intensive treatment unit, both with a median stay of 3 days. The main complications were: skin and soft tissue infections (42%), neurologic (8%) and septic or toxic shock (4%). There were 3 cases of death (0.4%). The direct cost of a varicella case was US $ 417, the indirect cost was US $ 224 and the proportional cost of a case of death was US $ 3,575. It is estimated that the total cost of a hospitalized varicella case in Chile was US $ 4,216. Conclusions: Varicella is associated with a significant burden of disease in Chile. Ihe median hospital stay was three days with 13% of cases requiring medical cane in a complex unit, with high associated costs which could be significantly reduced with the recently incorporation of the varicella vaccine into the National Immunization Program.

TI  - Mapping cropping intensity in Huaihe basin using phenology algorithm, all Sentinel-2 and Landsat images in Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - With the decline of cultivated land quality and area in recent decades, the intensification of land use plays an important role in meeting the growing demand for food. Cropping intensity refers to the number of crop planting cycles in one year, which is important for improving food production and safety at the local, regional and national scales. Therefore, it is necessary to develop an accurate high spatial resolution dataset of cropping intensity. The existing datasets of cropping intensity were generally developed based on MODIS or Landsat images, both of which have defects in spatial and temporal resolutions. In this paper, we improved the quality of the dataset on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, and developed a new algorithm incorporating crop phenology. The algorithm was based on the Landsat 7/8 and Sentine-2A/B time series imageries to map the 30 m cropping intensity in the Huaihe basin in 2018 by extracting complete growth cycle. Results show that single cropping, double cropping and triple cropping in the Huaihe basin accounted for 41.6%, 57.7% and 0.7% of the total cultivated area in 2018, respectively, and the proportion of multiple cropping reached 58.4%. The accuracy of single cropping, double cropping and triple cropping are 92.93%, 91.39%, and 72.78% respectively. The overall accuracy is 91.38% and the kappa coefficient is 0.84. This algorithm accurately captures the seasonal dynamics of planting patterns in arable land, which can be used to produce cropping intensity products with high-resolution and provide a reference for large-scale regional vegetation monitoring.

TI  - Network Analysis Integrating microRNA Expression Profiling with MRI Biomarkers and Clinical Data for Prostate Cancer Early Detection: A Proof of Concept Study
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
M3  - Article
AB  - The MRI of the prostate is the gold standard for the detection of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). Nonetheless, MRI still misses around 11% of clinically significant disease. The aim was to comprehensively integrate tissue and circulating microRNA profiling, MRI biomarkers and clinical data to implement PCa early detection. In this prospective cohort study, 76 biopsy naive patients underwent MRI and MRI directed biopsy. A sentinel sample of 15 patients was selected for a pilot molecular analysis. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was applied to identify the microRNAs drivers of csPCa. MicroRNA-target gene interaction maps were constructed, and enrichment analysis performed. The ANOVA on ranks test and ROC analysis were performed for statistics. Disease status was associated with the underexpression of the miRNA profiled; a correlation was found with ADC (r = -0.51, p = 0.02) and normalized ADC values (r = -0.64, p = 0.002). The overexpression of miRNAs from plasma was associated with csPCa (r = 0.72; p = 0.02), and with PI-RADS assessment score (r = 0.73; p = 0.02); a linear correlation was found with biomarkers of diffusion and perfusion. Among the 800 profiled microRNA, eleven were identified as correlating with PCa, among which miR-548a-3p, miR-138-5p and miR-520d-3p were confirmed using the RT-qPCR approach on an additional cohort of ten subjects. ROC analysis showed an accuracy of > 90%. Provided an additional validation set of the identified miRNAs on a larger cohort, we propose a diagnostic paradigm shift that sees molecular data and MRI biomarkers as the prebiopsy triage of patients at risk for PCa. This approach will allow for accurate patient allocation to biopsy, and for stratification into risk group categories, reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

TI  - Joint Sparsity for TomoSAR Imaging in Urban Areas Using Building POI and TerraSAR-X Staring Spotlight Data
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) can obtain 3D imaging models of observed urban areas and can also discriminate different scatters in an azimuth-range pixel unit. Recently, compressive sensing (CS) has been applied to TomoSAR imaging with the use of very-high-resolution (VHR) SAR images delivered by modern SAR systems, such as TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X. Compared with the traditional Fourier transform and spectrum estimation methods, using sparse information for TomoSAR imaging can obtain super-resolution power and robustness and is only minorly impacted by the sidelobe effect. However, due to the tight control of SAR satellite orbit, the number of acquisitions is usually too low to form a synthetic aperture in the elevation direction, and the baseline distribution of acquisitions is also uneven. In addition, artificial outliers may easily be generated in later TomoSAR processing, leading to a poor mapping product. Focusing on these problems, by synthesizing the opinions of various experts and scholarly works, this paper briefly reviews the research status of sparse TomoSAR imaging. Then, a joint sparse imaging algorithm, based on the building points of interest (POIs) and maximum likelihood estimation, is proposed to reduce the number of acquisitions required and reject the scatterer outliers. Moreover, we adopted the proposed novel workflow in the TerraSAR-X datasets in staring spotlight (ST) work mode. The experiments on simulation data and TerraSAR-X data stacks not only indicated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but also proved the great potential of producing a high-precision dense point cloud from staring spotlight (ST) data.

TI  - Surface Water Storage in Rivers and Wetlands Derived from Satellite Observations: A Review of Current Advances and Future Opportunities for Hydrological Sciences
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Surface water storage (SWS), the amount of freshwater stored in rivers/wetlands/floodplains/lakes, and its variations are key components of the water cycle and land surface hydrology, with strong feedback and linkages with climate variability. They are also very important for water resources management. However, it is still very challenging to measure and to obtain accurate estimates of SWS variations for large river basins at adequate time/space sampling. Satellite observations offer great opportunities to measure SWS changes, and several methods have been developed combining multisource observations for different environments worldwide. With the upcoming launch in 2022 of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission, which will provide, for the first time, direct estimates of SWS variations with an unprecedented spatial resolution (~100 m), it is timely to summarize the recent advances in the estimates of SWS from satellite observations and how they contribute to a better understanding of large-scale hydrological processes. Here, we review the scientific literature and present major results regarding the dynamic of surface freshwater in large rivers, floodplains, and wetlands. We show how recent efforts have helped to characterize the variations in SWS change across large river basins, including during extreme climatic events, leading to an overall better understanding of the continental water cycle. In the context of SWOT and forthcoming SWS estimates at the global scale, we further discuss new opportunities for hydrological and multidisciplinary sciences. We recommend that, in the near future, SWS should be considered as an essential water variable to ensure its long-term monitoring.</p>

AB  - This article deals with the analysis of InSAR performance for large-scale deformation measurement. The study evaluates the use of models, especially numerical weather prediction reanalysis, to mitigate disturbances in SAR interferograms. The impact of such corrections is evaluated by analyzing short-time baseline phase variograms in order to derive a lower bound for the interferometric accuracy, especially at large distances. The variance is then propagated from single interferograms to deformation rates. Finally, using GNSS measurements, the predicted error bars are validated on a large Sentinel-1 data set.

TI  - Feasibility Study on Estimation of Sea Ice Drift from KOMPSAT-5 and COSMO-SkyMed SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating the sea ice drift field is of importance in both scientific study and activities in the polar ocean. Ice motion is being tracked at large scale (10 km and larger) on a daily basis; however, a higher resolution product is desirable for more reliable monitoring of rapid changes in sea ice. The use of wide-swath SAR has been extensively studied; yet, recent high-resolution X-band SAR sensors have not been tested enough. We examine the feasibility of KOMPSAT-5 and COSMO-SkyMed for retrieving sea ice motion by using the dataset of the MOSAiC expedition. The ice drift match-ups extracted from consecutive SAR image pairs and buoys for more than seven months in the central Arctic were used for a performance evaluation and validation. In addition to individual tests for KOMPSAT-5 and COSMO-SkyMed, a cross-sensor combination of two sensors was tested to overcome the drawback, a relatively long revisit time of high-resolution SAR. The experimental results show that higher accuracies are achievable from both single- and cross-sensor configurations of high-resolution X-band SARs compared to wide-swath C-band SARs, and that sub-daily monitoring is feasible from the cross-sensor approach.</p>

TI  - Evaluation of Oil Spill Detection Models by Oil Spill Distribution Characteristics and CNN Architectures Using Sentinel-1 SAR data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting oil spill area using statistical characteristics of SAR images has limitations in that classification algorithm is complicated and is greatly affected by outliers. To overcome these limitations, studies using neural networks to classify oil spills are recently investigated. However, the studies to evaluate whether the performance of model shows a consistent detection performance for various oil spill cases were insufficient. Therefore, in this study, two CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) with basic structures (Simple CNN and U-net) were used to discover whether there is a difference in detection performance according to the structure of CNN and distribution characteristics of oil spill. As a result, through the method proposed in this study, the Simple CNN with contracting path only detected oil spill with an F1 score of 86.24% and U-net, which has both contracting and expansive path showed an F1 score of 91.44%. Both models successfully detected oil spills, but detection performance of the U-net was higher than Simple CNN. Additionally, in order to compare the accuracy of models according to various oil spill cases, the cases were classified into four different categories according to the spatial distribution characteristics of the oil spill (presence of land near the oil spill area) and the clarity of border between oil and seawater. The Simple CNN had F1 score values of 85.71%, 87.43%, 86.50%, and 85.86% for each category, showing the maximum difference of 1.71%. In the case of U-net, the values for each category were 89.77%, 92.27%, 92.59%, and 92.66%, with the maximum difference of 2.90%. Such results indicate that neither model showed significant differences in detection performance by the characteristics of oil spill distribution. However, the difference in detection tendency was caused by the difference in the model structure and the oil spill distribution characteristics. In all four oil spill categories, the Simple CNN showed a tendency to overestimate the oil spill area and the U-net showed a tendency to underestimate it. These tendencies were emphasized when the border between oil and seawater was unclear.

TI  - Effect of Correcting Radiometric Inconsistency between Input Images on Spatio-temporal Fusion of Multi-sensor High-resolution Satellite Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In spatio-temporal fusion aiming at predicting images with both high spatial and temporal resolutions from multi-sensor images, the radiometric inconsistency between input multi-sensor images may affect prediction performance. This study investigates the effect of radiometric correction, which compensate different spectral responses of multi-sensor satellite images, on the spatio-temporal fusion results. The effect of relative radiometric correction of input images was quantitatively analyzed through the case studies using Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, and RapidEye images obtained from two croplands. Prediction performance was improved when radiometrically corrected multi-sensor images were used as input. In particular, the improvement in prediction performance was substantial when the correlation between input images was relatively low. Prediction performance could be improved by transforming multi-sensor images with different spectral responses into images with similar spectral responses and high correlation. These results indicate that radiometric correction is required to improve prediction performance in spatio-temporal fusion of multi-sensor satellite images with low correlation.

TI  - The Relationship between Satellite-Derived Vegetation Indices and Live Weight Changes of Beef Cattle in Extensive Grazing Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The live weight (LW) and live weight change (LWC) of cattle in extensive beef production is associated with pasture availability and quality. The remote monitoring of pastures and cattle LWC can be achieved with a combination of satellite imagery and walk-over-weighing (WoW) stations. The objective of the present study is to determine the association, if any, between vegetation indices (VIs) (pasture availability) and the LWC of beef cattle in an extensive breeding operation in Northern Australia. The study also tests a suite of VIs along with variables such as rainfall and Julian day to predict the LWC of breeding cows. The VIs were calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery over a 2-year period from a paddock with 378 cattle. Animal LW was measured remotely using a weighing scale at the water point. The relationship between VIs, the LWC, and LW was assessed using linear mixed-effects regression models and random forest modelling. Findings demonstrate that all VIs calculated had a significant positive relationship with the LWC and LW (p < 0.001). Machine learning predictive modelling showed that the LWC of breeding cows could be predicted from VIs, Julian day, and rainfall information, with a Lin's Concordance Correlation Coefficient of 0.62 when using the leave-one-month-out cross-validation. The LW and LWC were greater during the wet season when VIs were higher compared to the dry season (p < 0.001). Results suggest that the remote monitoring of pasture availability, the LWC and LW is possible under extensive grazing conditions. Further, the use of VIs and other readily available data such as rainfall can be used to predict the LWC of a breeding herd in extensive conditions. Such information could be used to increase the productivity and land management in extensive beef production. The integration of these data streams offers great potential to improve the monitoring, management, and productivity of grazing or cropping enterprises.

TI  - Optimization of SPIO Injection for Sentinel Lymph Node Dissection in a Rat Model
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary: In this study, the following injection characteristics were evaluated to optimize magnetic tracer uptake in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in a rat hindleg model: (a) iron dose, (b) effect of dilution, (c) effect of injecting at different time courses and (d) effect of massaging the injection site. In conclusion, injection dose and time were primary factors for the SLN iron uptake. The result from this study will provide a background for magnetic procedures.The magnetic technique, consisting of a magnetic tracer and a handheld magnetometer, is a promising alternative technique for sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and was shown to be non-inferior to the standard technique in terms of identification rates. In this study, injection characteristics (iron dose, dilution, time course and massaging) were evaluated to optimize magnetic tracer uptake in the sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) in a rat hindleg model. 202 successful SLNDs were performed. Iron uptake in the SLN is proportional (10% utilization rate) to the injection dose between 20 and 200 mu g, showing a plateau uptake of 80 mu g in the SLN around 1000 mu g injection. Linear regression showed that time had a higher impact than dilution, on the SLN iron uptake. Massaging showed no significant change in iron uptake. The amount of residual iron at the injection site was also proportional to the injection dose without any plateau. Time was a significant factor for wash-out of residual iron. From these results, preoperative injection may be advantageous for SLN detection as well as reduction in residual iron at the injection site by potential decrease in required injection dose.

TI  - Coastline Detection Based on Sentinel-1 Time Series for Ship- and Flood-Monitoring Applications
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter addresses the use of the Sentinel-1 time series with the aim of proposing an automatic and unsupervised coastline detection method that averages the dynamical variations of coastal areas over a limited period of time, e.g., one year. First, we propose applying a temporal averaging filter that allows the temporal variations in coastal areas, e.g., due to tides or vegetation, to be encapsulated, and, at the same time, the speckle to be reduced, without decreasing the spatial resolution of the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) time series. Then, based on the distinctive backscattering values of the sea and land pixels, we will employ an iterative hierarchical tiling method in order to accurately characterize the two classes using bimodal distribution. The distribution is then segmented by a thresholding and region-growing procedure to separate the sea and land classes. A large-scale quantitative comparison between the SAR-derived and open street map (OSM) coastlines allows for a numerical evaluation of the results, i.e., an overall agreement ranging from 80% to 90%. In addition, Sentinel-2 images are used to evaluate the estimated SAR coastline qualitatively. Furthermore, the benefits of having an accurate SAR coastline are shown in the case of two well-known Earth observation-monitoring applications, ship detection, and floodwater mapping.

TI  - A Novel Method Based on Deep Learning, GIS and Geomatics Software for Building a 3D City Model from VHR Satellite Stereo Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the paper is to identify a suitable method for the construction of a 3D city model from stereo satellite imagery. In order to reach this goal, it is necessary to build a workflow consisting of three main steps: (1) Increasing the geometric resolution of the color images through the use of pan-sharpening techniques, (2) identification of the buildings' footprint through deep-learning techniques and, finally, (3) building an algorithm in GIS (Geographic Information System) for the extraction of the elevation of buildings. The developed method was applied to stereo imagery acquired by WorldView-2 (WV-2), a commercial Earth-observation satellite. The comparison of the different pan-sharpening techniques showed that the Gram-Schmidt method provided better-quality color images than the other techniques examined; this result was deduced from both the visual analysis of the orthophotos and the analysis of quality indices (RMSE, RASE and ERGAS). Subsequently, a deep-learning technique was applied for pan sharpening an image in order to extract the footprint of buildings. Performance indices (precision, recall, overall accuracy and the F-1 measure) showed an elevated accuracy in automatic recognition of the buildings. Finally, starting from the Digital Surface Model (DSM) generated by satellite imagery, an algorithm built in the GIS environment allowed the extraction of the building height from the elevation model. In this way, it was possible to build a 3D city model where the buildings are represented as prismatic solids with flat roofs, in a fast and precise way.</p>

TI  - Multi-Sensor, Active Fire-Supervised, One-Class Burned Area Mapping in the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing efforts are being devoted to understanding fire patterns and changes highlighting the need for a consistent database about the location and extension of burned areas (BA). Satellite-derived BA mapping accuracy in the Brazilian savannas is limited by the underestimation of burn scars from small, fragmented fires and high cloudiness. Moreover, systematic mapping of BA is challenged by the need for human intervention in training sample acquisition, which precludes the development of automatic-generated products over large areas and long periods. Here, we developed a multi-sensor, active fire-supervised, one-class BA mapping algorithm to address several of these limitations. Our main objective is to generate a long-term, detailed BA atlas suitable to improve fire regime characterization and validation of coarse resolution products. We use composite images derived from the Landsat satellite to generate end-of-season maps of fire-affected areas for the entire Cerrado. Validation exercises and intercomparison with BA maps from a semi-automatic algorithm and visual photo interpretation were conducted for the year 2015. Our results improve the BA mapping by reducing omission errors, especially where there is high cloud frequency, few active fires are detected, and burned areas are small and fragmented. Finally, our approach represents at least a 45% increase in BA mapped in the Cerrado, in comparison to the annual extent detected by the current coarse global product from MODIS satellite (MCD64), and thus, it is capable of supporting improved regional emissions estimates.

TI  - Applying Spatial Analysis to Create Modern Rich Pictures for Grassland Health Analysis
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are complex and heterogeneous ecosystems, and their health can be defined by the cumulative ability of their components to evolve, adapt, and maintain their integrity in the presence of stress/disturbance and provide ecosystem services. Herein, a design approach is used to generate alternative and multifunctional pastoral livestock production systems that enhance grassland health. As a way of understanding the complexity of grasslands and initiating the design process using systems thinking, rich pictures emerge as a useful method. As rich pictures are subjective views, geographic information systems (GIS) could be applied to improve the veracity of their outcomes, as both techniques are forms of an analytical process. This paper reports the application of GIS to a case study of a high-country farm to generate and combine different thematic maps to create a modern rich picture. The rich picture is a combination of remote sensing data (altitude, slope, aspects, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)), and on-the-ground data (plant species distribution and diversity and soil chemical, biological, and physical parameters). Layers were combined using a multi-criteria evaluation (MCE) based on the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) to create a final rich picture. The results highlight dissimilarities in perceptions of what underpins 'grassland health' between researchers in different fields and with different perspectives. The use of GIS produced a modern rich picture that enhanced the understanding of grassland health and allowed for the identification of gaps, values, and possibilities for future research work.</p>

TI  - Phycocyanin Monitoring in Some Spanish Water Bodies with Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an appropriate tool for water management. It allows the study of some of the main sources of pollution, such as cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms. These species are increasing due to eutrophication and the adverse effects of climate change. This leads to water quality loss, which has a major impact on the environment, including human water supplies, which consequently require more expensive purification processes. The application of satellite remote sensing images as bio-optical tools is an effective way to monitor and control phycocyanin concentrations, which indicate the presence of cyanobacteria. For this study, 90 geo-referenced phycocyanin measurements were performed in situ, using a Turner C3 Submersible Fluorometer and a laboratory spectrofluorometer, both calibrated with phycocyanin standard, in water bodies of the Iberian Peninsula. These samples were synchronized with Sentinel-2 satellite orbit. The images were processed using Sentinel Application Program software and corrected with the Case 2 Regional Coast color-extended atmospheric correction tool. To produce algorithms that would help to obtain the phycocyanin concentration from the reflectance measured by the multispectral instrument sensor of the satellite, the following band combinations were tested, among others: band 665 nm, band 705 nm, and band 740 nm. The samples were equally divided: half were used for the algorithm's calibration, and the other half for its validation. With the best adjustment, the algorithm was made more robust and accurate through a recalculation, obtaining a determination coefficient of 0.7, a Root Mean Square Error of 8.1 mu g L-1, and a Relative Root Mean Square Error of 19%. In several reservoirs, we observed alarming phycocyanin concentrations that may trigger many environmental health problems, as established by the World Health Organization. Remote sensing provides a rapid monitoring method for the temporal and spatial distribution of these cyanobacteria blooms to ensure good preventive management and control, in order to improve the environmental quality of inland waters.

TI  - Intensive West Nile Virus Circulation in Serbia in 2018-Results of Integrated Surveillance Program
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - The results of the Serbian national integrated West Nile virus (WNV) surveillance program conducted in 2018 and funded by the Serbian Veterinary Directorate are presented. The WNV surveillance program encompassed the entire territory of Serbia and was conducted by the veterinary service in collaboration with entomologists and ornithologists. The objective of the program was early detection of WNV circulation in the environment and timely reporting to the public health service and local authorities to increase clinical and mosquito control preparedness. The program was based on the detection of WNV presence in wild birds (natural hosts) and mosquitoes (virus vectors) and on serological testing of sentinel horses (WNV-specific IgM antibodies). The season 2018 was confirmed to be the season of the most intensive WNV circulation with the highest number and severity of human cases in Serbia ever reported. The most intense WNV circulation was observed in the northern and central parts of Serbia including Vojvodina Province, the Belgrade City area, and surrounding districts, where most positive samples were detected among sentinel animals, mosquitoes and wild birds. The majority of human cases were preceded by the detection of WNV circulation during the surveillance. The WNV surveillance program in 2018 showed satisfactory results in the capacity to indicate the spatial distribution of the risk for humans and sensitivity to early detection of WNV circulation in the environment.

TI  - Non-Sentinel Lymph Node Detection during Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Not-Complete-Lymph-Node-Dissection Era: A New Technique for Better Staging and Treating Melanoma Patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy has been demonstrated to be an effective staging procedure since its introduction in 1992. The new American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) classification did not consider the lack of information that would result from the less usage of the complete lymph node dissection as for a diagnostic purpose. Thus, this makes it difficult the correct staging and would leave about 20% of the further positive non-sentinel lymph nodes in the lymph node basin. In this paper, we aim to describe a new surgical technique that, combined with single-photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT), allows for better staging of melanoma patients. This is a prospective study that includes 104 patients with cutaneous melanoma. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was offered according to the AJCC guideline. Planar lymphoscintigraphy was performed in association with SPECT-CT, identifying and removing all non-biologically "excluded" lymph nodes, guiding the surgeon's hand in detection and removal of lymph nodes. Even if identification and removal of non-sentinel lymph nodes is unable to increase overall survival, it definitely gives better disease control in the basin. With a "classic" setting, the risk of leaving further lymph nodes out of the sentinel lymph node procedure is around 20%, thus, basically, the surgical sentinel lymph node of first and second lymph nodes would have therapeutic value and complete lymph node dissection classically performed.

TI  - Multi-scale and multi-system perspectives of zooplankton structure and function in Canadian freshwaters
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This review provides a Canadian perspective on freshwater zooplankton diversity and ecology across scales and systems. It aims at describing how zooplankton are diverse in forms and functions, and constitute a key component of plankton food webs, a model for ecological theories and a sentinel for monitoring ecological integrity and function in lakes facing environmental changes and anthropogenic stressors. These objectives are addressed across a continuum of scales (continental, regional and local) and systems (reservoirs, lakes and ponds). This perspective shows that the environmental control of zooplankton biodiversity, community structure and function in Canada is complex and variable. Zooplankton communities demonstrated a wide range of responses to anthropogenic disturbances across scales and systems due to interactions with watershed biogeochemistry and climate. This review supports the Multiple Forces hypothesis where forcing by abiotic factors (climate, nutrients, morphometry and chemistry) has a fundamental role at continental scale over Canadian ecoregions, and at regional scale in the Boreal ecozones. In contrast, forcing by biotic factors (algal resources and predators) is relatively more influential at local scale, in resort and urban regions. The challenge for future research will be to combine all new concepts and approaches in a global perspective to better understand the responses of freshwater zooplankton to multiple environmental changes and anthropogenic stressors in Canada.

TI  - Modeling mangrove responses to multi-decadal climate change and anthropogenic impacts using a long-term time series of satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the effects of simultaneously operating climate change and anthropogenic impacts on mangroves remains a challenge for the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The objective of this study was to spatially quantify the spatial extents and biomass of dwarf and tall mangroves in response to drought intensities (Standardized Precipitation Index, SPI), sea-level rise (EC), land use/land cover change (LULC), and surface runoff and freshwater inflow to upstream mangrove catchments along the coasts of southern Iran over a 35-year period (1986-2020). The study drew on a long-term time series of 105 Landsat satellite images, maritime data, rainfall data, field surveys, and models to quantify independent variables (i.e., the WetSpass-M model to quantify surface runoff) and mixed models analysis to determine the important drivers of change. Although mixed model analysis indicated that sea-level rise was the main climate change driver of the development of spatial extents and biomass of both tall and dwarf mangroves, its influence was embedded in the larger temporal climate context of the region. Our findings show that spatial extents and biomass development are neither tightly coupled nor developed temporally or directionally synchronously in dwarf and tall mangroves. This study also shows a precipitous decline in rainfall amounts, SPI, and freshwater runoff volumes starting in 1998. The ensuing long-term drought that is still ongoing but decreased slightly in intensity in the last few years shaped the overall spatiotemporal development pattern of the mangrove structures over the entire study period. The correlation between biomass and the independent variables was similar for dwarf and tall mangroves and was positive with SPI and runoff amounts and negative with EC in all three study sites.

TI  - Review on Multitemporal Classification Methods of Satellite Images for Crop and Arable Land Recognition
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper presents a review of the conducted research in the field of multitemporal classification methods used for the automatic identification of crops and arable land using optical satellite images. The review and systematization of these methods in terms of the effectiveness of the obtained results and their accuracy allows for the planning towards further development in this area. The state of the art analysis concerns various methodological approaches, including selection of data in terms of spatial resolution, selection of algorithms, as well as external conditions related to arable land use, especially the structure of crops. The results achieved with use of various approaches and classifiers and subsequently reported in the literature vary depending on the crops and area of analysis and the sources of satellite data. Hence, their review and systematic conclusions are needed, especially in the context of the growing interest in automatic processes of identifying crops for statistical purposes or monitoring changes in arable land. The results of this study show no significant difference between the accuracy achieved from different machine learning algorithms, yet on average artificial neural network classifiers have results that are better by a few percent than others. For very fragmented regions, better results were achieved using Sentinel-2, SPOT-5 rather than Landsat images, but the level of accuracy can still be improved. For areas with large plots there is no difference in the level of accuracy achieved from any HR images.

TI  - Comprehensive Review of Fluorescence Applications in Gynecology
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Since the introduction of indocyanine green (ICG) as a fluorophore in near-infrared imaging, fluorescence visualization has become an essential tool in many fields of surgery. In the field of gynecology, recent new applications have been proposed and found their place in clinical practice. Different applications in gynecology were investigated, subcategorized, and overviewed concerning surgical applications and available dyes. Specific applications in which fluorescence-guided surgery was implemented in gynecology are described in this manuscript-namely, sentinel node biopsy, mesometrium visualization, angiography of different organs, safety issues in pregnant women, ureters visualization, detection of peritoneal metastases, targeted fluorophores for cancer detection, fluorescent contamination hysterectomy, lymphography for lower limb lymphedema prevention, tumor margin detection, endometriosis, and metastases mapping. With evolving technology, further innovative research on the new applications of fluorescence visualization in cancer surgery may help to establish these techniques as standards of high-quality surgery in gynecology. However, more investigations are necessary in order to assess if these innovative tools can also be effective to improve patient outcomes and quality of life in different gynecologic malignancies.

TI  - Sentinel 2 images enable reliable prediction of fine-scale habitat dynamics of narrow endemic plant species in serpentine soils
T2  - APPLIED VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - AimsSerpentine soils are rare globally, covering <1% of the land surface, but frequently harbouring large numbers of narrow endemic species. Many serpentine areas are endangered and would benefit from actions informed by species distribution models (SDMs). Here, we assessed, for the first time, the potential use of remotely sensed descriptors of water and carbon cycles derived from Copernicus Sentinel 2 images for fine-scale habitat characterization and mapping of narrow endemic serpentine-tolerant species.LocationWe focused on three endemic species with a very limited distribution in the Serra de Careon ultramafic outcrop, a regional plant biodiversity hotspot in Spain.MethodsWe developed SDMs based solely on remotely sensed descriptors of plant water content and habitat dynamics estimated from multitemporal Sentinel 2 images.ResultsThe predictive capacity of the models was very high (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) > 0.9, sensitivity > 90 and specificity > 84), even for projections beyond the range of data used for calibration (AUC > 0.8, sensitivity > 77 and specificity > 81). Overall, the suitable habitat areas predicted by the models were similar for all three species (Schoener's D metric > 0.7). The annual mean and coefficient of variation of the Normalized Difference of Water Index provided a good representation of the hydromorphic soils with serpentine clay minerals and characterized by the formation of temporary pools during winter months. The annual mean and coefficient of variation of the Modified Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index were also important predictors owing to their capacity to capture the serpentine habitat conditions, characterized by open vegetation and highly exposed soil.ConclusionsThese findings confirm the potential of ecosystem functioning descriptors derived from spectral Sentinel 2 indices as a cost-effective means of characterizing the ecological niche of endemic plant species in serpentine habitats and as a promising tool to support their conservation and monitoring.

TI  - Gap-Filling of NDVI Satellite Data Using Tucker Decomposition: Exploiting Spatio-Temporal Patterns
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing satellite images in the optical domain often contain missing or misleading data due to overcast conditions or sensor malfunctioning, concealing potentially important information. In this paper, we apply expectation maximization (EM) Tucker to NDVI satellite data from the Iberian Peninsula in order to gap-fill missing information. EM Tucker belongs to a family of tensor decomposition methods that are known to offer a number of interesting properties, including the ability to directly analyze data stored in multidimensional arrays and to explicitly exploit their multiway structure, which is lost when traditional spatial-, temporal- and spectral-based methods are used. In order to evaluate the gap-filling accuracy of EM Tucker for NDVI images, we used three data sets based on advanced very-high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) imagery over the Iberian Peninsula with artificially added missing data as well as a data set originating from the Iberian Peninsula with natural missing data. The performance of EM Tucker was compared to a simple mean imputation, a spatio-temporal hybrid method, and an iterative method based on principal component analysis (PCA). In comparison, imputation of the missing data using EM Tucker consistently yielded the most accurate results across the three simulated data sets, with levels of missing data ranging from 10 to 90%.

TI  - Phase 1 study in healthy participants of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of enpatoran (M5049), a dual antagonist of toll-like receptors 7 and 8
T2  - PHARMACOLOGY RESEARCH & PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of single and multiple oral doses of enpatoran (formerly named M5049), a new toll-like receptor (TLR) 7 and 8 dual antagonist, and the effect of food on a single dose in healthy participants. In this single phase 1, randomized (3:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 96 participants received single and multiple ascending oral doses of enpatoran. Participants in single-dose cohorts received one dose of enpatoran (1, 3, 9, 25, 50, 100, or 200 mg) or placebo using a sentinel dosing strategy. Multiple-dose cohorts received enpatoran (9, 25, or 200 mg once daily, or 25 or 50 mg twice daily) or placebo for 14 days. Safety, tolerability, PK, and PD (ex vivo-stimulated cytokine secretion) were assessed in both parts. The effect of food was assessed in an open-label, one-way crossover study in the 25 mg single-dose cohort. Single- and multiple-oral doses of enpatoran up to 200 mg were well tolerated and no significant dose-limiting adverse events or safety signals were observed under fasting or fed conditions. PK parameters were linear and dose-proportional across the dose range evaluated, with a slightly delayed absorption and lower peak concentration observed at 25 mg with food. Exposure-dependent inhibition of ex vivo-stimulated interleukin-6 secretion was observed, with maximum inhibition at 200 mg. Enpatoran was well tolerated at doses up to 200 mg. Further investigation of enpatoran is warranted as a potential treatment for diseases driven by TLR7/8 overactivation, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and COVID-19 pneumonia.

TI  - Mapping coastal marine ecosystems of the National Park of Banc d'Arguin (PNBA) in Mauritania using Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal marine ecosystems ensure fundamental hydro-ecological functions and support high levels of biodiversity, besides being an important resource for local populations. These biocenosis have been increasingly threatened by human pressures (e.g. pollution, overfishing) along with climate change, which may have a dramatic impact on them. The National Park of Banc d'Arguin (PNBA) in Mauritania, one of the biggest parks in Western Africa, is a RAMSAR zone (classified by UNESCO since 1989) that plays a major role in (i) the maintenance of marine biocenosis, (ii) the protection of the ecosystems and (iii) the sequestration of carbon dioxide. Ecosystem databases and associated maps of the PNBA are out of date and limited to the southern and central parts of the park: updating is thus needed. In this paper, a supervised Support Vector Machine (SVM) was deployed using high-resolution images from Sentinel-2 combined with field data to map marine biocenosis of the PNBA. The results highlight that Sentinel-2 shows good classification accuracy for mapping marine biocenosis (>80% overall accuracy and a kappa index of 0.75), including seagrass beds. Also, the use of high-resolution sensors like SPOT-6 (1.5 m pixels) can overcome the limitations of Sentinel-2 (10 m pixels) when it comes to detecting small ecosystems distributed in patches. The use of freely-downloadable Sentinel-2 data, processed using geoinformatic freeware, make the methodology reproducible, affordable and easily transferable to local actors of biodiversity conservation for long term usage.

TI  - Co-Creating a "Sustainable New Normal" for Social Work and Beyond: Embracing an Ecosocial Worldview
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Review
AB  - We have an opportunity to help shape new systems and structures that redress injustices and course correct us for a trajectory that is infinitely better than the one on which we are now set. We can co-create a sustainable new normal, intentionally and mindfully, alongside those who are most impacted by factors of oppression, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Such a new trajectory would mitigate both the unintentional harm and blatant atrocities done to people and our ecosystem, as well as heal and promote holistic, mutual well-being. Since the dawn of the profession, many social workers have practiced using an expanded understanding of the person-environment framework (i.e., social, political, economic, and environmental) and have drawn upon Indigenous worldviews. However, our current mainstream professional models are entrenched in the growth ideology, which perpetuates the very injustices that we seek to eliminate. Therefore, we need to embrace an ecosocial worldview, shifting conversations and actions towards alternative approaches and establish new policies and practices. In order to equip the profession to meet these roles and responsibilities and address these interwoven injustices, we highlight examples of real, successful alternatives implemented across the globe and pose considerations for re-envisioning and co-creating a sustainable new normal, for the profession and beyond.

TI  - Metop First Generation AVHRR FRAC SST Reanalysis Version 1
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The first full-mission global AVHRR FRAC sea surface temperature (SST) dataset with a nominal 1.1 km resolution at nadir was produced from three Metop First Generation (FG) satellites: Metop-A (2006-on), -B (2012-on) and -C (2018-on), using the NOAA Advanced Clear Sky Processor for Ocean (ACSPO) SST enterprise system. Historical reprocessing ('Reanalysis-1', RAN1) starts at the beginning of each mission and continues into near-real time (NRT). ACSPO generates two SST products, one with global regression (GR; highly sensitive to skin SST), and another one with piecewise regression (PWR; proxy for depth SST) algorithms. Small residual effects of orbital and sensor instabilities on SST retrievals are mitigated by retraining the regression coefficients daily, using matchups with drifting and tropical moored buoys within moving time windows. In RAN, the training windows are centered at the processed day. In NRT, the same size windows are employed but delayed in time, ending four to ten days prior to the processed day. Delayed-mode RAN reprocessing follows the NRT with a two-month lag, resulting in a higher quality and a more consistent SST record. In addition to its completeness, the newly created Metop-FG RAN1 SST dataset shows very close agreement with in situ data (including the fully independent Argo floats), well within the NOAA specifications for accuracy (global mean bias; +/- 0.2 K) and precision (global standard deviation; 0.6 K) in a similar to 20% clear-sky domain (percent of clear-sky SST pixels to the total of ice-free ocean). All performance statistics are stable in time, and consistent across the three platforms. The Metop-FG RAN1 data set is archived at the NASA JPL PO.DAAC and NOAA NCEI. This paper documents the newly created dataset and evaluates its performance.

TI  - Analysis of Land Surface Temperature (LST) in Bur Ni Geureudong Geothermal Field, Aceh, Indonesia Using Landsat 8 OLI / TIRS Images
T2  - Chiang Mai University Journal of Natural Sciences
M3  - Article
AB  - Bur Ni Geureudong is one of geothermal areas that potentially to be developed for geothermal power plant in Aceh Province, Indonesia. Prior to the development, detail investigation based on geological, geophysical and geochemical methods are needed for estimating its potential. However, this site is located in a mountainous area with dense forests that are difficult to reach and research of geothermal exploration in site is still very poor considering its promising potential. So that the use of remote sensing method is very suitable to be done to investigate geothermal potential in these remote areas. For reconnaissance survey, Land Surface Temperature (LST) mapping using Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor) image data was conducted to investigate the geothermal potential in the area. Radiometric correction, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) mapping and emissivity calculations were performed to obtain the LST map. Results show temperatures in the area ranged 17 degrees C to 40 degrees C, the area with high surface temperatures are caused by geothermal activities. NDVI map also shows an agreement with the high surface temperature region and they are mostly indicated by occurrence of vegetation stress.

TI  - Improving remote sensing retrieval of water clarity in complex coastal and inland waters with modified absorption estimation and optical water classification using Sentinel-2 MSI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of water clarity in coastal and inland waters from satellite images is limited by significant uncertainties attributable to the optical complexity of these waters. To address this issue, we propose an improved semi-analytical model for retrieving the Secchi disk depth (ZSD) based on the mechanistic model (Lee model) developed by Lee et al. (2015). In the Lee model, a quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA) was employed to estimate the total absorption coefficient (a(lambda)) and total backscattering coefficient (bb(lambda)) to retrieve the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd(lambda)). ZSD was then estimated by remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and Kd. In this study, two improvements were made to the Lee model based on the band specifications of the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI). First, the reference wavelength (lambda 0) was shifted from 560 nm and 665 nm to the longer red edge band 705 nm, and the modified empirical formula for estimating a(lambda 0) was applied to improve ZSD retrieval. Second, waters were classified into different optical water types (OWTs), and the optimal ZSD algorithm was identified for each OWT to further improve the accuracy of ZSD estimation. The proposed model (denoted as QAA_OWT) was calibrated and evaluated with in situ data (N = 399) collected from waters with various optical properties including a lake (Daihai Lake) dominated by colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), a macrophytic lake (Ulansuhai Lake), and coastal water (the Bohai Sea) dominated by suspended sediments. The validation showed that QAA_OWT improved the accuracy of ZSD retrieval (0.18-5.0 m), with the averaged percentage difference (MAPD) decreasing from 31.9% to 24.9% and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) decreasing from 0.38 m to 0.32 m. The model was further applied to satellite images from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and independently assessed based on in situ-satellite match-ups (N = 31). The results verified the reliability of the model (MAPD = 31.8%, RMSD = 0.16 m). Time series MSI-derived ZSD maps clearly characterized the spatio-temporal patterns of the water clarity of Daihai Lake. Such maps are of significance in the accurate evaluation of the effectiveness of pollution control measures and aquatic ecosystem protection for lakes with low water quality. Sensitivity analysis revealed the robustness and insensitivity of the proposed model to input noise. This model could be applicable to many satellite sensors with spectral bands similar to those of Sentinel-2 MSI. Furthermore, it can be used as an effective tool for highly accurate remote sensing retrieval of ZSD in optically complex coastal and inland waters.

TI  - A Modified Self-adaptive Method for Mapping Annual 30-m Land Use/Land Cover Using Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of Yangtze River Delta
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Annual Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) change information at medium spatial resolution (i.e., at 30 m) is used in applications ranging from land management to achieving sustainable development goals related to food security. However, obtaining annual LULC information over large areas and long periods is challenging due to limitations on computational capabilities, training data, and workflow design. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), which provides a catalog of multi-source data and a cloud-based environment, we developed a novel methodology to generate a high accuracy 30-m LULC cover map collection of the Yangtze River Delta by integrating free and public LULC products with Landsat imagery. Our major contribution is a hybrid approach that includes three major components: 1) a high-quality training dataset derived from multi-source LULC products, filtered by k-means clustering analysis; 2) a yearly 39-band stack feature space, utilizing all available Landsat data and DEM data; and 3) a self-adaptive Random Forest (RF) method, introduced for LULC classification. Experimental results show that our proposed workflow achieves an average classification accuracy of 86.33% in the entire Delta. The results demonstrate the great potential of integrating multi-source LULC products for producing LULC maps of increased reliability. In addition, as the proposed workflow is based on open source data and the GEE cloud platform, it can be used anywhere by anyone in the world.

TI  - Computing and Assessment of Discrete Angle Positions for Optimizing the Solar Energy Harvesting for Urban Sustainable Development
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper proposes the computation and assessment of optimal tilt and azimuth angles for a receiving surface, using a mathematical model developed at the University of Tomsk, Russia. The model was validated and analyzed for the Nuevo Leon State, Northeast Mexico, utilizing a set of metrics, comparing against satellite data from NASA. A point of interest in the city of Monterrey was analyzed to identify orientation patterns throughout the year for an optimal solar energy gathering. The aim is providing the best orientation tilt angles for photovoltaic or solar thermal panels without tracking systems. In addition, this analysis is proposed as a tool to achieve optimal performance in sustainable urban development in the region. Based on the findings, a set of optimal tilt and azimuth surface angles are proposed for the analyzed coordinates. The aim is to identify the optimal performance to obtain the maximum solar irradiation possible over the year for solar projects in the region. The results show that the model can be used as a tool to accelerate decision making in the design of solar harvesting surfaces and allows the design of discrete tracking systems with an increase in solar energy harvesting above 5% annually.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article discusses the process of creating a digital forest model based on remote sensing data, three-dimensional modeling, and forest inventory data. Remote sensing data of the Earth provide a fundamental tool for integrating subsequent objects into a digital forest model, enabling the creation of an accurate digital model of a selected forest quarter by using forest inventory data in educational and experimental forestry, and providing a valuable and extensive database of forest characteristics. The formalization and compilation of technologies for connecting forest inventory databases and remote sensing data with the construction of three-dimensional tree models for a dynamic display of changes in forests provide an additional source of data for obtaining new knowledge. The quality of forest resource management can be improved by obtaining the most accurate details of the current state of forests. Using machine learning and regression analysis methods as part of a digital model, it is possible to visually assess the course of planting growth, changes in species composition, and other morphological characteristics of forests. The goal of digital, interactive forest modeling is to create virtual simulations of the future status of forests using a combination of predictive forest inventory models and machine learning technology. The research findings provide a basic idea and technique for developing local digital forest models based on remote sensing and data integration technologies.</p>

TI  - A Method to Estimate Surface Soil Moisture and Map the Irrigated Cropland Area Using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering variations in surface soil moisture (SSM) is essential in improving crop yield and irrigation scheduling. Today, most remotely sensed soil moisture products have difficulties in resolving irrigation signals at the plot scale. This study aims to use Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to estimate SSM at high spatial (10 m) and temporal resolution (at least 5 days) over an agricultural domain. Three supervised machine learning algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and linear regression models, were trained to estimate changes in SSM based on the variation in surface reflectance and backscatter over five different crops. Results showed that CNN is the best algorithm as it understands spatial relations and better represents two-dimensional images. Estimated values for SSM were in agreement with in-situ measurements regardless of the crop type, with RMSE=0.0292 (cm3/cm3) and R2=0.92 for the Sentinel-2 derived SSM and RMSE=0.0317 (cm3/cm3) and R2=0.84 for the Sentinel-1 soil moisture data. Moreover, a time series of estimated SSM based on Sentinel-1 (SSM-S1), Sentinel-2 (SSM-S2), and SSM derived from SMAP-Sentinel1 was compared. The developed SSM data showed a significantly higher mean SSM state over irrigated agriculture relative to the rainfed cropland area during the irrigation season. The multiple comparisons (fisher LSD) were tested and found that these two groups are different (pvalue=0.035 in 95% confidence interval). Therefore, by employing the maximum likelihood classification on the SSM data, we managed to map the irrigated agriculture. The overall accuracy of this unsupervised classification is 77%, with a kappa coefficient of 65%.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Analysis of West Nile Virus Epidemic in South Banat District, Serbia, 2017-2019
T2  - ANIMALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary:& nbsp;West Nile fever is an arthropod-borne viral disease that is transmitted from birds to humans and animals by mosquitoes. Humans may develop a severe disease, which sometimes can be fatal. At the end of the 20th century, the first outbreaks of West Nile fever among humans in urban environments in Eastern Europe and the United States were reported. The epidemics were characterized by the neurological form of the disease with a fatal outcome. Since the first outbreak of the disease in Serbia, the highest number of cases occurred in 2018. West Nile fever spread is driven by location and time, which means nearby locations and periods have similar features. Recognition of patterns of spread of the disease has the potential to facilitate the mosquito control program and disease prevention. This study aimed to examine the geographical and temporal similarities of registered cases during the epidemics in the period 2017-2019 in South Banat District, Serbia. We identified the following factors as crucial for the prediction of possible outbreaks: the presence of virus in natural reservoirs, mosquito abundance; precipitation, high water level of rivers followed by a consequent sudden decrease of precipitation and withdrawal of rivers into the main bed, and favorable temperatures.</p><br></p>West Nile virus (WNV) is an arthropod-born pathogen, which is transmitted from wild birds through mosquitoes to humans and animals. At the end of the 20th century, the first West Nile fever (WNF) outbreaks among humans in urban environments in Eastern Europe and the United States were reported. The disease continued to spread to other parts of the continents. In Serbia, the largest number of WNV-infected people was recorded in 2018. This research used spatial statistics to identify clusters of WNV infection in humans and animals in South Banat County, Serbia. The occurrence of WNV infection and risk factors were analyzed using a negative binomial regression model. Our research indicated that climatic factors were the main determinant of WNV distribution and were predictors of endemicity. Precipitation and water levels of rivers had an important influence on mosquito abundance and affected the habitats of wild birds, which are important for maintaining the virus in nature. We found that the maximum temperature of the warmest part of the year and the annual temperature range; and hydrographic variables, e.g., the presence of rivers and water streams were the best environmental predictors of WNF outbreaks in South Banat County.</p>

TI  - Retrieving gap-free daily root zone soil moisture using surface flux equilibrium theory
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is a dominant control on crop productivity, land-atmosphere feedbacks, and the hydrologic response of watersheds. Despite its importance, obtaining gap-free daily moisture data remains challenging. For example, remote sensing-based soil moisture products often have gaps arising from limits posed by the presence of clouds and satellite revisit period. Here, we retrieve a proxy of daily RZSM using the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates from Surface Flux Equilibrium Theory (SFET). Our method is calibration-less, parsimonious, and only needs widely available meteorological data and standard land-surface parameters. Evaluation of the retrievals at Oklahoma Mesonet sites shows that our method, overall, matches or outperforms widely available RZSM estimates from three markedly different approaches, viz. remote sensing data based Atmosphere-Land EXchange Inversion (ALEXI) model, the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission RZSM data product. When compared with in-situ observations, unbiased root mean square difference of retrieved RZSM were 0.03 (m(3) m(-3)), 0.06 (m(3) m(-3)), and 0.05 (m(3) m(-3)) for our method, the ALEXI model, and the VIC model, respectively. Better performance of our method is attributed to the use of both SFET for the estimation of ETa and non-parametric kernel-based method used to relate the RZSM with ETa. RZSM from our method may serve as a more accurate and temporally-complete alternative for a variety of applications including mapping of agricultural droughts, assimilation of RZSM for hydrometeorological forecasting, and design of optimal irrigation schedules.

TI  - Leaf water content estimation using top-of-canopy airborne hyperspectral data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed estimation of leaf water content (LWC) using optical data at early crop growth stage is important for identification of water-stressed plants. However, its accurate estimation is currently a major challenge due to the coarse spatial and spectral resolution of the available optical data, and the atmospheric impact on satellite-based remotely sensed data. Moreover, during early growth stages the canopy coverage is low, increasing the effect of the bare soil background on low spatial resolution data. Consequently, broadband optical data is insensitive to overtone frequencies of O-H stretching bonds of water molecules. Accordingly, this research developed a new model for estimating LWC based on newly identified, pure-pixel, water sensitive indices from high spatial resolution hyperspectral data. A hand-held field spectroradiometer and drone-based hyperspectral imager were used to collect temporal high spectral resolution hyperspectral data (Range: 400-1000 nm; Bandwidth: -2.1 nm) at leaf level, together with destructively sampled leaves to measure their LWC using the oven-drying method. The spectroradiometer data were used to explore the wavelengths sensitive to vibrational overtone frequencies of O-H bonds of water molecules present in leaves. A total of seven watersensitive wavelengths were identified, and corresponding normalised indices created for use with pure pixel narrowband hyperspectral data from vegetation. Farm scale maps of LWC were then created using drone-based hyperspectral data, based on minimum and maximum values of the above indices and 'days after sowing' information, through a gradient boost machine (GBM) model. The early growth stage maps of LWC were able to distinguish between water-stressed and well-irrigated plots with an R-2 of 0.93 and RMSE of 1.6% (g/g).

TI  - The Effect of Night Low Temperature on Agronomical Traits of Thirty-Nine Pepper Accessions (<i>Capsicum annuum</i> L.)
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Pepper plants are subject to complex environmental factors including abiotic and biotic stresses in fields, as well as the significant effects of climate changes, including low and high temperatures. Low temperature stress in the growth and development of pepper plants is one of the most critical issues, and directly impacts the crop yield and productivity of pepper plants. Therefore, it is essential to select and breed low temperature-(LT) tolerant pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) cultivars. This research was conducted to assess the agronomical traits of 39 pepper accessions belonging to the chili and bell fruit varieties which were cultivated under two different night temperature set-points: at 15 degrees C for a suboptimal temperature (CT) and at 10 degrees C for a low temperature (LT). The plant heights (PH) of most pepper accessions in a LT were significantly decreased compared to those in a CT. The stem diameter (SD) and the length of main axis (LMA) varied depending on the genotypes under LT. Moreover, the number of flowers (NFL), total number of fruits (NFR), fruit yield (FY), fruit fresh weight (FFW), fruit length (FL), fruit diameter (FD), and number of seeds in a fruit (NSF) remarkably declined in a LT compared to in a CT. The evaluated agronomical traits between LT and CT were further applied for the correlation analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical cluster analysis. Notably, the FY trait was correlated with other reproductive traits including NFR, FFW, FD, and FL on the positive directions and thirty-nine LT-treated pepper accessions were clustered into seven groups by the hierarchical clustering analysis. The selected accessions were primarily involved in the positive trends with the reproductive index including NFR, FL, FD, and FFW traits and could be used for pepper breeding programs to develop LT-tolerant cultivars.

TI  - Factors Associated With SARS-CoV-2 Infection in Bogota, Colombia: Results From a Large Epidemiological Surveillance Study
T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-AMERICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Epidemiologic surveillance of COVID-19 is essential to collect and analyse data to improve public health decision making during the pandemic. There are few initiatives led by public-private alliances in Colombia and Latin America. The CoVIDA project contributed with RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 in mild or asymptomatic populations in Bogota. The present study aimed to determine the factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in working adults.Methods: COVID-19 intensified sentinel epidemiological surveillance study, from April 18, 2020, to March 29, 2021. The study included people aged 18 years or older without a history of COVID-19. Two main occupational groups were included: healthcare and essential services workers with high mobility in the city. Social, demographic, and health-related factors were collected via phone survey. Afterwards, the molecular test was conducted to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.Findings: From the 58,638 participants included in the study, 3,310 (5.6%) had a positive result. A positive result was associated with the age group (18-29 years) compared with participants aged 60 or older, participants living with more than three cohabitants, living with a confirmed case, having no affiliation to the health system compared to those with social health security, reporting a very low socioeconomic status compared to those with higher socioeconomic status, and having essential occupations compared to healthcare workers.Interpretation: The CoVIDA study showed the importance of intensified epidemiological surveillance to identify groups with increased risk of infection. These groups should be prioritised in the screening, contact tracing, and vaccination strategies to mitigate the pandemic.(c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - How Religious Jewish and Muslim Students of Social Work Cope in a Secular College
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - The social work profession's worldview, which is expressed through education and practice, is 'almost exclusively secular in colour and context'. This qualitative study in the phenomenological tradition of ten religious Jewish and ten religious Arab-Muslim students of social work in Israel found that both groups coped similarly with the secularity, despite their ethnic, national and religious differences. Most of them adopted emotion-focussed coping strategies that isolated them from their academic surroundings. The religious students who adopted a problem-focussed strategy opened themselves to new knowledge. Knowing about these strategies may help faculty and other personnel in social work schools not only to be better acquainted with this minority but also to provide an environment that is receptive to and respectful of the religious student.

TI  - Ocean Fronts detection over the Bay of Bengal using changepoint algorithms-A non-parametric approach
T2  - OCEANOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Oceanic fronts are regions over the oceans where a significant change in the characteristics of the water masses is observed. Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite imagery over the Bay of Bengal shows regions that are populated by frontal structures. Over the Bay of Bengal, some of the strongest gradients in temperature and salinity are observed. In recent years, there has been a tremendous growth in the availability of satellite imagery and the necessity of automated fast detection of the frontal features is needed for services like potential fishing zones over open oceans. In this article, an algorithm to infer oceanic fronts over the Bay of Bengal is described using changepoint analysis. The changepoint algorithm is combined in a novel way with a contextual median filter to detect frontal features in AVHRR imagery. The changepoint analysis is a non-parametric technique that does not put thresholds on the gradients of brightness temperatures of the satellite imagery. In the open oceans, the gradients of temperature and salinity are not sharp and changepoint analysis is found to be a useful complementary technique to the existing front detecting methods when combined with contextual median filters.

TI  - Monitoring Changes to Arctic Vegetation and Glaciers at Ny-Alesund, Svalbard, Based on Time Series Remote Sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has profoundly affected global ecological security. The most vulnerable region on Earth is the high-latitude Arctic. Identifying the changes in vegetation coverage and glaciers in high-latitude Arctic coastal regions is important for understanding the process and impact of global climate change. Ny-Alesund, the northern-most human settlement, is typical of these coastal regions and was used as a study site. Vegetation and glacier changes over the past 35 years were studied using time series remote sensing data from Landsat 5/7/8 acquired in 1985, 1989, 2000, 2011, 2015 and 2019. Site survey data in 2019, a digital elevation model from 2009 and meteorological data observed from 1985 to 2019 were also used. The vegetation in the Ny-Alesund coastal zone showed a trend of declining and then increasing, with a breaking point in 2000. However, the area of vegetation with coverage greater than 30% increased over the whole study period, and the wetland moss area also increased, which may be caused by the accelerated melting of glaciers. Human activities were responsible for the decline in vegetation cover around Ny-Alesund owing to the construction of the town and airport. Even in areas with vegetation coverage of only 13%, there were at least five species of high-latitude plants. The melting rate of five major glaciers in the study area accelerated, and approximately 82% of the reduction in glacier area occurred after 2000. The elevation of the lowest boundary of the five glaciers increased by 50-70 m. The increase in precipitation and the average annual temperature after 2000 explains the changes in both vegetation coverage and glaciers in the study period.

TI  - Temporal Pattern Analysis of Cropland Phenology in Shandong Province of China Based on Two Long-Sequence Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology dynamics have attracted worldwide attention due to its direct response to global climate change and the great influence on terrestrial carbon budgets and ecosystem productivity in the past several decades. However, most studies have focused on phenology investigation on natural vegetation, and only a few have explored phenology variation of cropland. In this study, taking the typical cropland in the Shandong province of China as the target, we analyzed the temporal pattern of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and phenology metrics (growing season start (SOS) and end (EOS)) derived from the Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) 3-generation version 1 (1982-2015) and the Vegetation Index and Phenology (VIP) version 4 (1981-2016), and then investigated the influence of climate factors and Net Primary Production (NPP, only for EOS) on SOS/EOS. Results show a consistent seasonal profile and interannual variation trend of NDVI for the two products. Annual average NDVI has significantly increased since 1980s, and hugely augmentations of NDVI were detected from March to June for both NDVI products (p < 0.01), which indicates a consistent greening tendency of the study region. SOSs from both products are correlated well with the ground-observed wheat elongation and spike date and have significantly advanced since the 1980s, with almost the same changing rate (0.65/0.64 days yr-1, p < 0.01). EOS also exhibits an earlier but weak advancing trend. Due to the significant advance of SOS, the growing season duration has significantly lengthened. Spring precipitation has a relatively stronger influence on SOS than temperature and shortwave radiation, while a greater correlation coefficient was diagnosed between EOS and autumn temperature/shortwave radiation than precipitation/NDVI. Autumn NPP exhibits a nonlinear effect on EOS, which is first earlier and then later with the increase of autumn NPP. Overall, we highlight the similar capacity of the two NDVI products in characterizing the temporal patterns of cropland phenology.</p>

TI  - Atmospheric Methane Condition over the South Sumatera Peatland during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent anthropogenic activities have degraded peatlands, the largest natural reservoir of soil carbon, thereby reducing their carbon uptake from the atmosphere. As one of the primary sources of methane (CH4) emissions in terrestrial ecosystems, peatlands also contribute to atmospheric greenhouse gases. During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, Indonesia implemented a lockdown referred to as large-scale social restrictions (LSSR) in areas with high case numbers. To evaluate the effects of anthropogenic activity on peatlands, we investigated the CH4 concentrations in the atmosphere above the tropical peatlands of the Indonesian province South Sumatra before the LSSR (March 2020), during the LSSR (May 2020), and during the corresponding months of the previous year (March and May 2019). Using satellite-retrieved data from NASA, viz., the CH4 concentration and gross primary production (GPP) measured by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on board Aqua and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Terra, respectively, we discovered a decrease of approximately 5.5% in the mean CH4 concentration (which averaged 1.73 ppm across the periods prior to lockdown) as well as an increase in the GPP (which ranged from 53.3 to 63.9 g C m(-2) day(-1) during the lockdown, indicating high atmospheric carbon intake) during the LSSR. Thus, the restrictions during lockdown, which reduced anthropogenic activities, such as land use conversion and biomass burning, and related events, such as peatland and forest fires, significantly influenced the level of atmospheric CH4 above the peatlands in Indonesia.

TI  - Determining Actual Evapotranspiration Based on Machine Learning and Sinusoidal Approaches Applied to Thermal High-Resolution Remote Sensing Imagery in a Semi-Arid Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is key to assess crop water balance and optimize water-use efficiency. To attain sustainability in cropping systems, especially in semi-arid ecosystems, it is necessary to improve methodologies of ET estimation. A method to predict ET is by using land surface temperature (LST) from remote sensing data and applying the Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance Model (SSEBop). However, to date, LST information from Landsat-8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) has a coarser resolution (100 m) and longer revisit time than Sentinel-2, which does not have a thermal infrared sensor, which compromises its use in ET models as SSEBop. Therefore, in the present study we set out to use Sentinel-2 data at a higher spatial-temporal resolution (10 m) to predict ET. Three models were trained using TIRS' images as training data (100 m) and later used to predict LST at 10 m in the western section of the Copiapo Valley (Chile). The models were built on cubist (Cub) and random forest (RF) algorithms, and a sinusoidal model (Sin). The predicted LSTs were compared with three meteorological stations located in olives, vineyards, and pomegranate orchards. RMSE values for the prediction of LST at 10 m were 7.09 K, 3.91 K, and 3.4 K in Cub, RF, and Sin, respectively. ET estimation from LST in spatial-temporal relation showed that RF was the best overall performance (R-2 = 0.710) when contrasted with Landsat, followed by the Sin model (R-2 = 0.707). Nonetheless, the Sin model had the lowest RMSE (0.45 mm d(-1)) and showed the best performance at predicting orchards' ET. In our discussion, we argue that a simplistic sinusoidal model built on NDVI presents advantages over RF and Cub, which are constrained to the spatial relation of predictors at different study areas. Our study shows how it is possible to downscale Landsat-8 TIRS' images from 100 m to 10 m to predict ET.

TI  - A new application to one-step nucleic acid amplification-discarded sample in breast cancer: Preliminary results.
T2  - Molecular and clinical oncology
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay is a molecular method used for detecting breast cancer (BC) metastasis in sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, this method has a major disadvantage, since it prevents tissue structure analysis, while only one molecular marker can be evaluated, namely cytokeratin 19 mRNA. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether an OSNA-discarded sample could be suitable for the gene expression analysis of the SLN microenvironment. The remaining intermediate phase of the centrifuged SLN homogenate obtained from the OSNA assay of samples from two patients with BC was used for mRNA extraction. Subsequently, the expression of five genes, namely forkhead box, cluster of differentiation 4 and three control genes, was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analysis. The results demonstrated that high-quality RNA was extracted. Therefore, this RNA may be used for gene expression analyses to predict novel molecular biomarkers associated with immuno-inflammatory microenvironment.

TI  - Changes in Meadow Phenology in Response to Grazing Management at Multiple Scales of Measurement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian and ground-water dependent ecosystems found in the Great Basin of North America are heavily utilized by livestock and wildlife throughout the year. Due to this constant pressure, grazing can be a major influence on many groundwater dependent resources. It is important for land managers to understand how intensity and timing of grazing affect the temporal availability of these commodities (i.e., biodiversity, water filtration, forage, habitat). Shifts in forage or water availability could potentially be harmful for fauna that rely on them at specific times of the year. Seven meadow communities, each consisting of three distinct vegetative communities, were grazed at three intensities to determine the relationship between grazing management and phenological timing of vegetation. The agreement of on-the-ground measurements, near-surface digital cameras (phenocams), and satellite-based indices of greenness was examined for a two-year period (2019-2020) over these grazing and vegetative community gradients. Field determined phenology, phenocam Green Chromatic Coordinate (GCC), and Landsat Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were all highly correlated and the relationship did not change across the treatments. Timing of growth varied in these ecosystems depending on yearly precipitation and vegetative type. Communities dominated by mesic sedges had growing seasons which stopped earlier in the year. Heavier grazing regimes, however, did not equate to significant changes in growing season. Ultimately, shifts in phenology occurred and were successfully monitored at various spatial and temporal scales.

TI  - The Three-Cornered Hat Method for Estimating Error Variances of Three or More Atmospheric Datasets. Part II: Evaluating Radio Occultation and Radiosonde Observations, Global Model Forecasts, and Reanalyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply the three-cornered hat (3CH) method to estimate refractivity, bending angle, and specific humidity error variances for a number of datasets widely used in research and/or operations: radiosondes, radio occultation (COSMIC, COSMIC-2), NCEP global forecasts, and nine reanalyses. We use a large number and combinations of datasets to obtain insights into the impact of the error correlations among different datasets that affect 3CH estimates. Error correlations may be caused by actual correlations of errors, representativeness differences, or imperfect collocation of the datasets. We show that the 3CH method discriminates among the datasets and how error statistics of observations compare to state-of-the-art reanalyses and forecasts, as well as reanalyses that do not assimilate satellite data. We explore results for October and November 2006 and 2019 over different latitudinal regions and show error growth of the NCEP forecasts with time. Because of the importance of tropospheric water vapor to weather and climate, we compare error estimates of refractivity for dry and moist atmospheric conditions.

TI  - Land use/land cover change and ecosystem services in the Bagmati River Basin, Nepal
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Delivery of ecosystem services is strongly affected by changes in the land use/land cover (LULC) of an area. In this study, we analyze spatiotemporal changes in LULC of the rapidly changing Bagmati River Basin (BRB) of Nepal during 1988-2018 using Landsat satellite images. We also quantify carbon storage in different physiographic regions and LULC classes using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) model and assess economic valuation of carbon using the benefit transfer method. According to our analysis, there were increases in urban/built-up (247.5%), barren land (109.5%), shrub land (32.4%), and declines in forest cover (- 6.2%), cultivated land (- 4.1%), waterbodies (- 30.3%), sand (- 29.2%), and grass cover (- 10.6%) during the study period. As a result of these changes in LULC, carbon storage declined from 31.4 million tons year(-1) in 1988 (worth 157.0 million USD) to 30.8 million tons year(-1) (154.1 million USD) in 2018 with the total loss of 2.9 million USD. The largest decline in stored carbon was observed in Tarai and Dun valleys, from 6.8 to 6.5 million tons (- 1.4 million USD) followed by Churia, from 7.8 to 7.6 million tons (- 1.1 million USD). Increases in carbon storage were observed in urban/built-up and shrub land areas and declines in cultivated land, forest, barren land, waterbodies and grass land. The results of LULC change and estimated carbon stock in BRB provides a baseline for planners and policy makers to formulate appropriate plans to sustainably manage the region's land cover and to mitigate carbon loss.

TI  - Forest Cover and Sustainable Development in the Lumbini Province, Nepal: Past, Present and Future
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of forest cover change at different scales is an increasingly important research topic in environmental studies. Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR) is an integrated approach to manage and restore forests across various landscapes and environments. Such restoration helps to meet the targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-15, as outlined in the UN Environment's sixth Global Outlook, which includes the sustainable management of forests, the control of desertification, reducing degradation, biodiversity loss, and the conservation of mountain ecosystems. Here, we have used time series Landsat images from 1996 to 2016 to see how land use, and in particular forest cover, have changed between 1996 and 2016 in the Lumbini Province of Nepal. In addition, we simulated projections of land cover (LC) and forest cover change for the years 2026 and 2036 using a hybrid cellular automata Markov chain (CA-Markov) model. We found that the overall forest area increased by 199 km(2) (2.1%), from a 9491 km(2) (49.3%) area in 1996 to 9691 km(2) (50.3%) area in 2016. Our modeling suggests that forest area will increase by 81 km(2) (9691 to 9772 km(2)) in 2026 and by 195 km(2) (9772 km(2) to 9966 km(2)) in 2036. They are policy, planning, management factors and further strategies to aid forest regeneration. Clear legal frameworks and coherent policies are required to support sustainable forest management programs. This research may support the targets of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), the land degradation neutral world (LDN), and the UN decade 2021-2031 for ecosystem restoration.

TI  - Improving Soil Moisture Assessment of Turfgrass Systems Utilizing Field Radiometry
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for water conservation continues to increase as global freshwater resources dwindle. Turfgrass mangers are adapting to these concerns by implementing new tools to reduce water consumption. Time-domain reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture sensors can decrease water usage when scheduling irrigation, but nonuniformity across unsampled locations creates irrigation inefficiencies. Remote sensing data have been used to estimate soil moisture stress in turfgrass systems through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, numerous stressors other than moisture constraints impact NDVI values. The water band index (WBI) is an alternative index that uses narrowband, near-infrared light reflectance to estimate moisture limitations within the plant canopy. The green-to-red ratio index (GRI) is a vegetation index that has been proposed as a cheaper alternative to WBI as it can be measured using digital values of visible light instead of relying on more costly hyperspectral reflectance measurements. A replicated 2 x 3 factorial experimental design was used to repeatedly measure turf canopy reflectance and soil moisture over time as soils dried. Pots of '007' creeping bentgrass (CBG) and 'Latitude 36' hybrid bermudagrass (HBG) were grown on three soil textures: United States Golf Association (USGA) 90:10 sand, loam, and clay. Reflectance data were collected hourly between 07:00 and 19:00 using a hyperspectral radiometer and volumetric water content (VWC) data were collected continuously using an embedded soil moisture sensor from soil saturation until complete turf necrosis by drought stress. The WBI had the strongest relationship to VWC (r = 0.62) compared to GRI (r = 0.56) and NDVI (r = 0.47). The WBI and GRI identified significant moisture stress approximately 28 h earlier than NDVI (p = 0.0010). Those metrics also predicted moisture stress prior to fifty percent visual estimation of wilt (p = 0.0317), with lead times of 12 h (WBI) and 9 h (GRI). By contrast, NDVI provided 2 h of prediction time. Nonlinear regression analysis showed that WBI and GRI can be useful for predicting moisture stress of CBG and HBG grown on three different soil textures in a controlled environment.

TI  - Evidence for reprogramming of monocytes into reparative alveolar macrophages in vivo by targeting PDE4b
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-LUNG CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Increased lung vascular permeability and neutrophilic inflammation are hallmarks of acute lung injury. Alveolar macrophages (AM phi), the predominant sentinel cell type in the airspace, die in massive numbers while fending off pathogens. Recent studies indicate that the AM phi pool is replenished by airspace-recruited monocytes, but the mechanisms instructing the conversion of recruited monocytes into reparative AM phi remain elusive. Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a vascular barrier protective and immunosuppressive second messenger in the lung. Here, we subjected mice expressing GFP under the control of the Lysozyme-M promoter (LysM-GFP mice) to the LPS model of rapidly resolving lung injury to address the impact of mechanisms determining cAMP levels in AM phi and regulation of mobilization of the reparative AM phi-pool. RNA-seq analysis of flow-sorted M phi identified phosphodiesterase 4b (PDE4b) as the top LPS-responsive cAMP-regulating gene. We observed that PDE4b expression markedly increased at the time of peak injury (4 h) and then decreased to below the basal level during the resolution phase (24 h). Activation of transcription factor NFATc2 was required for the transcription of PDE4b in M phi. Inhibition of PDE4 activity at the time of peak injury, using intratracheal rolipram, increased cAMP levels, augmented the reparative AM phi pool, and resolved lung injury. This response was not seen following conditional depletion of monocytes, thus establishing airspace-recruited PDE4b-sensitive monocytes as the source of reparative AM phi. Interestingly, adoptive transfer of rolipram-educated AM phi into injured mice resolved lung edema. We propose suppression of PDE4b as an effective approach to promote reparative AM phi generation from monocytes for lung repair.

TI  - Evaluation of the Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) Product in the Sao Francisco Basin (Brazil)
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sao Francisco River basin is one of the largest in the Brazilian territory. This basin has enormous economic, social and cultural importance for the country. Its water is used for human and animal supply, irrigation and energy production. This basin is located in an area with different climatic characteristics (humid and semiarid) and studies related to precipitation are very important in this region. In this scenario, the objective of this investigation is to present an assessment of rainfall estimated through the Integrated Multi-SatellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG) product compared with rain gauges over the Sao Francisco river basin in Brazil. For that, a period from of 20 years and 18 surface weather stations were used to evaluate the product. Based on different evaluation techniques, the study found that the IMERG is appropriate to represent precipitation over the basin. According to the results, the performance of the IMERG product depends on the location where the rain occurs. The bias ranged from -1.67 to 0.34 mm, the RMSE ranged from 5.36 to 10.36 mm and the values of the correlation coefficients between the daily data from the IMERG and rain gauge ranged from 0.28 to 0.61. The results obtained by Student t-test, density curves and regression analysis, in general, show that the IMERG is able to satisfactorily represent rain gauge data. The exception is the eastern portion of the basin, where the product, on average, underestimates the precipitation (p-value < 0.05) and presents the worst statistical metrics.

TI  - Implementation of Fire Policies in Brazil: An Assessment of Fire Dynamics in Brazilian Savanna
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In 2012, the Brazilian government implemented the Federal Brigades Program (FBP), a fire policy strategy to hire and train firefighters to combat wildfires. This study analyzed the impact of this program on fire behavior before (2008-2012) and after (2013-2017) its implementation in the Parque do Araguaia Indigenous Land, the largest indigenous territory with the highest occurrence of fires in the Brazilian tropical savanna. We analyzed the annual pattern of fire incidence in the dry season, the fire impact per vegetation type, the recurrence, and the relationship between fire and precipitation. The datasets were based on active fire products derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Landsat and Resourcesat-based burned area products, and the records of the fire combat operations. Our results showed that FBP contributed to the reduction of the number of areas affected by fires and to the formation of a more heterogeneous environment composed of fire-resistant and fire-sensitive native vegetation fragments. On the other hand, after the implementation of the FBP, there was an increase in the recurrence of 3-4 years of fires. We concluded that the FBP is an important public policy capable of providing improvements in fire management activities.

TI  - 3D Ocean Water Wave Surface Analysis on Airborne LiDAR Bathymetric Point Clouds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water wave monitoring is a vital issue for coastal research and plays a key role in geomorphological changes, erosion and sediment transportation, coastal hazards, risk assessment, and decision making. However, despite missing data and the difficulty of capturing the data of nearshore fieldwork, the analysis of water wave surface parameters is still able to be discussed. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for accurate detection and analysis of water wave surface from Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry (ALB) large-scale point clouds data. In our proposed method we combined the modified Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) clustering method with a connectivity constraint and a multi-level analysis of ocean water surface. We adapted for most types of wave shape anatomies in shallow waters, nearshore, and onshore of the coastal zone. We used a wavelet analysis filter to detect the water wave surface. Then, through the Fourier Transformation Approach, we estimated the parameters of wave height, wavelength, and wave orientation. The comparison between the LiDAR measure estimation technique and available buoy data was then presented. We quantified the performance of the algorithm by measuring the precision and recall for the waves identification without evaluating the degree of over-segmentation. The proposed method achieves 87% accuracy of wave identification in the shallow water of coastal zones.

TI  - Social Work Communication with Parents Who Are Practising Christians: An Empirical Study
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Given Britain's religious, spiritual and secular diversity, and national legislation and policy directives such as The Children Act 1989 and Working Together to Safeguard Children, this empirical study addressed the lack of specific research investigating social workers' actual communication-in-action with Christian parents during statutory parenting assessment. The research deployed the two complementary theoretical frameworks of Critical Realism and Worldview studies to generate a deep understanding of communication. Thick descriptions of the communication act, social-worker-with-Christian-parent communication and the attendant meanings attributed to this event by study participants were generated from substantive data obtained from (i) a Forum Theatre performance delivered to thirty-one volunteering qualifying and qualified social workers and from (ii) unstructured qualitative interviews with twelve volunteering Christian parents. Analytic tactics from grounded theory were deployed to conduct the retroductive analysis. Key findings identified some shared social-worker-with-Christian-parent understandings. However, generally, Christian parents were so mistrustful about revealing ontological commitments to their Christian living/parenting praxis that they altered their language-a wariness worsened by the social workers' absenting of Christian belief-talk through using formulaic strategies.

TI  - Trends and drivers of forest cover change in the Cherangany hills forest ecosystem, western Kenya
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting and monitoring forest cover change and its drivers has become a vital component of forest management globally as it helps in decision-making and policy development. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatio-temporal trends of forest cover change and its drivers from 1985 to 2020 in the Cherangany hills forest ecosystem, Kenya. Landsat satellite data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) algorithms were used for land cover mapping and change detection. In addition, a literature review was undertaken to establish the drivers of forest cover change over time in the study area. The results show an overall decline in the forest, water features, and built-up areas land cover categories in the study area while croplands, grasslands, and bareland registered gains. The percentage area under forests declined by about 14.1% (13,782 ha) during the 35 years. This loss translates to an annual average forest loss of 0.40% or 394 ha. Conversely, cropland and grassland registered an increase of about 8.1% (7944 ha) and 5.8% (5616 ha) respectively over the 35-year study period. The drivers of forest cover change in the ecosystem comprised the conversion of forests to croplands and grasslands, grazing, encroachment, illegal logging, firewood harvesting, charcoal production, forest fires, excisions, climate change, population growth, policy, and institutional failures. The findings of this study will help the relevant forest managers re-evaluate the past conservation and management strategies and focus the rehabilitation efforts on the forest ecosystem's degradation hotspots for sustainable forest management.

TI  - Unequivocal Differences in Predation Pressure on Large Carabid Beetles between Forestry Treatments
T2  - DIVERSITY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Carabid beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are considered as one of the most cardinal invertebrate predatory groups in many ecosystems, including forests. Previous studies revealed that the predation pressure provided by carabids significantly regulates the ecological network of invertebrates. Nevertheless, there is no direct estimation of the predation risk on carabids, which can be an important proxy for the phenomenon called ecological trap. In our study, we aimed to explore the predation pressure on carabids using 3D-printed decoys installed in two types of forestry treatments, preparation cuts and clear cuts, and control plots in a Hungarian oak-hornbeam forest. We estimated the seasonal, diurnal and treatment-specific aspects of the predation pressure on carabids. Our results reveal a significantly higher predation risk on carabids in both forestry treatments than in the control. Moreover, it was also higher in the nighttime than daytime. Contrarily, no effects of season and microhabitat features were found. Based on these clues we assume that habitats modified by forestry practices may act as an ecological trap for carabids. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of how ecological interactions between species may change in a modified forest environment.

TI  - Factors Affecting Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Breast Cancer Undergoing Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy before or after Systemic Therapy
T2  - IRANIAN RED CRESCENT MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The tendency to spread to sentinel lymph node (SLN) may differ depending on the biological, clinical, and histopathological features of tumors. If the factors that affect SLN metastasis (SLNM) are known, there may be no need to perform SLN biopsy (SLNB) in some groups.Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting SLNM in patients who underwent surgery and SLNB before (surgery group) or after (neoadjuvant chemotherapy group) systemic therapy in the light of current biological characteristics of tumors and patients.Methods: The study included patients who were operated on for breast cancer and underwent SLNB in our institute between 2017 and 2019. The study included a total of 1,050 patients, who were divided into the surgery (n=900) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) groups (n=150). The patients' tumor localization, tumor size, histological subtype, grade, receptor status, lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status, the number of sentinel lymph nodes removed, metastatic lymph nodes in SLNB, and axillary dissection status were analyzed in this study.Results: The study included a total of 1,050 patients, who were assigned to the surgery (n=900) and NAC groups (n=150). Of the patients, 311 (34.5%) cases had SLNM. In the surgery group, multivariate analyses showed that grade III, LVI, Her2 (+) increased the risk of metastasis. In the NAC group, the analyses showed Pre-NAC clinical findings of LN metastasis and luminal A subtypes as effective factors. The factors affecting SLNM were analyzed, and the univariate analyses showed that grades II and III, a tumor size of >2 cm, LVI, Her2 (+), and triple negative increased the risk of metastasis. The analyses also revealed LVI as the most important risk factor for SLN metastasis.Conclusion: Knowing the factors affecting SLNM can provide clues for the type of intervention, reconstruction, and radiotherapy planning of patients to be operated on directly or after NAC. In our study, it was found that patient age, tumor size, tumor biology, tumor grade, and especially LVI status were very important in predicting SLN positivity. It is believed that these features should be taken into account when determining the treatment strategy.

TI  - Picturing beach erosion and deposition trends using PSInSAR: an example from the non-barred southern west coast of India
T2  - WETLANDS ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal dynamics can rapidly alter beach morphology. In some places, such as the non-barred southern west coast of India, studying changes to beach morphology is a relatively arduous task. Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR), a remote sensing technique that utilizes stacks of radar images for accurate long-term monitoring of ground features, allows for detailed observations of coastal morphodynamics. Twenty-two single look complex (SLC) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) Sentinel-1A images, acquired from 4 March 2016 to 3 June 2017, are used to monitor geomorphological processes such as coastal erosion and deposition. Ground deformation measurements from PSInSAR processing shows the coast stretching ~ 70 km between Thaickal and Munambam is highly dynamic, characterized by phases of erosion and deposition. The highest negative displacement of - 24.9 mm at Thaickal versus the + 7.6 mm at Chellanam in the north show the co-existing milieus of erosion and deposition. PSInSAR results concur with corresponding Google Earth images. In addition, beach sediment texture and scanning electron microscope grain micro-texture in the beach segment further corroborate temporal phases of erosion and deposition. Two locations are identified as typical erosional sites, while one location typified deposition. Erosion and deposition or rebuilding of beaches, usually correspond respectively with the onset and offset of SW monsoon wave climate in the Arabian Sea. When zones of deposition are mainly located in the proximity of river and/or lake inlets, stretches characterized by erosion are distal to inlets. Linear regression analyses of displacement-time series plots were used to identify general erosion or depositional regimes along beach segments. Results from this study illustrate how PSInSAR is a capable and reliable processing tool for monitoring temporal phases of coastal morpho-dynamics.

TI  - Early Classification Method for US Corn and Soybean by Incorporating MODIS-Estimated Phenological Data and Historical Classification Maps in Random-Forest Regression Algorithm
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An early crop classification method is functionally required in a near-real-time crop-yield prediction system, especially for upland crops. This study proposes methods to estimate the mixed-pixel ratio of corn, soybean, and other classes within a low-resolution MODIS pixel by coupling MODIS-derived crop phenology information and the past Cropland Data Layer in a random-forest regression algorithm. Verification of the classification accuracy was conducted for the Midwestern United States. The following conclusions are drawn: The use of the random-forest algorithm is effective in estimating the mixed-pixel ratio, which leads to stable classification accuracy; the fusion of historical data and MODIS-derived crop phenology information provides much better crop classification accuracy than when these are used individually; and the input of a longer MODIS data period can improve classification accuracy, especially after day of year 279, because of improved estimation accuracy for the soybean emergence date.

The total built-up area has risen dramatically, from 195.3 sq. km to 435.1 sq. km, during 1989-2020, which has led to habitat fragmentation, deforestation, and difficulties in running urban utility services effectively in the new extensions. This research aimed to simulate urban expansion in Delhi based on various driving factors using a logistic regression model. The recent urban expansion of Delhi was mapped using LANDSAT images of 1989, 2000, 2010, and 2020. The urban expansion was analyzed using concentric rings to show the urban expansion intensity in each direction. Nine driving factors were analyzed to detect the influence of each factor on the urban expansion process. The results revealed that the proximity to urban areas, proximity to main roads, and proximity to medical facilities were the most significant factors in Delhi during 1989-2020, where they had the highest regression coefficients: -0.884, -0.475, and -0.377, respectively. In addition, the predicted pattern of urban expansion was chaotic, scattered, and dense on the peripheries. This pattern of urban expansion might lead to further losses of natural resources. The relative operating characteristic method was utilized to assess the accuracy of the simulation, and the resulting value of 0.96 proved the validity of the simulation. The results of this research will aid local authorities in recognizing the patterns of future expansion, thus facilitating the implementation of effective policies to achieve sustainable urban development in Delhi.

TI  - Differential Interferometry over Sentinel-1 TopSAR Images as a Tool for Water and Tillage Soil Erosion Analysis
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Erosion is a major problem on agricultural lands in Europe. Erosion measurement tools have traditionally been focused on delocalized quantification but without mapping the real places inside the basin where the erosion took effect. In this article, we use new space missions, such as Sentinel-1, and the opportunity they offer to obtain SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images with high frequency, resolution, range, and, above all, availability to enable the application of techniques, like differential interferometry, in new fields. We propose to measure ground deformation caused by water and tillage erosion in small agricultural basins using TopSAR (Terrain Observation with Progressive Scans SAR, Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the Sentinel-1 mission, after previously verifying the accuracy of these measurements through comparison with measurements from a LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) system. The results of this work confirm the potential of monitoring erosion in agricultural basins with differential interferometry over Sentinel-1 TopSAR images. Its capabilities have been successfully tested in different conditions related to agricultural tasks without precipitation or storm events. This technique makes it possible to study both water and tillage erosion and sedimentation processes and even to test the efficiency of anti-erosion measures in the field or to verify the results of different management practices over time.

TI  - Ecological Safety Assessment and Analysis of Regional Spatiotemporal Differences Based on Earth Observation Satellite Data in Support of SDGs: The Case of the Huaihe River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial ecosystems provide a variety of benefits for human life and production, and are a key link for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). The basin ecosystem is one type of terrestrial ecosystem. Ecological security (ES) assessments are an important component of the overall strategy to achieve regional sustainable development. The Huaihe River Basin (HRB) has the common characteristics of most basins, such as high population density, a rapidly developing economy, and many environmental problems. This study constructed an ES evaluation system by applying a pressure-state-response framework as an assessment method for the sustainable development of basins. Taking the HRB as an example, this study determined the ES status of the region from 2001 to 2019 and analyzed crucial factors for any variation observed by combining remote sensing and climate data, relevant policies, and spatial information technology. The results highlight the importance of reserves and the negative impact of urban expansion on ES. Additionally, the enactment of policies had a positive impact on ES, whereas precipitation had a negative effect on ES in most areas of the HRB. Based on these results, the government should strengthen the protection of forests, grasslands, and wetlands and improve water conservation facilities. This study provides guidance for the subsequent economic development, environmental protection, and the achievements of SDG 15 in the HRB.

TI  - Bi-Spectral Infrared Algorithm for Cloud Coverage over Oceans by the JEM-EUSO Mission Program
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The need to monitor specific areas for different applications requires high spatial and temporal resolution. This need has led to the proliferation of ad hoc systems on board nanosatellites, drones, etc. These systems require low cost, low power consumption, and low weight. The work we present follows this trend. Specifically, this article evaluates a method to determine the cloud map from the images provided by a simple bi-spectral infrared camera within the framework of JEM-EUSO (The Joint Experiment Missions-Extrem Universe Space Observatory). This program involves different experiments whose aim is determining properties of Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) via the detection of atmospheric fluorescence light. Since some of those projects use UV instruments on board space platforms, they require knowledge of the cloudiness state in the FoV of the instrument. For that reason, some systems will include an infrared (IR) camera. This study presents a test to generate a binary cloudiness mask (CM) over the ocean, employing bi-spectral IR data. The database is created from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data (bands 31 and 32). The CM is based on a split-window algorithm. It uses an estimation of the brightness temperature calculated from a statistical study of an IR images database along with an ancillary sea surface temperature. This statistical procedure to obtain the estimate of the brightness temperature is one of the novel contributions of this work. The difference between the measured and estimation of the brightness temperature determines whether a pixel is cover or clear. That classification requires defining several thresholds which depend on the scenarios. The procedure for determining those thresholds is also novel. Then, the results of the algorithm are compared with the MODIS CM. The agreement is above 90%. The performance of the proposed CM is similar to that of other studies. The validation also shows that cloud edges concentrate the vast majority of discrepancies with the MODIS CM. The relatively high accuracy of the algorithm is a relevant result for the JEM-EUSO program. Further work will combine the proposed algorithm with complementary studies in the framework of JEM-EUSO to reinforce the CM above the cloud edges.

TI  - Prevalence of Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome: A Single-Center Retrospective Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a sleep breathing disorder that often remains undiagnosed and untreated. OSAS prevalence is increasing exponentially. Starting on the dentist's role as an epidemiological and diagnostic "sentinel ", the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of OSAS. The clinical diaries of 4659 patients were reviewed through a single-center retrospective analytic study. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Only 0.26% of patients reported to suffer from sleep apnea and were then diagnosed with OSAS. It was found that, out of 4487 patients, 678 suffered from hypertension (14.80%), 188 from gastro-esophageal-reflux-disease (GERD = 4.10%) and 484 from gastritis (10.78%). These results could be related to a difficult diagnosis of OSAS and to the absence of a dedicated section on sleep disorders in medical records. Therefore, the introduction of a question dedicated to sleep disorders, the administration of questionnaires (such as the STOP-BANG questionnaire) for early diagnosis, a multidisciplinary approach and pneumological examination could support the dentist in identifying patients at risk of OSAS.

TI  - The Signature of Geomagnetic Field External Drivers in Virtual Observatory 30-day Means Derived From Swarm Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The separation of contributions from different sources in the magnetic field signal measured at satellite altitude is an open challenge. An approach to this problem, using Principal Component Analysis, is here applied to geomagnetic external field series at Virtual Observatories (VOs). These series are computed from an enlarged data set of Swarm data covering all local times and all geomagnetic activity levels between January 2014 and December 2019. For each 30-day time window, the Equivalent Source Dipole technique is used to reduce all measurements inside a cylinder to one single "observation" at its axis and 500 km altitude. Our results reveal a first principal mode with dipolar geometry and time variation following very closely the RC-index of geomagnetic activity. They display a resolved second principal mode with annual periodicity and of approximately zonal quadrupolar radial pattern, reminiscent of results in a previous study using VO series from a filtered satellite data set and with lower time resolution. We resort to the recent comprehensive model CM6 to identify a possible source for this second mode. We propose that the dipolar mode is the expression of the magnetospheric ring current dynamics, at 30-day time resolution, and the quadrupolar mode is the expression of the annual asymmetry between local summer and winter Sq current vortices. Two fainter modes could be related to the equinoctial amplification of Sq vortices and the ionospheric dynamo modulation by nonmigrating tides. We show that a more uniform local time sampling could contribute to better resolve ionospheric structures.

TI  - ConCerv: a prospective trial of conservative surgery for low-risk early-stage cervical cancer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective The objective of the ConCerv Trial was to prospectively evaluate the feasibility of conservative surgery in women with early-stage, low-risk cervical cancer. Methods From April 2010 to March 2019, a prospective, single-arm, multicenter study evaluated conservative surgery in participants from 16 sites in nine countries. Eligibility criteria included: (1) FIGO 2009 stage IA2-IB1 cervical carcinoma; (2) squamous cell (any grade) or adenocarcinoma (grade 1 or 2 only) histology; (3) tumor size <2 cm; (4) no lymphovascular space invasion; (5) depth of invasion <10 mm; (6) negative imaging for metastatic disease; and (7) negative conization margins. Cervical conization was performed to determine eligibility, with one repeat cone permitted. Eligible women desiring fertility preservation underwent a second surgery with pelvic lymph node assessment, consisting of sentinel lymph node biopsy and/or full pelvic lymph node dissection. Those not desiring fertility preservation underwent simple hysterectomy with lymph node assessment. Women who had undergone an 'inadvertent' simple hysterectomy with an unexpected post-operative diagnosis of cancer were also eligible if they met the above inclusion criteria and underwent a second surgery with pelvic lymph node dissection only. Results 100 evaluable patients were enrolled. Median age at surgery was 38 years (range 23-67). Stage was IA2 (33%) and IB1 (67%). Surgery included conization followed by lymph node assessment in 44 women, conization followed by simple hysterectomy with lymph node assessment in 40 women, and inadvertent simple hysterectomy followed by lymph node dissection in 16 women. Positive lymph nodes were noted in 5 patients (5%). Residual disease in the post-conization hysterectomy specimen was noted in 1/40 patients-that is, an immediate failure rate of 2.5%. Median follow-up was 36.3 months (range 0.0-68.3). Three patients developed recurrent disease within 2 years of surgery-that is, a cumulative incidence of 3.5% (95% CI 0.9% to 9.0%). Discussion Our prospective data show that select patients with early-stage, low-risk cervical carcinoma may be offered conservative surgery.

T2  - JOURNAL OF EARLY MODERN HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - Outside the field of animal studies, Humphrey Primatt's Duty of Mercy has received little attention. This article offers a new perspective on his work by contextualizing Primatt's ecological worldview within Enlightenment debates about the "essence of mankind." I argue that Primatt's call to extend "rights" to all creatures was a deliberate attempt to redraw the contested borders between humans and animals by privileging morality over other characteristics of humanity. The article shows how Primatt, an Anglican vicar, incorporated contemporary ideologies and knowledge into Christian teachings in order to formulate his anthropocentric argument and transform the nature of human-animal interactions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Pasture Quality Based on NDVI Time-Series in Mediterranean Montado Ecosystem
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of dryland pasture quality is closely related to the seasonal and inter-annual variability characteristic of the Mediterranean climate. This variability introduces great unpredictability in the dynamic management of animal grazing. The aim of this study is to evaluate the potential of two complementary tools (satellite images, Sentinel-2 and proximal optical sensor, OptRx) for the calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to monitor in a timely manner indicators of pasture quality (moisture content, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber). In two consecutive years (2018/2019 and 2019/2020) these tools were evaluated in six fields representative of dryland pastures in the Alentejo region, in Portugal. The results show a significant correlation between pasture quality degradation index (PQDI) and NDVI measured by remote sensing (R-2 = 0.82) and measured by proximal optical sensor (R-2 = 0.83). These technological tools can potentially make an important contribution to decision making and to the management of livestock production. The complementarity of these two approaches makes it possible to overcome the limitations of satellite images that result (i) from the interference of clouds (which occurs frequently throughout the pasture vegetative cycle) and (ii) from the interference of tree canopy, an important layer of the Montado ecosystem. This work opens perspectives to explore new solutions in the field of Precision Agriculture technologies based on spectral reflectance to respond to the challenges of economic and environmental sustainability of extensive livestock production systems.

TI  - Rapid estimation of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from forest fire events using cloud-based computation of google earth engine
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the main sources of greenhouse gases is forest fire, with carbon dioxide as its main constituent. With increasing global surface temperatures, the probability of forest fire events also increases. A method that enables rapid quantification of emissions is even more necessary to estimate the environmental impact. This study introduces the application of the Google Earth Engine platform to monitor burned areas in forest fire events in Mount Arjuno, Indonesia, during the 2016-2019 period, using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellite imageries. The events particularly affected grassland and tropical forest areas, as well as a fraction of agricultural areas, with a total estimated emission of 2.5 x 10(3) tCO(2)/km(2) burned area. Higher carbon dioxide emissions were also observed, consistent with the higher local surface temperature as well as the CO total column mixing ratio average retrieved from Sentinel-5 p Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument during the period of analysis.

TI  - Challenges and Outlines of Steelmaking toward the Year 2030 and Beyond-Indian Perspective
T2  - METALS
M3  - Review
AB  - In FY-20, India's steel production was 109 MT, and it is the second-largest steel producer on the planet, after China. India's per capita consumption of steel was around 75 kg, which has risen from 59 kg in FY-14. Despite the increase in consumption, it is much lower than the average global consumption of 230 kg. The per capita consumption of steel is one of the strongest indicators of economic development across the nation. Thus, India has an ambitious plan of increasing steel production to around 250 MT and per capita consumption to around 160 kg by the year 2030. Steel manufacturers in India can be classified based on production routes as (a) oxygen route (BF/BOF route) and (b) electric route (electric arc furnace and induction furnace). One of the major issues for manufacturers of both routes is the availability of raw materials such as iron ore, direct reduced iron (DRI), and scrap. To achieve the level of 250 MT, steel manufacturers have to focus on improving the current process and product scenario as well as on research and development activities. The challenge to stop global warming has forced the global steel industry to strongly cut its CO2 emissions. In the case of India, this target will be extremely difficult by ruling in the production duplication planned by the year 2030. This work focuses on the recent developments of various processes and challenges associated with them. Possibilities and opportunities for improving the current processes such as top gas recycling, increasing pulverized coal injection, and hydrogenation as well as the implementation of new processes such as HIsarna and other CO2-lean iron production technologies are discussed. In addition, the eventual transition to hydrogen ironmaking and "green " electricity in smelting are considered. By fast-acting improvements in current facilities and brave investments in new carbon-lean technologies, the CO2 emissions of the Indian steel industry can peak and turn downward toward carbon-neutral production.</p>

TI  - Regional stagnation of the western Keewatin ice sheet and the significance of meltwater corridors and eskers, northern Canada
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The glacial land system of western Keewatin region, northern Canada, consists of three significant events: (1) regional emplacement of subglacial sediments, mainly till; (2) landscape erosion with development of an integrated, anabranched network of meltwater drainage routes leading to meltwater corridors; and (3) deposition of an extensive array of eskers, and related landforms, within meltwater corridors. Integration of extensive field observations, mapping, and remotely sensed data allow us to link scoured bedrock and till surfaces, truncated drumlins, scour pits, glaciofluvial terraces, boulder lags, and a large-scale network of corridors, as part of regional meltwater erosion events. The network of long (similar to 100-200 km), relatively wide (similar to 1-3 km) meltwater corridors record confined subglacial erosion that scoured sediment (and bedrock) prior to glaciofluvial sedimentation (predominately eskers). Despite considerable sediment erosion along meltwater corridors, moraines and other ice-marginal deposits are rarely observed on the western Keewatin landscape. The absence of these features is inconsistent with deglacial models relying on step-wise active retreat of the ice margin. Instead, we propose that deglaciation of the western Keewatin sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet was predominantly controlled by regional thinning and stagnation. These findings raise fundamental questions about deglacial patterns and processes and thus suggest that further evaluation and revision of existing models of deglacial chronology for this sector of the Laurentide Ice Sheet is needed.

TI  - Using BDS MEO and IGSO Satellite SNR Observations to Measure Soil Moisture Fluctuations Based on the Satellite Repeat Period
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture is an important geophysical parameter for studying terrestrial water and energy cycles. It has been proven that Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometry Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) can be applied to monitor soil moisture. Unlike the Global Positioning System (GPS) that has only medium earth orbit (MEO) satellites, the Beidou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) also has geosynchronous earth orbit (GEO) satellites and inclined geosynchronous satellite orbit (IGSO) satellites. Benefiting from the distribution of three different orbits, the BDS has better coverage in Asia than other satellite systems. Previous retrieval methods that have been confirmed on GPS cannot be directly applied to BDS MEO satellites due to different satellite orbits. The contribution of this study is a proposed multi-satellite soil moisture retrieval method for BDS MEO and IGSO satellites based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observations. The method weakened the influence of environmental differences in different directions by considering satellite repeat period. A 30-day observation experiment was conducted in Fengqiu County, China and was used for verification. The satellite data collected were divided according to the satellite repeat period, and ensured the response data moved in the same direction. The experimental results showed that the BDS IGSO and MEO soil moisture estimation results had good correlations with the in situ soil moisture fluctuations. The BDS MEO B1I estimation results had the best performance; the estimation accuracy in terms of correlation coefficient was 0.9824, root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.0056 cm(3)cm(-3), and mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.0040 cm(3)cm(-3). The estimations of the BDS MEO B1I, MEO B2I, and IGSO B2I performed better than the GPS L1 and L2 estimations. For the BDS IGSO satellites, the B1I signal was more suitable for soil moisture retrieval than the B2I signal; the correlation coefficient was increased by 19.84%, RMSE was decreased by 42.64%, and MAE was decreased by 43.93%. In addition, the BDS MEO satellites could effectively capture sudden rainfall events.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of electronic surveillance tool for catheter-associated urinary tract infections in tertiary care hospitals A meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Automated systems have been developed to reduce labor-intensive manual recordings during nosocomial infection surveillance. The diagnostic accuracies of these systems have differed in various settings. Methods: We designed this meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an electronic surveillance tool for catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) in tertiary care hospitals. We systematically searched databases such as Medline, Scopus, Cochrane library and Embase (from inception until November 2019) for relevant studies. We assessed the quality of trials using the diagnostic accuracy studies-2 tool, and performed a meta-analysis to obtain a pooled sensitivity and specificity for electronic surveillance. We included 6 studies with 16,492 patients in the analysis. Results: We found a pooled sensitivity of electronic diagnostic surveillance for CAUTIs of 97.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67.6-99.9%) and a pooled specificity of 92.6% (95% CI, 55.2-99.2%). The diagnostic odds ratio was 494 (95% CI, 89-2747). The positive likelihood ratio was 13.1 (95% CI, 1.63-105.8) and the negative likelihood ratio 0.02 (95% CI, 0.001-0.40). A bivariate box plot indicated the possibility of heterogeneity between the included studies. Conclusion: Our review suggests that electronic surveillance is useful for diagnosing CAUTIs among hospitalized patients in tertiary care hospitals due to its high sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Influence of the Saharan Air Layer on Hurricane Nadine (2012). Part I: Observations from the Hurricane and Severe Storm Sentinel (HS3) Investigation and Modeling Results
T2  - MONTHLY WEATHER REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses a model with aerosol-cloud-radiation coupling to examine the impact of Saharan dust and other aerosols on Hurricane Nadine (2012). To study aerosol direct (radiation) and indirect (cloud microphysics) effects from individual, as well as all aerosol species, eight different NU-WRF Model simulations were conducted. In several simulations, aerosols led to storm strengthening, followed by weakening relative to the control simulation. This variability of the aerosol impact may be related to whether aerosols are ingested into clouds within the outer rainbands or the eyewall. Upper-tropospheric aerosol concentrations indicate vertical transport of all aerosol types in the outer bands but only vertical transport of sea salt in the inner core. The results suggest that aerosols, particularly sea salt, may have contributed to a stronger initial intensification but that aerosol ingestion into the outer bands at later times may have weakened the storm in the longer term. In most aerosol experiments, aerosols led to a reduction in cloud and precipitation hydrometeors, the exception being the dust-only case that produced periods of enhanced hydrometeor growth. The Saharan air layer (SAL) also impacted Nadine by causing a region of strong easterlies impinging on the eastern side of the storm. At the leading edge of these easterlies, cool and dry air near the top of the SAL was being ingested into the outer-band convection. This midlevel low-equivalent-potential-temperature air gradually lowered toward the surface and eventually contributed to significant cold-pool activity in the eastern rainband and in the northeast quadrant of the storm. Such enhanced downdraft activity could have led to weakening of the storm, but it is not presently possible to quantify this impact.

T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - To enhance the capacity of Shanghai's drainage network to guard against flooding, this study used data obtained from an urban drainage network and spatial geological information to conduct precise analysis on an area of approximately 31 km(2) with various land uses in downtown Shanghai and to establish a two-dimensional model. Based on the two-dimensional model, an integrated urban flooding early warning and rainfall runoff management platform was developed through combining meteorological data and real-time remote sensing data of the drainage network operation. Through precise simulation of the rainstorm runoff process, projection of the scope and magnitude of urban surface runoff hazard impact, issuance of flooding forecasts, and provision of hazard early warning and decision-making support, the developed platform is capable of providing risk assessment of the drainage system and early warning of flooding risk.</p>

TI  - Assessing the Responses of Aviation-Related SO<sub>2</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> Emissions to COVID-19 Lockdown Regulations in South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aircraft emit harmful substances, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapour (H2O), nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur oxides (SOx), particulates, and other trace compounds. These emissions degrade air quality and can deteriorate human health and negatively impact climate change. Airports are the nucleus of the ground and low-altitude emissions from aircraft during approach, landing, take-off, and taxi. During the global lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, tight restrictions of the movement were imposed, leading to temporary closures of airports globally. In this study, we look at the variability of emissions at two major airports in South Africa, namely the OR Tambo international airport (FAOR) and the Cape Town international airport (FACT). Trend analysis of aircraft movements, i.e., departures and arrivals, showed a sharp decline at the two airports coinciding with the lockdowns to prevent the spread of the COVID-19. Consequently, a decrease in NO2 emissions by 70.45% (12.6 x 10(-5) mol/m(2)) and 64.58% (11.6 x 10(-5) mol/m(2)) at FAOR and FACT were observed, respectively. A noticeable SO2 emission decline was also observed, particularly over FAOR during the lockdown period in South Africa. Overall, this study observed that the global lockdown regulations had a positive impact on the air quality, causing a brief decline in emissions from commercial aviation at the South African major airports.

TI  - Impacts of Rainfall and Temperature Changes on Smallholder Agriculture in the Limpopo Province, South Africa
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity and frequency in the recurrence of extreme climate events are compounding the vulnerability of smallholder farmers, who have always lacked the resources to adapt. The increasing temperatures and decreasing rainfall are exacerbating water scarcity challenges through drought recurrence. There is an urgent need for pathways that lead towards Sustainable Development Goals, mainly Goals 1 (no poverty) and 2 (zero hunger) in poor rural communities. This study assessed rainfall and temperature trends from 1960 to 2018 and their impacts on crop production in the Mopani and Vhembe Districts of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Trend analysis was used to analyse rainfall patterns, as well as the trends in temperature recorded for the past 58 years. The climate moisture index (CMI) and runoff estimates were used to assess the degree of aridity and water availability, respectively. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remotely sensed data were used to assess the changes over time. The total annual rainfall has declined significantly while annual minimum and maximum temperatures have increased significantly during the period under observation. An aridity index of -0.70 calculated for the study areas classifies the districts as dry and water scarce. The results of the analysis also indicate that the districts are climate change hot spots, and are highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. The changes are compounding water and food insecurity. Policy and decision-makers should focus on enhancing adaptation and resilience initiatives in the study areas through systematic, transformative, and integrated approaches, such as scenario planning, circular economy, and nexus planning.

TI  - Rainfall Intensity Estimation Using Geostationary Satellite Data Based on Machine Learning: A Case Study in the Korean Peninsula in Summer
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation is one of the main factors that affect water and energy cycles, and its estimation plays a very important role in securing water resources and timely responding to water disasters. Satellite-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) has the advantage of covering large areas at high spatiotemporal resolution. In this study, machine learning-based rainfall intensity models were developed using Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) water vapor channel (6.7 mu m), infrared channel (10.8 mu m), and weather radar Column Max (CMAX) composite data based on random forest (RF). The target variables were weather radar reflectivity (dBZ) and rainfall intensity (mm/hr) converted by the Z-R relationship. The results showed that the model which learned CMAX reflectivity produced the Critical Success Index (CSI) of 0.34 and the Mean-Absolute-Error (MAE) of 4.82 mm/hr. When compared to the GeoKompsat-2 and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)-Cloud Classification System (CCS) rainfall intensity products, the accuracies improved by 21.73% and 10.81% for CSI, and 31.33% and 23.49% for MAE, respectively. The spatial distribution of the estimated rainfall intensity was much more similar to the radar data than the existing products.

TI  - Enhancing Interprofessional Collaboration in Perioperative Setting from the Qualitative Perspectives of Physicians and Nurses
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Communication failures were a leading cause of sentinel events in the operation room due to frequently the communication breakdown occurs between physicians and nurses. This study explored the perspectives of surgical teams (nurses, physicians, and anaesthesiologists) on interprofessional collaboration and improvement strategies. A surgical team comprising eight perioperative nurses, four surgeons, and four anaesthesiologists from a university-affiliated hospital participated in this qualitative and phenomenological research from December 2018 to April 2019. Data were collected in in-depth interviews and were used in a thematic analysis according to Colaizzi to extract themes and categorised codes with the ATLAS.ti software. The result is presented in three generic categories: Barrier-like disruptive behaviours and lack of coordination of care; consequences by safety threats to the patient; overcoming barriers by shared decision making among professionals, flattened hierarchies, and teamwork/communication training. The conclusion is that different teams' perspectives can facilitate genuine reflection, discussion, and implementation of targeted interventions to improve operating room interprofessional collaboration and overcome barriers and their consequences. Currently, there is a need to change towards interprofessional collaboration for optimal patient outcomes and to ensure all professionals' expectations are met.

TI  - Energy in the Anthropocene: How the concept of energy shaped both our current crisis and its professed solution
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF THE BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay traces how the concept of energy-defined as the ability to do work in physics-informed two similar fields of knowledge with very dissimilar results. One, the resource economy in the late 19th century, laid some important epistemic and ideological foundations for the destruction of the environment in the present. The other, ecology, introduced a new holistic view of nature, which laid the groundwork for the recent reconceptualization of ethics, epistemology, and humankind's role on Earth culminating in the Anthropocene hypothesis-formulated in direct opposition to the capitalist, anthropocentric notions inherited from the 19th century. In both cases, it was the concept of energy that enabled thinking about the multifarious visualities, materialities, and temporalities of natural phenomena as united in a single causal substructure of energy exchanges. In resource economics, the energetic worldview imposed an anthropocentric useful/useless divide on the environment-modeled, I argue, on the energy/entropy distinction-and made it "logical" to think of minerals, plants, and human labor as analogous resources, justifiably equated and linked in the economic system. The same ability to equate and connect was fundamental to the discipline of ecology and its application to sociology in the 20th century, and, in more recent years, to philosophy and historiography. In stripping nature of all surface illusions, energy proved enormously efficient for exposing the entanglement of large-scale systems composed of animate and inanimate actors equally imbued with agency.

TI  - Machine Learning to Estimate Surface Roughness from Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We apply the Support Vector Regression (SVR) machine learning model to estimate surface roughness on a large alluvial fan of the Kosi River in the Himalayan Foreland from satellite images. To train the model, we used input features such as radar backscatter values in Vertical-Vertical (VV) and Vertical-Horizontal (VH) polarisation, incidence angle from Sentinel-1, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Sentinel-2, and surface elevation from Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM). We generated additional features (VH/VV and VH-VV) through a linear data fusion of the existing features. For the training and validation of our model, we conducted a field campaign during 11-20 December 2019. We measured surface roughness at 78 different locations over the entire fan surface using an in-house-developed mechanical pin-profiler. We used the regression tree ensemble approach to assess the relative importance of individual input feature to predict the surface soil roughness from SVR model. We eliminated the irrelevant input features using an iterative backward elimination approach. We then performed feature sensitivity to evaluate the riskiness of the selected features. Finally, we applied the dimension reduction and scaling to minimise the data redundancy and bring them to a similar level. Based on these, we proposed five SVR methods (PCA-NS-SVR, PCA-CM-SVR, PCA-ZM-SVR, PCA-MM-SVR, and PCA-S-SVR). We trained and evaluated the performance of all variants of SVR with a 60:40 ratio using the input features and the in-situ surface roughness. We compared the performance of SVR models with six different benchmark machine learning models (i.e., Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Binary Decision Tree (BDT), Bragging Ensemble Learning, Boosting Ensemble Learning, and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)). We observed that the PCA-MM-SVR perform better with a coefficient of correlation (R = 0.74), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.16 cm), and Mean Square Error (MSE = 0.025 cm2). To ensure a fair selection of the machine learning model, we evaluated the Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), corrected AIC (AICc), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). We observed that SVR exhibits the lowest values of AIC, corrected AIC, and BIC of all the other methods; this indicates the best goodness-of-fit. Eventually, we also compared the result of PCA-MM-SVR with the surface roughness estimated from different empirical and semi-empirical radar backscatter models. The accuracy of the PCA-MM-SVR model is better than the backscatter models. This study provides a robust approach to measure surface roughness at high spatial and temporal resolutions solely from the satellite data.</p>

TI  - Removal of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid from water by modified zeolite adsorbents
T2  - SCIENCEASIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The removal of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) by zeolites (ZY, ZY-10, and ZY-200 with Si/Al ratios of 6.07, 14.68, and 207.25, respectively) and modified zeolites with hexadecyltrimethyl ammonuium (HDTMA) were investigated. The influence of HDTMA concentration, modification methodology, and 2,4-D initial concentration were evaluated for 24 h at room temperature (30 degrees C). The results showed that the best adsorption capacity was obtained from 15 mM HDTMA using a dropwise method and 10 mg/12,4-D solution. The best adsorption capacities of the unmodified and modified zeolites were 20.80 +/- 0.23, 27.90 +/- 0.45, 18.02 +/- 0.27, 10.32 +/- 0.40, 71.01 +/- 0.51, and 99.61 +/- 0.36% for ZY, ZY-10, ZY-200, 15MZY, 15MZY-10, and 15MZY-200, respectively. Compared with the unmodified zeolites, the adsorption efficiency of 2,4-D of the modified zeolites was higher except for the MZY, which was due to the steric hindrance caused by blocking of zeolite pores by large HDTMA molecules. The adsorption isotherms of ZY, ZY-10, 15MZY, and 15MZY-10 corresponded to the Freundlich model with the R-2 values in the range of 0.79220.9752. The ZY-200 and 15MZY-200 corresponded to the Langmuir model and showed the R-2 values of 0.9091 and 0.9589, respectively. The XRD characterization results showed that all unmodified and modified zeolites were similar in crystallinity and the structural framework of zeolite Y. The BET surface area, micropore surface area, and micropore volume of unmodified and modified zeolites were on a downward trend, while external surface area, pore volume, and pore diameter increased.

TI  - Remote Sensing Applications in Sugarcane Cultivation: A Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - A large number of studies have been published addressing sugarcane management and monitoring to increase productivity and production as well as to better understand landscape dynamics and environmental threats. Building on existing reviews which mainly focused on the crop's spectral behavior, a comprehensive review is provided which considers the progress made using novel data analysis techniques and improved data sources. To complement the available reviews, and to make the large body of research more easily accessible for both researchers and practitioners, in this review (i) we summarized remote sensing applications from 1981 to 2020, (ii) discussed key strengths and weaknesses of remote sensing approaches in the sugarcane context, and (iii) described the challenges and opportunities for future earth observation (EO)-based sugarcane monitoring and management. More than one hundred scientific studies were assessed regarding sugarcane mapping (52 papers), crop growth anomaly detection (11 papers), health monitoring (14 papers), and yield estimation (30 papers). The articles demonstrate that decametric satellite sensors such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 enable a reliable, cost-efficient, and timely mapping and monitoring of sugarcane by overcoming the ground sampling distance (GSD)-related limitations of coarser hectometric resolution data, while offering rich spectral information in the frequently recorded data. The Sentinel-2 constellation in particular provides fine spatial resolution at 10 m and high revisit frequency to support sugarcane management and other applications over large areas. For very small areas, and in particular for up-scaling and calibration purposes, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are also useful. Multi-temporal and multi-source data, together with powerful machine learning approaches such as the random forest (RF) algorithm, are key to providing efficient monitoring and mapping of sugarcane growth, health, and yield. A number of difficulties for sugarcane monitoring and mapping were identified that are also well known for other crops. Those difficulties relate mainly to the often (i) time consuming pre-processing of optical time series to cope with atmospheric perturbations and cloud coverage, (ii) the still important lack of analysis-ready-data (ARD), (iii) the diversity of environmental and growth conditions-even for a given country-under which sugarcane is grown, superimposing non-crop related radiometric information on the observed sugarcane crop, and (iv) the general ill-posedness of retrieval and classification approaches which adds ambiguity to the derived information.</p>

TI  - Sentinel node mapping using indocyanine green and near-infrared fluorescence imaging technology for endometrial cancer: A prospective study using a surgical algorithm in Indian patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF MINIMAL ACCESS SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence with high-definition, three-dimensional imaging systems is emerging as the latest strategy to reduce trauma and improve surgical outcomes during oncosurgery. Materials and Methods: This is a prospective study involving 100 patients with carcinoma endometrium who underwent robotic-assisted Type 1 pan-hysterectomy, with ICG-directed sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy from November 2017 to December 2019. The aim was to assess the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of SLN algorithm and to evaluate the location and distribution of SLN in pelvic, para-aortic and unusual areas and the role of frozen section. Results: The overall SLN detection rate was 98%. Bilateral detection was possible in 92% of the cases. Right side was detected in 98% of the cases and left side was visualised in 92% of the cases. Complete node dissection was done where SLN mapping failed. The most common location for SLN in our series was obturator on the right hemipelvis and internal iliac on the left hemipelvis. SLN in the para-aortic area was detected in 14% of cases. In six cases, SLN was found in atypical locations, that is pre-sacral area. Eight patients had SLN positivity for metastasis and underwent complete retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy. Comparison of final histopathological report with frozen section reports showed no false negatives. Conclusions: SLN mapping holds a great promise as a modern staging strategy for endometrial cancer. In our experience, cervical injection was an optimal method of mapping the pelvis. ICG showed a high overall detection rate, and bilateral mapping appears to be a feasible alternative to the more traditional methods of SLN mapping in patients with endometrial cancer. The ICG fluorescence imaging system is simple and safe and may become a standard in oncosurgery in view of its staging and anatomical imaging capabilities. This approach can reduce the morbidity, operative times and costs associated with complete lymphadenectomy while maintaining prognostic and predictive information.

TI  - Detection of Crop Hail Damage with a Machine Learning Algorithm Using Time Series of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Hailstorms usually result in total crop loss. After a hailstorm, the affected field is inspected by an insurance claims adjuster to assess yield loss. Assessment accuracy depends largely on in situ detection of homogeneous damage sectors within the field, using visual techniques. This paper presents an algorithm for the automatic detection of homogeneous hail damage through the application of unsupervised machine learning techniques to vegetation indices calculated from remote sensing data. Five microwave and five spectral indices were evaluated before and after a hailstorm in zones with different degrees of damage. Dual Polarization SAR Vegetation Index and Normalized Pigment Chlorophyll Ratio Index were the most sensitive to hail-induced changes. The time series and rates of change of these indices were used as input variables in the K-means method for clustering pixels into homogeneous damage zones. Validation of the algorithm with data from 91 soybean, wheat, and corn plots showed that in 87.01% of cases there was significant evidence of differences in average damage between zones determined by the algorithm within the plot. Thus, the algorithm presented in this paper allowed efficient detection of homogeneous hail damage zones, which is expected to improve accuracy and transparency in the characterization of hailstorm events.

TI  - Evaluation of Land Use and Land Cover Change and Its Drivers in Battambang Province, Cambodia from 1998 to 2018
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this research was to evaluate land use and land cover (LULC) change in Battambang province of Cambodia over the last two decades. The LULC maps for 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018 were produced from Landsat satellite imagery using the supervised classification technique with the maximum likelihood algorithm. Each map consisted of seven LULC classes: built-up area, water feature, grassland, shrubland, agricultural land, barren land and forest cover. The overall accuracies of the LULC maps were 93%, 82%, 94%, 93% and 83% for 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013 and 2018, respectively. The LULC change results showed a significant increase in agricultural land, and a large decrease in forest cover. Most of the changes in both LULC types occurred during 2003-2008. Overall, agricultural land, shrubland, water features, built-up areas and barren land increased by 287,600 hectares, 58,600 hectares, 8300 hectares, 4600 hectares and 1300 hectares, respectively, while forest cover and grassland decreased by 284,500 hectares and 76,000 hectares respectively. The rate of LULC changes in the upland areas were higher than those in the lowland areas of the province. The main drivers of LULC change identified over the period of study were policy, legal framework and projects to improve economy, population growth, infrastructure development, economic growth, rising land prices, and climate and environmental change. Landmine clearance projects and land concessions resulted in a transition from forest cover and shrubland to agricultural land. Population and economic growth not only resulted in an increase of built-up area, but also led to increasing demand for agricultural land and rising land prices, which triggered the changes of other LULC types. This research provides a long-term and detailed analysis of LULC change together with its drivers, which is useful for decision-makers to make and implement better policies for sustainable land management.

TI  - Identification of Potential Surface Water Resources for Inland Aquaculture from Sentinel-2 Images of the Rwenzori Region of Uganda
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture has the potential to sustainably meet the growing demand for animal protein. The availability of water is essential for aquaculture development, but there is no knowledge about the potential inland water resources of the Rwenzori region of Uganda. Though remote sensing is popularly utilized during studies involving various aspects of surface water, it has never been employed in mapping inland water bodies of Uganda. In this study, we assessed the efficiency of seven remote-sensing derived water index methods to map the available surface water resources in the Rwenzori region using moderate resolution Sentinel 2A/B imagery. From the four targeted sites, the Automated Water Extraction Index for urban areas (AWEInsh) and shadow removal (AWEIsh) were the best at identifying inland water bodies in the region. Both AWEIsh and AWEInsh consistently had the highest overall accuracy (OA) and kappa (OA > 90%, kappa > 0.8 in sites 1 and 2; OA > 84.9%, kappa > 0.61 in sites 3 and 4), as well as the lowest omission errors in all sites. AWEI was able to suppress classification noise from shadows and other non-water dark surfaces. However, none of the seven water indices used during this study was able to efficiently extract narrow water bodies such as streams. This was due to a combination of factors like the presence of terrain shadows, a dense vegetation cover, and the image resolution. Nonetheless, AWEI can efficiently identify other surface water resources such as crater lakes and rivers/streams that are potentially suitable for aquaculture from moderate resolution Sentinel 2A/B imagery.

TI  - Fluorescence Guided Surgery
T2  - METHODS AND APPLICATIONS IN FLUORESCENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Fluorescence guided surgery (FGS) is an imaging technique that allows the surgeon to visualise different structures and types of tissue during a surgical procedure that may not be as visible under white light conditions. Due to the many potential advantages of fluorescence guided surgery compared to more traditional clinical imaging techniques such as its higher contrast and sensitivity, less subjective use, and ease of instrument operation, the research interest in fluorescence guided surgery continues to grow over various key aspects such as fluorescent probe development and surgical system development as well as its potential clinical applications. This review looks to summarise some of the emerging opportunities and developments that have already been made in fluorescence guided surgery in recent years while highlighting its advantages as well as limitations that need to be overcome in order to utilise the full potential of fluorescence within the surgical environment.

TI  - Evaluating the Territorial Impact of Built-Up Area Expansion in the Surroundings of Bucharest (Romania) through a Multilevel Approach Based on Landsat Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the relentless expansion of built-up areas is one of the most important tasks for achieving sustainable planning and supporting decision-making on the regional and local level. In this context, techniques based on remote sensing can play a crucial role in monitoring the fast rhythm of urban growth, allowing the regular appraisal of territorial dynamics. The main aim of the study is to evaluate, in a multi-scalar perspective, the built-up area expansion and the spatio-temporal changes in Ilfov County, which overlaps the surroundings of Bucharest, capital of Romania. Our research focuses on processing multi-date Landsat satellite imagery from three selected time references (2000, 2008, 2018) through the supervised classification process. Further on, the types of built-up area dynamics are explored using LDTtool, a landscape metrics instrument. The results reveal massive territorial restructuring in the 18 years, as the new built-up developments occupy a larger area than the settlements' surface in 2000. The rhythm of the transformations also changed over time, denoting a significant acceleration after 2008, when 75% of the new development occurred. At the regional level, the spatial pattern has become more and more complex, in a patchwork of spatial arrangements characterized by the proliferation of low density areas interspersed with clusters of high density developments and undeveloped land. At the local level, a comparative assessment of the administrative territorial units' pathway was conducted based on the annual growth of built-up areas, highlighting the most attractive places and the main territorial directions of development. In terms of the specific dynamics of built-up areas, the main change patterns are "F-NP increment by gain ", followed by "G-Aggregation by gain ", both comprising around 80% of the total number of cells. The first type was prevalent in the first period (2000-2008), while the second is identified only after 2008, when it became the most represented, followed in the hierarchy by the previously dominant category. The spatial pattern differentiations were further explored in three complementary case studies investigated in correlation with socioeconomic data, revealing a heterogeneous landscape.

TI  - Reconstructing Ocean Heat Content for Revisiting Global Ocean Warming from Remote Sensing Perspectives
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global ocean heat content (OHC) is generally estimated using gridded, model and reanalysis data; its change is crucial to understanding climate anomalies and ocean warming phenomena. However, Argo gridded data have short temporal coverage (from 2005 to the present), inhibiting understanding of long-term OHC variabilities at decadal to multidecadal scales. In this study, we utilized multisource remote sensing and Argo gridded data based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network method, which considers long temporal dependence to reconstruct a new long time-series OHC dataset (1993-2020) and fill the pre-Argo data gaps. Moreover, we adopted a new machine learning method, i.e., the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and applied the well-known Random Forests (RFs) method for comparison. The model performance was measured using determination coefficients (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE). The results showed that LSTM can effectively improve the OHC prediction accuracy compared with the LightGBM and RFs methods, especially in long-term and deep-sea predictions. The LSTM-estimated result also outperformed the Ocean Projection and Extension neural Network (OPEN) dataset, with an R-2 of 0.9590 and an RMSE of 4.45 x 10(19) in general in the upper 2000 m for 28 years (1993-2020). The new reconstructed dataset (named OPEN-LSTM) correlated reasonably well with other validated products, showing consistency with similar time-series trends and spatial patterns. The spatiotemporal error distribution between the OPEN-LSTM and IAP datasets was smaller on the global scale, especially in the Atlantic, Southern and Pacific Oceans. The relative error for OPEN-LSTM was the smallest for all ocean basins compared with Argo gridded data. The average global warming trends are 3.26 x 10(8) J/m(2)/decade for the pre-Argo (1993-2004) period and 2.67 x 10(8) J/m(2)/decade for the time-series (1993-2020) period. This study demonstrates the advantages of LSTM in the time-series reconstruction of OHC, and provides a new dataset for a deeper understanding of ocean and climate events.

TI  - Landslide mapping and analysis along the China-Pakistan Karakoram Highway based on SBAS-InSAR detection in 2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karakoram Highway (KKH), a part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), is a major highway connecting northern Pakistan to China. The inventorying and analysis of landslides along KKH are challenging because of poor accessibility, vast study area, limited availability of ground-based datasets, and the complexity of landslide processes in the region. In order to preserve life, property, and infrastructure, and to enable the uninterrupted and efficient operation of the KKH, it is essential to strengthen measures for the prevention and control of geological disasters. In the present study, SBAS-InSAR (Small Baseline Subsets-Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) was used to process 150 scenes of Sentinel 1-A images in the year 2017 along the Karakoram Highway. A total of 762 landslides, including 57 complex landslides, 126 rock falls, 167 debris slides, and 412 unstable slopes, ranging in size between 0.0017 and 10.63 km(2) were identified. Moreover, this study also gains an inventory of 40 active glacier movements in this region. Landslide categorization, displacements characteristics, spatial distribution, and their relationship with various contributing factors have been successfully investigated along the entire KKH using image interpretation and frequency-area statistics. The criteria adopted for landslides categorization is presented in the study. The results showed that the 2-D ground deformation derived in Hunza valley echoes well with the general regional landslides characteristics. The spatial distribution analysis revealed that there are clumped distributions of landslides in the Gaizi, Tashkurgan, and Khunjerab in China, as well as in Hunza valley, and north of Chilas city in Pakistan. Statistical results indicated that these landslides mainly occur on south-facing slopes with a slope angle of 20 degrees-45 degrees and elevation relief of 550-2,100 m. Landslide development is also related to low vegetation cover and weathering effects in mountain gullies. Overall, our study provides scientific data support and theoretical references for prevention, control, and mitigation of geological disasters in the Karakoram region.

TI  - Deep Autoencoders With Multitask Learning for Bilinear Hyperspectral Unmixing
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral unmixing is an important problem for remotely sensed data interpretation. It amounts at estimating the spectral signatures of the pure spectral constituents in the scene (endmembers) and their corresponding subpixel fractional abundances. Although the unmixing problem is inherently nonlinear (due to multiple scattering), the nonlinear unmixing of hyperspectral data has been a very challenging problem. This is because nonlinear models require detailed knowledge about the physical interactions between the sunlight scattered by multiple materials. In turn, bilinear mixture models (BMMs) can reach good accuracy with a relatively simple model for scattering. In this article, we develop a new BMM and a corresponding unsupervised unmixing approach which consists of two main steps. In the first step, a deep autoencoder is used to linearly estimate the endmember signatures and their associated abundance fractions. The second step refines the initial (linear) estimates using a bilinear model, in which another deep autoencoder (with a low-rank assumption) is adapted to model second-order scattering interactions. It should be noted that in our developed BMM model, the two deep autoencoders are trained in a mutually interdependent manner under the multitask learning framework, and the relative reconstruction error is used as the stopping criterion. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated using both synthetic and real hyperspectral data sets. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed approach can reasonably estimate the nature of nonlinear interactions in real scenarios. Compared with other state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms, the proposed approach demonstrates very competitive performance.

TI  - Analysis of the Efficiency and Prognostic Value of the Sentinel Node Technique in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma after Seven Years
T2  - MEDICINA-LITHUANIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: The purpose of this study was to analyse the diagnostic and prognostic efficiency of the sentinel lymph node biopsy technique (SLNB). Materials and Methods: This is a prospective observational study performed by the Hospital Complex in Santiago de Compostela (CHUS) in Spain, between February 2013 and June 2020. The study included 60 patients, who had been diagnosed with OSCC in stage T1/T2N0M0. Results: 10 patients (16.7%) presented with SN+ (sentinel node positive). The majority (80%) only presented subcapsular affection, however one case also presented with extracapsular affection. Using the Kaplan-Meier curves, we determined that the average survival estimation for SN- patients was 74.0 months (CI95% 67.6-80.5) and it was 45.4 months (CI95% 10.9-24.0) for SN+ patients (p = 0.002). SN+ patients presented an OR = 11.000 (CI95% 2.393-50.589, p = 0.002) for cancer-related mortality. In terms of the diagnostic performance of the SN (sentinel node) test, a 55% sensitivity, a 100% specificity, 100% PPV and a 84% NPV were obtained. The analysis using ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curves revealed an AUC = 0.671 (CI95% 0.492-0.850, p = 0.046). Conclusions: SLNB seems to be an adequate technique for the detection of hidden metastases.

TI  - Evaluating the use of hyperspectral imagery to calculate raster-based wetland vegetation condition indicator
T2  - AQUATIC ECOSYSTEM HEALTH & MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Field observations and measurements of wetland plants have traditionally been used to monitor and evaluate wetland condition; however, there has been increasing use of remote sensing applications for rapid evaluations of wetland productivity and change. Combining key aspects of field- and remote sensing-based wetland evaluation methods can provide more efficient or improved biological indices. This exploratory study set out to develop a raster-based Wetland Vegetation Condition Indicator system that used airborne hyperspectral imagery-derived data to estimate plant-community quality (via wetland classification and Coefficient of Conservatism) and vegetation biomass (estimated using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The Wetland Vegetation Condition Indicator system was developed for three Lake Ontario wetland areas and compared to a field-based floristic quality index and a dominant-plant based Floristic quality index(dom). The indicator system serves as a proof-of-concept that capitalized on the spatial and spectral attributes of high-resolution imagery to quantify and characterize the quality and quantity of wetland vegetation. A Pearson correlation analysis showed moderate r values of 0.59 and 0.62 for floristic quality index and floristic quality index(dom), respectively, compared to the indicator method. The differences are potentially due to the spatial resolution of the imagery and the indicator method only accounting for the dominant plants within each assessment unit (pixel), therefore disregarding understory plants or those with low abundance. However, the multi-metric Wetland Vegetation Condition Indicator approach shows promise as an indicator of wetland condition by using remotely sensed data, which could be useful for more efficient landscape-scale assessments of wetland health, resilience, and recovery.

TI  - Rice Mapping Using a BiLSTM-Attention Model from Multitemporal Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate rice distribution information is needed to ensure the sustainable development of food production and food security. With its unique advantages, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can monitor the rice distribution in tropical and subtropical areas under any type of weather condition. This study proposes an accurate rice extraction and mapping framework that can solve the issues of low sample production efficiency and fragmented rice plots when prior information on rice distribution is insufficient. The experiment was carried out using multitemporal Sentinel-1A Data in Zhanjiang, China. First, the temporal characteristic map was used for the visualization of rice distribution to improve the efficiency of rice sample production. Second, rice classification was carried out based on the BiLSTM-Attention model, which focuses on learning the key information of rice and non-rice in the backscattering coefficient curve and gives different types of attention to rice and non-rice features. Finally, the rice classification results were optimized based on the high-precision global land cover classification map. The experimental results showed that the classification accuracy of the proposed framework on the test dataset was 0.9351, the kappa coefficient was 0.8703, and the extracted plots maintained good integrity. Compared with the statistical data, the consistency reached 94.6%. Therefore, the framework proposed in this study can be used to extract rice distribution information accurately and efficiently.

AB  - Vinoth et al. proposed an authenticated key agreement scheme for industrial IoT (Internet of Things) applications. Vinoth et al.'s scheme aimed to protect the remote sensing data of industrial IoT devices under hostile environments. The scheme is interesting because the authorized user is allowed simultaneously to access the multiple IoT sensing devices. Therefore, we carefully analyzed the security and privacy implications of Vinoth et al.'s scheme. Our findings are summarized as follows. One, Vinoth et al.'s scheme failed to defeat user impersonation attacks. Second, Vinoth et al.'s scheme did not prevent IoT sensing device impersonation attacks. Third, Vinoth et al.'s scheme suffered from replay attacks. Fourth, Vinoth et al.'s scheme was vulnerable to desynchronization attacks. Fifth, Vinoth et al.'s scheme could not maintain user privacy. As a case study, our analysis results enlighten researchers and engineers on the design of robust and efficient authenticated key agreement schemes for IoT applications.</p>

TI  - Regionalized Linear Models for River Depth Retrieval Using 3-Band Multispectral Imagery and Green LIDAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Bathymetry is of vital importance in river studies but obtaining full-scale riverbed maps often requires considerable resources. Remote sensing imagery can be used for efficient depth mapping in both space and time. Multispectral image depth retrieval requires imagery with a certain level of quality and local in-situ depth observations for the calculation and verification of models. To assess the potential of providing extensive depth maps in rivers lacking local bathymetry, we tested the application of three platform-specific, regionalized linear models for depth retrieval across four Norwegian rivers. We used imagery from satellite platforms Worldview-2 and Sentinel-2, along with local aerial images to calculate the intercept and slope vectors. Bathymetric input was provided using green Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) data augmented by sonar measurements. By averaging platform-specific intercept and slope values, we calculated regionalized linear models and tested model performance in each of the four rivers. While the performance of the basic regional models was comparable to local river-specific models, regional models were improved by including the estimated average depth and a brightness variable. Our results show that regionalized linear models for depth retrieval can potentially be applied for extensive spatial and temporal mapping of bathymetry in water bodies where local in-situ depth measurements are lacking.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Ocean Colour-Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) Forel-Ule Index Using GOCI Satellite Image and Machine Learning Technique
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forel-Ule Index (FUI) is an index which classifies the colors of inland and seawater exist in nature into 21 grades ranging from indigo blue to cola brown. FUI has been analyzed in connection with the eutrophication, water quality, and light characteristics of water systems in many studies, and the possibility as a new water quality index which simultaneously contains optical information of water quality parameters has been suggested. In this study, Ocean Colour-Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) based 4 km FUI was spatially downscaled to the resolution of 500 m using the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) data and Random Forest (RF) machine learning. Then, the RF-derived FUI was examined in terms of its correlation with various water quality parameters measured in coastal areas and its spatial distribution and seasonal characteristics. The results showed that the RF-derived FUI resulted in higher accuracy (Coefficient of Determination (R-2) =0.81, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) =0.7784) than GOCI-derived FUI estimated by Pitarch's OC-CCI FUI algorithm (R-2=0.72, RMSE=0.9708). RF-derived FUI showed a high correlation with five water quality parameters including Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus, Chlorophyll-a, Total Suspended Solids, Transparency with the correlation coefficients of 0.87, 0.88, 0.97, 0.65, and-0.98, respectively. The temporal pattern of the RF-derived FUI well reflected the physical relationship with various water quality parameters with a strong seasonality. The research findings suggested the potential of the high resolution FUI in coastal water quality management in the Korean Peninsula.

TI  - Using the Edmonton Obesity Staging System in the real world: a feasibility study based on cross-sectional data.
T2  - CMAJ open

M3  - Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Edmonton Obesity Staging System (EOSS) combined with body mass index (BMI) enables improved functional and prognostic assessment for patients. To facilitate application of the EOSS in practice, we aimed to create tools for capturing comorbidity assessments in electronic medical records and for automating the calculation of a patient's EOSS stage.METHODS: In this feasibility study, we used cross-sectional data to create a clinical dashboard to calculate and display the relation between BMI and EOSS and the prevalence of related comorbidities. We obtained data from the Northern Alberta Primary Care Research Network and the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN). We included patients at least 18 years of age with BMI between 30 and 60 who visited a network clinic between July 2016 and July 2019. We calculated descriptive statistics and used stepwise ordinary least squares regression to assess the contributions of age, sex and BMI to EOSS variation.RESULTS: We created a clinical dashboard using the CPCSSN data presentation tool. Of the total 31 496 patients included in the study, 23 460 had a BMI of at least 30; BMI was unavailable for 8036 patients. Within each EOSS disease severity stage, there were similar proportions of patients from each BMI class (e.g., patients with EOSS stage 2 included 51.8% of those with BMI class I, 55.3% of those with BMI class II and 58.8% of those with BMI class III).INTERPRETATION: Using data from primary care electronic medical records, it was feasible to create a clinical dashboard for obesity that highlighted the severity and stage of obesity. Making this information easily accessible for individual clinical care and practice-level quality improvement may advance obesity care.

TI  - Spatio-temporal changes in the Machoi glacier Zanskar Himalaya India using geospatial technology
T2  - QUATERNARY SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the temporal changes of Machoi glacier, Zanskar region of the north-western Himalaya, India using multi-temporal Landsat satellite data from 1973 to 2018. The results suggest that the Machoi glacier has retreated consistently from last 45 years with an uneven retreat rate. The temporal fluctuations since 1973 AD reveal that the glacier snout has retreated similar to 563 m at an average of similar to 12.51 m yr(-1). However, the snout has retreated at variable rates during different time intervals e.g., 80 m (average of similar to 11.43 m yr(-1)) from 1973 to 1980 AD, 120 m (average of similar to 12.0 m yr(-1)) from 1980 to 1990 AD, 123 m (average of similar to 12.3 m yr(-1)) from 1990 to 2000 AD, 128 m (average of similar to 12.8 m yr(-1)) from 2000 to 2010 AD and 112 m (average of similar to 14 m yr(-1)) from 2010 to 2018AD. The highest rate of snout (similar to 14 m yr(-1)) retreat during 2010-2018 AD is linked to the changing climate in the region as observed from the meteorological data. The analysis of meteorological data suggests that during this period temperature as well as the liquid precipitation have increased due to global warming whereas the extent of solid precipitation has decreased which might be the possible causes of higher retreat of Machoi glacier.

TI  - Land-surface evapotranspiration derived from a first-principles primary production model
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) links the water and carbon cycles in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. In this study, we develop an ET modelling framework based on the idea that the transpiration and carbon uptake are closely coupled, as predicted by the 'least-cost hypothesis' that canopy conductance acclimates to environmental variations. According to eco-evolutionary optimality theory, which has been previously applied in monitoring and modelling land-surface processes, the total costs (per unit carbon fixed) for maintaining transpiration and carboxylation capacities should be minimized. We calculate gross primary production (GPP) assuming that the light- and Rubisco-limited rates of photosynthesis, described by the classical biochemical model of photosynthesis, are coordinated on an approximately weekly time scale. Transpiration (T) is then calculated via acclimated canopy conductance, with no need for plant type- or biome-specific parameters. ET is finally calculated from T using an empirical function of light, temperature, soil water content and foliage cover to predict the T/ET ratio at each site. The GPP estimates were well supported by (weekly) GPP data at 20 widely distributed eddy-covariance flux sites (228 site-years), with correlation coefficients (r) = 0.81 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 18.7 gC week(-1) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) = 0.61. Predicted ET was also well supported, with r =0.85, RMSE = 5.5 mm week(-1) and NSE = 0.66. Estimated T/ET ratios (0.43-0.74) showed significant positive relationships to radiation, precipitation and green vegetation cover and negative relationships to temperature and modelled T (r = 0.84). Aspects of this framework could be improved, notably the estimation of T/ET. Nonetheless, we see the application of eco-evolutionary principles as a promising direction for water resources research, eliminating the uncertainty introduced by the need to specify multiple parameters, and leveraging the power of remotely sensed vegetation cover data as a key indicator of ecosystem function.

TI  - Assessing Burned Areas in Wildfires and Prescribed Fires with Spectral Indices and SAR Images in the Margalla Hills of Pakistan
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The extent of wildfires cannot be easily mapped using field-based methods in areas with complex topography, and in those areas the use of remote sensing is an alternative. This study first obtained images from the Sentinel-2 satellites for the period 2015-2020 with the objective of applying multi-temporal spectral indices to assess areas burned in wildfires and prescribed fires in the Margalla Hills of Pakistan using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). Using those images, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), which are often used to assess the severity of fires, were calculated for wildfires and prescribed fires. For each satellite image, spectral indices values were extracted for the 5th, 20th, 40th, 60th, 80th and 95th percentiles of pixels of each burned area. Then, boxplots representing the distribution of these values were plotted for each satellite image to identify whether the regeneration time subsequent to a fire, also known as the burn scar, and the severity of the fire differed between the autumn and summer wildfires, and with prescribed fires. A statistical test revealed no differences for the regeneration time amongst the three categories of fires, but that the severity of summer wildfires was significantly different from that of prescribed fire, and this, for both indices. Second, SAR images were obtained from the Sentinel-1 mission for the same period as that of the optical imagery. A comparison of the response of 34 SAR variables with official data on wildfires and prescribed fires from the Capital Development Authority revealed that the 95(th) percentile of the Normalized Signal Ratio (NSR p_95) was found to be the best variable to detect fire events, although only 50% of the fires were correctly detected. Nonetheless, when the occurrence of fire events according to the SAR variable NSR p_95 was compared to that from the two spectral indices, the SAR variable was found to correctly identify 95% of fire events. The SAR variable NSR p_95 is thus a suitable alternative to spectral indices to monitor the progress of wildfires and assess their severity when there are limitations to the use of optical images due to cloud coverage or smoke, for instance.</p>

TI  - Radiative Transfer Modeling With Biogeochemical-Argo Float Data in the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - A radiative transfer model was parameterized and validated using Biogeochemical Argo float data acquired between 2012 and 2017 across the Mediterranean Sea. Fluorescence-derived chlorophyll a concentration, particulate optical backscattering at 700 nm, and fluorescence of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) were used to parametrize the light absorption and scattering coefficients of the optically significant water constituents (such as pure water, non-algal particles, CDOM, and phytoplankton). The model was validated with in situ downwelling irradiance profiles and apparent optical properties derived both from irradiance profiles and satellite data, such as the diffuse attenuation coefficients and remote sensing reflectance. Results showed that by using regional parameterizations that are not only related to chlorophyll concentration and vertical distribution, the model was able to capture a more accurate spectral response in the examined wavelength range compared to chlorophyll-related (or Case 1) optical models. When using alternative models that incorporated also measurements of CDOM fluorescence or particulate optical backscattering, the model skill increased at all examined wavelengths. Finally, using a multi-spectral optical configuration also enabled the estimation of the relative contribution of separate water constituents in the examined spectral range. Simulations including non-algal particles and CDOM performed up to 61% and 79% better than when considering the optical properties of pure seawater alone. Moreover, a simulation including phytoplankton light absorption resulted in an error reduction of up to 42%, especially at 412 nm and with a more uniform response at the wavelengths considered.

TI  - Early-Season Mapping of Winter Crops Using Sentinel-2 Optical Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 imagery is an unprecedented data source with high spatial, spectral and temporal resolution in addition to free access. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the potential of using Sentinel-2 data to map winter crops in the early growth stage. Analysis of three winter crop types-winter garlic, winter canola and winter wheat-was carried out in two agricultural regions of China. We analysed the spectral characteristics and vegetation index profiles of these crops in the early growth stage and other land cover types based on Sentinel-2 images. A decision tree classification model was built to distinguish the crops based on these data. The results demonstrate that winter garlic and winter wheat can be distinguished four months before harvest, while winter canola can be distinguished two months before harvest. The overall classification accuracy was 96.62% with a kappa coefficient of 0.95. Therefore, Sentinel-2 images can be used to accurately identify these winter crops in the early growth stage, making them an important data source in the field of agricultural remote sensing.

TI  - Statistical Time-Series Analysis of Interferometric Coherence from Sentinel-1 Sensors for Landslide Detection and Early Warning
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are one of the most destructive natural hazards worldwide, affecting greatly built-up areas and critical infrastructure, causing loss of human lives, injuries, destruction of properties, and disturbance in everyday commute. Traditionally, landslides are monitored through time consuming and costly in situ geotechnical investigations and a wide range of conventional means, such as inclinometers and boreholes. Earth Observation and the exploitation of the freely available Copernicus datasets, and especially Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, can assist in the systematic monitoring of landslides, irrespective of weather conditions and time of day, overcoming the restrictions arising from in situ measurements. In the present study, a comprehensive statistical analysis of coherence obtained through processing of a time-series of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery was carried out to investigate and detect early indications of a landslide that took place in Cyprus on 15 February 2019. The application of the proposed methodology led to the detection of a sudden coherence loss prior to the landslide occurrence that can be used as input to Early Warning Systems, giving valuable on-time information about an upcoming landslide to emergency response authorities and the public, saving numerous lives. The statistical significance of the results was tested using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests and two-tailed t-tests.

AB  - Present research examined three selected villages landscape near Khanpur Dam, District Haripur, that's an offer to visitors the integrated knowledge of native ethos, history and environment. We first evaluated the landscape exploration and documentation of three selected villages i.e., Surraj Galli, Khoi Maira and Darra in Khanpur with a DSLR camera and Landsat 8 images, using the supervised image classification technique, by ArcGIS v10.3 during June 2019-2020. Second, we collected data from local communities and tourists by using two types of questionnaire survey and a total of 300 respondents were served over six months of period. In total 150 respondents from local communities were served questionnaire for documentation of selected communities' profile and their major flora, fauna. The sampling intensity was 2.5%. Most dominant respondents belonged to Raja, Malik and Aawan communities. Flora documentation was carried out by quadratics system taking 60 plots from study area with 0.5% sampling intensity. The tourist preferences and attitudes were surveyed involving 150 visitors. Most visitors belong to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and prefer to visit with friends more than family and relatives especially in spring and summer holidays. The result also indicated that the declaration of a noble landscape could benefit the local people.

TI  - Using Remotely Sensed Sea Surface Salinity and Colored Detrital Matter to Characterize Freshened Surface Layers in the Kara and Laptev Seas during the Ice-Free Season
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The overall volume of freshwater entering the Arctic Ocean has been growing as glaciers melt and river runoff increases. Since 1980, a 20% increase in river runoff has been observed in the Arctic system. As the discharges of the Ob, Yenisei, and Lena rivers are an important source of freshwater in the Kara and Laptev Seas, an increase in river discharge might have a significant impact on the upper ocean circulation. The fresh river water mixes with ocean water and forms a large freshened surface layer (FSL), which carries high loads of dissolved organic matter and suspended matter into the Arctic Ocean. Optically active material (e.g., phytoplankton and detrital matter) are spread out into plumes, which are evident in satellite data. Russian river signatures in the Kara and Laptev Seas are also evident in recent SMOS Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) Arctic products. In this study, we compare the new Arctic+ SSS products, produced at the Barcelona Expert Center, with the Ocean Color absorption coefficient of colored detrital matter (CDM) in the Kara and Laptev Seas for the period 2011-2019. The SSS and CDM are found to be strongly negatively correlated in the regions of freshwater influence, with regression coefficients between -0.72 and -0.91 in the studied period. Exploiting this linear correlation, we estimate the SSS back to 1998 using two techniques: one assuming that the relationship between the CDM and SSS varies regionally in the river-influenced areas, and another assuming that it does not. We use the 22-year time-series of reconstructed SSS to estimate the interannual variability of the extension of the FSL in the Kara and Laptev Seas as well as their freshwater content. For the Kara and Laptev Seas, we use 32 and 28 psu as reference salinities, and 26 and 24 psu isohalines as FSL boundaries, respectively. The average FSL extension in the Kara Sea is 2089-2611 km2, with a typical freshwater content of 11.84-14.02 km3. The Laptev Sea has a slightly higher mean FSL extension of 2320-2686 km2 and a freshwater content of 10.15-12.44 km3. The yearly mean freshwater content and extension of the FSL, computed from SMOS SSS and Optical data, is (as expected) found to co-vary with in situ measurements of river discharge from the Arctic Great Rivers Observatory database, demonstrating the potential of SMOS SSS to better monitor the river discharge changes in Eurasia and to understand the Arctic freshwater system during the ice-free season.

TI  - Climate Effects on Vertical Forest Phenology of <i>Fagus sylvatica</i> L., Sensed by Sentinel-2, Time Lapse Camera, and Visual Ground Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary climate change leads to earlier spring phenological events in Europe. In forests, in which overstory strongly regulates the microclimate beneath, it is not clear if further change equally shifts the timing of leaf unfolding for the over- and understory of main deciduous forest species, such as Fagus sylvatica L. (European beech). Furthermore, it is not known yet how this vertical phenological (mis)match-the phenological difference between overstory and understory-affects the remotely sensed satellite signal. To investigate this, we disentangled the start of season (SOS) of overstory F.sylvatica foliage from understory F. sylvatica foliage in forests, within nine quadrants of 5.8 x 5.8 km, stratified over a temperature gradient of 2.5 degrees C in Bavaria, southeast Germany, in the spring seasons of 2019 and 2020 using time lapse cameras and visual ground observations. We explained SOS dates and vertical phenological (mis)match by canopy temperature and compared these to Sentinel-2 derived SOS in response to canopy temperature. We found that overstory SOS advanced with higher mean April canopy temperature (visual ground observations: -2.86 days per degrees C; cameras: -2.57 days per degrees C). However, understory SOS was not significantly affected by canopy temperature. This led to an increase of vertical phenological mismatch with increased canopy temperature (visual ground observations: +3.90 days per degrees C; cameras: +2.52 days per degrees C). These results matched Sentinel-2-derived SOS responses, as pixels of higher canopy height advanced more by increased canopy temperature than pixels of lower canopy height. The results may indicate that, with further climate change, spring phenology of F. sylvatica overstory will advance more than F. sylvatica understory, leading to increased vertical phenological mismatch in temperate deciduous forests. This may have major ecological effects, but also methodological consequences for the field of remote sensing, as what the signal senses highly depends on the pixel mean canopy height and the vertical (mis)match.

AB  - This work assessed the capability of Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) and satellite multispectral Sentinel-2 image data for mapping the distribution, percent cover (%cover) and biomass of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in optically complex coastal waters of the Baltic Sea. As a first step, the distribution maps of SAV were created for brown macroalgae, green macroalgae and higher plants classes. Secondly, %cover maps were retrieved by building class level relationships between in situ estimated %cover and image reflectance. Thirdly, statistical models were built for estimating class specific SAV biomass as a function of SAV %cover. Finally, developed biomass models were applied to class specific %cover maps derived from the step 2 for landscape scale biomass estimation. CASI sensor had higher classification accuracy (78%) compared to Sentinel-2 sensor (69%). CASI also outperformed Sentinel-2 in the %cover assessment showing R2 values in the range of 0.55-0.73, while R2 values in the range of 0.36-0.49 were retrieved for Sentinel-2. However, both sensors provided similar distribution and %cover patterns of benthic vegetation. The %cover-biomass models showed a very good fit explaining 66-82% of variance of different SAV classes. Comparison of biomass estimates from both images revealed that the total dry biomass (t) was underestimated by Sentinel-2 by 10.6%. However, if biomasses were retrieved per unit area (t/km2), then both instruments resulted in nearly identical total SAV biomasses.

TI  - Time Series Analysis of Land Cover Change in Dry Mountains: Insights from the Tajik Pamirs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greening and browning trends in vegetation have been observed in many regions of the world in recent decades. However, few studies focused on dry mountains. Here, we analyze trends of land cover change in the Western Pamirs, Tajikistan. We aim to gain a deeper understanding of these changes and thus improve remote sensing studies in dry mountainous areas. The study area is characterized by a complex set of attributes, making it a prime example for this purpose. We used generalized additive mixed models for the trend estimation of a 32-year Landsat time series (1988-2020) of the modified soil adjusted vegetation index, vegetation data, and environmental and socio-demographic data. With this approach, we were able to cope with the typical challenges that occur in the remote sensing analysis of dry and mountainous areas, including background noise and irregular data. We found that greening and browning trends coexist and that they vary according to the land cover class, topography, and geographical distribution. Greening was detected predominantly in agricultural and forestry areas, indicating direct anthropogenic drivers of change. At other sites, greening corresponds well with increasing temperature. Browning was frequently linked to disastrous events, which are promoted by increasing temperatures.</p>

TI  - In situ and satellite long-term monitoring of two earthflows of the Italian southern Apennines and of the structures built on them
T2  - ITALIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL-RIVISTA ITALIANA DI GEOTECNICA
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper reports the results of a long-term monitoring of the slow movements of two deep earthflows in tectonized clay shales of southern Apennines. The cumulated movements have caused over the years severe damage to buildings and infrastructure, with important social and economic costs. Deep and superficial displacements, along with pore water pressures, are being monitored since 2005; in some areas of the slope, displacement monitoring by inclinometers started about 30 years ago. The kinematics of the landslides has been clarified sufficiently on the basis ofground-based measurements. On the other hand, the mostly N-S orientation of displacements, and the rather limited urbanization, make it rather challenging to monitor the area by satellite interferometry methodology. To minimize such problem, satellite data relative to areas where the displacements and their directions are clearly determined by inclinometers and GPS were analysed at the most detailed scale of analysis. The data validation allowed to confidently exploit remote sensing results in a wider area. Thus, images acquired by the COSMO-SkyMed satellite system, supplemented by ERS and Envisat data (available since 1993), allowed the reconstruction of the kinematic history of the urbanized area even where inclinometer displacement series were available only over short periods. Indications about the effectiveness of the remedial measures constructed in the area under study could also be obtained.

TI  - Improving Forest Baseline Maps in Tropical Wetlands Using GEDI-Based Forest Height Information and Sentinel-1
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote Sensing-based global Forest/Non-Forest (FNF) masks have shown large inaccuracies in tropical wetland areas. This limits their applications for deforestation monitoring and alerting in which they are used as a baseline for mapping new deforestation. In radar-based deforestation monitoring, for example, moisture dynamics in unmasked non-forest areas can lead to false detections. We combined a GEDI Forest Height product and Sentinel-1 radar data to improve FNF masks in wetland areas in Gabon using a Random Forest model. The GEDI Forest Height, together with texture metrics derived from Sentinel-1 mean backscatter values, were the most important contributors to the classification. Quantitatively, our mask outperformed existing global FNF masks by increasing the Producer's Accuracy for the non-forest class by 14%. The GEDI Forest Height product by itself also showed high accuracies but contained Landsat artifacts. Qualitatively, our model was best able to cleanly uncover non-forest areas and mitigate the impact of Landsat artifacts in the GEDI Forest Height product. An advantage of the methodology presented here is that it can be adapted for different application needs by varying the probability threshold of the Random Forest output. This study stresses that, in any application of the suggested methodology, it is important to consider the UA/PA trade-off and the effect it has on the classification. The targeted improvements for wetland forest mapping presented in this paper can help raise the accuracy of tropical deforestation monitoring.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to summarize the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 from Western Mexico people during 2020. A retrospective analysis from an electronic database of people visiting a sentinel center for molecular SARS-CoV-2 confirmatory diagnosis by RT-PCR from April to December 2020 was carried out for epidemiological and clinical description of COVID-19. Out of 23,211 patients evaluated, 6918 (29.8%) were confirmed for SARS-CoV-2 infection (mean age 38.5 & PLUSMN; 13.99), mostly females (53.8%). Comorbidities, such as diabetes (34.7%), obesity (31.15%), and hypertension (31.8%), presented an increased odds OR = 1.27, CI = 1.14-1.41; OR = 1.08, CI = 1.01-1.16; and OR = 1.09, CI = 0.99-1.19, respectively, for viral-infection. Moreover, fever, headache, and dry cough were the most frequent symptoms. No infection difference among sex was found. Those patients > 60 years old were prone to COVID-19 severity (OR = 3.59, CI = 2.10-6.14), evaluated by the number of manifested symptoms, increasing with age. In conclusion, a high SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was found in Western Mexico. Comorbidities were frequent in infected people; nevertheless, no association with disease outcomes was observed, in contrast with the highest disease severity risk found in older patients; however, continuous monitoring should be carried since comorbidities have been reported as aggravating factors. This study can help the health officials for the elaboration of planning efforts of the disease management and others in the future.</p>

TI  - Structural Position and Typification of Alteration Zones, Polar Urals: First Experience of Modern Space Sensing of the Earth
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A new approach to statistical analysis of the data from the Landsat 8 spacecraft was developed for the first time for the territory of the Urals on the basis of the method of principal components. It is based on assessment of the spectral contribution of the mineralogical index to the principal component and aimed at identifying the features of the deep structure of the Toupugol-Khanmeyshor gold mineral district of the Polar Urals. It was found that the prospective gold fields are confined to the contact zone of small ring structures up to 10 km in size. The area is crosscutted by extensive ore-controlling faults of NE or NW strike; on the processed satellite image it is manifested in contrasting spots of the iron (III) oxide index and, to a lesser extent, the iron (II) oxide index. These indexes appear to be indicators of hydrothermal minerals and products of their hypergenesis (e.g., limonite). This prospecting indicator can be further used in metallogenic analysis of detailed satellite images of partially closed regions of the Arctic zone.

TI  - Extreme Droughts Change in the Mekong River Basin: A Multidisciplinary Analysis Based on Satellite Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates droughts in the Mekong River Basin (MKB) based on a multidisciplinary method, mainly using the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Mann-Kendall (MK) test. Precipitation data corresponding to the seasonality of the regional climate were retrieved from Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement from 2001 to 2020, at a monthly temporal scale and 0.1 degree spatial resolution. Drought events and their average interval, duration, and severity were determined based on Run theory. Our results revealed the most extreme drought period was in January 2014, at the time the lowest precipitation occurred. Spatial extreme drought results indicated that Zone 2 in the upstream MKB has the highest frequency of drought, with 44 events observed during 19 years, and experiences the most severe droughts, whereas Zone 24 in the downstream MKB has the most prolonged drought duration of seven months. The periods and locations of extreme drought were identified using the SPI, corresponding to historic droughts of the MKB. Furthermore, the MK test shows an increasing trend of droughts in the lower MKB and the cluster analysis identified six clusters of times series. Overall, our study provides essential findings for international and national water resource stakeholders in identifying trends of extreme drought in the MKB.

TI  - A Two-Round Weight Voting Strategy-Based Ensemble Learning Method for Sea Ice Classification of Sentinel-1 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice information in the Arctic region is essential for climatic change monitoring and ship navigation. Although many sea ice classification methods have been put forward, the accuracy and usability of classification systems can still be improved. In this paper, a two-round weight voting strategy-based ensemble learning method is proposed for refining sea ice classification. The proposed method includes three main steps. (1) The preferable features of sea ice are constituted by polarization features (HH, HV, HH/HV) and the top six GLCM-derived texture features via a random forest. (2) The initial classification maps can then be generated by an ensemble learning method, which includes six base classifiers (NB, DT, KNN, LR, ANN, and SVM). The tuned voting weights by a genetic algorithm are employed to obtain the category score matrix and, further, the first coarse classification result. (3) Some pixels may be misclassified due to their corresponding numerically close score value. By introducing an experiential score threshold, each pixel is identified as a fuzzy or an explicit pixel. The fuzzy pixels can then be further rectified based on the local similarity of the neighboring explicit pixels, thereby yielding the final precise classification result. The proposed method was examined on 18 Sentinel-1 EW images, which were captured in the Northeast Passage from November 2019 to April 2020. The experiments show that the proposed method can effectively maintain the edge profile of sea ice and restrain noise from SAR. It is superior to the current mainstream ensemble learning algorithms with the overall accuracy reaching 97%. The main contribution of this study is proposing a superior weight voting strategy in the ensemble learning method for sea ice classification of Sentinel-1 imagery, which is of great significance for guiding secure ship navigation and ice hazard forecasting in winter.

TI  - Layover Compensation Method for Regional Spaceborne SAR Imagery Without GCPs
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images reveal severe geometric distortions especially in the mountain area, such as layover, which is caused by imaging characteristics of SAR itself and terrain undulations. The layover phenomenon greatly limits the application of SAR images. This article proposes a layover compensation method for regional spaceborne SAR imagery without ground control points (GCPs), which is mainly improved from two aspects. First, a method based on rational function model (RFM) to determine the layover range is proposed. Second, based on geometric calibration and block adjustment, the processing flow is optimized to generate digital orthophoto map (DOM) which greatly eliminated the influence of layover. The proposed method was applied to Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) SAR regional images, including the ascending and descending track stacks. The result showed that 84.5% of the layover pixels on the regional DOM were compensated, which verified the effectiveness and feasibility of the method.

TI  - Inflation of Okmok Volcano During 2008-2020 From PS Analyses and Source Inversion With Finite Element Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Okmok volcano, located on northeastern Umnak Island along the eastern end of the Aleutian island arc, is one of the most active volcanoes in Alaska, producing multiple eruptions in the past century. The most recent eruption, which occurred during July-August of 2008, was the most explosive since the early nineteenth century. In the years following the 2008 eruption, Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations indicate that Okmok has inflated at a variable rate of 40-195 mm/yr. In this study, we investigate the post-eruptive deformation of Okmok (2008-2020) using InSAR and GNSS. L-band ALOS-2, C-band Sentinel-1/Envisat and X-band TerraSAR-X data are analyzed with Persistent Scatterer (PS) InSAR method. The deformation time series calculated from InSAR and GNSS are assimilated into finite element models using the Ensemble Kalman Filter to track the evolution of the magma system through time. The results indicate that the InSAR-derived deformation history can be well explained by a spatially stable magmatic source located in the central caldera, at about 3 km beneath the sea level, which is also believed to be the same source that produced the 1997 and 2008 eruptions. Magma accumulation in the reservoir is about 0.08km3 from 2008 to 2020, which is about 160% and about 60% of the total reservoir volume changes during the 1997 and the 2008 eruptions, respectively.Plain Language Summary Precise mapping of volcano deformation allows for identification and modeling of the source location, shape, and pressure change within a magma reservoir of the volcanic system. Hence, monitoring ground surface deformation is a critical part in volcano study and eruption forecasting. In this study, we map the deformation history of Okmok volcano since its 2008 eruption using InSAR. The produced displacement time series are then used to track the magmatic pressure accumulation in the magmatic reservoir with numerical models. Our InSAR measurements show that Okmok has been undergoing persistent inflation with time-varying rates since the last eruption in 2008. The measured deformation suggests the magmatic source as that accounting for the pre-2008 eruptions. The cumulative volume change during 2008-2020 is similar to 160% and similar to 60% of the total volumes of the 1997 and the 2008 eruptions, respectively.

TI  - Soil Moisture and Salinity Inversion Based on New Remote Sensing Index and Neural Network at a Salina-Alkaline Wetland
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid and semi-arid regions, soil moisture and salinity are important elements to control regional ecology and climate, vegetation growth and land function. Soil moisture and salt content are more important in arid wetlands. The Ebinur Lake wetland is an important part of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, China. The Ebinur Lake Basin is a representative area of the arid climate and ecological degradation in central Asia. It is of great significance to study the spatial distribution of soil moisture and salinity and its causes for land and wetland ecological restoration in the Ebinur Lake Basin. Based on the field measurement and Landsat 8 satellite data, a variety of remote sensing indexes related to soil moisture and salinity were tested and compared, and the prediction models of soil moisture and salinity were established, and the accuracy of the models was assessed. Among them, the salinity indexes D1 and D2 were the latest ones that we proposed according to the research area and data. The distribution maps of soil moisture and salinity in the Ebinur Lake Basin were retrieved from remote sensing data, and the correlation analysis between soil moisture and salinity was performed. Among several soil moisture and salinity prediction indexes, the normalized moisture index NDWI had the highest correlation with soil moisture, and the salinity index D2 had the highest correlation with soil salinity, reaching 0.600 and 0.637, respectively. The accuracy of the BP neural network model for estimating soil salinity was higher than the one of other models; R-2 = 0.624, RMSE = 0.083 S/m. The effect of the cubic function prediction model for estimating soil moisture was also higher than that of the BP neural network, support vector machine and other models; R-2 = 0.538, RMSE = 0.230. The regularity of soil moisture and salinity changes seemed to be consistent, the correlation degree was 0.817, and the synchronous change degree was higher. The soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake Basin was generally low in the surrounding area, high in the middle area, high in the lake area and low in the vegetation coverage area. The soil moisture in the Ebinur Lake Basin slightly decreased outward with the Ebinur Lake as the center and was higher in the west and lower in the east. However, the spatial distribution of soil moisture had a higher mutation rate and stronger heterogeneity than that of soil salinity.

TI  - New Evidence to Support Zephyria Tholus as a Composite Volcano on Mars
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Zephyria Tholus has been proposed to be a composite volcano, however, detailed geomorphological study was not carried out due to limited high-resolution remote sensing data. Here we use MOLA, THEMIS, CTX and HiRISE data to conduct topographical and geomorphological analysis of Zephyria Tholus. We identify extensive valleys and troughs on the flank, which are sector collapse or glacio-fluvial in origin. The valleys and troughs indicate coexistence of different erosion resistance materials, along with the observed solid lava outcrops. There are also layered materials identified on the wall of the largest valley. In addition, perched craters are identified on the top depression and flanks of Zephyria Tholus, indicating the presence of ice-rich layer. We conducted crater size-frequency distribution of the caldera and found the absolute model age is 3.74 (+0.03, -0.04) Ga. The geomorphology evidence and chronology result support the composite volcano nature of Zephyria Tholus, and indicate the magma volatile content in the Aeolis region in Noachian is more than 0.15 wt% if the atmosphere paleo-pressure was similar to present Mars.

TI  - Analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of ecological environmental quality in Ningxia and its driving force contribution based on RSEDI.
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate grasp of the evolution of regional ecological environment quality is of great practical significance to achieve harmonious and stable high.quality development of human society and nature. Here, we used four periods of Landsat TM/ OLI remote sensing images of Ningxia in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018 as data sources to extract generalized difference vegetation index (GI), moisture index (WI), desertification index (DI), salinization index (MSI), and con. struct remote sensing ecological distance index (RSEDI) to analyze the spatial and temporal evo. lution of Ningxia ecological environment and its driving factors. The results showed that the GI values generally showed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2018, which was 0.265, 0.246, 0.286, and 0.288 in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018, respectively. The WI, MSI, and DI values generally showed a decreasing trend, with WI values being 0.212, 0.223, 0.159 and 0.168, MSI values being 0.218, 0.242, 0.196 and 0.202, and DI values being 0.190, 0.183, 0.180 and 0.184 in those four years, respectively. The overall trend of RSEDI index was increasing, with the mean improved ecological environment. There were significant spatial variations in ecological environ. ment quality of the study area. The GI and WI had the distribution characteristics of high in north and south and low in middle, with the high. value areas located in the Yinchuan Plain and south. ern mountainous areas and the low. value areas located in the central arid area. The high.value ar. eas of DI were distributed in the east, west, north, and central areas, while the low.value areas were distributed in the Yinchuan Plain and southern mountainous areas. The high.value areas of MSI were mainly distributed in the Yanghuang irrigation area of central part and the Yinbei irriga. tion area of northern part, while the low.value area was located in the southern mountainous area. In general, desertification and salinization were lower in the southern mountainous area, higher in the central area, and highest in the northern Yinchuan Plain. Human factors had the greatest con. tribution ( 51.4%), with the main driving factors of total population, urbanization rate, primary industry, secondary industry and tertiary industry output values. The natural factors were the sec. ond important type with a contribution rate of 35.5%, with mean temperature, mean wind speed and potential evaporation as the main factors.

TI  - Using satellite rainfall products to assess the triggering conditions for hydro-morphological processes in different geomorphological settings in China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydro-morphological processes (HMP, i.e. all processes contained within the spectrum defined between debris flows and flash floods) initiate in response to intense rainfall events. Efficient HMP hazard assessment over large regions is often hindered because of limited rainfall observations over mountainous areas. Real-time and easily accessible satellite rainfall products offer new opportunities to address the observational coverage problem in ungauged catchments. In this work, two satellite rainfall products, Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Station Data (CHIRPS), are investigated by taking the ground measurements as a reference. Based on a close agreement between GPM and rain gauge data, daily rainfall together with a series of antecedent rainfall values were calculated to investigate the spatio-temporal distribution of HMP occurred from 2001 to 2015 across the whole Chinese territory. Ultimately, rainfall thresholds for HMP initiation within different geomorphological settings in China were obtained by: (1) building antecedent rainfall sequences consisting of HMP and non-HMP via 100 nonparametric bootstrapped replicates; (2) testing several percentiles of the rainfall distribution as thresholds for HMP occurrence; (3) optimizing rainfall thresholds for six geomorphological macro-regions in China. This study confirmed the ability of satellite data in defining the rainfall conditions for the triggering of HMP, acknowledging the potential underestimation and/or bias that characterize any satellite rainfall products. Our findings provides new insight on rainfall conditions responsible for HMP initiation at the Chinese national scale.

TI  - Does polar amplification exist in Antarctic surface during the recent four decades?
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There are numerous studies on polar amplification and its influence on mid-latitude weather and climate. However, assessments on whether polar amplification occurs in Antarctica are rarely conducted. Based on the latest atmospheric reanalysis of ERA5 produced by European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), we have defined the Antarctic amplification index, and calculated the trend of annual and seasonal Surface Air Temperature (SAT) mean during 1979-2019 for Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) and the trend mean of different meridional sectors of Antarctic sub regions including East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS), West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) and Antarctic Peninsula (AP). Antarctic amplification shows regional differences and seasonal variations. Antarctica shows a slight warming with the largest magnitude in AP. The temperature anomalies indicate the least fluctuations in austral summer, and the more fluctuations in winter and spring. In austral summer, the warming trend domains EAIS and WAIS, while the cooling trend appears over AP. The zonal mean in Southern Hemisphere maintains a warming trend in the low latitudes, and fluctuates greatly in the middle and high latitudes. The strongest Antarctic amplification phenomenon occurs in spring, with the amplification index of 1.20. For AP, the amplification occurs in austral autumn, and the amplification index is 2.16. At South Pole and the surrounding regions, SAT for land only fluctuates largely and shows different trends in different seasons. The mechanism of Antarctic amplification is unclear till now, and its research suffers from the limitation of measured data. This suggests that future research needs progress in comprehensive ground observation network, remote sensing data accumulation, and high-resolution climate modeling with better representation of both atmospheric and cryospheric processes in Antarctica.

TI  - Prediction Potential of Remote Sensing-Related Variables in the Topsoil Organic Carbon Density of Liaohekou Coastal Wetlands, Northeast China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems contain large amounts of soil organic carbon. Their natural environment is often both at the junction of land and water with good conditions for carbon sequestration. Therefore, the study of accurate prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) density in coastal wetland ecosystems of flat terrain areas is the key to understanding their carbon cycling. This study used remote sensing data to study SOC density potentials of coastal wetland ecosystems in Northeast China. Eleven environmental variables including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), renormalization difference vegetation index (RDVI), ratio vegetation index (RVI), topographic wetness index (TWI), elevation, slope aspect (SA), slope gradient (SG), mean annual temperature (MAT), and mean annual precipitation (MAP) were selected to predict SOC density. A total of 193 soil samples (0-30 cm) were divided into two parts, 70% of the sampling sites data were used to construct the boosted regression tree (BRT) model containing three different combinations of environmental variables, and the remaining 30% were used to test the predictive performance of the model. The results show that the full variable model is better than the other two models. Adding remote sensing-related variables significantly improved the model prediction. This study revealed that SAVI, NDVI and DVI were the main environmental factors affecting the spatial variation of topsoil SOC density of coastal wetlands in flat terrain areas. The mean (& PLUSMN;SD) SOC density of full variable models was 18.78 (& PLUSMN;1.95) kg m(-2), which gradually decreased from northeast to southwest. We suggest that remote sensing-related environmental variables should be selected as the main environmental variables when predicting topsoil SOC density of coastal wetland ecosystems in flat terrain areas. Accurate prediction of topsoil SOC density distribution will help to formulate soil management policies and enhance soil carbon sequestration.</p>

TI  - Ecological Effect of Ecological Engineering Projects on Low-Temperature Forest Cover in Great Khingan Mountain, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The evaluation of ecological restoration projects can provide support for further strengthening the efforts of ecological restoration work and implementing the strategic objectives of the ecological region. Considering the current problem of the single evaluation index, this study evaluated the implementation effect of ecological projects from different temporal and spatial dimensions. Based on the MODIS vegetation index time series data, this study first computed the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 15.3.1 of Great Khingan Mountain (GKM) to evaluate the impact of ecological engineering on land use change and land productivity. As a common indicator, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values showed a trend of a decrease and then gradual increase after the start of the Natural Forest Protection Project (NFPP) II, which was related to the land use changes from the forest to the grassland during the implementation of the NFPP. However, land productivity maintained a steady trend because of the transition between the forest and grassland. Meanwhile, to detect changes in vegetation at a smaller scale, the LandTrendr algorithm was used to identify the magnitude of forest disturbance, the years when it occurred, and the year of restoration. After implementing the ecological project, the forests in the GKM region were only partially disturbed, and most of the forests in most areas maintained a stable trend. Our study highlighted the varying effectiveness of different indexes for NFPP and evaluated the ecological impact of ecological projects from multiple perspectives.

TI  - Estimating the Changes in Glaciers and Glacial Lakes in the Xixabangma Massif, Central Himalayas, between 1974 and 2018 from Multisource Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous melting of valley glaciers can impact the water levels of glacial lakes and create glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs). The Xixabangma massif is one of the most populated areas in the Himalayas and has suffered from multiple GLOFs. To estimate the glacier melting rate in the past four decades and analyze the outburst risk of glacial lakes in the Xixabangma massif, we determined changes in glacier mass balance, glacier area and glacial lake area based on KH-9 images, TanDEM-X images, Landsat images, SRTM DEM and ICESat-2 elevations. Our results show that, from 1974 to 2018, the total glacier area shrank from 954.01 km(2) to 752.46 km(2), whereas the total glacial lake area grew from 20.90 km(2) to 38.71 km(2). From 1974 to 2000, 2000 to 2013 and 2013 to 2018, the region-wide glacier mass balance values were -0.16 m w.e./a, -0.31 m w.e./a and -0.29 m w.e./a, respectively. Three glacial lakes, named Gangxico, Galongco and Jialongco, respectively, expanded by 127.14%, 373.45% and 436.36% from 1974 to 2018, and the mass loss rates of their parent glaciers from 2000 to 2013 increased by 81.72%, 122.22% and 160.00% relative to those during 1974 to 2000. The dams of these three lakes are unstable, and their drainage valleys directly connect to a major town and its infrastructure. Due to current high-water levels, possible external events such as ice collapse, landslide, heavy rainfall and earthquakes can easily trigger GLOFs. Hence, we deemed that the Gangxico, Galongco and Jialongco glacial lakes are dangerous and require special attention.

TI  - HA-Net: A Lake Water Body Extraction Network Based on Hybrid-Scale Attention and Transfer Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the large quantity of noise and complex spatial background of the remote sensing images, how to improve the accuracy of semantic segmentation has become a hot topic. Lake water body extraction is crucial for disaster detection, resource utilization, and carbon cycle, etc. The the area of lakes on the Tibetan Plateau has been constantly changing due to the movement of the Earth's crust. Most of the convolutional neural networks used for remote sensing images are based on single-layer features for pixel classification while ignoring the correlation of such features in different layers. In this paper, the two-branch encoder is presented, which is a multiscale structure that combines the features of ResNet-34 with a feature pyramid network. Secondly, adaptive weights are distributed to global information using the hybrid-scale attention block. Finally, PixelShuffle is used to recover the feature maps' resolution, and the densely connected block is used to refine the boundary of the lake water body. Likewise, we transfer the best weights which are saved on the Google dataset to the Landsat-8 dataset to ensure that our proposed method is robust. We validate the superiority of Hybrid-scale Attention Network (HA-Net) on two given datasets, which were created by us using Google and Landsat-8 remote sensing images. (1) On the Google dataset, HA-Net achieves the best performance of all five evaluation metrics with a Mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) of 97.38%, which improves by 1.04% compared with DeepLab V3+, and reduces the training time by about 100 s per epoch. Moreover, the overall accuracy (OA), Recall, True Water Rate (TWR), and False Water Rate (FWR) of HA-Net are 98.88%, 98.03%, 98.24%, and 1.76% respectively. (2) On the Landsat-8 dataset, HA-Net achieves the best overall accuracy and the True Water Rate (TWR) improvement of 2.93% compared to Pre_PSPNet, which proves to be more robust than other advanced models.

TI  - A Modified Approach of Extracting Landfast Ice Edge Based on Sentinel-1A InSAR Coherence Image in the Gulf of Bothnia
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landfast ice is an integral component of the coastal ecosystem. Extracting the edge and mapping the extent of landfast ice are one of the main methods for studying ice changes. In this work, a standardized process for extracting landfast ice edge in the Baltic Sea using the InSAR coherence image is established with Sentinel-1 radar data and InSAR technology. A modified approach combining multiscale segmentation and morphological erosion is then proposed to provide a reliable way to extract landfast ice edge. Firstly, the coherence image is obtained using InSAR technology. Then, the edge is separated and extracted with the modified approach. The modified approach is essentially a four-step procedure involving image segmentation, median filter, morphological erosion, and rejection of small patches. Finally, the full extent of landfast ice can be obtained using floodfill algorithm. Multiple InSAR image pairs of Sentinel-1A acquired from 2018 to 2019 are utilized to successfully extract the landfast ice edge in the Gulf of Bothnia. The results show that the landfast ice edge and the extents obtained by the proposed approach are visually consistent with those shown in the ice chart issued by the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute (SMHI) over a coastline length of 345 km. The mean distance between land-water boundary and the coastline issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is 109.1 m. The modified approach obviously preserves more details in local edge than the reference method. The experimental results show that the modified approach proposed in this paper can extract the edge and map the extent of landfast ice more accurately and quickly, and is therefore expected to contribute to the further understanding and analyzing the changes of landfast ice in the future.

TI  - Numerical Study of Global ELF Electromagnetic Wave Propagation with Respect to Lithosphere-Atmosphere-Ionosphere Coupling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Before and after earthquakes, abnormal physical and chemical phenomena can be observed by gathering ground-based and satellite data and interpreted by the lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC) mechanism. In this study, we focused on the mechanism of LAIC electromagnetic radiation and investigated the seismic electromagnetic (EM) wave generated in the lithosphere by earthquakes and its global propagation process from the lithosphere through the atmosphere and into the bottom of ionosphere, in order to analyze the abnormal disturbance of ground-based and space-based observation results. First, analytic formulas of the electrokinetic effect were used to simulate the generation and propagation process of the seismic EM wave in the lithosphere, interpreted as the conversion process of the seismic wave and EM wave in porous media. Second, we constructed a three-dimensional Earth-ionosphere waveguide by applying the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm to model the global propagation process of the seismic EM wave into the atmosphere and cavity between the bottom of the ionosphere and the surface of the Earth. By combining the model of the electrokinetic effect in the lithosphere with the numerical model of the Earth-ionosphere waveguide in the atmosphere and ionosphere, we numerically simulated the global transmission process of extremely low-frequency (ELF: 3 Hz-3000 Hz) EM waves which are related to earthquakes. The propagation parameters of coseismic ELF EM waves with different duration times and center frequencies were analyzed and summarized. The simulation results demonstrate that the distribution characteristics of an electric field along longitude, latitude and altitude with time are periodic and the time interval during which an EM wave travels around the whole Earth is approximately 0.155 s when adopting the conductivity of the knee profile. We also compared the observation data with the simulation results and found that the attenuating trends of the ELF electric field are consistent. This proposed ELF EM wave propagation model of lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling is very promising for the explanation of abnormal disturbances of ground-based and space-based observation results of ELF EM fields which are associated with earthquakes.

TI  - Questioning the Assumptions, Sustainability and Ethics of Endless Economic Growth
T2  - JOURNAL OF RISK AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article questions the assumptions, sustainability and ethics of endless economic growth on the basis of environmental science, ecological economics and ecological ethics. It considers the impossibility and unsustainability of endless physical growth on a finite planet. It considers the indicators of environmental degradation (all increasing) and argues that society's addiction to endless growth is irresponsible. It discusses the key problem of denial, and how this blocks us from finding workable solutions. It discusses how in theory GDP could continue to grow modestly in the future if we adopted a steady-state economy where growth was not caused by an expanding population or resource use. However, this model is currently unpopular, with many advocating the green and circular economies that are partial solutions, and which justify ongoing growth through a fantasy of absolute decoupling. I discuss the need for society to change its anthropocentric worldview to one of ecocentrism. I then question whether the UN Sustainable Development Goals are actually ecologically sustainable. I discuss how, when we ignore the problems of an endlessly growing economy, we create significant risk to society. Rather than a focus only on 'sustainable economic growth', I suggest it is time to focus centrally on an ecologically sustainable economy and future.

TI  - Change Detection Using a Texture Feature Space Outlier Index from Mono-Temporal Remote Sensing Images and Vector Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-temporal remote sensing images are the primary sources for change detection. However, it is difficult to obtain comparable multi-temporal images at the same season and time of day with the same sensor. Considering texture homogeneity among objects belonging to the same category, this paper presents a new change detection approach using a texture feature space outlier index from mono-temporal remote sensing images and vector data. In the proposed approach, a texture feature contribution index (TFCI) is defined based on information gain to select the optimal texture features, and a feature space outlier index (FSOI) based on local reachability density is presented to automatically identify outlier samples and changed objects. Our approach includes three steps: (1) the sampling method is designed considering spatial distribution and topographic properties of image objects extracted by segmenting the recent image with existing vector map. (2) Samples with changed categories are refined by an iteration procedure of texture feature selection and outlier sample elimination; and (3) the changed image objects are identified and classified using the refined samples to calculate the FSOI values of the image objects. Three experiments in the two study areas were conducted to validate its performance. Overall accuracies of 95.94%, 96.36%, and 96.28% were achieved, respectively, while the omission and commission errors for every category were all very low. Four widely used methods with two-temporal images were selected for comparison, and the accuracy of the proposed method is higher than theirs. This indicates that our approach is effective and feasible.

TI  - Farmland Changes and Their Ecological Impact in the Huangshui River Basin
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Huangshui River Basin (HRB) is the main grain production and key implementation region of the "Grain for Green Program " (GGP) of Qinghai Province, and has experienced a quick urbanization during the last 20 years. Therefore, identifying the farmland change and its ecological effects is significant for farmland and ecological protection in the HRB. To this end, this study analyzed the farmland change between 2000 and 2018, based on 1 m spatial resolution farmland data visually interpreted from Google Earth high-resolution images, and then estimated its ecological impact based on the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data of MODIS, using an ecological impact index of farmland change. The study found that: (1) The farmland area in the HRB decreased from 320.15 k ha in 2000 to 245.01 k ha in 2018, reduced by 23.47% or 1.48% per year, as mainly caused by ecological restoration and built-up land occupation; (2) from 2000 to 2018, the natural environment showed a greening trend in the HRB, with the mean NDVI increasing by 0.74% per year; (3) the farmland changes had a positive ecological effect, contributing 6.67% to the regional increase in the NDVI, but had a negative impact on grain production; (4) it is suggested to strengthen farmland protection by strictly controlling the urban land occupation and over-conversion of farmland in the HRB.</p>

TI  - Multi-source hierarchical data fusion for high-resolution AOD mapping in a forest fire event
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite and ground-based remote sensing images, as well as reanalysis data, are widely used to measure and/or model aerosol properties of Earth's atmosphere. However, none of these data sources are perfect: satellite data suffer from various sources of uncertainties and data gaps; ground observations have limited spatial coverage; and reanalysis data can't provide high resolution information. In this study, we synergize these three data sources to develop a hierarchical data fusion algorithm based on the philosophy of Modified Quantile-Quantile Adjustment-Bayesian Maximum Entropy (MQQA-BME). Such efforts lead to improved data coverage, prediction accuracy, and spatiotemporal resolution simultaneously. Practical implementation of MQQA-BME was assessed by mapping the aerosol optical depth (AOD) of a forest fire event in California in November 2018. The proposed hierarchical data fusion scheme successfully synergizes the multi-source AOD data of MERRA2, GOES-16, and MAIAC, and the fused products are further calibrated using AERONET data. The estimated coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the fused data set of MEERA2_GOES_MAIAC are 0.481 and 0.084, respectively. After calibrating with AERONET AOD data, the R-2 and RMSE were improved to 0.694 and 0.072, respectively. The MQQA-BME algorithm has paved a new way to dynamically map AOD at high spatiotemporal resolution.

AB  - The essay aims to assert the presence of Shakespeare in the work of the Brazilian romantic poet Alvares de Azevedo, not only as an inevitable part of any romantic praxis, but also as one of the authors that actually grant Azevedo's work its characteristic face. Therefore, besides a brief examination of certain romantic manifestations, two paratexts will be examined in the poet's oeuvre: the famous Preface to the second part of Lira dos vinte anos and "Puff", the preface/prologue to Macario. In both texts the Elizabethan poet is the axis for an understanding of Alvares de Azevedo's worldview as of his concept of the romantic literary work.

TI  - Realized and potential efficiency for post-stratified estimation in a national forest inventory
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-stratification is often used to increase the precision of estimates arising from large-area forest inventories with plots established at permanent locations. Remotely sensed data and associated spatial products are often used for developing the post-stratification, which offers a mechanism to increase precision for less cost than increasing the sample size. While important variance reductions have been shown from post-stratification, it remains unknown where observed gains lie along the continuum of possible gains. This information is needed to determine whether efforts to further improve post-stratification outcomes are warranted. In this study, two types of optimal post-stratification were compared with typical production-based post-stratifications to estimate the magnitude of remaining gains possible. Although the optimal post-stratifications were derived using methods inappropriate for operational usage, the results indicated that substantial further increases in precision for estimates of both forest area and total tree biomass could be obtained with better post-stratifications. The potential gains differed by the attribute being estimated, the population being studied, and the number of strata. Practitioners seeking to optimize post-stratification face challenges, such as evaluation of numerous auxiliary data sources, temporal misalignment between plot observations and remotely sensed data acquisition, and spatial misalignment between plot locations and remotely sensed data due to positional errors in both data types.

TI  - Evaluating Surveillance for and Estimating Administration of Rabies Postexposure Prophylaxis in the United States, 2012-2018
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAn evaluation of postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) surveillance has not been conducted in over 10 years in the United States. An accurate assessment would be important to understand current rabies trends and inform public health preparedness and response to human rabies.Methodology/Principle findingsTo understand PEP surveillance, we sent a survey to public health leads for rabies in 50 U. S. states, Puerto Rico, Washington DC, Philadelphia, and New York City. Of leads from 54 jurisdictions, 39 (72%) responded to the survey; 12 reported having PEP-specific surveillance, five had animal bite surveillance that included data about PEP, four had animal bite surveillance without data about PEP, and 18 (46%) had neither. Although 12 jurisdictions provided data about PEP use, poor data quality and lack of national representativeness prevented use of this data to derive a national-level PEP estimate.We used national-level and state specific data from the Healthcare Cost & Utilization Project (HCUP) to estimate the number of people who received PEP based on emergency department (ED) visits. The estimated annual average of initial ED visits for PEP administration during 2012-2017 in the United States was 46,814 (SE: 1,697), costing upwards of 165 million USD. State-level ED data for initial visits for administration of PEP for rabies exposure using HCUP data was compared to state-level surveillance data from Maryland, Vermont, and Georgia between 2012-2017. In all states, state-level surveillance data was consistently lower than estimates of initial ED visits, suggesting even states with robust PEP surveillance may not adequately capture individuals who receive PEP.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that making PEP a nationally reportable condition may not be feasible. Other methods of tracking administration of PEP such as syndromic surveillance or identification of sentinel states should be considered to obtain an accurate assessment.

TI  - RELIGIOSITY AND NEW POPULISM
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Religiosity is a factor influencing political activity. Its impact may support democratic attitudes or encourage populist tendencies. Research so far has not found earlier co-occurrence of religiosity with populist attitudes in Poland. However, the social impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has made it possible to look for changes in this respect. The main social effects in the new populism dimension have involved the strengthening of existing and the emergence of new conspiracy theories. The results of our research have allowed us to positively verify the research model and confirm the conjecture that religiosity is a significant predictor of new populist attitudes, which may contribute to a change of the democratic state idea. Unlike the classical type of populism, understood as an ideology, new populism is explained in terms of worldview, helping individuals to understand the complexity of the surrounding world using functional generalisations.

TI  - Estimation of dry vegetation cover and mass from MODIS data: Verification by roughness length and sand saltation threshold
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring of dry vegetation in arid and semi-arid regions is crucial in environmental investigations such as assessments of wind erosion risk, livestock forage, and fire risk. However, there has been little research into estimating the coverage and mass of dry (non-photosynthetic) vegetation. In our study area at Tsogt-Ovoo (TsO) in the northern Gobi Desert, Mongolia, we used MODIS data to compare observed dry vegetation cover (VCd obs) and mass (M-d_obs) with values estimated from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and six other potential Short Wavelength InfraRed (SWIR) dry vegetation indices. Of the seven vegetation indices, the Soil Tillage Index (STI) and Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI), both of which are calculated from SWIR bands 6 and 7, provided good estimates of (VCd_obs) and (M-d_obs). Our comparisons of observed roughness length (z(0)) and threshold friction velocity (u*t) for sand saltation at stony and non-stony sites with dry vegetation cover determined from STI verified its suitability for estimating VCd(STI). At both sites, the observed z(0)and u(*t)increased with increasing estimated VCd(STI). Based on their relationships with STI, we predicted values of z(0)and u(*t)in the absence of dry vegetation that were in accordance with published data. The threshold wind speeds at 10 m height derived from u(*t)at both the stony and non-stony sites were reasonably close to the value that is commonly used in dust models. Thus, we verified that STI is a suitable index for estimating the amount of dry vegetation in the Gobi Desert and, potentially, in other arid and semi-arid regions. Although the relationships of z(0)and u(*t)with STI require further validation, it appears that the use of STI can improve future wind erosion risk assessments in arid and semi-arid environments.

TI  - LR-TSDet: Towards Tiny Ship Detection in Low-Resolution Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, deep learning-based methods have made great improvements in object detection in remote sensing images (RSIs). However, detecting tiny objects in low-resolution images is still challenging. The features of these objects are not distinguishable enough due to their tiny size and confusing backgrounds and can be easily lost as the network deepens or downsamples. To address these issues, we propose an effective Tiny Ship Detector for Low-Resolution RSIs, abbreviated as LR-TSDet, consisting of three key components: a filtered feature aggregation (FFA) module, a hierarchical-atrous spatial pyramid (HASP) module, and an IoU-Joint loss. The FFA module captures long-range dependencies by calculating the similarity matrix so as to strengthen the responses of instances. The HASP module obtains deep semantic information while maintaining the resolution of feature maps by aggregating four parallel hierarchical-atrous convolution blocks of different dilation rates. The IoU-Joint loss is proposed to alleviate the inconsistency between classification and regression tasks, and guides the network to focus on samples that have both high localization accuracy and high confidence. Furthermore, we introduce a new dataset called GF1-LRSD collected from the Gaofen-1 satellite for tiny ship detection in low-resolution RSIs. The resolution of images is 16m and the mean size of objects is about 10.9 pixels, which are much smaller than public RSI datasets. Extensive experiments on GF1-LRSD and DOTA-Ship show that our method outperforms several competitors, proving its effectiveness and generality.

TI  - The Annual Cycle of Terrestrial Water Storage Anomalies in CMIP6 Models Evaluated against GRACE Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) is a critical component of the global water cycle where improved spatiotemporal dynamics would enhance exploration of weather- and climate-linked processes. Thus, correctly simulating TWSA is essential not only for water-resource management but also for assessing feedbacks to climate through land-atmosphere interactions. Here we evaluate simulated TWSA from 25 climate models (from phase 6 of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project) through comparison with TWSA from GRACE satellite data (2003-14) in 14 river basins globally and assess causes of discrepancies by examining precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), and runoff (R-off) fluxes during recharge (increasing TWS) and discharge (decreasing TWS) cycles. Most models show consistent biases in seasonal amplitudes of TWS anomalies relative to GRACE output: higher modeled amplitudes in river basins in high northern latitudes and the Parana and Congo basins, and lower amplitudes in most midlatitude basins and other tropical basins. This TWSA systematic bias also exists in the previous CMIP5 simulations. Models overestimate P compared to observed P datasets in 7 out of 14 basins, which increases (decreases) seasonal storage amplitude relative to GRACE in the recharge (discharge) cycle. Overestimation (underestimation) of runoff is another common contributing factor in the discharge phase that increases (decreases) TWSA amplitudes relative to GRACE in five river basins. The results provide a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of the simulated annual range in TWSA through comparison with GRACE data that can be used to guide future model development.

TI  - Superpixel-Based Regional-Scale Grassland Community Classification Using Genetic Programming with Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands are one of the most important terrestrial ecosystems on the planet and have significant economic and ecological value. Accurate and rapid discrimination of grassland communities is critical to the conservation and utilization of grassland resources. Previous studies that explored grassland communities were mainly based on field surveys or airborne hyperspectral and high-resolution imagery. Limited by workload and cost, these methods are typically suitable for small areas. Spaceborne mid-resolution RS images (e.g., Sentinel, Landsat) have been widely used for large-scale vegetation observations owing to their large swath width. However, there still keep challenges in accurately distinguishing between different grassland communities using these images because of the strong spectral similarity of different communities and the suboptimal performance of models used for classification. To address this issue, this paper proposed a superpixel-based grassland community classification method using Genetic Programming (GP)-optimized classification model with Sentinel-2 multispectral bands, their derived vegetation indices (VIs) and textural features, and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) bands and the derived textural features. The proposed method was evaluated in the Siziwang grassland of China. Our results showed that the addition of VIs and textures, as well as the use of GP-optimized classification models, can significantly contribute to distinguishing grassland communities, and the proposed approach classified the seven communities in Siziwang grassland with an overall accuracy of 84.21% and a kappa coefficient of 0.81. We concluded that the classification method proposed in this paper is capable of distinguishing grassland communities with high accuracy at a regional scale.

TI  - Estimation of Long-Term River Discharge and Its Changes in Ungauged Watersheds in Pamir Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pamir Plateau is an extremely important water resource area for over 60 million people in Central Asia. With the increasingly significant response of water resources to climate change, timely hydrological predictions for the future supply are necessary. In the plateau, accessing and monitoring the glaciers and their melt outflow are challenging due to the harsh geographic environments. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) combined with remote sensing technologies offer great potential for providing information to improve water resources management and decision-making. In this study, we integrated UAV and satellite remote sensing data, and applied a water balance model to estimate monthly and annual river discharges for the ten river sections in the Eastern Pamir Plateau, China from 1999 to 2020. We found that the glacier area in the controlled basins of these sections has decreased by approximately 63% from 1999 to 2020. Basins with smaller glacier areas are more sensitive to climate change. The ten river sections are characterized by decreasing trends in monthly river discharge, with an average reduction of -21.05%. The annual variation of total runoff and glacial meltwater discharge is consistent with the monthly variation of discharge, and the average discharge from glacier meltwater accounts for 83% of the total runoff. We conclude that the overall decreasing trend of discharge is closely related to the recession of glaciers. Under the background of climate warming in the region, glaciers are no longer sufficient to support the increase in river discharge, which has passed its peak value and shows a decreasing trend.

TI  - Mapping and Monitoring of Land Cover/Land Use (LCLU) Changes in the Crozon Peninsula (Brittany, France) from 2007 to 2018 by Machine Learning Algorithms (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network) and by Post-classification Comparison (PCC)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover/land use (LCLU) is currently a very important topic, especially for coastal areas that connect the land and the coast and tend to change frequently. LCLU plays a crucial role in land and territory planning and management tasks. This study aims to complement information on the types and rates of LCLU multiannual changes with the distributions, rates, and consequences of these changes in the Crozon Peninsula, a highly fragmented coastal area. To evaluate the multiannual change detection (CD) capabilities using high-resolution (HR) satellite imagery, we implemented three remote sensing algorithms: a support vector machine (SVM), a random forest (RF) combined with geographic object-based image analysis techniques (GEOBIA), and a convolutional neural network (CNN), with SPOT 5 and Sentinel 2 data from 2007 and 2018. Accurate and timely CD is the most important aspect of this process. Although all algorithms were indicated as efficient in our study, with accuracy indices between 70% and 90%, the CNN had significantly higher accuracy than the SVM and RF, up to 90%. The inclusion of the CNN significantly improved the classification performance (5-10% increase in the overall accuracy) compared with the SVM and RF classifiers applied in our study. The CNN eliminated some of the confusion that characterizes a coastal area. Through the study of CD results by post-classification comparison (PCC), multiple changes in LCLU could be observed between 2007 and 2018: both the cultivated and non-vegetated areas increased, accompanied by high deforestation, which could be explained by the high rate of urbanization in the peninsula.

AB  - Few surges on the Central Tibetan Plateau have been reported. Here, we report observations of a recent surging event of the Gangjiaquba Glacier in the Geladandong Peak region using surface velocity and morphology changes that were extracted from Landsat MSS/TM/ETM+/OLI images obtained from 1973 to 2019. The results reveal that the active surge of this glacier initiated at the end of summer in 2014 and terminated in 2016. The surge resulted in a total advance of 500 +/- 11.2 m and many fresh crevasses in the surging zone. The maximum velocity was 1100 m a(-1) during the active surge phase, which is much smaller than those observed in Karakoram but similar to observations in West Kunlun.

TI  - Paddy Rice Mapping in Thailand Using Time-Series Sentinel-1 Data and Deep Learning Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The elimination of hunger is the top concern for developing countries and is the key to maintain national stability and security. Paddy rice occupies an essential status in food supply, whose accurate monitoring is of great importance for human sustainable development. As one of the most important paddy rice production countries in the world, Thailand has a favorable hot and humid climate for paddy rice growing, but the growth patterns of paddy rice are too complicated to construct promising growth models for paddy rice discrimination. To solve this problem, this study proposes a large-scale paddy rice mapping scheme, which uses time-series Sentinel-1 data to generate a convincing annual paddy rice map of Thailand. The proposed method extracts temporal statistical features of the time-series SAR images to overcome the intra-class variability due to different management practices and modifies the U-Net model with the fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) to maintain the edge of the fields. In this study, 758 Sentinel-1 images that covered the whole country from the end of 2018 to 2019 were acquired to generate the annual paddy rice map. The accuracy, precision, and recall of the resultant paddy rice map reached 91%, 87%, and 95%, respectively. Compared to SVM classifier and the U-Net model based on feature selection strategy (FS-U-Net), the proposed scheme achieved the best overall performance, which demonstrated the capability of overcoming the complex cultivation conditions and accurately identifying the fragmented paddy rice fields in Thailand. This study provides a promising tool for large-scale paddy rice monitoring in tropical production regions and has great potential in the global sustainable development of food and environment management.

TI  - Changes in the Urban Surface Thermal Environment of a Chinese Coastal City Revealed by Downscaling MODIS LST with Random Forest Algorithm
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of the formation and evolution of urban surface thermal environment is crucial for urban planning and improving the environment of a settlement. Qingdao was selected in this study as a typical coastal city undergoing rapid urbanization, and the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of its urban surface thermal environment from 2010 to 2019 were evaluated. The random forest (RF) algorithm was adopted to obtain its land surface temperature (LST) map with 30-m resolution by downscaling the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product; the remote sensing indices emphasizing different land cover types, LST calculated by the radiative transfer equation, and elevation were used as input variables in the algorithm. The heat island intensity (HII), urban heat island (UHI) volume, and UHI grade were used to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of the urban surface thermal environment in Qingdao. The results show an increasing trend in average HII between 1.1 and 2.52 degrees C in the study area over the past 10 years. The northern city appeared to have the highest UHI volume, while change of the UHI volume in Huangdao District of southwestern Qingdao was the most significant. The areas with high HII have gradually expanded during the last 10 years, and the areas with a 10-yr persistently high HII are distributed mainly in old urban areas with high building density and a dense population. Different factors may influence UHI, such as artificial heat sources, surface heat sources, and hybrid heat sources. Finally, adjusting the urban structure, increasing the vegetated area, and changing building colors are proposed to mitigate UHI in the areas with continuously high HII.

TI  - Improving Estimates of Soil Salt Content by Using Two-Date Image Spectral Changes in Yinbei, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salt content (SSC) is normally featured with obvious spatiotemporal variations in arid and semi-arid regions. Space factors such as elevation, temperature, and spatial locations are usually used as input variables for a model to estimate the SSC. However, whether temporal patterns of salt-affected soils (identified as temporal spectral patterns) can indicate the SSC level and be applied as a covariate in a model to estimate the SSC remains unclear. Hence, temporal changes in soil spectral patterns need to be characterized and explored as to their use as an input variable to improve SSC estimates. In this study, a total of 54 field samples and a time-series of Sentinel-2 multispectral images taken at monthly intervals (from October 2017 to April 2018) were collected in the Yinbei area of western China. Then, two-date satellite images were used to quantify significant spectral changes over time using spectral change vector analysis, and four two-date-based index methods were used to characterize soil spectral changes. Lastly, the optimal two-date-based spectral indices and multispectral bands were used as input variables to build the estimation models using a random forest algorithm. Results showed that the two-date-based spectral index could be applied as an input variable to improve the accuracy of SSC estimation at a regional scale. Temporal changes in salt-induced spectral patterns can be indicated by the band difference in the wavelength range from 400 nm to 900 nm. Three two-date-based indices designated as D-28a (i.e., the band difference between band 2 from an image acquired in April 2018 and band 8a from an image acquired in December 2017), D-22, and D-28 were the optimal parameters for characterizing salt-induced spectral changes, which were dominated by the total brightness, chloride, and sulfate accumulation of the soils. The model did not yield satisfactory estimation results (RPD = 1.49) when multispectral bands were used as the input variables. Multispectral bands coupled with two two-date-based indices (D-22 and D-28a) used as the input variables produced the best estimation result (R-2 = 0.92, RPD = 3.27). Incorporating multispectral bands and two-date-based indices into the random forest model provides a remotely-sensed strategy that effectively supports the monitoring of soil salt content.</p>

Although extensive classification efforts have been exerted based on the terrain factor, the scale analysis to describe the macro and micro landform features still needs standard measurement. To obtain the appropriate analysis scale of landform structure feature, and then carry out landform classification using the terrain texture, the texture feature is introduced for reflecting landform spatial differentiation and homogeneity. First, applying the ALOS World 3D-30m (AW3D30) DEM and selecting typical landforms of the southwest Tibet Plateau, the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), which acts as the texture feature analysis method, is executed to dissect the multiscale structural features of the terrain texture. Second, through the structural indices of reconstructed texture images, the optimum decomposition scale of DWT is confirmed. Under these circumstances, wavelet coefficients and wavelet energy entropy are extracted as texture features. Finally, the random forest (RF) method is utilized to classify the landform. Results indicate that the texture feature of DWT can achieve higher classification accuracy, which increases by approximately 11.8% compared with the gray co-occurrence matrix (GLCM).</p>

TI  - Dynamics of Vegetation Greenness and Its Response to Climate Change in Xinjiang over the Past Two Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has proven to have a profound impact on the growth of vegetation from various points of view. Understanding how vegetation changes and its response to climatic shift is of vital importance for describing their mutual relationships and projecting future land-climate interactions. Arid areas are considered to be regions that respond most strongly to climate change. Xinjiang, as a typical dryland in China, has received great attention lately for its unique ecological environment. However, comprehensive studies examining vegetation change and its driving factors across Xinjiang are rare. Here, we used the remote sensing datasets (MOD13A2 and TerraClimate) and data of meteorological stations to investigate the trends in the dynamic change in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and its response to climate change from 2000 to 2019 across Xinjiang based on the Google Earth platform. We found that the increment rates of growth-season mean and maximum NDVI were 0.0011 per year and 0.0013 per year, respectively, by averaging all of the pixels from the region. The results also showed that, compared with other land use types, cropland had the fastest greening rate, which was mainly distributed among the northern Tianshan Mountains and Southern Junggar Basin and the northern margin of the Tarim Basin. The vegetation browning areas primarily spread over the Ili River Valley where most grasslands were distributed. Moreover, there was a trend of warming and wetting across Xinjiang over the past 20 years; this was determined by analyzing the climate data. Through correlation analysis, we found that the contribution of precipitation to NDVI (R-2 = 0.48) was greater than that of temperature to NDVI (R-2 = 0.42) throughout Xinjiang. The Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) was also computed to better investigate the correlation between climate change and vegetation growth in arid areas. Our results could improve the local management of dryland ecosystems and provide insights into the complex interaction between vegetation and climate change.

TI  - Expansion and Evolution of a Typical Resource-Based Mining City in Transition Using the Google Earth Engine: A Case Study of Datong, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China's resource-based cities have made tremendous contributions to national and local economic growth and urban development over the last seven decades. Recently, such cities have been in transition from resource-centered development towards human-oriented urbanization to meet the requirements of long-term sustainability for the natural environment and human society. A good understanding of urban expansion and evolution as a consequence of urbanization has important implications for future urban and regional planning. Using a series of remote sensing (RS) images and geographical information system (GIS)-based spatial analyses, this research explores how a typical resource-based mining city, Datong, has expanded and evolved over the last two decades (2000-2018), with a reflection on the role of urban planning and development policies in driving the spatial transformation of Datong. The RS images were provided and processed by the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Spatial cluster analysis approaches were employed to examine the spatial patterns of urban expansion. The results indicate that the area of urban construction land increased by 132.6% during the study period, mainly along with the Chengqu District, the Mining Area, and in the southeast of the Nanjiao District, where most new towns are located. Reflection on the factors that influence urban expansion shows that terrain, urban planning policies, and social economy are driving Datong's urban development.

TI  - Contribution of Biophysical Factors to Regional Variations of Evapotranspiration and Seasonal Cooling Effects in Paddy Rice in South Korea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have observed seasonal cooling effects in paddy rice as compared to temperate forest through enhanced evapotranspiration (ET) in Northeast Asia, while rare studies have revealed biophysical factors responsible for spatial variations of ET and its cooling effects. In this study, we adopted a data fusion method that integrated MODIS 8-day surface reflectance products, gridded daily climate data of ground surface, and a remote sensing pixel-based Penman-Monteith ET model (i.e., the RS-PM model) to quantify ET patterns of paddy rice in South Korea from 2011 to 2014. Results indicated that the regional variations of the rice-growing season ET (RGS-ET, the sum of daily ET from the season onset of rapid canopy expansion (SoS) to the end of the rice-growing season (EGS)) were primarily influenced by phenological factors (i.e., the length of growing period-LGP), followed by growing season mean climatic factors (i.e., vapor pressure deficit-VPD, and air temperature). For regional variations of the paddy field ET (PF-ET, the sum of daily ET from the field flooding and transplanting date detected by satellite observations (FFTDsat) to SoS, and to EGS), the extents were substantially reduced, only accounting for 54% of the RGS-ET variations. The FFTDsat and SoS were considered critical for the reduced PF-ET variations. In comparison to the temperate forest, changes in monthly ground surface air temperature (T-s) in paddy fields showed the V-shaped seasonal pattern with significant cooling effects found in late spring and early summer, primarily due to a large decline in daytime T-s that exceeded the nighttime warming. Bringing FFTDsat towards late spring and early summer was identified as vital field management practices, causing significant declines in daytime T-s due to enhanced ET. Results highlighted climate-warming mitigation by paddy fields due to early flooding practices.

TI  - Combining UAV and Landsat data to assess glacier changes on the central Tibetan Plateau
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, researchers have focused on the applications of uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) in environmental remote sensing tasks. However, studies on glacier monitoring using UAV technology are relatively scarce, especially for high mountain glacier monitoring. To explore the feasibility of UAV technology for high mountain glaciers, four UAV surveys were deployed on two glaciers of the central Tibetan Plateau. Based on the images retrieved by UAV in 2017 and 2019, orthomosaics and digital elevation models were produced to quantify the length, area and elevation changes in the ablation zone of these two glaciers at different times. Additionally, we utilized several Landsat scenes to derive glacier changes over the last 30 years and combined these with the UAV data to assess the advantages and disadvantages of UAV technology in mountain glacier monitoring.

TI  - High-altitude meteorology of Indian Himalayan Region: complexities, effects, and resolutions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalaya, by virtue of its location and stupendous height, acts as a great climatic divide and regulates meteorological conditions in the subcontinent regions of South Asia. However, the associated complexities and their effects are yet to be resolved to understand the meteorology of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). In this review volume, we synthesize the results and inferences of several studies carried out in the IHR using in situ data, remotely sensed data, and model-based meteorological observations. Results provide insights into climate change, scientific gaps, and their causes in deciphering meteorological observations from the last century to recent decades and envisage impacts of climate change on water reservoirs in the future. Warming trend of air temperature, in contrast to global temperature, has been projected in recent decades (after 1990) with a greater warming rate in the maximum temperature than the minimum temperature. This drifting of air temperature from the beginning of last century accelerates the diurnal temperature range of the Himalayas. An elevation-dependent warming trend is mostly perceived in the northwest Himalayan region, implicating an increased warming rate in the Greater Himalaya as compared to the lower and Karakoram Himalaya. No definite trends of precipitation have been observed over different regions of the IHR, suggesting heterogeneous cryosphere-climate interaction between western and central Himalaya. In this review, we have tried to emphasize to the scientific community and policy-makers for enhancing the knowledge of physical and dynamical processes associated with meteorological parameters in the Himalayan terrain.

TI  - Glacier classification from Sentinel-2 imagery using spatial-spectral attention convolutional model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers are critical components of the cryosphere and most sources of water. The Sentinel-2 imagery provides an efficient and cost-effective way for the production of inventories of glaciers. Efficient conventional glacial methods can overcome the drawbacks of manual interpretation by generating glacier maps in a fast and accurate manner. However, these methods are difficult to obtain discriminative spatial-spectral features, so that it is difficult capture the subtle differences between glaciers and surrounding material on Sentinel-2 imagery. In this paper, a novel spatial-spectral attention neural network approach, which integrates a novel spatial-spectral attention module with UNet architecture, is designed for better addressing these challenges in glacier mapping. The proposed approach builds an interdependencies between spatial-spectral domains via adaptively recalibrating the weighs of spatial-spectral features for each pixel, which is benefit to highlight the difference between glaciers and surroundings. The proposed module is effectively integrated in UNet architecture, and the optimal model overcomes the noise effect on Sentinel-2 imagery, which outperforms the original UNet approach about 1 percent. The result indicates that a consistent improvement of glacier feature extraction. Furthermore, the proposed approach is compared with several existing glacier mapping algorithm, and results demonstrate that the proposed approach has stronger generalization ability and can obtain satisfactory accuracy for glacier mapping with test accuracy about 98.61%.

TI  - Accurate Wheat Lodging Extraction from Multi-Channel UAV Images Using a Lightweight Network Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of wheat lodging is of great significance to post-disaster agricultural production management, disaster assessment and insurance subsidies. At present, the recognition of lodging wheat in the actual complex field environment still has low accuracy and poor real-time performance. To overcome this gap, first, four-channel fusion images, including RGB and DSM (digital surface model), as well as RGB and ExG (excess green), were constructed based on the RGB image acquired from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Second, a Mobile U-Net model that combined a lightweight neural network with a depthwise separable convolution and U-Net model was proposed. Finally, three data sets (RGB, RGB + DSM and RGB + ExG) were used to train, verify, test and evaluate the proposed model. The results of the experiment showed that the overall accuracy of lodging recognition based on RGB + DSM reached 88.99%, which is 11.8% higher than that of original RGB and 6.2% higher than that of RGB + ExG. In addition, our proposed model was superior to typical deep learning frameworks in terms of model parameters, processing speed and segmentation accuracy. The optimized Mobile U-Net model reached 9.49 million parameters, which was 27.3% and 33.3% faster than the FCN and U-Net models, respectively. Furthermore, for RGB + DSM wheat lodging extraction, the overall accuracy of Mobile U-Net was improved by 24.3% and 15.3% compared with FCN and U-Net, respectively. Therefore, the Mobile U-Net model using RGB + DSM could extract wheat lodging with higher accuracy, fewer parameters and stronger robustness.

TI  - An Algorithm for the Retrieval of High Temporal-Spatial Resolution Shortwave Albedo from Landsat-8 Surface Reflectance and MODIS BRDF
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Variations in surface physicochemical properties and spatial structures can prominently transform surface albedo which conversely influence surface energy balances and global climate, making it crucial to continuously monitor and quantify surface dynamics at fine scales. Here, we made two improvements to propose an algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of 30-m Landsat albedo, based on the coupling of Landsat-8 and MODIS BRDF. First, two kinds of prior knowledge were added to disaggregate BRDF, including the Anisotropic Flat Index (AFX) and the Albedo-to-Nadir reflectance ratio (AN ratio), from MODIS scales into Landsat scales. Second, a simplified data fusion method was used to simulate albedo for the same, subsequent, or antecedent dates. Finally, we validated the reliability and correlations of the algorithm at six sites of the Surface Radiation (SURFRAD) budget network and intercompared the results with another algorithm called the 'concurrent approach'. The results showed that the proposed algorithm had favorable usability and robustness, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.015 (8%) and a mean bias of -0.005; while the concurrent approach had a RMSE of 0.026 (14%) and a mean bias of -0.018. The results emphasized that the proposed algorithm has captured subtle changes in albedo over a 16-day period.</p>

TI  - AGTOC: A novel approach to winter wheat mapping by automatic generation of training samples and one-class classification on Google Earth Engine
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely acquisition of crop spatial distribution is a prerequisite for growth monitoring and yield forecasting. Currently, the automatic acquisition of crop distribution at large scales is still a challenge due to the time-consuming processing of remotely sensed imagery and manual collection of sufficient training samples. Although the advent of cloud computing platforms has proved to improve the efficiency and automation of crop type classification, how to obtain sufficient training samples in an efficient and cost-effective way remains unclear. In this research, we developed a new approach integrating the automatic generation of training samples and one-class machine learning classification (AGTOC) for mapping winter wheat over Jiangsu Province, China on Google Earth Engine (GEE). After extracting spatial objects from Sentinel-2 imagery in the season of 2017-2018, this method performed recognition of winter wheat objects based on the unique phenology and spectral features of winter wheat. Then the generated winter wheat objects were further refined and regarded as training samples for provincial winter wheat classification with one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). Furthermore, the transferability of AGTOC was evaluated by applying the classification approach to different seasons (2016-2017 & 2019-2020) and a different sensor (Landsat-8 OLI). According to independent ground truth data, the winter wheat mapping with AGTOC achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.61%. When compared with agricultural census data, the winter wheat area accounted for 99% and 90% of the variability at the municipal and county levels. Furthermore, the OA achieved 88.94% and 90.17% while transferring the AGTOC from 2017-2018 to 2016-2017 and 2019-2020. The transferability of the AGTOC model to Landsat-8 OLI imagery of the same season yielded an OA of 85.98%. These results demonstrated that AGTOC exhibited high efficiency and accuracy across the province, different seasons and sensors without the need of extensive field visits for training sample collection. This proposed approach has great potential in the automatic mapping of winter wheat on GEE at country or global levels.

TI  - On the Mutual Interference Between Spaceborne SARs: Modeling, Characterization, and Mitigation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the radio spectrum available to spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is restricted to certain limited frequency intervals, there are many different spaceborne SAR systems sharing common frequency bands. Due to this reason, it is reported that two spaceborne SARs at orbit cross positions can potentially cause severe mutual interference. Specifically, the transmitting signal of an SAR, typically linear frequency modulated (LFM), can be directly received by the side or back lobes of another SAR's antenna, causing radiometric artifacts in the focused image. This article tries to model and characterize the artifacts and study efficient methods for mitigating them. To this end, we formulate an analytical model for describing the artifact, which reveals that the mutual interference can introduce a 2-D LFM radiometric artifact in image domain with a limited spatial extent. We show that the artifact is low-rank based on a range-azimuth decoupling analysis and 2-D high-order Taylor expansion. Based on the low-rank model, we show that two methods, i.e., principal component analysis and its robust variant, can be adopted to efficiently mitigate the artifact via processing in the image domain. The former method has the advantage of fast processing speed, for example, a subswath of Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath image can be processed within 70 s via blockwise processing, whereas the latter provides improved accuracy for sparse pointlike scatterers. Experiment results demonstrate that the radiometric artifacts caused by mutual interference in Sentinel-1 level-1 images can be efficiently mitigated via the proposed methods.

TI  - A deep learning method to predict soil organic carbon content at a regional scale using satellite-based phenology variables
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining the spatial distribution information of soil organic carbon (SOC) is significant to quantify the carbon budget and guide land management for migrating carbon emissions. Digital soil mapping of SOC at a regional scale is challenging due to the complex SOC-environment relationships. Vegetation phenology that directly indicates a long time vegetation growth characteristics can be potential environmental covariates for SOC prediction. Deep learning has been developed for soil mapping recently due to its ability of constructing high-level features from the raw data. However, only dozens of predictors were used in most of those studies. It is not clear that how deep learning with long term land surface phenology product performs for SOC prediction at a regional scale. This paper explored the effectiveness of ten-years MODIS MCD12Q2 phenology variables for SOC prediction with a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in Anhui province, China. Random forest (RF) was applied to compare with CNN using three groups of environmental variables. The results showed that adding the land surface phenology variables into the pool of the natural environmental variables improved the prediction accuracy of CNN by 5.57% of RMSE and 31.29% of R-2. Adding phenology variables obtained a higher accuracy improvement than adding Normalized Differences Vegetation Indices. The CNN obtained a higher prediction accuracy than RF regardless of using which group of variables. This study proved that land surface phenology metrics were effective predictors and CNN was a promising method for soil mapping at a regional scale.

TI  - Satellite observed rapid green fodder expansion in northeastern Tibetan Plateau from 2010 to 2019
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The livestock product consumption per capita in China has almost doubled in the past three decades. The planting of green fodder has increased in the agropastoral ecotone of China to meet the increasing demand for livestock feed, and the green fodder expansion can have subsequent consequences on the environment. However, information on the area and distribution of green fodder is very limited. Here, we developed a pixel- and phenology-based algorithm to map green fodder and track its dynamics in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau, a typical alpine pasture region in China, using all the available Landsat images and Google Earth Engine (GEE). We developed a simple approach for the rapid identification of green fodder fields by using a new green fodder index that considers the unique phenology of green fodder, which has higher greenness and water content in the late growing season than other vegetation. A total of 858 Landsat images were used to generate green fodder maps in northeastern Tibetan Plateau (including Zeku, Guinan, and Tongde Counties) in three periods (circa 2010, 2015, and 2019). The overall accuracies of our green fodder maps were 93-97% and the Matthews correlation coefficients were 0.76-0.83. We found a rapid expansion of green fodder from 16.3 km(2) in 2010 to 136.1 km(2) in 2019. Newly cultivated green fodder occurred in both existing croplands and natural grasslands. Our study demonstrated the potential of the phenology-based approach, all the available Landsat images, and GEE for tracing the historical dynamics of green fodder at 30-m resolution in alpine regions. Our findings advance our understanding of changes in forage area, production, the supply-demand gap, and the ecological and climatic consequences of green fodder expansion.

TI  - Factors Affecting COVID-19 Transmission and Modelling of Close Contact Tracing Strategies
T2  - IRANIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Close contact tracing is an essential measure that countries are applying to combat the epidemic of COVID-19. The purpose of contact tracing is to rapidly identify potentially infected individuals and prevent further spread of the disease. In this study, based on the factors affecting the COVID-19 transmission, a scoring protocol is provided for close contact tracing.Methods: First, the factors affecting the COVID-19 transmission in close contacts were identified by a rapid review of the literature. Data were gathered by searching the Embase, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus databases. Then, by formulating and scoring the identified factors with two sessions of the expert panel, close contact transmission risk score determined, and a protocol for contacts tracing was designed.Results: Close contact transmission risk depends on the contact environment characteristics, the infectivity (virus shedding) of the sentinel case, and contact characteristics. Based on these factors, the close contact transmission risk score and contact tracing protocol were prepared.Conclusion: The close contact transmission risk scores will provide the ability to contact classifications and developing specific tracing strategies for them. Given that there are not any specific treatments for COVID-19 and lack of universal vaccination, applying nonpharmaceutical measures such as contact tracing along with physical distancing is very crucial. Therefore, we recommended this model to the evaluation of exposure risk and contact tracing.

T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrous Ca-sulfates, gypsum and bassanite, have been detected on Mars using both visible/near-infrared (VNIR) remote sensing measurements and in-situ rover-based mineralogical measurements. Understanding the distributions and abundances of minerals on the Martian surface from remote sensing data is important in evaluating ancient Martian environments. Optical constants are critical input parameters in radiative transfer theory, which allows for the extraction of mineral abundances from a mixture spectrum. We have derived VNIR (0.35-2.5 mu m, at 10 nm spectral sampling) optical constants of gypsum and bassanite powders using radiative transfer theory and laboratory reflectance spectra of separated size fractions as well as multiple phase angles. In addition, the MIR (2.5-25 mu m, or 4,000-400 cm(-1), at 2 cm(-1) spectral sampling) orientation averaged optical constants of gypsum and bassanite were generated using the classical Lorentz-Lorenz dispersion theory. We compare the optical constants of gypsum derived in this work with previously published estimates and note both similarities and differences. The optical constants derived in this work will assist in modeling VNIR reflectance spectra and quantifying mineral abundances from mineral mixtures.

TI  - Indigenous forest classification in New Zealand-A comparison of classifiers and sensors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the composition and the changes of New Zealand's woody vegetation communities is important for effective management. However, past national-scale mapped classifications emphasised mature rather than seral vegetation communities and forests were mapped in relative coarse spatial resolution. The integration of Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery provides an opportunity for forest mapping with low cost and high accuracy.This study aims to investigate the feasibility of the integrated image for detailed forest mapping. Free satellite data (Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, fused data) were compared with commercial data (WorldView-2, and WorldView-2 resampled to Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope spatial resolutions) by conducting pixel-based classification with three machine learning classifiers (Support Vector Machine radial basis function kernel, Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network). The combinations of imagery type and classifier were assessed on their potential for mapping nine land cover classes in podocarp forest in New Zealand's central north island, including: conifer, low layer vegetation, broadleaf evergreen, highland softwood, wetland vegetation, water, dead tree, lowland softwood, and low-density vegetation and bare soil. Spectral features (single bands and indices), textural features, and an 8 m resolution digital terrain model (DTM) were used in classifications; the relative importance of these input features was also assessed.In this study, it was found that the overall classification accuracy was dependent on the combination of classifier and imagery, with different combinations resulting in a range of accuracies between 0.669 and 0.956. The best overall accuracy was achieved by integrating Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope imagery (0.956) which was even greater than that of WorldView-2 (0.951). The digital terrain model was the most important feature for all scenarios; Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix-Mean was the most important texture variable for WorldView-2 and integrated images. Original bands, as well as GI, Norm-G, and SR-NIRR, were also crucial for vegetation classification.

TI  - Optical Thickness Calculation Method of Cirrus Based on MODIS Parameters
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cirrus optical thickness is one of the cloud optical parameters that have great influence on global climate and earth radiation budget. In military, atmospheric science and other fields, there is a wide demand for cirrus optical parameter solving algorithm. Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data is used to solve cirrus parameters, and satellite multi-channel data is mostly used, so the data processing process is relatively complex. The RT3 model combined with MODIS cloud parameters was proposed to simulate and calculate cirrus reflectance, and a cirrus optical thickness lookup table was established. A simple algorithm was designed to achieve effective inversion of cirrus optical thickness. The correlation coefficient between the inversion results of cirrus optical thickness and the actual data measured by MODIS is 0.97, which verifies the reliability of cirrus optical thickness inversion. By selecting MODIS data at different time periods, the variation of cirrus optical thickness in different time and space ranges is analyzed, and the average error is less than 0. 16, which further verifies the effectiveness of the RT3 model-based lookup table for inversion of cirrus optical thickness. The results are helpful to realize simple and effective inversion of cirrus optical properties worldwide.

TI  - Edge-Preserving Denoising of Image Sequences
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - To monitor the Earth's surface, the satellite of the NASA Landsat program provides us image sequences of any region on the Earth constantly over time. These image sequences give us a unique resource to study the Earth's surface, changes of the Earth resource over time, and their implications in agriculture, geology, forestry, and more. Besides natural sciences, image sequences are also commonly used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of medical studies for understanding the functioning of brains and other organs. In practice, observed images almost always contain noise and other contaminations. For a reliable subsequent image analysis, it is important to remove such contaminations in advance. This paper focuses on image sequence denoising, which has not been well-discussed in the literature yet. To this end, an edge-preserving image denoising procedure is suggested. The suggested method is based on a jump-preserving local smoothing procedure, in which the bandwidths are chosen such that the possible spatio-temporal correlations in the observed image intensities are accommodated properly. Both theoretical arguments and numerical studies show that this method works well in the various cases considered.</p>

TI  - Effects of Urbanization on Landscape Patterns in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River Region
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The middle reaches of the Yangtze River region (MRYRR) are China's first trans-regional urban agglomeration, located in the center of the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The MRYRR is an important ecological reserve, and its land cover changes are affected by both socio-economic development and geographical environment. In this paper, Landsat ETM/TM/OLI remote sensing images were used to monitor land use and landscape patterns from 1990 to 2015. Through supervised classification, land use transfer matrix, landscape pattern metrics and correlation analysis, the spatial-temporal patterns of land use change and its relationship with socio-economic in the study area were revealed. The results showed that: (1) the main land use types in the study area were cropland (CL) and forestland (FL), accounting for more than three-quarters of the study area. During the study period, built-up land (BL) increased, CL decreased, FL increased first and then decreased; (2) the BL expanded mainly by occupying CL and FL, and regional landscape pattern was gradually fragmented, with complex patch shape and increasing diversity and heterogeneity. Among them, the BL is gradually gathered, and the FL and CL are gradually fragmented; (3) in the past 25 years, the urbanization process in this region has been obvious, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has increased by 36 times. The socioeconomic variables were positively correlated with BL, orchard (OL) and Shannon diversity index (SHID), and negatively correlated with CL, Wasteland (WL), mean patch size (MPS) and contagion size (CONTAG). The results showed that the urbanization development has a great impact on the region, and the ecological protection task is still challenging. It is necessary to protect high-quality cropland and draw a red line for ecological protection. We should strengthen the construction of ecological corridors and ecological nodes to adapt to regional sustainable development.

TI  - Long-term Landsat monitoring of mining subsidence based on spatiotemporal variations in soil moisture: A case study of Shanxi Province, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground subsidence caused by mining activities has extensively and chronically affected people living near mining areas. Remote sensing images provide temporally and spatially continuous observations of surface natural resources. In order to accurately understand and continuously observe subsidence areas, this study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of mining subsidence using long-term Landsat time-series. The study area was a typical mining region in Shanxi Province, China, with a long history of mining activity. Landsat images from 1986 to 2019, as well as reference data, were used to construct inter-annual time-series trajectories of soil moisture, which were derived from spatial normalizations of the soil moisture monitoring index(SSMMI). The LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform was then used to extract the subsidence areas and their spatiotemporal dynamics. The results indicate that (i)the map of the spatial distributions of mining subsidence had an overall accuracy of 83.8% and indicate that areas that underwent subsidence were mainly concentrated in mining cites(including Taiyuan, Lvliang, and Linfen); (ii)subsidence before 1990 accounted for 39.6% of the total occurrences and a large proportion(45.18%) of the subsidence was short-term; (iii)subsidence in mountain areas that have long histories of mining and long subsidence durations require further attention by researchers. This study allows us to advance the long-term monitoring of mining subsidence times using variations in soil moisture, combined with moderate resolution satellite data such as Landsat and time-series analysis algorithms.

TI  - Predicting the abundance of copper in soil using reflectance spectroscopy and GF5 hyperspectral imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metals in soil are harmful environmental pollutants due to their toxicity and copper (Cu) is a key indicator. Detecting and mapping the distribution of soil property using remote sensing technique is cost-effective. In this study, GF5 hyperspectral data and field spectroscopy were used to estimate soil Cu concentration of the farmland soils around the tailing reservoir of Tongkuangyu Copper deposit, Shanxi Province, China. Sixty-six soil samples were collected and their reflectance spectra were measured for modeling the relationship between Cu concentration in soil and visible-shortwave infrared reflectance (VIS-SWIR) reflectance data. Spectral index (2209 nm/907 nm) was found sensitive to Cu contents in soil and prediction was conducted by piecewise partial least square regression (P-PLSR). The coefficient of determination (R-2) and residual prediction deviation (RPD) of the model developed from laboratory soil spectra were 0.89 and 2.81. The model was then applied to the GF5 satellite hyperspectral data and the spatial distribution of Cu content was mapped with acceptable accuracy R-2 (0.83) and RPD (1.56). The result confirms that it is feasible to use satellite data to map soil copper anomaly quantitatively with simple spectral index. The study also demonstrates that GF5 hyperspectral data, due to its high spectral resolution (4-7 nm), good signal-to-noise ratio (SNR 200:1-100:1) and large swath coverage (60 km), can provide an alternative data source for quick and large-scale environment monitoring to support soil remediation policies.

TI  - Water clarity changes in Lake Taihu over 36 years based on Landsat TM and OLI observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The water quality in Lake Taihu, which is located in the middle of the largest group of cities on the Yangtze River delta of China, has changed greatly with rapid economic and social development since the reform and opening up of China in the 1980s. Here, Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI satellites launched in 1984 and 2013 were used to track 36-year changes in Secchi disk depth (Z(sd)), which is a key water quality and lake health indicator. First, the quasi-analytical algorithm (QAA)-based Zsd estimation model and commonly used empirical models were calibrated using in situ measured Z(sd) and TM/OLI band-simulated remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) obtained from 299 sampling points in 12 field cruises in Lake Taihu. Afterward, another 69 pairs of in situ measured Z(sd) data synchronized with TM images and 40 pairs of in situ measured Z(sd) data synchronized with OLI images were used to validate the calibrated Z(sd) estimation models. For the QAA-based method, which has been successfully applied to OLI data, we developed an approach for modeling the R-rs in the missing 443-nm band in TM using a virtual band estimator algorithm; this enables the application of the method to TM data. By comparing with other calibrated empirical models, the accuracy of the QAA-based model was determined to be high for both OLI and TM, with an average unbiased relative error of < 24%. Second, we employed the QAA-based model to retrieve the spatial and temporal Z(sd) variation characteristics of Lake Taihu from 1984 to 2019, and analyzed the driving factors. The results suggest an increase in Z(sd) from 1984 to 1998, which was mainly caused by a decrease in wind speed. There was a turning point for Z(sd) changes around 1998, with a downtrend from 1999 to 2019, which was primarily attributed to increase in the frequency and area of cyanobacterial blooms associated with the low average wind speed and increasing air temperatures. This study provides the first analysis of the spatial and temporal characteristics of Z(sd) in Lake Taihu over the past 36 years, and the Z(sd) results and driving force analyses could facilitate local water resource conservation.

TI  - All-sky total and direct surface Shortwave Downward Radiation (SWDR) estimation from satellite: Applications to MODIS and Himawari-8
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The earth's surface shortwave downward radiation (SWDR), which is generally defined as the sum of the incoming solar energy over the earth's surface in the shortwave spectrum (0.3-3.0 mu m), is a key component of the surface radiation budget (SRB). Spatiotemporally continuous SWDR is needed because it is one of the required parameters driving many land models and applications. In this study, a look-up table (LUT)-based, easyto-use approach to derive all-sky total and direct surface SWDR is proposed. The only inputs for the new approach include solar and observing angles, blue band radiance, elevation, and surface climatological albedo. The applications of the new method to both Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Himawari8 measurements are presented, and validation versus ground measurements from 21 sites shows that both the instantaneous and daily SWDR can be accurately derived from the above-mentioned method. A further comparison with the Himawari-8 L2 SWDR product reveals that our newly proposed method performs better, with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 91.77 (13.99) W/m(2) and a bias of -3.91 (-1.55) W/m(2) for the instantaneous (daily) total SWDR. The simplicity and reliable accuracy of the new approach make it suitable for producing all-sky surface total and direct SWDR from space-based measurements at the globe scale.

TI  - High-resolution sea level change around China seas revealed through multi-satellite altimeter data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level change is not uniform across the oceans and high-resolution sea level trend (SLT) models reveal that the rate of sea level change differs between different waters. In this study, we developed a new method for obtaining a high-resolution, 1'x1'-grid SLT model, using the time-varying mean sea surface (MSS) of several MSSs calculated from averaged multi-satellite-derived sea surface heights (TOPEX/Poseidon, Jason-1/2/3, ERS-1/2, Envisat, GFO, Cryosat-2, SARAL/AltiKa, Sentinel-3A, HY-2A) over different periods. We applied this model to estimate the mean sea level change in the China seas and their adjacent ocean (0 degrees-41 degrees N, 100 degrees-140 degrees E). This new model revealed the patterning of sea level change within the study region in detail, and detected a sea level change dipole south of Japan. A zonal SLT pattern was identified in three regions: the region of the North Pacific Subtropical Counter Current (an eastward current located in the band of 19.5 degrees-22.5 degrees N, populated with eddies), and the areas east of Taiwan and east of Luzon Island. Moreover, the rate of sea level rise in the offshore zone was found to be similar to 0.67 mm/yr (20%) higher than that in the open ocean. This finding has important implications for coastal protection.

TI  - Dynamics of Egg Parasitoids of Chilo suppressalis and Its Response to Landscape Structure in Northern Jiangxi.
T2  - Chinese Journal of Biological Control
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the bio-control roles of egg parasitoids on rice striped stemborer (SSB) Chilo suppressalis in Southern rice planting areas, we evaluated the dynamics of egg parasitoids and its responses to different landscape structure. Potted rice plant, detached fresh rice leaf, and filter paper with SSB egg mass were compared for their efficiency as sentinel eggs. Field parasitism dynamics of egg parasitoids were investigated using potted rice plants with egg masses in different seasons. Further, parasitism of egg parasitoids in different landscape was investigated on May 6th, July 1st and September 7th using potted rice plants with egg masses for analysis of the relationship between parasitism rate and landscape variables at five different spatial scales (0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 km radius). The results showed that potted rice plants with SSB eggs were the best as sentinel eggs, seconded by detached fresh rice leaves with SSB eggs. Field parasitism was very low on early rice, significantly increased on middle rice, peaking at 66.7% on middle July. After late August, the parasitism rate on late season rice decreased gradually. A close relationship was detected between forest area and egg parasitism rate at 1.5 km scale. When the proportion of forest area was less than 40%, parasitism rate decreased with the increasing of forest area. In contrast, when forest area was more than 40%, parasitism rate increased with the increase of forest area. In conclusion, although proportion of forest area is related to the parasitism rate of C. suppressalis eggs, however, the related effect is not a linear response. The results of this study provide a simple and effective method for evaluation of egg parasitoids of C. suppressalis in Southern rice region, and serve as a reference for the development of integrated pest management strategies by using egg parasitoids of C. suppressalis.

TI  - Vladimir Solovyov - the First Symbolist or the Last Romantic? (Aesthetic Views and Creative Model)
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the problem polemic for Solovyov studies and related to the nature of the artistic world of Solovyov the writer. The aim of the research is to study the nature of Solovyov's artistic consciousness and method, to identify the degree of reflection of romantic and symbolist creative paradigms in them. Based on the material of philosophical and aesthetic, poetic, prose, dramatic, literary and critical works of Solovyov, the author of the article proves that Solovyov was a romantic in worldview, type of artistic consciousness, artistic method, although his works show separate features of realistic and symbolist creative paradigms. The research is carried out in the traditions of comparative literature studies (A.N. Veselovsky, V.M. Zhirmunsky, A.N. Nikolyukin, and others), which explore continuity in literature of various historical and literary epochs, the perception, assimilation, and transformation of separate ideas and features of poetics. Historical-genetic and comparative-typological approaches in Solovyov studies allow identifying the genetic and typological essence of the writer's artistic world, more accurately determining its place in the historical-literary process. In the course of the research, the author analyzes the characteristics of Solovyov' s worldview; his aesthetic views, nature of relationship with the reader, and means of artistic expression; the plots, artistic types, techniques, language repeated in his writings. The author of the article comes to the conclusion that the artistic world of Solovyov was built with a focus on romantic principles of perception and reflection of reality. At the same time, the romanticism of the late 19th century in Russian literature was significantly different from its classical version, actively absorbing the features of literary phenomena of a different artistic nature (primarily symbolism). Hence is the misleading external similarity between the artistic texts of Solovyov and the symbolists, which in reality is combined with significant, fundamental differences. Solovyov was close to the symbolists ideologically as much as the aesthetic programs of romanticists and symbolists were close. At the same time, he could never accept orientation to the chosen artistic layers, the "own" reader, the demonstrative freedom from religious and spiritual principles, the inadequacy of the author and his or her mask, the cult of art going so far as to deny not only high ideological content, but also any semantic coherence. Solovyov, who shaped as a writer on the aesthetic principles of his century, always proceeded from the idea of a special spiritual mission of a poet, the inseparability of the author and the work. Remaining a romanticist throughout his work, using romantic figurativeness, developing romantic themes, following the romantic project of dialogue with a reader, he combined all this with a realistic attitude to the depicted reality (desire to influence it) and with symbolist techniques (symbolism, understatement).

AB  - The range of natural environmental degradation caused by anthropogenic activity may include geomorphological forms such as dunes resulting from the build-up activity of the wind. In effect, such environmental transformation affects changes connected not only with their relief, but also with the presence and health of diverse plant and animal inhabitants. The subject of the survey was a parabolic dune with asymmetric shape, the sand of which was subjected to exploitation over many years. Terrain data acquired by means of GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) served to elaborate the present relief of the surveyed dune and to reconstruct its primary relief. These were mainly places where the impacts of human activities were recorded. For this purpose, ordinary kriging (OK) estimation was performed. Simultaneously, satellite data and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) imaging were acquired, and subjected to image fusion in order to acquire near infrared bands (NIR), red, green, blue in high spatial resolution. These in turn were applied so as to estimate the condition of the vegetation overplanting the dune and surrounding terrain. The correctness of the modelling was verified by cross-validation (CV), which disclosed low error values. Such values in present and primary relief were, respectively, mean error (ME) at -0.009 and -0.014, root mean square error (RMSE) at 0.564 and 0.304 and root mean square standardised error (RMSSE) at 0.999 and 1.077. Image fusion, with use of pansharpening allowed a colour-infrared composition (CIR) and a Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index 1 (MCARI1) to be obtained. Their analysis disclosed that vegetation on the dune is characterised by worse health condition as compared with the surrounding area thereof. The proposed approach enabled the environmental condition of the surveyed dune to be analysed, and thereby it allows for a determination of the consequences of further uncontrolled sand recovery without taking into account the historical cartographic materials customarily considered to be the main source of information.

TI  - A Low-Cost Digital Colorimetry Setup to Investigate the Relationship between Water Color and Its Chemical Composition
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Developments in digital image acquisition technologies and citizen science lead to more water color observations and broader public participation in environmental monitoring. However, the implications of the use of these simple water color indices for water quality assessment have not yet been fully evaluated. In this paper, we build a low-cost digital camera colorimetry setup to investigate quantitative relationships between water color indices and concentrations of optically active constituents (OACs). As proxies for colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and phytoplankton, humic acid and algae pigments were used to investigate the relationship between water chromaticity and concentration. We found that the concentration fits an ascending relationship with xy chromaticity values and a descending relationship with hue angle. Our investigations permitted us to increase the information content of simple water color observations, by relating them to chemical constituent concentrations in observed waters.

TI  - Rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans using machine-learned trusted pixels from Cropland Data Layer
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A timely and detailed crop-specific land cover map can support many agricultural applications and decision makings. However, in-season crop mapping over a large area is still challenging due to the insufficiency of ground truth in the early stage of a growing season. To address this issue, this paper presents an efficient machine-learning workflow for the rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans fields without ground truth data for the current year. We use trusted pixels, a set of pixels that are predicted from the historical Cropland Data Layer (CDL) data with high confidence in the current year's crop type, to label training samples on multitemporal satellite images for crop type classification. The entire mapping process only involves a limited number of satellite images acquired within the growing season (normally 3-4 images per scene) and no field data needs to be collected. According to the investigation on 12 states of the U.S. Corn Belt, it is found that a considerable number of trusted pixels can be identified from the historical CDL data by the trusted pixel prediction model based on artificial neural network. According to the experiment on 49 Landsat-8 scenes and 31 Sentinel-2 tiles, the in-season maps of corn and soybeans are expected to reach 85%-95% agreement with CDL as well as field data by mid-July. Once the in-season satellite imagery becomes available, the crop cover map can be rapidly created even with limited computational resources. This study provides a new perspective and detailed guidance for rapid in-season mapping of corn and soybeans, which can be potentially applied to identify more diverse crop types and scaled up to the entire United States.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Cloud and Cloud Shadow Detection Method Based on RDA-Net Model
T2  - LASER & OPTOELECTRONICS PROGRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problems that most of the current cloud and cloud shadow detection methods arc prone to misdetection, serious edge detail loss and insufficient detection accuracy, a remote sensing image cloud and cloud shadow detection method based on the dual attention convolutional neural network model (RDA-Net) is proposed. In the model, the dual attention module is introduced to can effectively capture the dependence of global features, the recursive residual module is used to avoid degradation of the deep network, and the improved atrous spatial pyramid pooling module can extract multi-scale features without changing the size of the feature map. First, the remote sensing image dataset is preprocessed and made the corresponding labels, and then the Gaofen-1 WFV remote sensing image dataset is used for training and testing. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the detection accuracy of cloud and cloud shadow, and can still obtain better edge details of cloud and cloud shadow under complex conditions.

TI  - Remote sensing method for detecting green tide using HJ-CCD top-of-atmosphere reflectance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and rapid monitoring of green macroalgae blooms (GMB; also known as green tide) provide valuable information in decision making for mitigating its environmental impacts and economic losses. Plenty of spectralbased algorithms mainly rely on Rayleigh-corrected or atmospherically-corrected reflectance. However, this inherently requires additional information beyond satellite observations for atmospheric correction. This work developed a new method for detecting GMB just by using satellite top-of-atmosphere reflectance (Rtoa) without any atmospheric correction scheme based on Tasseled-cap-like transformation (TCT-like). Here we conducted a case study on Chinese four-band HJ-CCD sensor for illustrating the reliability and sensitivity of this method for detecting GMB of Ulva prolifera. The performance of the method was validated statistically via cross-sensor and cross-index comparisons with existing algorithms from atmospherically-corrected reflectance. Results showed that the Rtoa-based method can effectively detect GMB with high accuracy, and achieved high robustness against observing conditions such as various background water conditions, thin cloud cover and sun-glint. In addition to the findings presented here, this study may provide a promising way to detect massive macroalgae blooms of other species using optical satellite data.

TI  - Seismic Images of Shallow Waters over the Shatsky Rise in the Northwest Pacific Ocean
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEAN UNIVERSITY OF CHINA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of seismic oceanography to reveal finescale vertical structures of water column in the oceans based on multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection data. Such information can clarify the dynamic processes of mixing, exchange, and translation of water mass and energy. In this study, we present four MCS lines and satellite data to show high-resolution seismic images of shallow waters over the Shatsky Rise in the Northwest Pacific Ocean, where the Kuroshio Extension passes and bifurcates. One of our MCS transects crossed the center of an anticyclonic warm eddy on August 28, 2010, confirmed by satellite data such as sea level anomaly (SLA), geostrophic current anomaly (GCA), and sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTa). The seismic image showed that the eddy vertical structure featured a bowl-like shape and onion-like internal layering. The slightly tilted (<0.5 degrees) surface of the eddy was 400 m below the sea surface, indicating a subsurface eddy. The eddy was inferred to have a radius of 50 km and a maximum thickness of 500 m. Other MCS sections demonstrated the submesoscale structure of oceanfronts, characterized by the dipping reflectors (> 2 degrees-3 degrees) at the boundaries between water masses with differing properties. In addition, the discrepancies in SLA, GCA, and SSTa between water masses resulted in different seismic reflectivities. The water masses with high SLA, anticyclonic GCA and positive SSTa featured high-amplitude, continuous, clear-layered, and non-linear reflections, whereas those with low SLA, cyclonic GCA, and negative SSTa were associated with weak, fragmented, less stratification, and more linear reflectors.

TI  - Evaluation of Three Gridded Precipitation Products to Quantify Water Inputs over Complex Mountainous Terrain of Western China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the capacity of three gridded precipitation products (MSWEP V2.2, TRMM-3B42 V7, and GPM-IMERG V6) to detect precipitation in the Min Jiang watershed, a data-scarce and mountainous region in western China. A set of statistical and contingency indices is calculated for the precipitation products and compared with rain gauge observations at 23 ground stations from July 2000 to May 2016. Consistency between gridded and ground precipitation datasets is examined at different temporal (i.e., daily, monthly, seasonally, and annually) and spatial (i.e., site level, sub-regional level, and watershed level) resolutions. We identify possible reasons for discrepancies among precipitation datasets. Our results indicate that: (1) the MSWEP product is best suited for the study of long-term mesoscale rainfall, rather than short-term light or extreme rainfall; (2) the IMERG product represents stable performance for the simulation of rainfall spatial variability and detection capability; and (3) Composition of the datasets, climatic systems, and regional topography are key factors influencing the consistency between gridded and ground precipitation datasets. Therefore, we suggest using MSWEP V2.2 and GPM-IMERG V6 as potential precipitation data sources for hydrometeorological studies over the Min Jiang watershed. The findings of this study inform future hydrometeorological and climate applications in data-scarce regions with complex terrain.

TI  - Improved 1-km-Resolution Hourly Estimates of Aerosol Optical Depth Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a crucial parameter for various environmental and climate studies. Merging multi-sensor AOD products is an effective way to produce AOD products with more spatiotemporal integrity and accuracy. This study proposed a conditional generative adversarial network architecture (AeroCGAN) to improve the estimation of AOD. It first adopted MODIS Multiple Angle Implication of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AOD data to training the initial model, and then transferred the trained model to Himawari data and obtained the estimation of 1-km-resolution, hourly Himawari AOD products. Specifically, the generator adopted an encoder-decoder network for preliminary resolution enhancement. In addition, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) was used for environment features extraction and connected to a residual network for improving accuracy. Meanwhile, the sampled data and environment data were designed as conditions of the generator. The spatial distribution feature comparison and quantitative evaluation over an area of the North China Plain during the year 2017 have shown that this approach can better model the distribution of spatial features of AOD data and improve the accuracy of estimation with the help of local environment patterns.

TI  - Impacts of Spatial Configuration of Land Surface Features on Land Surface Temperature across Urban Agglomerations, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Booming urbanization triggers a significant modification of surface landscape configuration and hence complex urban climates. Considerable concerns exist regarding impacts of impervious surface area (ISA) and/or urban green space (UGS) on land surface temperature (LST). However, a knowledge gap still exists concerning the influence of urban landscape components and related spatial configuration on LST. To date, case studies have usually focused on individual cities, while few reports have addressed the impacts of urban surface components and relevant spatial configurations on LST within cities of different sizes, at different latitudes, and with different climatic backgrounds. Considering case studies from different latitudes and various climatic backgrounds can assist in obtaining comprehensive viewpoints about impacts of urban surface features on LST in both space and time. In this paper we analyzed data from three urban agglomerations, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD), over the period 2000-2015. These three regions are densely populated with the most developed socio-economy across China, and are also dominated by booming urbanization. Based on Landsat remotely sensed data, we included the spatial pattern of surface components and related configuration into our analysis, quantifying impacts of spatial configuration of surface components on LST in both space and time. We found generally rising LST over all cities, which can be attributed to continuous urban expansion-induced decreased UGS. Generally, LST over ISA was 0.96-7.96 degrees C higher than that over UGS. We investigated the impacts of spatial pattern of land surface components on LST and found that the joint effect of the composition and spatial configuration of land surface components had the most significant impact on LST. Specifically, ISA and UGS had higher impact on LST than the impact of geometry of the ISA and UGS on LST. In the future, continuous expansion of ISA and continuous shrinking of UGS will drive the rising tendency of LST. Moreover, a larger rising tendency of LST will be observed in larger sized cities than smaller sized cities.

TI  - Global Land High-Resolution Cloud Climatology Based on an Improved MOD09 Cloud Mask
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds play an important role in the energy and moisture cycle of the earth-atmosphere system, which affects many important processes in nature and human societies. However, there are very few fine-grained and high-precision global cloud climatology data available for high-resolution models. In this paper, we produced a fine-grained (1 km resolution) global land cloud climatology (GLHCC) report based on MOD09 cloud masks from 2001 to 2016, with a temporal resolution of 10 days. The two improvements (short-wave infrared and Band 2/6 ratio threshold method) on the original MOD09 cloud mask have reduced the snow, ice, and bright areas mistakenly classified as clouds. The preliminary cloud products undergo the removal of orbital artifacts by Variational Stationary Noise Remover (VSNR) and the removal of abnormal albedo areas to generate the final cloud climatology data. The new product was directly validated by ground-based cloud observations collected from 3777 global weather stations. PATMOS-X from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and MOD/MYD35 served as comparison products for consistency check of GLHCC. The assessment results show that GLHCC demonstrated a strong correlation with ground station observations, MOD/MYD35, and PATMOS-X. When the ground observations were taken as the truth value, GLHCC and MOD/MYD35 displayed higher accuracy than PATMOS-X. In most selected interested areas where the three behave differently, GLHCC matched the facts better than MOD/MYD35 and PATMOS-X. The GLHCC can well represent the cloud distribution over the past 16 years and will play an important role in the fine-grained demands of many aspects of nature and human society.

TI  - Texture Is Important in Improving the Accuracy of Mapping Photovoltaic Power Plants: A Case Study of Ningxia Autonomous Region, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Photovoltaic (PV) technology is becoming more popular due to climate change because it allows for replacing fossil-fuel power generation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, many countries have been attempting to generate electricity through PV power plants over the last decade. Monitoring PV power plants through satellite imagery, machine learning models, and cloud-based computing systems that may ensure rapid and precise locating with current status on a regional basis are crucial for environmental impact assessment and policy formulation. The effect of fusion of the spectral, textural with different neighbor sizes, and topographic features that may improve machine learning accuracy has not been evaluated yet in PV power plants' mapping. This study mapped PV power plants using a random forest (RF) model on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We combined textural features calculated from the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), reflectance, thermal spectral features, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) from Landsat-8 imagery and elevation, slope, and aspect from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) as input variables. We found that the textural features from GLCM prominent enhance the accuracy of the random forest model in identifying PV power plants where a neighbor size of 30 pixels showed the best model performance. The addition of texture features can improve model accuracy from a Kappa statistic of 0.904 & PLUSMN; 0.05 to 0.938 & PLUSMN; 0.04 and overall accuracy of 97.45 & PLUSMN; 0.14% to 98.32 & PLUSMN; 0.11%. The topographic and thermal features contribute a slight improvement in modeling. This study extends the knowledge of the effect of various variables in identifying PV power plants from remote sensing data. The texture characteristics of PV power plants at different spatial resolutions deserve attention. The findings of our study have great significance for collecting the geographic information of PV power plants and evaluating their environmental impact.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Characteristics of the Surface Urban Heat Island and Its Driving Factors Based on Local Climate Zones and Population in Beijing, China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing degree of urbanization has continuously aggravated the surface urban heat island (sUHI) effect in China. To investigate the correlation between spatiotemporal changes of sUHI and urbanization in Beijing, land surface temperature in summer from 2000 to 2017 and the distribution of local climate zones (LCZs) in 2003, 2005, 2010, and 2017 was retrieved using remote sensing data and used to analyze the sUHI area and intensity change. The statistical method GeoDetector was utilized to investigate the explanatory ability of LCZs and population as the driving factors. The year of 2006 was identified as the main turning year for sUHI evolution. The variation the sUHI from 2000 showed first an increasing trend, and then a decreasing one. The sUHI pattern changed before and after 2009. Before 2009, the sUHI mainly increased in the suburbs, and then, the enhancement area moved to the central area. The sUHI intensity change under different LCZ conversion conditions showed that the LCZ conversion influences the sUHI intensity significantly. Based on population distribution data, we found that the relationship between population density and sUHI gets weaker with increasing population density. The result of GeoDetector indicated that the LCZ is the main factor influencing the sUHI, but population density is an important auxiliary factor. This research reveals the sUHI variation pattern in Beijing from 2000 and could help city managers plan thermally comfortable urban environments with a better understanding of the effect of urban spatial form and population density on sUHIs.

TI  - Object-Based Area-to-Point Regression Kriging for Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical earth observation satellite sensors often provide a coarse spatial resolution (CR) multispectral (MS) image together with a fine spatial resolution (FR) panchromatic (PAN) image. Pansharpening is a technique applied to such satellite sensor images to generate an FR MS image by injecting spatial detail taken from the FR PAN image while simultaneously preserving the spectral information of MS image. Pansharpening methods are mostly applied on a per-pixel basis and use the PAN image to extract spatial detail. However, many land cover objects in FR satellite sensor images are not illustrated as independent pixels, but as many spatially aggregated pixels that contain important semantic information. In this article, an object-based pansharpening approach, termed object-based area-to-point regression kriging (OATPRK), is proposed. OATPRK aims to fuse the MS and PAN images at the object-based scale and, thus, takes advantage of both the unified spectral information within the CR MS images and the spatial detail of the FR PAN image. OATPRK is composed of three stages: image segmentation, object-based regression, and residual downscaling. Three data sets acquired from IKONOS and Worldview-2 and 11 benchmark pansharpening algorithms were used to provide a comprehensive assessment of the proposed OATPRK approach. In both the synthetic and real experiments, OATPRK produced the most superior pan-sharpened results in terms of visual and quantitative assessment. OATPRK is a new conceptual method that advances the pixel-level geostatistical pansharpening approach to the object level and provides more accurate pan-sharpened MS images.

TI  - Ocean Temperature and Color Frontal Zones in the Gulf of Mexico: Where, When, and Why
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal patterns of ocean frontal zones in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) are studied using ocean color and sea surface temperature (SST) imagery collected by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer/Aqua (MODIS/A) over an 18-year (2002-2019) period. A gradient-based front detection algorithm is applied to each daily image to detect frontal features, from which a comprehensive data set of ocean frontal zones (both climatology and time series) is established. Prominent seasonality is found in both ocean color and SST frontal zones while their seasonal variations differ. Major persistent frontal zones are mainly distributed in coastal waters within the 130-m isobath, and they are often associated with wind forcing, wind-driven Ekman transport, upwelling/downwelling, river discharge, ocean currents, and topography. The seasonal and interannual variations in frontal distributions are also revealed in the dominant spatial and temporal modes derived from an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) decomposition analysis. These findings may have significant implications on fisheries and ocean ecology research. For example, both ocean color and SST frontal features in certain months are found to coincide with a well-known fishing ground in the eastern GoM, and surface macroalgae features are found to align well with the identified ocean frontal features.

AB  - (Objective) The quality of snow leopard monitoring images collected by infrared trigger cameras is uneven and the number is limited. An automatic recognition method of snow leopard monitoring images based on deep learning data expansion was proposed to improve the recognition accuracy of the snow leopard under limited samples. (Method) Improving the ResNeSt50 model with attention mechanism, the snow leopard monitoring images of Qilian Mountain National Park of northwestern China were used as the original dataset, the non-snow leopard terrestrial wildlife images taken by the infrared trigger camera were used as the extended negative sample, and the network snow leopard images were used as the extended positive sample. Comparative experiments were conducted in turn based on the above three datasets. The model was gradually guided to focus on the key characteristics of individual snow leopards by choosing an appropriate expansion method, and the effectiveness of the data expansion was verified by Gradient-weighted Class Activation Map. (Result) The model trained with the original data set+expanded negative samples+expanded positive samples had the best recognition effect. The Grad-CAM showed that the model correctly focused on the individual pattern and spot characteristics of the snow leopard. Compared with the recognition model based on Vgg16 and ResNet50, ResNeSt50 achieved the best recognition effect, the test set recognition accuracy rate reached 97.70%, the precision rate reached 97.26%, and the recall rate reached 97.59%. (Conclusion) The model trained by the original data set+extended negative sample+ extended positive sample data expansion method proposed in this paper can distinguish the background from the foreground, and has a strong ability to discriminate the characteristics of snow leopard itself, and the generalization ability is the best.

TI  - Extracting Frequent Sequential Patterns of Forest Landscape Dynamics in Fenhe River Basin, Northern China, from Landsat Time Series to Evaluate Landscape Stability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The forest landscape pattern evolution can reveal the intensity and mode of action of human-land relationships at different times and in different spaces, providing scientific support for regional ecological security, human settlement health, and sustainable development. In this study, we proposed a novel method for analyzing the dynamics of landscape patterns. First, patch density (PD), largest patch index (LPI), landscape shape index (LSI), and contiguity index (CI) were used to identify the types of forest spatial patterns. The frequent sequential pattern mining method was used to detect the frequent subsequences from the time series of landscape pattern types from 1991 to 2020 and further evaluate the forest landscape stability of the Fenhe River Basin in China. The results show that different frequent sequence patterns have conspicuous spatial and temporal differences, which describe the evolution processes and stability changes during a certain period of forest evolution and play an important role in the analysis of forest dynamics. The proportion of the disturbed regions to the total forest area exhibited a downward trend. The long-term evolution pattern indicates that there are many evolution processes and trends in the forest at the same time, showing an aggregation distribution law. Compared with 2016, the forest landscape has become complete in 2020, and the overall stability of the Fenhe River Basin has improved. This study can provide scientific support to land managers and policy implementers and offer a new perspective for studying forest landscape pattern changes and evaluating landscape stability.

TI  - Machine Learning-Based Modeling of Vegetation Leaf Area Index and Gross Primary Productivity Across North America and Comparison With a Process-Based Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation plays a key role in regulating the material and energy exchanges among the biosphere, the atmosphere, and the pedosphere. Modeling and predicting vegetation key variables such as leaf area index (LAI) and gross primary productivity (GPP) are crucial to understand and project the processes of vegetation growth in response to climate change. While a number of studies developed models to simulate vegetation GPP using satellite-derived LAI, the requirement of satellite-based model inputs largely limits the predicting power of these developed models. This study developed a machine learning scheme, utilizing both support vector regression (SVR) and random forests (RF), which are capable of modeling LAI and GPP time series using only meteorological variables. We first simulated the LAI time series directly using meteorological variables as inputs and then buffered its unrealistic day-to-day fluctuation, and further modeled the GPP time series using meteorological variables and modeled LAI time series. This scheme enhanced the interpretability of machine learning models by considering the nonnegligible coupling between LAI and GPP. We tested our methods for four main plant functional types across North America and evaluated the models using both satellite-based and flux tower data. The results demonstrated that the machine learning models perform well on simulating the time series of both LAI and GPP. We identified that there is a need to improve the phenology representation in the Biome-BGCMuSo model. The machine learning models provide an alternative way to predict time series of LAI and GPP using only meteorological variables across large geographic regions, and also provide benchmarking accuracies for future developments of the process-based models.

TI  - Hyperspectral and Full-Waveform LiDAR Improve Mapping of Tropical Dry Forest's Successional Stages
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of the degree of regeneration in tropical dry forest (TDF) is critical for conservation policymaking and evaluation. Hyperspectral remote sensing and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have been used to characterize the deterministic successional stages in a TDF. These successional stages, classified as early, intermediate, and late, are considered a proxy for mapping the age since the abandonment of a given forest area. Expanding on the need for more accurate successional forest mapping, our study considers the age attributes of a TDF study area as a continuous expression of relative attribute scores/levels that vary along the process of ecological succession. Specifically, two remote-sensing data sets: HyMap (hyperspectral) and LVIS (waveform LiDAR), were acquired at the Santa Rosa National Park Environmental Monitoring Super Site (SRNP-EMSS) in Costa Rica, were used to generate age-attribute metrics. These metrics were then used as entry-level variables on a randomized nonlinear archetypal analysis (RNAA) model to select the most informative metrics from both data sets. Next, a relative attribute learning (RAL) algorithm was adapted for both independent and fused metrics to comparatively learn the relative attribute levels of the forest ages of the study area. In this study, four HyMap indices and five LVIS metrics were found to have the potential to map the forest ages of the study area, and compared with these results, a significant improvement was found through the fusion of the metrics on the accuracy of the generated forest age maps. By linking the age group mapping and the relative attribute mapping results, a dynamic gradient of the age-attribute transition patterns emerged.

TI  - Monitoring Cyanobacteria Bloom in Dianchi Lake Based on Ground-Based Multispectral Remote-Sensing Imaging: Preliminary Results
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Some lakes in China have undergone serious eutrophication, with cyanobacterial blooms occurring frequently. Dynamic monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms is important. At present, the traditional lake-survey-based cyanobacterial bloom monitoring is spatiotemporally limited and requires considerable human and material resources. Although satellite remote sensing can rapidly monitor large-scale cyanobacterial blooms, clouds and other factors often mean that effective images cannot be obtained. It is also difficult to use this method to dynamically monitor and manage aquatic environments and provide early warnings of cyanobacterial blooms in lakes and reservoirs. In contrast, ground-based remote sensing can operate under cloud cover and thus act as a new technical method to dynamically monitor cyanobacterial blooms. In this study, ground-based remote-sensing technology was applied to multitemporal, multidirectional, and multiscene monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms in Dianchi Lake via an area array multispectral camera mounted on a rotatable cloud platform at a fixed station. Results indicate that ground-based imaging remote sensing can accurately reflect the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of cyanobacterial blooms and provide timely and accurate data for salvage treatment and early warnings. Thus, ground-based multispectral remote-sensing data can operationalize the dynamic monitoring of cyanobacterial blooms. The methods and results from this study can provide references for monitoring such blooms in other lakes.

TI  - Detecting and Analyzing the Displacement of a Small-Magnitude Earthquake Cluster in Rong County, China by the GACOS Based InSAR Technology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A series of small-magnitude earthquakes (M-w 2.9 similar to M-w 4.9) occurred in Rong County, Sichuan Province, China between 30 March 2018 and December 2020, which threatened the safety of local residents. Determining the surface displacement and estimating the damage caused by these earthquakes are significant for earthquake relief, post-earthquake disaster assessment and hazard elimination. This paper integrates the Generic Atmospheric Correction Online Service (GACOS) with interferometry synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to accurately detect the displacement of the series of small-magnitude earthquakes in Rong County based on 45 Sentinel-1 ascending/descending images acquired from January 2018 to December 2020. We analyze the influence of some factors involved in surface displacement, including earthquake magnitude, focal depth and the distance from the epicenter to the fault. The above measurement for small-magnitude earthquakes and statistics analysis for the displacement have not been performed before, so this can help better understand the displacement features of small-magnitude earthquakes, which are important for post-earthquake hazard assessment and disaster prevention.

TI  - Assessing the Long-Term Evolution of Abandoned Salinized Farmland via Temporal Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Salinization in arid or semiarid regions with water logging limits cropland yield, threatening food security. The highest level of farmland salinization, that is, abandoned salinized farmland, is a tradeoff between inadequate drainage facilities and sustainable farming. The evolution of abandoned salinized farmlands is closely related to the development of cropping systems. However, detecting abandoned salinized farmland using time-series remote sensing data has not been investigated well by previous studies. In this study, a novel approach was proposed to detect the dynamics of abandoned salinized farmland using time-series multispectral and thermal imagery. Thirty-two years of temporal Landsat imagery (from 1988 to 2019) was used to assess the evolution of salinization in Hetao, a two-thousand-year-old irrigation district in northern China. As intermediate variables of the proposed method, the crop-specific planting area was retrieved via its unique temporal vegetation index (VI) pattern, in which the shape-model-fitting technology and the K-means cluster algorithm were used. The desert area was stripped from the clustered non-vegetative area using its distinct features in the thermal band. Subsequently, the abandoned salinized farmland was distinguished from the urban area by the threshold-based saline index (SI). In addition, a regression model between electrical conductance (EC) and SI was established, and the spatial saline degree was evaluated by the SI map in uncropped and unfrozen seasons. The results show that the cropland has constantly been expanding in recent decades (from 4.7 x 10(5) ha to 7.1 x 10(5) ha), while the planting area of maize and sunflower has grown and the area of wheat has decreased. Significant desalinization progress was observed in Hetao, where both the area of salt-affected land (salt-free area increased approximately 4 x 10(5) ha) and the abandoned salinized farmland decreased (reduced from 0.45 x 10(5) ha to 0.19 x 10(5) ha). This could be mainly attributed to three reasons: the popularization of water-saving irrigation technology, the construction of artificial drainage facilities, and a shift in cropping patterns. The decrease in irrigation and the increase in drainage have deepened the groundwater table in Hetao, which weakens the salt collection capacity of the abandoned salinized farmland. The results demonstrate the promising possibility of reutilizing abandoned salinized farmland via a leaching campaign where the groundwater table is sufficiently deep to stop salinization.</p>

TI  - Monitoring Cropping Intensity Dynamics across the North China Plain from 1982 to 2018 Using GLASS LAI Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - China is a large grain producer and consumer. Thus, obtaining information about the cropping intensity (CI) in cultivated land, as well as understanding the intensified utilization of cultivated land, is important to ensuring an increased grain production and food security for China. This study aims to detect and map the changes in CI over a period of 36 years across China's core grain-producing area-the North China Plain (NCP)- using remotely sensed leaf area index (LAI) time series data acquired by the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) products. We first selected 2132 sample points that consisted entirely, or almost entirely, of cultivated cropland from all pixels; the biennial LAI curves for the sample points were then extracted; the Savitzky-Golay filter and second-order difference algorithm were then applied to reconstruct the biennial LAI curves and obtain the number of peaks in these curves. In addition, the multiple cropping index (MCI) was calculated to represent the CI. Finally, the spatial distribution of the CI of cultivated land on the NCP was mapped from 1982 to 2018 using a geo-statistical kriging approach. Spatially, the results indicate that the CI of cultivated land over the NCP exhibits a distinct spatial pattern that conforms to "high in the south, low in the north ". The single cropping system (SCS) mainly occurred in the higher latitude area ranging from 37.04 & DEG;N to 42.54 & DEG;N, and the double cropping system (DCS) mainly existed in the lower latitude area between 31.95 & DEG;N and 39.97 & DEG;N. Temporally, the CI increased over the study period, but there were some large fluctuations in CI from 1982 to 1998 and it maintained relatively stable since 2000. Across the NCP, 68.14% of cultivated land experienced a significant increase in CI during the 36-year period, while only 3.87% showed a significant decrease. We also found that, between 1982 and 2018, the northern boundary of the area for DCS underwent a significant westward expansion and northward movement. Our results show a good degree of consistency with statistical data and previous research and also help to improve the reliability of satellite-based identification of CI using low spatial resolution LAI products. The results provide important information that can be used for analyzing and evaluating the rational utilization of cultivated land resources; thus, ensuring food security and realizing agricultural sustainability not only for the NCP, but for China as a whole. These results also highlight the value of satellite remote sensing to the long-term monitoring of cropping intensity at large scales.

TI  - Mapping leaf chlorophyll content of mangrove forests with Sentinel-2 images of four periods
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll is a good indicator of health status and nutritional condition as plant grows. Many studies have investigated the feasibility of retrieving leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) using vegetation indices (VIs) of multiple plant species, yet very few studies have examined the multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images for mapping LCC of mangrove forests. With field collected leaf SPAD values (relative chlorophyll content), this study explored the relationship of leaf SPAD values against five types of newly-developed VIs derived from leaf hyperspectral data and Sentinel-2 data of four periods (May 2018, January 2019, August 2019, and December 2019). Linear regression with best-performing VIs and Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR) were developed to construct the SPAD retrieval model in each period. The leave-one-out cross-validation technique was employed to compare the estimation results of VIs and KRR method, and the four periods of SPAD maps were produced by the bestperforming model. The results showed that the newly-developed index (ratio of single-band reflectance to the sum of two bands reflectance, RSSI) achieved the high correlation coefficient with leaf SPAD value at both leaf and canopy level. At canopy level, the linear model using RSSI (B8/(B2 + B5), B8a/(B2 + B4), B8/(B2 + B5), and B8/(B2 + B3)) outperformed than that using traditional broadband indices and KRR model with R-adjust(2) = 0.496, 0.742, 0.681, and 0.801; RMSE = 5.75, 4.29, 4.00, and 3.46; and RE = 7.67%, 5.68%, 4.97%, and 4.63% in each period. We concluded that there are great potentials of newly-developed index of RSSI using Sentinel-2 data for regional retrieving and mapping LCC of mangrove forests across different time periods, which is essential for mangrove ecological conservation and restoration.

TI  - Impacts of Dam Operation on Vegetation Dynamics of Mid-Channel Bars in the Mid-Lower Yangtze River, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamics on mid-channel bars (MCBs) is essential for supporting ecosystem functions and associated services in river systems, especially in dammed large rivers. Generally, there are two possible changing patterns that vegetation of MCBs downstream a dam would experience. On one hand, the vegetation area may shrink because of a decrease in the MCB area in the post-dam period, which has been observed in many rivers around the world. On the other hand, the MCB vegetation area may expand because flood disturbances would be weakened by dam operation. However, little evidence has been reported to clarify such confusion. Therefore, vegetation dynamics of MCBs in the mid-lower Yangtze River downstream the Three Gorges Dam (TGD; the world's largest dam) is selected as a case study to address the issue. Using long-term (1987-2017) Landsat archive images, this study reveals the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation area change intensities (VACIs; indicated by dynamic trends) on MCBs in the mid-lower Yangtze River. Results show that an overall VACI in the post-dam period (2003-2017) is about three times faster than that in the pre-dam period (1987-2002). In other words, the rate of vegetation colonization accelerated after the TGD operation began in 2003. Moreover, the VACIs in the post-dam period are size dependent, where large size MCBs are likely to gain higher VACIs: Small-sized MCBs (0.33 km(2)/yr), medium-sized MCBs (1.23 km(2)/yr), large-sized MCBs (1.49 km(2)/yr). In addition, VACIs of individual MCBs in the post-dam period are distance dependent, where the further a MCB was from the TGD, the higher the VACI. It is also suggested that the weakened flood disturbances in the post-dam could explain the rapid vegetation growth and colonization. This work is not only beneficial for managing and protecting MCBs downstream the TGD after its operation, but is also helpful in understanding vegetation dynamics of MCBs in other dammed river systems around the world.

TI  - Seawater Debye Model Function at L-Band and Its Impact on Salinity Retrieval From Aquarius Satellite Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A model function of seawater, which specifies the dielectric constant of seawater as a function of salinity, temperature, and frequency, is important for the retrieval of sea surface salinity using satellite data. In 2017, a model function has been developed based on measurement data at 1.4134 GHz using a third-order polynomial expression in salinity (S) and temperature (T). Although the model showed improvements in salinity retrieval, it had an inconsistent behavior between partitioned salinities. To improve the stability of the model, new dielectric measurements of seawater have been made recently over a broad range of salinities and temperatures to expand the data set used for developing the model function. The structure of the model function has been changed from a polynomial expansion in S and T to a physics-based model consisting of a Debye molecular resonance term plus a conductivity term. Each unknown parameter is expressed in S and T based on the expanded measurement data set. Physical arguments have been used to limit the number of unknown coefficients in these expressions to improve the stability of the model function. The new model function has been employed in the retrieval algorithm of the Aquarius satellite mission to obtain a global salinity map. The retrieved salinity using a different model function is compared with in situ data collected by Argo floats to evaluate the impact and the performance of model functions. The results indicate that the new model function has significant improvements in salinity retrieval compared with other existing models.

TI  - Glacier Velocity Changes in the Himalayas in Relation to Ice Mass Balance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier evolution with time provides important information about climate variability. Here, we investigated glacier velocity changes in the Himalayas and analysed the patterns of glacier flow. We collected 220 scenes of Landsat-7 panchromatic images between 1999 and 2000, and Sentinel-2 panchromatic images between 2017 and 2018, to calculate surface velocities of 36,722 glaciers during these two periods. We then derived velocity changes between 1999 and 2018 for the early winter period, based on which we performed a detailed analysis of motion of each individual glacier, and noted that the changes are spatially heterogeneous. Of all the glaciers, 32% have sped up, 24.5% have slowed down, and the rest 43.5% have remained stable. The amplitude of glacier slowdown, as a result of glacier mass loss, is significantly larger than that of speedup. At regional scales, we found that glacier surface velocity in winter has uniformly decreased in the western part of the Himalayas between 1999 and 2018, while increased in the eastern part; this contrasting difference may be associated with decadal changes in accumulation and/or melting under different climatic regimes. We also found that the overall trend of surface velocity exhibits seasonal variability: summer velocity changes are positively correlated with mass loss, i.e., velocity increases with increasing mass loss, whereas winter velocity changes show a negative correlation. Our study suggests that glacier velocity changes in the Himalayas are spatially and temporally heterogeneous, in agreement with studies that previously highlighted this trend, emphasising complex interactions between glacier dynamics and environmental forcing.

TI  - Vessel Target Detection in Spaceborne-Airborne Collaborative SAR Images via Proposal and Polarization Fusion
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper focuses on vessel detection through the fusion of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired from spaceborne-airborne collaborative observations. The vessel target detection task becomes more challenging when it features inshore interferences and structured and shaped targets. We propose a new method, based on target proposal and polarization information exploitation (TPPIE), to fuse the spaceborne-airborne collaborative SAR images for accurate vessel detection. First, a new triple-state proposal matrix (TSPM) is generated by combining the normed gradient-based target proposal and the edge-based morphological candidate map. The TSPM can be used to extract the potential target regions, as well as filtering out the sea clutter and inshore interference regions. Second, we present a new polarization feature, named the absolute polarization ratio (APR), to exploit the intensity information of dual-polarization SAR images. In the APR map, the vessel target regions are further enhanced. Third, the final fused image with enhanced targets and suppressed backgrounds (i.e., improved target-to-clutter ratio; TCR) is attained by taking the Hadamard product of the intersected TSPM from multiple sources and the composite map exploiting the APR feature. Experimental analyses using Gaofen-3 satellite and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) SAR imagery indicate that the proposed TPPIE fusion method can yield higher TCRs for fused images and better detection performance for vessel targets, compared to commonly used image fusion approaches.

TI  - A Framework for Generating High Spatiotemporal Resolution Land Surface Temperature in Heterogeneous Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial biophysical parameter related closely to the land-atmosphere interface. Satellite thermal infrared measurement provides an effective method to derive LST on regional and global scales, but it is very hard to acquire simultaneously high spatiotemporal resolution LST due to its limitation in the sensor design. Recently, many LST downscaling and spatiotemporal image fusion methods have been widely proposed to solve this problem. However, most methods ignored the spatial heterogeneity of LST distribution, and there are inconsistent image textures and LST values over heterogeneous regions. Thus, this study aims to propose one framework to derive high spatiotemporal resolution LSTs in heterogeneous areas by considering the optimal selection of LST predictors, the downscaling of MODIS LST, and the spatiotemporal fusion of Landsat 8 LST. A total of eight periods of MODIS and Landsat 8 data were used to predict the 100-m resolution LST at prediction time t(p) in Zhangye and Beijing of China. Further, the predicted LST at t(p) was quantitatively contrasted with the LSTs predicted by the regression-then-fusion strategy, STARFM-based fusion, and random forest-based regression, and was validated with the actual Landsat 8 LST product at t(p). Results indicated that the proposed framework performed better in characterizing LST texture than the referenced three methods, and the root mean square error (RMSE) varied from 0.85 K to 2.29 K, and relative RMSE varied from 0.18 K to 0.69 K, where the correlation coefficients were all greater than 0.84. Furthermore, the distribution error analysis indicated the proposed new framework generated the most area proportion at 0 similar to 1 K in some heterogeneous regions, especially in artificial impermeable surfaces and bare lands. This means that this framework can provide a set of LST dataset with reasonable accuracy and a high spatiotemporal resolution over heterogeneous areas.

TI  - ASSESSMENT OF MANGROVE AS A NATURAL BEACH PROTECTION IN SURABAYA COAST, INDONESIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove area in east coast of Surabaya region is becomes a fortress to protect the city from the threat of erosion and sea intrusion. According to its function, the development of mangrove areas will help this area in dealing with coastal erosion. This study presents a GIS model that aims to determine the effect of mangrove changes to coastal erosion risk. The method used Landsat satellite images during 2015-2019 to calculate mangrove changes. DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) is used to calculate shoreline changes. Finally, the model used CERA to analysis coastal erosion risk. The results showed that there is the dynamics change of shoreline (both accretion and abrasion) in the 2015-2019 period in each district. This change is influenced by the density of mangroves. Meanwhile, the analysis of CERA. showed that the Kenjeran and Bulak Districts are classified as high risk of erosion. This condition is not only based on the extent of mangrove but is also caused by other parameters such as geomorphology, land cover, population density, and so on.

TI  - Applying DSAS tool to detect coastal changes along Nile Delta, Egypt
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastline of the Nile Delta is a dynamic zone in Egypt that is received considerable attention. This region contains many major cities and it also contains a number of economically important harbors such as Damietta, Port Said and Alexandria. This research focuses attention on applying Geographical Information System (GIS) tool to assess prospective changes along the coast of the Nile Delta, Egypt during the past thirty-four years. In this paper, changes to the coastline were monitored using twelve scenes of Landsat images from 1984 to 2018. After the extraction of shorelines from Landsat images, Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was used to calculate shoreline displacement rate. The results showed that about 44.2% of the study area was under erosion and 45% was under accretion while it was stable at 10.8% between 1984 and 2018. The results illustrated that Rosetta and Damietta promontories are displayed higher rates of erosion than other coastal regions of the Nile Delta. National measures must be implemented to protect the entire coast in threatened areas. (c) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences. Production and hosting by Elsevier B. V.

TI  - Mapping eucalypts trees using high resolution multispectral images: A study comparing WorldView 2 vs. SPOT 7
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Invasive alien plants are considered as a major threat to many ecological and socio-economic systems. Nevertheless, the management of some of these plants is often controversial due to the positive socioeconomic and ecosystem roles they play. This necessitates proper mapping and monitoring of the extent and spatial distribution of such plants to prioritize resource allocation and management. However, mapping plant species using remote sensing in a heterogeneous environment such as an urban area is often challenged by high levels of spectral muddle. This study investigated the utility of the high and medium spectral and spatial resolution imageries from the WorldView-2 (WV-2) and SPOT-7 satellites, respectively, to map eucalypts trees in urban areas. Furthermore, the classification performances of Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) were compared. Both WV-2 and SPOT-7 imageries attained overall accuracies of 81.67% (0.78 kappa) and 72.78% (0.67 kappa), respectively, when the RF algorithm was used and 80% (0.76 Kappa) and 71.11% (0.65 Kappa), respectively when SVM algorithm was used. The user's accuracies for the eucalypts class in both WV-2 and SPOT 7 imageries were 73.33% and 60%, respectively, for the RF and 70% and 56.67% for the SVM algorithm, respectively. Thus, WV-2 imagery is more suitable for mapping eucalypts trees in a heterogeneous urban environment. Therefore, the classification of WV-2 imageries using RF produced a relatively more accurate map of the eucalypts trees for the study areas, the southern part of Johannesburg city.

TI  - Estimating urban greenness index using remote sensing data: A case study of an affluent vs poor suburbs in the city of Johannesburg
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The importance of urban green space has over the years grown into an indispensable component of green infrastructure incorporated in urban planning and design as investment to promote the well-being of city dwellers. The continuous advancement in remote sensing spatial and spectral resolutions has made it possible to effectively map and evaluate urban green space for better management. The urban greenness index between the affluent suburb of Rosebank in the north and the poor Township of Soweto in the south, of Johannesburg city was assessed and compared to determine the environmental quality between the two areas. The total above ground biomass (AGB) of the two predominantly occurring street trees, Jacaranda mimosifolia and Platanus x acerifolia in Rosebank was estimated using existing allometric equa-tions for the respective species. An equation was derived from the correlation of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values extracted from SPOT 6 image and AGB of Rosebank. The same equation was then used to extrapolate and estimate the AGB of Soweto. The results showed that Rosebank had the lowest total AGB of approximately 113,179 ton, while that of Soweto was approximately 504,400 ton. However, the greenness index of Rosebank (83%) was greater than in Soweto (14%), indicating a pat-tern of ecological disparity between the two areas. These findings could be useful for designing a sound urban planning and policy formulation for the city of Johannesburg. (c) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - A shift in the diurnal timing and intensity of deep convection over the Congo Basin during the past 40 years
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Congo Basin, one of the three most convective regions in the world, has recently experienced a large-scale drying trend accompanied by an increase in thunderstorm activity. This study analyzes changes in the diurnal variations of cloudiness and deep convection from 1979 to 2019 over the Congo, evaluates their associations with trends in precipitation efficiency, and explores their possible connections to the observed decrease in precipitation. Analyses of GridSat-B1 and MODIS satellite datasets in conjunction with ERA5 reanalysis data show that cloud cover has decreased, and brightness temperature (Tb) has increased during the morning hours, while convective activity has increased and Tb has decreased during the afternoon hours, possibly due to the observed warming and drying trend over the Congo. The combined effects of decreasing clouds during the morning and the subsequent increasing convection during the afternoon have led to an amplification of the diurnal amplitude in Tb over the Congo. Our results also indicate a decrease in precipitation efficiency and an increase in cloud base height. Such changes may be attributable to the Congo drought as increased surface temperatures and decreased surface relative humidity would raise the lifted condensation level, and thus increase the cloud base height and decrease the precipitation efficiency. This positive-feedback mechanism may ultimately result in the observed decrease of precipitation at the surface, further accelerating the drying trend over the Congo.

TI  - Integrated method for rice cultivation monitoring using Sentinel-2 data and Leaf Area Index
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - it is necessary to apply a remote sensing-based system for rice cultivation assessment parallel with the field measurements of the crop biophysical parameters. This study aims to map the rice cultivated areas and give an estimate for the expected yield (ton/ha) using Sentinel-2 satellite data. The study was carried out in an experimental site in the Kafr El-Sheikh governorate with a total area of 3240 ha. The multi temporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) extracted from nine Sentinel-2 imagery cover the whole summer season. The supervised nearest neighborhood object-based classification method was employed, resulting in a classification map with an overall accuracy of 95% and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. Yield prediction was carried out by using an empirical yield prediction model using the NDVI and the Leaf Area Index (LAI). The LAI was calculated using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model and then validated against the measured LAI. the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MPAE) was calculated to estimate the error between the measured and predicted LAI and yield. The MPAE was found to be +/- 6.76% (i.e. +/- 0.28 m(2)/m(2)) with a high correlation between the measured and the calculated LAI with a coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.94). While for the yield, the MPAE was found to be +/- 6.53% (i.e. +/- 0.66 ton/ha) and R-2 of 0.95. This method is applicable to estimate area and yield of rice in the northern Nile delta in adequate time before harvest. (C) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Mapping of hydrothermal alterations related to gold mineralization within parts of the Malumfashi Schist Belt, North-Western Nigeria
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing methods are a vital alternative for regional exploration surveys. Many ore deposits (e.g., epithermal, porphyry-related, volcanogenic massive sulphides, etc.) have distinct distribution patterns of alteration zones that can be used for recognizing this mineralization. Several known goldfields are distributed within the basement rocks of western Nigeria. The area of interest, Malumfashi Schist Belt, is located in North-Western Nigeria and is characterized by gneisses and metasediments that were intruded by Pan-African granitoids. Gold mineralization occurs as veins and veinlets that are associated with hydrothermal alteration zones (i.e., argillic, phyllic, and propylitic). Hence, the discrimination of these alteration zones is one of the key indicators for new prospective zones of gold mineralization in this metallogenic belt. In the present study, Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper+ (Landsat-7 ETM+) and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) data were processed and integrated with the aim to identify possible locations for gold mineralization within the Malumfashi Schist Belt. For this purpose, the band ratio techniques and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied to identify, enhance and map the different alteration types, while fractal analysis was utilized to quantify the degree of alteration within each processed image. Using the multi-criteria evaluation method, the discretized images obtained from the fractal analysis were weighted and integrated into an enhanced possible location for gold occurrences. A receiver operating curve/Area under curve analysis was then used to evaluate the reliability of the predictive model. Both spatial and GIS analyses indicate that gold mineralization displays a proximal relationship to hydrothermal alteration data. We can map sets of alteration minerals which mainly represent new and good ore prospects for the investigated area. A sensitivity analysis points out a predictive accuracy of 78%, which suggests the model is capable of predicting gold occurrences within the study region. Besides, the results showed that the prospective zones of gold accumulations mainly occur within metasedimentary units. It is recommended that the studied dataset provide a potential tool for mapping alteration minerals related to gold deposits that can be applied in other regions with analogous geological setting.

TI  - Spotlight influenza: Laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza in people with acute respiratory illness: a literature review and meta-analysis, WHO European Region, 2004 to 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Across the World Health Organization European Region, there are few estimates of the proportion of people seeking medical care for influenza like illness or acute respiratory infections and who have laboratory-confirmed seasonal influenza infection. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of data extracted from studies published between 2004 and 2017 and from sentinel data from the European surveillance system (TESSy) between 2004 and 2018. We pooled within-season estimates by influenza type/subtype, setting (outpatient (OP)/inpatient (IP)) and age group to estimate the proportion of people tested who have laboratory-confirmed and medically-attended seasonal influenza in Europe. Results: In the literature review, the pooled proportion for all influenza types was 33% (95% confidence interval (CI): 30-36), higher among OP 36% (95% CI: 33-40) than IP 24% (95% CI: 20-29). Pooled estimates for all influenza types by age group were: 0-17 years, 26% (22-31); 18-64 years, 41% (32-50); >= 65 years, 33% (27-40). From TESSy data, 33% (31-34) of OP and 24% (21-27) of IP were positive. The highest proportion of influenza A was in people aged 18-64 years (22%, 16-29). By subtype, A(H1N1)pdm09 was highest in 18-64 year-olds (16%, 11-21%) whereas A(H3N2) was highest in those >= 65 years (10%, 2-22). For influenza B, the highest proportion of infections was in those aged 18-64 years (15%, 9-24). Conclusions: Laboratory-confirmed influenza accounted for approximately one third of all acute respiratory infections for which medical care was sought during the influenza season.

TI  - Contributions of multispectral images to the study of land cover in wet depressions of eastern Tunisia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern Tunisia is dotted with varied wetlands such as lagoons, sabkhas, garaas... These wetlands, at the interface between land and water, are rich, diverse and dynamic environments. Remote sensing shows potential and efficiency in the detection and characterization of these environments, although these humid depressions are difficult to define. The implementation of new optical satellite sensors characterized by High and Very High Spatial Resolution (HSR and VHSR) and by a high temporal repetitiveness, completes the field data and allows to envisage a delineation of the wet depression and a detailed detection of its land use. The purpose of this article is to determine whether the VHSR image, with its very rich spatial resolution, offers an added value for the detection of these diversified depressions, in comparison with the HSR image with richer spectral resolution. The results of the analysis show that the Ikonos image at VHSR compensates for the spectral richness of Sentinel-2 images at HSR. The "object-oriented" classification method, widely used today in image processing for various applications, appears to be more suitable than the "pixel-based" method in VHSR image classification. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and the Transformed Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (TSAVI) have multiple interests in wetland detection, although moisture masks show some inefficiency in improving the quality of classifications.

TI  - Seroprevalence and detection of <i>Trypanosoma cruzi</i> in dogs living in a non-endemic area for Chagas disease in the legal Amazon region, Brazil
T2  - VETERINARY PARASITOLOGY- REGIONAL STUDIES AND REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent for Chagas disease, is widely distributed in the Americas. Its hosts are humans and wild and domestic mammals, and its vectors are triatomine insects. Studies have indicated that domestic dogs are sentinel animals in the epidemiology of Chagas disease in endemic regions, including states in the Legal Amazon region of Brazil. In Sao Luis, the capital of Maranha similar to o, a non-endemic state, the existence of a domestic cycle involving domestic rats has been proven, along with a wild cycle maintained by didelphids. However, no studies on T. cruzi infection in domestic animals in this locality have been conducted. The aim of this study was to investigate occurrence of T. cruzi in dogs living in the Itaqui Bacanga district of Sao Luis, Maranhao, by means of serological and molecular tests. Blood samples were obtained from 330 dogs and structured epidemiological questionnaires were applied to their keepers. These samples were used in the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Fisher's exact test was used for statistical calculations with the aim of identifying risk factors. Out of the 330 animals, 105 (31.8%) were reactive in IFAT, 46 (13.0%) in ELISA and 20 (6.0%) in both serological tests. The results were not significant (p > 0.05) when submitted to statistical analysis for the studied variables. From PCR, 58 samples (17.5%) were found to be positive and, of these, one (0.3%) showed similarity to T. cruzi after sequencing. These data demonstrate that dogs were exposed to and infected by T. cruzi. Thus, they can be considered sentinel animals for Chagas disease in the locality studied, which signals that there is a need for epidemiological surveillance actions.

TI  - Co-seismic landslide detection after M 7.4 earthquake on June 23. 2020, in Oaxaca, Mexico, based on rapid mapping method using high and medium resolution Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are the fourth most common natural disasters in the world, with Costa Rica and southern Mexico being the most affected regions of Central America (Froude and Petley, 2018). In this work, we propose a semi-automated method to detect earth-quake-triggered landslides for rapid mapping after a disaster event using open Sentinel-1 data. We used high-resolution TerraSAR-X data and very high-resolution Spot-7 images to compare and evaluate the accuracy of landslide distribution maps generated from the semi-automated method, applied to the M 7.1 earthquake on June 23, 2017, in Oaxaca, Mexico. The outcomes showed better accuracy in descending orbits due to 'windward-leeward' physiographic conditions, with a 50.56% quality percentage. This shows a reasonably good capacity to detect co-seismic landslides. However, the breaching factor was also high because several features, such as bare soils and agricultural areas, were incorrectly identified as co-seismic landslides. Finally, this semi-automated method establishes a basis for future improvements in methodologies applied to construct rapid mapping inventories using medium SAR scales.

TI  - Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) 2019: Prospective hospital-based surveillance for serious paediatric conditions
T2  - COMMUNICABLE DISEASES INTELLIGENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionThe Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance (PAEDS) network is an Australian hospital-based active surveillance system employing prospective case ascertainment for selected serious childhood conditions, particularly vaccine preventable diseases and potential adverse events follow-ing immunisation (AEFI). This report presents surveillance data for 2019.MethodsSpecialist nurses screened hospital admissions, emergency department records, laboratory and other data on a daily basis in seven paediatric tertiary referral hospitals across Australia, to identify chil-dren with the conditions under surveillance. Standardised protocols and case definitions were used across all sites. In 2019, the conditions under surveillance comprised: acute flaccid paralysis (AFP; a syndrome associated with poliovirus infection), acute childhood encephalitis (ACE), influenza, intus-susception (IS; a potential AEFI with rotavirus vaccines), pertussis, varicella-zoster virus infection (varicella and herpes zoster), invasive meningococcal and invasive Group A streptococcus diseases and two new conditions, Kawasaki disease and gram-negative bloodstream infections. An additional social research component continued to evaluate parental attitudes to influenza vaccination.ResultsPAEDS captured 2,701 cases for 2019 across all conditions under surveillance. Key outcomes of PAEDS included: contribution to national AFP surveillance to reach the World Health Organization reporting targets for detection of poliomyelitis cases; demonstration of high influenza activity in 2019 and influenza-associated deaths in ACE cases; identification of key barriers to influenza vac-cination of children hospitalised for acute respiratory illness; reporting of all IS cases associated with vaccine receipt to relevant state health department; and showing a further reduction nationally in varicella cases. Enhanced pertussis surveillance continued to capture controls to support vaccine efficacy estimation. Invasive meningococcal disease surveillance surveillance showed predominance of serotype B and a reduction in cases nationally. Surveillance for invasive group A streptococcus captured severe cases in children. Monitoring of Kawasaki disease incidence and gram-negative bloodstream infections commenced.ConclusionsPAEDS continues to provide unique policy-relevant data on serious paediatric conditions using sentinel hospital-based enhanced surveillance.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 satellite data to quantify grass and biomass production
T2  - FOURRAGES
M3  - Article
AB  - Grazed grass is the least expensive feed in a ration and good grass management requires knowledge of the quantities available, among other things. In order to simplify and automate these grass measurements, and thus contribute to the maintenance or even the development of grazing, the HERDECT project has focused on building methods for estimating grassland biomass using remote sensing tools (remote acquisition), and to estimate their operational feasibility.This research presents a comparison of regression methods on several variables extracted from Sentinel-2 images with field data, in order to develop prediction models of grass height and standing biomass. A set of experimental field data, collected on 18 sites mainly located in the western part of France, was used to evaluate the capacity of the models produced to estimate grass height and biomass.The biomass and grass height estimates obtained from the satellite were compared with field data from the HERDECT project farms and the "grass growth" network. The results presented show an interesting forecast quality for a mass use.

TI  - Barriers to fire spread in northern Australian tropical savannas, deriving fire edge metrics from long term high-frequency fire histories
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The savannas of northern Australia are amongst the most fire-prone landscapes in the world. However, over the last fifteen years, increasing effort has been put into reducing fire extent and severity using prescribed burning strategies early in the dry season. This study seeks to improve the application of strategic fire management by providing a more detailed understanding of the landscape features that impede fire spread in Australia's tropical savannas using long-term satellite-derived fire histories. Spatial analysis of fire edges in Kakadu National Park based on fine-scale (30 m) Landsat imagery found that most fires stopped along linear edges, which were primarily associated with known features (roads, rivers and cliffs). Further analysis found linear features with the highest stopping ability covered only 13% of the park but divided the whole park into smaller containment regions. The stopping power of each feature type was found to vary according to their width and to change during the fire season, results that could help plan strategic fuel reduction burns. Similar results were seen with the lower-resolution continental-scale MODIS satellite-derived edge data. The MODIS dataset provided a means for applying fire edge analysis to support planning in areas of northern Australia that lack fine scale fire history mapping.

TI  - Adaptive Heterogeneous Support Tensor Machine: An Extended STM for Object Recognition Using an Arbitrary Combination of Multisource Heterogeneous Remote Sensing Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple observation data from multisensor satellites lead to data with complex heterogeneous tensor structures, and the available object data are observed by the arbitrary combination of multisource satellites, which brings significant challenges to object recognition using typical deep learning methods, classical support vector machines (SVMs), and support tensor machines (STMs). To process multisource data represented as heterogeneous tensors effectively, the heterogeneous STM (HSTM) is proposed by integrating rank-R decomposition of multitensors with nu-STM to directly separate samples in heterogeneous tensor space. Furthermore, combining the shared projecting tensors used to mine related information for intercombinations and the auxiliary projecting tensors exploited to capture the individual information for intracombination, the HSTM is extended to Adaptive HSTM (AHSTM) to address the arbitrary combination of multisource data by only training once. To accelerate the training of AHSTM, the AHSTM-oriented decomposition method is proposed to use small sequential analytic optimizations instead of the original large numerical optimization. Using multiangle optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite images, experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AHSTM obtains higher accuracy than typical SVM and STM methods for each combination of multisource data and reduces the time consumption by over 75% for the training set with different sizes compared with the typical interior-point method and the active-set method.

TI  - Surface albedo spatial variability in North America: Gridded data vs. local measurements
T2  - SOLAR ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Considering the current booming interest for the large-scale deployment of bifacial photovoltaic modules, the solar industry now requires accurate estimates of broadband surface albedo at high spatial resolution. In this context, the present study evaluates the adequacy and performance over North America of two Moderate Res-olution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) white-sky albedo products (at 500-m and 1-km resolution) and the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) product at 4-km resolution. Two variations of the 500-m MODIS product are also considered: black-sky albedo and all-sky albedo. Albedo observations from 36 radiometric stations during 2011-2015 are analyzed while considering the apparent homogeneity of the surface character-istics over the 4x4 km NSRDB pixel in which they are located. Even at sites where the albedo around the station has been found "homogeneous" in the literature, marked differences are found between the daily observations and the gridded estimates at any spatial resolution. Differences in seasonal behavior and between the three different albedo types also impact the accuracy of the albedo estimates, with overtones caused by local speci-ficities and inhomogeneities. All this precludes the desirable evaluation of the local albedo at a specific site of relatively small size compared to its corresponding 4x4-km pixel if only the mean albedo over that pixel is known. Significant discrepancies are also found at snow-impacted sites, most importantly in the case of the NSRDB albedo estimates, which are typically much too high.

TI  - Fractures models comparison using GIS data around crater lakes in Cameroon volcanic line environment
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assesses the contribution of Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI images to observe existing fractures and faults of at least 12 km in length around the lakes Nyos, Monoun and Oku whose are three major crater lakes in the Cameroon Volcanic Line (CVL) environment. The results obtained using principal component analysis, directional filters and linear densities show many similarities and some differences. In fact, Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI images present 427 lineaments in common, including all known geological linear structures, certain geophysical lineaments and some new fractures. This proves that the area is much more fractured than previously known and that only the environments of lakes Nyos and Monoun are crossed by faults and fractures. Apart from the similarities, the differences observed relate to the lineaments specific to each image, their main direction, their length and the values of the fracturing densities. Also, the results show that the Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI images are suitable for the structural research in the CVL environment. But, the Landsat 8 OLI images are more efficient as they have made it possible to reconstitute almost all known geological structures and their lengths.

TI  - Improving land use land cover mapping of a neural network with three optimizers of multi-verse optimizer, genetic algorithm, and derivative-free function
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - For land management and planning, information on the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) is vital. In this research, three optimizers of the Multi-Verse Optimizer (MVO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and Derivative-free Function (DF) are developed in MATLAB programming language to improve the accuracy of remote sensing image classification using a Small-sized Neural Network (SNN). The results are compared to a Medium-sized Neural Network (MNN) developed in MATLAB programming language. Based on the test data, the MNN has the best performance with the Overall Accuracy (OA) of 92.64% for the object-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m. Based on the test data, the Derivative-free Function Multi-layer Perceptron (DFMLP) for the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m has the best performance with the OA of 89.31%. The Genetic Algorithm Multi-layer Perceptron (GAMLP) for the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 m has the least performance with a value of 74.47% for the OA. The most significant improvement was for the pixel-based Landsat-8 imagery with a spatial resolution of 15 m where the DF and GA opti-mizers have improved the results of the SNN classifier with 7.37% and similar to 8% for the OA index, respectively.

TI  - The 31-gene expression profile stratifies recurrence and metastasis risk in patients with cutaneous melanoma
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: Sentinel node biopsy is a prognostic indicator of melanoma recurrence. We hypothesized that adding the primary melanoma molecular signature from the 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test could refine the risk of recurrence prognosis for patients with stage I-III melanoma. Materials & methods: Four hundred thirty-eight patients with stage I-III melanoma consecutively tested with the 31-GEP were retrospectively analyzed. The 31-GEP stratified patients as low-risk (Class 1A), intermediate-risk (Class 1B/2A) or high risk (Class 2B) of recurrence or metastasis. Results: The 31-GEP significantly stratified patient risk for recurrence-free survival (p < 0.001), distant metastasis-free survival (p < 0.001) and melanoma-specific survival (p < 0.001) and was a significant, independent predictor of metastatic recurrence (hazard ratio: 5.38; p = 0.014). Conclusion: The 31-GEP improves prognostic accuracy in stage I-III melanoma.Lay abstract Cutaneous melanoma is a type of skin tumor affecting 100,000 new patients each year. Even with the best tools available today, knowing which patients will die from their cancer can be challenging. Using individual tumors from over 400 patients, we analyzed the expression of 31 genes from each tumor. Doing this helped us split the patients into groups who are more or less likely to die from their tumor. By combining this technique with current medical practices and guidelines, we hope to help identify which patients may or may not benefit from more intense therapies.

TI  - A Nuclear Generator of Clouds: Accidents and Radioactive Contamination Identified on Declassified Satellite Photographs in the <i>Mayak</i> Chemical Combine, Southern Urals
T2  - CAMBRIDGE ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mayak Chemical Combine was one of the most secretive places in the Soviet Union. It was built in the southern Urals, close to Kyshtym. The facility produced weapons-grade plutonium and other radioactive isotopes for the Soviet nuclear military programme. Fugitives from behind the Iron Curtain mentioned the site, usually due to accidents and peculiar, unexplained observations. Such reports were often treated in the West as exaggerated or fictional, as they spoke of large-scale disasters, deportations and vast landscape transformations. This paper aims to present the research potential of declassified Cold War intelligence records for archaeological landscape studies of off-limits military sites. To outline a somewhat broader perspective, I will combine those sources with contemporary historical knowledge and modern remote sensing data. The analysis will be focused on the Central Intelligence Agency [CIA] satellite imagery (CORONA and GAMBIT) from the 1960s to the beginning of the 1970s. The discussed sources recorded outcomes of nuclear disasters, hundreds of square kilometres of uninhabited wasteland, abandoned villages, disappearing lakes, dying forests, diverted rivers, and other features related to this clandestine plutonium facility.

TI  - Local climate zone classification using a multi-scale, multi-level attention network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Local Climate Zones (LCZ) offer a climate-aware and standardized classification scheme composed of 17 urban and natural landscape classes. Recent deep learning-based LCZ classification studies have adopted a scene classification approach with computer vision-inspired models. In light of these advancements, this study introduces a multi-scale, multi-level attention network (MSMLA-Net) for deep learning-based LCZ classification. MSMLA-Net integrates a multi-scale (MS) module to generate multi-scale features from the input data and a novel multi-level attention (MLA) module as a branch unit from the model's main ResNet backbone. MLA uses the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) at multiple stages to generate multi-level spatially and spectrally enhanced features for context aggregation. This study presents comprehensive model-based experiments on model depth, the individual and combined influence of MS and MLA modules, and the addition of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, data-based experiments are conducted to determine optimal Sentinel-2 spectral bands, while OpenStreetMap (OSM) building data, ALOS World 3D DSM height information, and a national land cover map are included as ancillary bands. LCZ classification tests are conducted on six major cities in South Korea. With regards to model-based performance, MSMLA-Net was built using a modified SE-ResNet50 backbone (MSMLA-50) and obtained the best classification results using 48 by 48-pixel input patches with a combination of all Sentinel-2 and ancillary bands, outperforming three state-of-the-art LCZ classification models. In particular, only MSMLA-50 reached over 70% built-up overall accuracy and maintained high accuracy even when tested on completely unseen areas in a "citywise" leave-one-out sampling strategy. For data-based results, the combination of Sentinel-2 Red Edge bands were helpful, mainly due to the greater number of available bands. Training only ancillary data generated up to 75.0% for built-up overall accuracy, albeit at the cost of low natural overall accuracy. Using all available bands and ancillary data produced the best results, but a combination of only OSM and Sentinel-2 bands also generated comparable accuracy. Ultimately, the proposed MSMLA-Net bridges advanced computer vision techniques such as attention mechanisms and multi-level context aggregation to improve LCZ classification. The MS and MLA modules can be applied on different backbones, sophisticated sampling schemes, and data inputs to flexibly achieve improved classification results.

TI  - Urbanization and urban land use efficiency: Evidence from regional and Addis Ababa satellite cities, Ethiopia
T2  - HABITAT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ethiopia has experienced rapid urbanization over the past three decades. Several cities expanded rapidly and many satellite towns sprung up around the major cities. The high rate of urbanization and urban growth resulted in high demand for urban land, mainly for industrial, commercial, and residential purposes. In order to meet the demand, an enormous amount of land has been made available for urban use, mainly through land conversion. However, we know very little about how efficiently cities use urban land. This paper investigated the urban land use efficiency (ULUE) of sixteen cities in Ethiopia. Remote sensing data (Landsat 7/8) was analysed with ArcGIS to assess spatiotemporal land use changes between 2007 and 2019. Built-up environment footprints were computed from Google Earth imagery. The ratio of land consumption to population growth rate, and the rate of urban infill were assessed. The findings revealed a prevalence of urban land use inefficiencies in all cities. In most cities, the rate of land consumption far exceeds the population growth rate. Densification (urban infill) is low and slow. A considerable part of the converted agricultural land sits idle within the built-up area for many years. Low ULUE is what fuels urban sprawl, fragmentation and informal settlements. This study emphasised the need to implement urban policies and practices aimed at improving ULUE. Improving ULUE is imperative to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; ensuring sustainable urban land use; addressing land prices and housing shortages; protecting farmland and ecosystems; tackling land hoarding, urban sprawl and informal settlements.

M3  - Article
AB  - Habitat mapping is an essential tool to implement the European Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC and to manage the Natura 2000 protected areas network. However, their elaboration is most often based on field surveys, which are time-consuming and expensive when dealing with large areas. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the contribution of Sentinel-2 satellite images for mapping habitats of the Natura 2000 site 'Estuaire de la Loire'. We used 1,248 phytosociological plots to establish a complete typology of the study site's habitats. Locating these plots led us to select training areas that characterize 39 habitats to calibrate the Random Forest algorithm. We classified 11 single-date images spread evenly over a year and performed a multi-date classification of 9 images. We obtained high overall accuracy between 76.47% and 87.28% for the single-date image classifications and 98.7% for multi-date image classification. Our results demonstrate that Sentinel-2 images are appropriate for accurate habitat mapping and constitute a relevant tool to identify and conserve habitats of community interest.

TI  - Integration of urban expansion with hybrid road transport network development within Haldia Municipality, West Bengal
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapidly growing cities in developing countries like India are facing some concerns such as unplanned and unsystematic urban growth. The port based industrial development plays a pivotal role for growth of urban expansion and transport development over once the agricultural dominant area in Haldia Municipality, West Bengal. This study emphasised on the relationship between urban expansion and transport development using various geospatial and statistical techniques. Land use/cover maps have been prepared in ArcGIS v.10.1 for 2001 and 2018 with the help of Landsat images then road network connectivity was analysed using statistical techniques and GIS environment. Kernel density was used for analysing hybrid road network density. Finally, correlation technique was applied to find out the spatial relationship between the exiting transportation and population. Based on the results, we found the value of coefficient of determination as 0.651 that means transportation development is rigidly controlled by population density. So, urban area was expanded day after day through the huge population pressure over the study area. Moreover, hybrid road transport networks were developed which are well connected to all the fringe areas from the city centre for providing better transport accessibility and facility. But, the planning of urban area through transportation is required to give more attention on proper allocation of others urban services especially for the city people.

TI  - The involvement of axillary reverse mapping nodes in patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Axillary reverse mapping (ARM) was developed to preserve the lymphatic drainage from the upper arm during sentinel lymph-node (SLN) biopsy or axillary lymph-node dissection (ALND). However, the oncological safety of ARM has been controversial because of not infrequent involvement of ARM nodes. Methods Patients with clinically negative nodes (cN0) underwent SLN biopsy and ARM. SLNs were identified using blue dye and radioisotope, and ARM nodes were traced using the fluorescent method. Patients with positive SLN underwent the standard ALND. After surgery, they were followed up for more than 3 years. Results A total of 507 patients with cN0 breast cancer were enrolled between May 2009 and November 2017. SLNs were identified in 499 (98%) of 507 patients, and ARM nodes were identified in 159 (31%) patients in the SLN field. The crossover rate of SLN-ARM nodes was 28%. Among 95 patients with positive SLNs, 70 patients underwent conventional ALND. ARM nodes were identified in 65 (93%) of those patients in the ALND field. The mean number of removed ARM nodes was 7.2 (range 0-25) in patients who underwent the standard ALND. Although ARM nodes were involved in 18 of 65 patients, the involved ARM nodes were the same SLNs identified in 14 (78%) patients. Since SLN-ARM nodes should be removed, ARM nodes were involved only in 4 (5.7%) patients after SLN biopsy. Conclusions Except for positive SLN-ARM nodes, the involvement of ARM nodes is infrequent in patients with positive SLN.

TI  - Tracking forest loss and fragmentation between 1930 and 2020 in Asian elephant (<i>Elephas maximus</i>) range in Nepal
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover is the primary determinant of elephant distribution, thus, understanding forest loss and fragmentation is crucial for elephant conservation. We assessed deforestation and patterns of forest fragmentation between 1930 and 2020 in Chure Terai Madhesh Lanscape (CTML) which covers the entire elephant range in Nepal. Forest cover maps and fragmentation matrices were generated using multi-source data (Topographic maps and Landsat satellite images of 1930, 1975, 2000, and 2020) and spatiotemporal change was quantified. At present, 19,069 km(2) forest cover in CTML is available as the elephant habitat in Nepal. Overall, 21.5% of elephant habitat was lost between 1930 and 2020, with a larger (12.3%) forest cover loss between 1930 and 1975. Area of the large forests (Core 3) has decreased by 43.08% whereas smaller patches (Core 2, Core 1, edge and patch forests) has increased multifold between 1930 and 2020. The continued habitat loss and fragmentation probably fragmented elephant populations during the last century and made them insular with long-term ramifications for elephant conservation and human-elephant conflict. Given the substantial loss in forest cover and high levels of fragmentation, improving the resilience of elephant populations in Nepal would urgently require habitat and corridor restoration to enable the movement of elephants.

TI  - Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), trace elements and life history parameters of mass-stranded common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) in New Zealand
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Profiles of 33 PFAS analytes and 12 essential and non-essential trace elements were measured in livers of stranded common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) from New Zealand. PFAS concentrations reported were largely comparable to those measured in other marine mammal species globally and composed mostly of long-chain compounds including perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA), per-fluorotridecanoic acid (PFTrDA) and perfluorooctanesulfonamide (FOSA). PFAS profiles did not vary signifi-cantly by location, body condition, or life history. Notably, significant positive correlations were observed within respective PFAS and trace elements. However, only negative correlations were evident between these two contaminant types, suggesting different exposure and metabolic pathways. Age-associated concentrations were found for PFTrDA and four trace elements, i.e. silver, mercury, cadmium, selenium, indicating differences in the bioaccumulation biomagnification mechanisms. Overall, our results contribute to global understanding of accumulation of PFAS by offering first insights of PFAS exposure in cetaceans living within South Pacific Aus-tralasian waters.

TI  - Genomic prediction modeling of soybean biomass using UAV-based remote sensing and longitudinal model parameters
T2  - PLANT GENOME
M3  - Article
AB  - The application of remote sensing in plant breeding can provide rich information about the growth processes of plants, which leads to better understanding concerning crop yield. It has been shown that traits measured by remote sensing were also beneficial for genomic prediction (GP) because the inclusion of remote sensing data in multitrait models improved prediction accuracies of target traits. However, the present multitrait GP model cannot incorporate high-dimensional remote sensing data due to the difficulty in the estimation of a covariance matrix among the traits, which leads to failure in improving its prediction accuracy. In this study, we focused on growth models to express growth patterns using remote sensing data with a few parameters and investigated whether a multitrait GP model using these parameters could derive better prediction accuracy of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] biomass. A total of 198 genotypes of soybean germplasm were cultivated in experimental fields, and longitudinal changes of their canopy height and area were measured continuously via remote sensing with an unmanned aerial vehicle. Growth parameters were estimated by applying simple growth models and incorporated into the GP of biomass. By evaluating heritability and correlation, we showed that the estimated growth parameters appropriately represented the observed growth curves. Also, the use of these growth parameters in the multitrait GP model contributed to successful biomass prediction. We conclude that the growth models could describe the genetic variation of soybean growth curves based on several growth parameters. These dimension-reduction growth models will be indispensable for extracting useful information from remote sensing data and using this data in GP and plant breeding.

TI  - Performance of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence for Detecting Lymph Node Metastasis in Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL GENITOURINARY CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose:: The use of sentinel lymph node dissection in several cancers has been gaining attention with the emergence of indocyanine green fluorescence. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the diagnostic performance of indocyanine green fluorescence in detecting lymph node metastasis in prostate cancer patients. Methods: : A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS on November 30, 2020, to identify eligible studies. Studies were eligible if they investigated the diagnostic performance of indocyanine green fluorescence before pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer patients and reported the number of true positives, false positives, false negatives, and true negatives on lymph node-based analysis in comparison to histopathologic findings in the dissected specimen. Results:: Our systematic review covered 11 studies published between 2011 and 2020, with 519 patients, and our meta-analysis included 9 studies with 479 patients. Based on lymph node analysis of indocyanine green fluorescence, the results showed pooled sensitivity and specificity at 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49 to 0.90) and 0.66 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.70), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was 6.0 (95%CI 2 to 21). Several lymphatic drainage routes also showed sentinel lymph nodes localized outside the ordinal pelvic lymph node template. Conclusions:: We noted relatively low diagnostic performance for lymph node metastasis, suggesting that indocyanine fluorescence may not currently be a viable alternative to pelvic lymph node dissection in prostate cancer patients. However, this technique shows novel lymphatic drainage routes and underscores the importance of lymph nodes not removed in ordinary dissection. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Identifying important connectivity areas for the wide-ranging Asian elephant across conservation landscapes of Northeast India
T2  - DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Connectivity is increasingly important for landscape-scale conservation programmes. Yet there are obstacles to developing reliable connectivity maps, including paucity of data on animal use of the non-habitat matrix. Our aim was to identify important connectivity areas for the endangered Asian elephant Elephas maximus across a 21,210 km(2) region using empirical data and recently developed animal movement models. Location Northeast India. Methods We interviewed 1,184 respondents, primarily farmers, residing across our study region, to collect crowd-sourced data on elephant use of the matrix. We generated a classified land use/land cover map and collated remotely sensed data on environmental and anthropogenic covariates. We used logistic regression to estimate the influence of these covariates on resistance, based on elephant detections recorded via interviews. We modelled elephant movement within the randomised shortest path framework, which allows for scenarios ranging from optimal movement with complete information on the landscape to random movement with no information on the landscape. We calculated the passage of elephants through pixels in our study region, a parameter that denotes the expected number of elephant movements through a particular pixel across movement routes. We overlaid linear infrastructure sourced from secondary data, and human-elephant conflict hotspots generated from our interview data, on passage maps. Results Elephants preferred locations with high vegetation cover, close to forests and with low human population density. We mapped important connectivity areas across the study region, including in three important conservation landscapes. Whilst forests facilitated connectivity, the matrix also played an important contributory role to elephant dispersal. Incorporating information on environmental and anthropogenic drivers of elephant movement added value to connectivity predictions. Main conclusions Fine-scale mapping of connectivity, using empirical data and realistic movement models, such as the approach we use, can provide for informed and more effective landscape-scale conservation.

TI  - Attention-Based Multistage Fusion Network for Remote Sensing Image Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening is a significant branch in the field of remote sensing image processing, the goal of which is to fuse panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images through certain rules to generate high-resolution MS (HRMS) images. Therefore, how to improve the spatial and spectral resolutions of the fused image is the problem that we need to solve urgently. In this article, a multistage remote sensing image fusion network (MRFNet) is proposed on the basis of in-depth research and exploration on the fusion of the PAN and MS images to obtain a clear fused image that can reflect the ground features more comprehensively and completely. The proposed network consists of three stages that are connected by cross-stage fusion. The first two stages are used to extract the features of the PAN and MS images. The structure of the encoder-decoder and the channel attention module are used to extract the features of the remote sensing image in the channel domain. The third stage is the image reconstruction stage fusing the extracted features with the original image to improve the spatial and spectral resolutions of the fused result. A series of experiments are conducted on the benchmark datasets WorldView II, GF-2, and QuickBird. Qualitative analysis and quantitative comparison show the superiority of MRFNet in visual effects and the values of evaluation indicators.

AB  - BackgroundPakistan has been experiencing intervals of sporadic cases and localized outbreaks in the last two decades. No proper study has been carried out in order to find out the environmental burden of toxigenic V. cholerae as well as how temporal and environmental factors associated in driving cholera across the country.MethodsWe tested waste water samples from designated national environment surveillance sites in Pakistan with RT-PCR assay. Multistage sampling technique were utilized for samples collection and for effective sample processing Bag-Mediated Filtration system, were employed.Resultswere analysed by district and month wise to understand the geographic distribution and identify the seasonal pattern of V. cholera detection in Pakistan. Results Between May 2019, and February 2020, we obtained and screened 160 samples in 12 districts across Pakistan. Out of 16 sentinel environmental surveillance sites, 15 sites showed positive results against cholera toxigenic gene with mostly lower CT value (mean, 34 +/- 2) and have significant difference (p < 0.05). The highest number of positive samples were collected from Sindh in month of November, then in June it is circulating in different districts of Pakistan including four Provinces respectively.ConclusionV. cholera detection do not follow a clear seasonal pattern. However, the poor sanitation problems or temperature and rainfall may potentially influence the frequency and duration of cholera across the country. Occurrence of toxigenic V. cholerae in the environment samples showed that cholera is endemic, which is an alarming for a potential future cholera outbreaks in the country.

TI  - Local Estimation of Ionospheric Parameters from Single-Station Observations of Low-Orbiting Beacon Satellites
T2  - RADIOPHYSICS AND QUANTUM ELECTRONICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose a method for local estimation of ionospheric parameters (vertical total electron content and critical frequencies f(0F2)) from single-station observations of low-orbiting beacon satellites in the vicinity of the reception station. We demonstrate the capabilities of this technique using the data from two receiving stations located in Moscow (Russia) and Gakona (Alaska, USA). The critical frequencies f(0F2) calculated using the data from satellite signal receivers are compared with those based on the ionosondes in Moscow and Gakona. The correlation coefficients based on the ionosonde and satellite data processed by the proposed method are 0.85-0.86. A possibility for constructing local indicators of ionospheric disturbances, which are sensitive to geomagnetic conditions, is discussed.

TI  - Background 210Po activity concentrations in Greenland marine biota and dose assessment
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Polonium-210 (210Po) is a radionuclide sentinel as it bioaccumulates in marine organisms, thereby being the main contributor to committed dietary doses in seafood consumers. Although seafood and marine mammals are an important part of the traditional Inuit diet, there is a general lack of information on the 210Po concentrations in the Greenlandic marine food chain leading to the human consumer. Here, we determine background 210Po concentrations in edible parts of different marine organisms from Greenland and provide a dose assessment. Blue mussels (Mytilus edulis), organs of ringed seal (Pusa hispida) and polar bear (Ursus maritimus) displayed significantly elevated 210Po concentrations in respect to all other studied organisms (p < 0.001). 210Po concentrations ranged from 0.02 Bq kg-1, w.w. in Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) muscle to 78 Bq kg-1, w.w. and 202 Bq kg-1, w.w. in ringed seal muscle and kidneys, respectively. 210Po concentration ratio for edible parts increases in the order bladderwrack (Fucus Vesiculosus), northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), blue mussels, and from fish species to ringed seal and polar bear. 210Po distribution in fish, ringed seal, and polar bear follows a general pattern, the lowest concentrations were in muscle, and the highest concentrations were in the organs involved in metabolism. The derived 210Po annual absorbed dose in edible parts of studied marine organisms are several orders of magnitude lower than the recommended dose rate screening value of 10 mu Gy h-1. Effective doses from intake of 210Po to Greenland average children (1.4 mSv y-1), and high seafood and marine mammal consumers (2 mSv y-1 for adults and 3.6 mSv y-1for children) are higher than the world average annual effective dose due to ingestion of naturally occurring radionuclides.

TI  - Large scale mapping of forest attributes using heterogeneous sets of airborne laser scanning and National Forest Inventory data
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Norwegian forest resource map (SR16) maps forest attributes by combining national forest inventory (NFI), airborne laser scanning (ALS) and other remotely sensed data. While the ALS data were acquired over a time interval of 10 years using various sensors and settings, the NFI data are continuously collected. Aims of this study were to analyze the effects of stratification on models linking remotely sensed and field data, and assess the accuracy overall and at the ALS project level. Materials and methods The model dataset consisted of 9203 NFI field plots and data from 367 ALS projects, covering 17 Mha and 2/3 of the productive forest in Norway. Mixed-effects regression models were used to account for differences among ALS projects. Two types of stratification were used to fit models: 1) stratification by the three main tree species groups spruce, pine and deciduous resulted in species-specific models that can utilize a satellite-based species map for improving predictions, and 2) stratification by species and maturity class resulted in stratum-specific models that can be used in forest management inventories where each stand regularly is visually stratified accordingly. Stratified models were compared to general models that were fit without stratifying the data. Results The species-specific models had relative root-mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 35%, 34%, 31%, and 12% for volume, aboveground biomass, basal area, and Lorey's height, respectively. These RMSEs were 2-7 percentage points (pp) smaller than those of general models. When validating using predicted species, RMSEs were 0-4 pp. smaller than those of general models. Models stratified by main species and maturity class further improved RMSEs compared to species-specific models by up to 1.8 pp. Using mixed-effects models over ordinary least squares models resulted in a decrease of RMSE for timber volume of 1.0-3.9 pp., depending on the main tree species. RMSEs for timber volume ranged between 19%-59% among individual ALS projects. Conclusions The stratification by tree species considerably improved models of forest structural variables. A further stratification by maturity class improved these models only moderately. The accuracy of the models utilized in SR16 were within the range reported from other ALS-based forest inventories, but local variations are apparent.

TI  - A seasonal algorithm of the snow-covered area fraction for mountainous terrain
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The snow cover spatial variability in mountainous terrain changes considerably over the course of a snow season. In this context, fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) is an essential model parameter characterizing how much ground surface in a grid cell is currently covered by snow. We present a seasonal fSCA algorithm using a recent scale-independent fSCA parameterization. For the seasonal implementation, we track snow depth (HS) and snow water equivalent (SWE) and account for several alternating accumulation-ablation phases. Besides tracking HS and SWE, the seasonal fSCA algorithm only requires subgrid terrain parameters from a fine-scale summer digital elevation model. We implemented the new algorithm in a multilayer energy balance snow cover model. To evaluate the spatiotemporal changes in modeled fSCA, we compiled three independent fSCA data sets derived from airborne-acquired fine-scale HS data and from satellite and terrestrial imagery. Overall, modeled daily 1 km fSCA values had normalized root mean square errors of 7 %, 12 % and 21 % for the three data sets, and some seasonal trends were identified. Comparing our algorithm performances to the performances of the CLM5.0 fSCA algorithm implemented in the multilayer snow cover model demonstrated that our full seasonal fSCA algorithm better represented seasonal trends. Overall, the results suggest that our seasonal fSCA algorithm can be applied in other geographic regions by any snow model application.

TI  - Validation of Australian atmospheric aerosols from reanalysis data and CMIP6 simulations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the performance of different data sources in representing the spatio-temporal characteristics of aerosol species over Australia, which is one of the primary sources of dust in the Southern Hemisphere and an important contributor to global biomass burning emissions. First, NASA/MERRA2 and ECMWF/CAMS Total AOD550nm are evaluated against 16 AERONET stations during 2003-2018, with CAMS consistently underestimating (-15%) and MERRA2 overestimating (19%) the total AOD. Despite the differences in magnitudes, both reanalyses capture the measured Australian aerosols' seasonal and interannual variability, mainly modulated by seasonal biomass burning and episodic dust storms. CAMS performs remarkably well in low aerosol conditions, while MERRA2 captures extreme aerosol events better. The intercomparison of the different aerosol species from the two reanalyses confirms that CAMS shows lower mean aerosol species concentrations than MERRA2. Results show the greatest differences (more than 50%) in sea salt and sulfates, while organic matter AOD is similarly represented between both reanalyses, with differences of roughly 3%. The spatial distribution and annual cycle of the aerosol types are also compared. In both reanalyses, carbonaceous AOD (black carbon and organic matter) are predominant in the northern part of the country during austral spring, and are highly correlated with MODIS active fires. Dust aerosols prevail in central Australia in summer, and sulfates in the main urban areas throughout the year. However, unlike the other species, sea salt exhibits opposite annual cycles in the two reanalyses. Finally, both MERRA2 and CAMS are used to evaluate the historical simulations of 16 GCM from CMIP6. The models capture the Australian aerosols' annual variation, although they tend to overestimate dust and underrepresent biomass burning AOD. IPSL-CM6A-LR and EC-Earth3-AerChem perform particularly well simulating aerosols over Australia. The evaluation of Australian aerosols performed in this study could contribute to reanalysis and climate model improvements, as well as improving long-term solar energy resources assessment.

AB  - Hyperthermia is defined as an elevated body temperature above the normal range due to a failure of heat regulatory mechanisms. In addition to its effects on other organ systems, hyperthermia is associated with profound cardiovascular effects. We report the sentinel case of a 6-year-old girl with structurally and electrically normal heart, who presented with life-threatening hyperpyrexia-induced ventricular tachycardia, which was refractory to cardioversion and anti-arrhythmics but responded promptly to cooling. We emphasise the lifesaving role of immediate and aggressive cooling in such patients.

TI  - Multiscale assessment of land surface phenology from harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2, PlanetScope, and PhenoCam imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - As the spatial and temporal resolution of remotely sensed imagery has improved over the last four decades, algorithms for monitoring and mapping seasonal changes in surface properties have evolved rapidly. Most recently, the availability of daily PlanetScope imagery has created new opportunities for monitoring the land surface phenology (LSP) of terrestrial ecosystems at high spatial resolution. However, the quality and value of LSP information from PlanetScope imagery have not been systematically examined. In this paper, we evaluate the character and quality of LSP information derived from PlanetScope by comparing time series of vegetation indices and LSP metrics from PlanetScope to corresponding time series and LSP metrics derived from Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery and PhenoCams at six sites that span a diverse range of land cover types and climate. Results show that vegetation index time series from all three data sources show high temporal correlation, and LSP metrics derived from HLS, PlanetScope, and PhenoCam show high agreement with negligible bias. Semi-variograms for phenometrics estimated from PlanetScope imagery indicate that the majority of spatial variance captured in PlanetScope phenometrics occurs well below the spatial resolution HLS imagery. At the same time, LSP metrics from HLS are most strongly correlated with the 50-75% quantiles of 3 m LSP metrics from PlanetScope. This indicates that HLS captures the average phenology at sub-pixel scale captured in PlanetScope imagery. Our results represent the first comprehensive comparison of LSP metrics estimated from PlanetScope and publicly available moderate spatial resolution imagery, and provide insights regarding: (1) the quality and character of LSP metrics derived from HLS and PlanetScope; and (2) the relative merits and trade-offs associated with the use of each data source for LSP studies.

TI  - Deep feature learning and latent space encoding for crop phenology analysis
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions of the Vegetation and Environment monitoring New Micro-Satellite (VEN mu S) satellite data facilitate field-level phenological analysis of crops. This study proposes deep learning (DL) based approaches to resolve the issues prevalent in crop phenology-based fingerprint estimation at field-level using VEN mu S satellite data. An encoder-decoder-based framework, called piece-wise kernel encoding network (PKNet), is proposed for missing data imputation of the vegetation index (VI) curves derived from time-series image data. PKNet adopts interpolation-based convolution, dynamic time wrapping (DTW) based layer formulation, and imputation-specific constraints for optimal smoothing of the irregularly sampled VI curves. Besides, PKNet learns kernel parameters dynamically. A variational encoding framework called a dynamic-projection-based generalization network (DPGNet), is proposed to generalize the pixel-level VI curves to synthesize a representative VI curve for a given field. DPGNet is more effective than the use of multiple moments as it is resilient to outliers and learns normally distributed latent space with a small number of samples. The current research also proposes a classifier, called dynamic time wrapping based capsule network (DTCapsNet), which learns a discriminative latent space and accurately models the VI curve features. The DTCapsNet considers the time-series nature of the input using DTW-based convolution layers. The feature characterization improves generalizability and gives good results, even with a limited number of training samples. Experiments using the ground truth information and satellite images, acquired over two farms in Israel, illustrate that the proposed frameworks give better results than the commonly-used existing approaches.

TI  - Surface composition of debris-covered glaciers across the Himalaya using linear spectral unmixing of Landsat 8 OLI imagery
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalaya mountain range is characterized by highly glacierized, complex, dynamic topography. The ablation area of Himalayan glaciers often features a highly heterogeneous debris mantle comprising ponds, steep and shallow slopes of various aspects, variable debris thickness, and exposed ice cliffs associated with differing ice ablation rates. Understanding the composition of the supraglacial debris cover is essential for a proper understanding of glacier hydrology and glacier-related hazards. Until recently, efforts to map debris-covered glaciers from remote sensing focused primarily on glacier extent rather than surface characteristics and relied on traditional whole-pixel image classification techniques. Spectral unmixing routines, rarely used for debris-covered glaciers, allow decomposition of a pixel into constituting materials, providing a more realistic representation of glacier surfaces. Here we use linear spectral unmixing of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images (30 m) to obtain fractional abundance maps of the various supraglacial surfaces (debris material, clean ice, supraglacial ponds and vegetation) across the Himalaya around the year 2015. We focus on the debris-covered glacier extents as defined in the database of global distribution of supraglacial debris cover. The spectrally unmixed surfaces are subsequently classified to obtain maps of composition of debris-covered glaciers across sample regions.We test the unmixing approach in the Khumbu region of the central Himalaya, and we evaluate its performance for supraglacial ponds by comparison with independently mapped ponds from high-resolution Pleiades (2 m) and Planet-Scope imagery (3 m) for sample glaciers in two other regions with differing topo-climatic conditions. Spectral unmixing applied over the entire Himalaya mountain range (a supraglacial debris cover area of 2254 km(2)) indicates that at the end of the ablation season, debris-covered glacier zones comprised 60.9% light debris, 23.8% dark debris, 5.6% clean ice, 4.5% supraglacial vegetation, 2.1% supraglacial ponds, and small amounts of cloud cover (2 %), with 1.2% unclassified areas. The spectral unmixing performed satisfactorily for the supraglacial pond and vegetation classes (an F score of similar to 0.9 for both classes) and reasonably for the debris classes (F score of 0.7).Supraglacial ponds were more prevalent in the monsoon-influenced central-eastern Himalaya (up to 4% of the debris-covered area) compared to the monsoon-dry transition zone (only 0.3 %) and in regions with lower glacier elevations. Climatic controls (higher average temperatures and more abundant precipitation), coupled with higher glacier thinning rates and lower average glacier velocities, further favour pond incidence and the development of supraglacial vegetation. With continued advances in satellite data and further method refinements, the approach presented here provides avenues towards achieving large-scale, repeated mapping of supraglacial features.

TI  - INVERTED CHANNEL VARIATIONS IDENTIFIED ON A DISTAL PORTION OF A BAJADA IN THE CENTRAL ATACAMA DESERT, CHILE
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In deserts, the interplay between occasional fluvial events and persistent aeolian erosion can form composite modern and relict surfaces, especially on the distal portion of alluvial fans. There, relief inversion of alluvial deposits by differential erosion can form longitudinal ridges. We identified two distinct ridge types formed by relief inversion on converging alluvial fans in the hyperarid Chilean Atacama Desert. Although they are co-located and similar in scale, the ridge types have different ages and formation histories that apparently correspond to minor paleoclimate variations. Gravel-armored ridges are remnants of deflated alluvial deposits with a bimodal sediment distribution (gravel and sand) dated to a minor pluvial phase at the end of the Late Pleistocene (similar to 12 kyr). In contrast, younger (similar to 9 kyr) sulfate-capped ridges formed during a minor arid phase with evaporite deposition in a pre-existing channel that armored the underlying deposits. Collectively, inverted channels at Salar de Llamara resulted from multiple episodes of surface overland flow and standing water spanning several thousand years. Based on ridge relief and age, the minimum long-term deflation rate is 0.1-0.2 m/kyr, driven primarily by wind erosion. This case study is an example of the equifinality concept whereby different processes lead to similar landforms. The complex history of the two ridge types can only be generally constrained in remotely sensed data. In situ observations are required to discern the specifics of the aqueous history, including the flow type, magnitude, sequence, and paleoenvironment. These findings have relevance for interpreting similar landforms on Mars.

TI  - Application of Single-Hole Laparoscopy and Sentinel Lymph Node Imaging in Early Endometrial Carcinoma in Special Population
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. To explore the clinical efficacy of single-hole laparoscopy combined with sentinel lymph node imaging in the treatment of early endometrial carcinoma in a special population. Method. A retrospective analysis was made on the clinicopathological data of 8 patients with early endometrial carcinoma who underwent extra fascial total hysterectomy plus double adnexal resection and pelvic sentinel lymphadenectomy by transumbilical single-hole laparoscopy in Jiaxing Maternal and Child Health Hospital from Apr. 2019 to Apr. 2021. Result. Single-hole laparoscopy and sentinel lymph node imaging were successfully performed in 8 patients with early endometrial carcinoma, and none of them was converted to porous or laparotomy. At the same time, all 8 patients have a high demand for body shape. All FIGO pathological grades were grade I before operation. Operation time is 160.87 +/- 40.61 min, amount of bleeding is 68.75 +/- 12.31 ml, the catheter was removed for 2 days, anal exhaust time is 30.13 +/- 10.99 h, and postoperative hospital stay is 4.00 +/- 1.07 d. There was no related organ injury during the operation, no case of blood transfusion, or case of poor wound healing. The evaluation of postoperative satisfaction was very satisfactory. Conclusion. The application of single-hole laparoscopy and sentinel lymph node imaging in the treatment of early endometrial carcinoma in the special population should be safe and feasible with high satisfaction.

TI  - Evaluation of vertical accuracy of different digital elevation models sources for Buraydah city
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are used in a variety of applications and in different scientific disciplines. Analysis of the DEM datasets for these applications requires information about the quality of the elevation data. In this paper, the quality of several DEM datasets has been compared with Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) ground control points for Buraydah city, Saudi Arabia. The DEM datasets include high resolution DEM data extracted from 1-m contour maps (CON-DEM), the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS World 3D) 30 m resolution, Shuttle Radar Topography Mapping Mission (SRTM) 30 m resolution and Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER GDEM) 30 m resolution images. The vertical accuracy assessment measures were calculated assuming the normality and non-normality of the encountered errors after removing outliers from the elevation's differences. All DEM datasets represent a strong correlation of DEM errors in comparison with the reference data. The CON-DEM has the highest accuracy of 1.446 m root mean square error (RMSE) followed by ALOS AW3D30 datasets of accuracy 1.746 m. In contrast, the SRTM and ASTER GDEM datasets have the lowest accuracies (2.583 m and 5.667 m RMSE respectively). In addition, results of the robust estimates such as the normalized median (NMAD) and the absolute deviation at the 90% quantile (LE90) are produced to refine the results for non-normal error distribution datasets. The calculations show slight differences of the statistical estimates for some DEM datasets that represent non-normality of the elevation difference when compared with the reference data.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy after Previous Radical Lymphadenectomy of the Same Lymph Node Basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to determine the feasibility of preoperative lymphoscintigraphy and intraoperative radio-guided sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients previously submitted to complete lymphadenectomy (CL) in the same region. There is no current proposal to stage patients diagnosed with a new melanoma after SLNB if the regional lymph node (LN) was removed, preventing this specific population from adjuvant treatments due to understaging. Methods: We assessed six cases of patients with a previous cancer diagnosis (melanoma, breast, or thyroid cancer) who had undergone CL and later developed a new cutaneous melanoma in the same extremity submitted to CL. They underwent preoperative lymphoscintigraphy to locate the sentinel lymph node (SLN), followed by a radio-guided SLNB with the assistance of patent blue dye. A pathologist then evaluated the excised SLN. Results: We had 100% feasibility, all six patients had their SLN located, and three (50%) patients tested positive for metastasis in the excised LNs. Conclusions: All these patients met the criteria to undergo SLNB, but no previous reports demonstrated and corroborated the performance of this procedure in this situation. SLNB with expected drainage for regions previously submitted to a radical lymphadenectomy is a safe and effective procedure. A lymphoscintigraphy allows locating the SLN that is likely to be resected in surgery. In this scenario, we had a 50% positivity, providing how relevant and essential this information is for the prognosis and practical therapeutical approaches for this rare but relevant melanoma population.

TI  - Characterization of released dust over open waters in the south of the Iran Plateau based on satellite and ground-based measurements
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite recordings by CALIPSO and Aqua-MODIS, available data on the Aerosol Robotic Net-work (AERONET), and synoptic stations have been used to investigate dust storms over the Persian Gulf and the Oman Sea from January 2007 to December 2019. We found that the depo-larization of lidar signals by atmospheric dust particles is quite sensitive to their origins (deserts, or alluvial sediments). In the CALIPSO data set, the depolarization just over the thickness of an aerosol layer is called as the integrated depolarization ratio (IPDR). The IPDR and MODIS aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the mentioned waters are in correlation with the changes in the wind pattern over the region and activities of different dust sources in the neighborhoods of the waters. This investigation shows that the highest IPDR values belong to the dust particles which are originating from the Arabian Peninsula and impacting almost all regions in the south of the Iran Plateau from February to May. Also, these waters are under considerable influence of the Mesopotamian region and dust sources at the east side of the plateau. These sources are almost composed of alluvial sediments, and the IPDR for particles rising from them, is not high as those from the Arabian desert. Even though intense dust plumes raised from sources in the East of the Plateau impact these waters very frequently in summertime, but largest dust particles belong to the plumes originating from the Arabian desert in spring.

TI  - Axillary ultrasound and fine-needle aspiration cytology to predict clinically relevant nodal burden in breast cancer patients
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Axillary lymph node involvement is one important prognostic factor in breast cancer, but the way to access this information has been modified over the years. This study evaluated if axillary ultrasound (US) coupled with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) can accurately predict clinically relevant node metastasis in patients with breast cancer, and thus assist clinical decisions Methods This is a cross-sectional study with retrospective data collection of 241 individuals (239 women and 2 men) with unilateral operable breast cancer who were submitted to preoperative axillary assessment by physical exam, US and FNAC if suspicious nodes by imaging. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the methods. We compared the patient's characteristics using chi-square test, parametrics and non-parametrics statistics according to the variable. Results The most sensible method was US (0.59; 95% CI, 0.50-0.69), and the most specific was US coupled with FNAC (0.97; 95% CI, 0.92-0.99). Only 2.7% of the patients with normal axillary US had more than 2 metastatic nodes in the axillary lymph node dissection, against 50% of the patients with suspicious lymph nodes in the US and positive FNAC. Conclusions Axillary US coupled with FNAC can sort patients who have a few metastatic nodes at most from those with heavy axillary burden and could be one more tool to initially evaluate patients and define treatment strategies.

TI  - The outflow of Asian biomass burning carbonaceous aerosol into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere in spring: radiative effects seen in a global model
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning (BB) over Asia is a strong source of carbonaceous aerosols during spring. From ECHAM6-HAMMOZ model simulations and satellite observations, we show that there is an outflow of Asian BB carbonaceous aerosols into the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) (black carbon: 0.1 to 6 ng m(-3) and organic carbon: 0.2 to 10 ng m(-3)) during the spring season. The model simulations show that the greatest transport of BB carbonaceous aerosols into the UTLS occurs from the Indochina and East Asia region by deep convection over the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia. The increase in BB carbonaceous aerosols enhances atmospheric heating by 0.001 to 0.02 K d(-1) in the UTLS. The aerosol-induced heating and circulation changes increase the water vapor mixing ratios in the upper troposphere (by 20-80 ppmv) and in the lowermost stratosphere (by 0.02-0.3 ppmv) over the tropics. Once in the lower stratosphere, water vapor is further transported to the South Pole by the lowermost branch of the Brewer-Dobson circulation. These aerosols enhance the in-atmosphere radiative forcing (0.68 +/- 0.25 to 5.30 +/- 0.37 W m(-2)), exacerbating atmospheric warming, but produce a cooling effect on climate (top of the atmosphere - TOA: -2.38 +/- 0.12 to -7.08 +/- 0.72 W m(-2)). The model simulations also show that Asian carbonaceous aerosols are transported to the Arctic in the troposphere. The maximum enhancement in aerosol extinction is seen at 400 hPa (by 0.0093 km(-1)) and associated heating rates at 300 hPa (by 0.032 K d(-1)) in the Arctic.

TI  - Modelling of soil depth and hydraulic properties at regional level using environmental covariates- A case study in India
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil hydraulic properties are important for agroecosystem modelling, irrigation scheduling, drought risk assessment, and preparation of proper land use planning. Field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) are the two vital soil hydraulic properties that determine the availability of water for plant growth. In the present study, we evaluated four data mining algorithms for mapping of field capacity and permanent wilting point along with soil depth over 16.2 M ha of Andhra Pradesh state, South India. Class pedo-transfer function was developed based on the soil texture classes (760 observations) and the profile total field capacity (TFC) and total profile permanent wilting point (TPWP) were computed for 1 m soil depth. Multi-linear Regression (MLR), Cubist, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) models were evaluated using 2267 soil profile datasets collected over the study area. Along with Landsat-8 data and climatic datasets, terrain attributes such as plan curvature, profile curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), topographic position index (TPI), Multiresolution Index of Valley Bottom Flatness (MrVBF), and Multi-resolution Ridge Top Flatness (MrRTF) were used as environmental covariates. The models were calibrated using 80% of total field observations and validated using 20% of observations. The validation results showed that RF outperformed all other models for the prediction of both soil depth and profile TFC and TPWP. RF explained 39% of the variation of total field capacity and permanent wilting point with RMSE of 133 mm and 89 mm, respectively. The highest mean TFC and TPWP were found in Vertisols (256 and 154 mm, respectively) and Inceptisols (216 and 126, mm respectively). The highresolution (250 m) maps of hydraulic properties and soil depth are useful for land use planning and different crop modelling studies.

TI  - Satellite-based modelling of potential tsetse (<i>Glossina pallidipes</i>) breeding and foraging sites using teneral and non-teneral fly occurrence data
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: African trypanosomiasis, which is mainly transmitted by tsetse flies (Glossina spp.), is a threat to public health and a significant hindrance to animal production. Tools that can reduce tsetse densities and interrupt disease transmission exist, but their large-scale deployment is limited by high implementation costs. This is in part limited by the absence of knowledge of breeding sites and dispersal data, and tools that can predict these in the absence of ground-truthing.Methods: In Kenya, tsetse collections were carried out in 261 randomized points within Shimba Hills National Reserve (SHNR) and villages up to 5 km from the reserve boundary between 2017 and 2019. Considering their limited dispersal rate, we used in situ observations of newly emerged flies that had not had a blood meal (teneral) as a proxy for active breeding locations. We fitted commonly used species distribution models linking teneral and non-teneral tsetse presence with satellite-derived vegetation cover type fractions, greenness, temperature, and soil texture and moisture indices separately for the wet and dry season. Model performance was assessed with area under curve (AUC) statistics, while the maximum sum of sensitivity and specificity was used to classify suitable breeding or foraging sites.Results: Glossina pallidipes flies were caught in 47% of the 261 traps, with teneral flies accounting for 37% of these traps. Fitted models were more accurate for the teneral flies (AUC = 0.83) as compared to the non-teneral (AUC = 0.73). The probability of teneral fly occurrence increased with woodland fractions but decreased with cropland fractions. During the wet season, the likelihood of teneral flies occurring decreased as silt content increased. Adult tsetse flies were less likely to be trapped in areas with average land surface temperatures below 24 degrees C. The models predicted that 63% of the potential tsetse breeding area was within the SHNR, but also indicated potential breeding pockets outside the reserve.Conclusion: Modelling tsetse occurrence data disaggregated by life stages with time series of satellite-derived variables enabled the spatial characterization of potential breeding and foraging sites for G. pallidipes. Our models provide insight into tsetse bionomics and aid in characterising tsetse infestations and thus prioritizing control areas.

TI  - Remote sensing of wetland evolution in predicting shallow groundwater arsenic distribution in two typical inland basins
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A large number of studies have shown that the existence of wetlands may influence arsenic concentrations in adjacent shallow groundwater. However, little is known about the linkage between wetland evolution and arsenic enrichment in shallow groundwater. This study investigated wetland evolutions from 1973 to 2015 in two arid semiarid inland basins along the Yellow River catchment (i.e., the Yinchuan Basin and the Hetao Basin) based on remote sensing data, and their association with arsenic distributions based on arsenic concentrations of 244 and 570 shallow groundwater samples, respectively. The long-term Landsat images reveal that the covering area of wetlands exhibited increasing trends in both the Yinchuan Basin and the Hetao Basin. Wetlands in the Yinchuan Basin and the Yellow River water-irrigation area in the Hetao Basin varied with precipitation before 2000, but exhibited increasing trends because of wetland restoration policies since 2000. Wetlands in groundwater-irrigation area in the Hetao Basin decreased due to increasing exploitation of shallow groundwater. Wetlands with long existence time were mainly distributed along the Yellow River and drainage channels and in large lakes in the northern Yinchuan Basin and the Hetao Basin, where high-arsenic (>10 mu g/L) groundwater occurred. The probability of high-arsenic groundwater distribution increased with the proportion of wetland existence time to the entire studied period (42 years), which can be best explained by a BiDoseResp growth curve. Longer existence of wetlands may cause greater probability of high-arsenic groundwater. This was likely related to long-term introduction of biodegradable organic matter into shallow aquifers and thereafter enhancement of arsenic mobility and/or arsenic being released beneath wetlands and transported into shallow aquifers under continuing wetland water recharge. We therefore suggest that mapping wetland evolutions could probably serve as a good indicator for predicting high arsenic groundwater distributions in shallow aquifers. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - On a new piecewise regression model with cure rate: Diagnostics and application to medical data
T2  - STATISTICS IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we discuss an extension of the classical negative binomial cure rate model with piecewise exponential distribution of the time to event for concurrent causes, which enables the modeling of monotonic and non-monotonic hazard functions (ie, the shape of the hazard function is not assumed as in traditional parametric models). This approach produces a flexible cure rate model, depending on the choice of time partition. We discuss local influence on this negative binomial power piecewise exponential model. We report on Monte Carlo simulation studies and application of the model to real melanoma and leukemia datasets.

TI  - Application of Generalized Cauchy Process on Modeling the Long-Range Dependence and Self-Similarity of Sea Surface Chlorophyll Using 23 years of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the temporal characteristics of sea surface chlorophyll (SSC) is helpful for marine environmental management. This study chose 10 time series of remote daily sea surface chlorophyll products from the European Space Agency during the period from July 29, 1998 to December 31, 2020. A generalized Cauchy model was employed to capture the local and global behaviors of sea surface chlorophyll from a fractal perspective; the fractal dimension D measures the local similarity while the Hurst parameter H measures the global long-range dependence. The generalized Cauchy model was fitted to the empirical autocorrelation function values of each SSC series. The results showed that the sea surface chlorophyll was multi-fractal in both space and time with the D values ranging from 1.0000 to 1.7964 and H values ranging from 0.6757 to 0.8431. Specifically, regarding the local behavior, 9 of the 10 series had low D values (<1.5), representing weak self-similarity; on the other hand, regarding the global behavior, high H values represent strong long-range dependence that may be a general phenomenon of daily sea surface chlorophyll.

TI  - The first epidemiological and virological influenza surveillance in the Republic of Guinea revealed the predominance of influenza A/H3N2 and B Victoria viruses
T2  - EPIDEMIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Little is known about respiratory viruses infection in Guinea. Influenza surveillance has not been implemented in Guinea mainly because of the paucity of laboratory infrastructure and capacity. This paper presents the first influenza surveillance data in Guinea. Swabs were obtained from August 2018 through December 2019 at influenza sentinel sites and transported to the Institut National de Sante Publique for testing. Ribonucleic acid was extracted and tested for the presence of influenza A and B by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Positive samples were further characterised to determine the subtypes and lineages of influenza viruses. A total of 862 swabs were collected and tested. Twenty-three per cent of samples tested positive for influenza A and B viruses. Characterisation of positive specimens identified influenza A/H1N1pmd09 (2.5%), influenza A/H3N2 (57.3%), influenza B/Victoria lineage (36.7%) and 7 (3.5%) influenza B with undetermined lineage. Influenza B virus activity clustered in August through November while influenza A/H3N2 displayed two clusters of activities that appeared in May through August and November through December. For the first time in Guinea, the epidemiology, diversity and period of circulation of influenza viruses were studied. The results indicate the predominance and the periods of activities of influenza B Victoria lineage and influenza A/H3N2 which are important information for preventive strategies. It is warranted to extend the influenza surveillance to other parts of Guinea to better understand the epidemiology of the viruses and monitor the emergence of influenza strains with pandemic potential.

TI  - Characteristics of daytime land surface temperature in wind corridor: A case study of a hot summer and warm winter city
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - With increasing urbanisation, the fraction of built-up areas and human activities increase, deteriorating the urban thermal environment and air quality. To improve the urban environment, wind corridors have attracted much research attention in recent years. In this study, a sky-view factor (SVF)-based method is proposed and verified for the potential wind corridor detection in a built-up urban area. The proposed method accurately identified wind corridors at a spatial resolution as high as 10 m. Characteristics of daytime land surface temperature (LST) were analysed based on Landsat-8 data. Results show that daytime LST in the wind corridor is higher than that in its adjacent non-corridor areas. To quantify the effect of SVF on LST over urban ground-level surfaces, the quantitative relationship between SVF and LST was analysed in the whole study area. Mean LST was found to increase linearly with SVF at a rate of about 0.2 degrees C per 0.1 SVF value. Moreover, effects of the underlying surface and urban morphology on LST were also discussed. Water bodies were found to effectively reduce LST, whereas in built-up areas, LST was also affected by building height (negative correlation) and building density (positive correlation). When using building height as a variable, the mean LST difference reached 3.5 degrees C in four seasons, while it was only 1.2 degrees C between areas with different building densities. These findings are useful to urban planning and provide insights to evaluate wind corridors' effectiveness holistically.

TI  - Identification of cultivated land change trajectory and analysis of its process characteristics using time-series Landsat images: A study in the overlapping areas of crop and mineral production in Yanzhou City, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most studies have extensively evaluated the extent and direction of land-use change in coal mining areas; however, they did not adequately describe the time dimension of cultivated land changes at the pixel scale. In this study, we reconstructed the time-series of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using best index slope extraction-wavelet transform (BISE-WT) filtering. The trajectory type of cultivated land change was identified based on the time-series curves of those original cultivated land pixels using the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), normalized differences building index (NDBI), and bare soil index (BSI). Additionally, the time nodes of cultivated land changes were detected based on the NDVI time-series data, MNDWI, NDBI, and BSI. The results showed that this clustering method had the highest overall accuracy (89.90%) and the highest kappa coefficient (86.36%) of those three methods. Moreover, the overall accuracy of different trajectory types, time node detection in cultivated land converted to other lands, and the restored cultivated land from other lands were 0.9005, 0.9438, and 0.9430, respectively, and the kappa coefficient were 0.8803, 0.9390, and 0.9371, respectively. The conversion from cultivated land to non-cultivated land mainly occurred during 1989-2005, while the reclamation of cultivated land mainly occurred in 2009, 2011, and 2013. Permanent cultivated land accounted for the highest proportion (56.26%) of the five trajectory types. The proportion of cultivated land converted to non-cultivated land to cultivated land was 18.51%, and the proportion of disturbed cultivated land that was not reclaimed was 25.23%. The proportion of cultivated land converted to the developed was the comparatively high (17.73%), and that of the restored cultivated land after conversion from cultivated land to waterbody was the lowest (0.53%). The results of this study provide a scientific basis for guiding land reclamation, ecological restoration, and evaluating sustainability in the overlapping areas of crop and mineral production.

TI  - MODELS FOR PREDICTING SENTINEL AND NON-SENTINEL LYMPH NODES BASED ON PRE-OPERATIVE ULTRASONIC BREAST IMAGING TO OPTIMIZE AXILLARY STRATEGIES
T2  - ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - strategy decisions have become more complex and controversial in considering minimally traumatic therapy instead of sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary lymph node dissection or regional nodal irradiation for people with breast cancer. The purpose of this study was to noninvasively predict sentinel lymph node (SLN) and non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) status based on pre-operative sonographic and clinicopathologic features to determine optimal decisions regarding axillary therapy. In total, 701 patients with breast cancer from two independent centers were retrospectively analyzed. The SLN model (SLNM) for predicting SLN status and the NSLN model (NSLNM) for predicting NSLN status were trained based on a training set using the randomforest algorithm, and their performance was validated using an independent external test set. A receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn to obtain the area under the curve, which was used to assess performance. The area under the curve for the SLNM in the training and test, respectively, was 94.2% and 83.0%, and for the NSLNM, 99.5% and 92.7%. The SLNM and NSLNM accurately predicted that 61.46% (319/519) and 17.53% (91/519), respectively, of our participants were non-metastatic. The overall benefit of the three models was 78.99% in our participants. The two models for predicting SLN and NSLN status showed excellent application potential in optimizing axillary strategies.

TI  - A New Divergence Method to Quantify Methane Emissions Using Observations of Sentinel-5P TROPOMI
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a new divergence method to estimated methane (CH4) emissions from satellite observed mean mixing ratio of methane (XCH4) by deriving the regional enhancement of XCH4 in the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL). The applicability is proven by comparing the estimated emissions with its known emission inventory from a 3-month GEOS-Chem simulation. When applied to TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument observations, sources from well-known oil/gas production areas, livestock farms and wetlands in Texas become clearly visible in the emission maps. The calculated yearly averaged total CH4 emission over the Permian Basin is 3.06 (2.82, 3.78) Tg a(-1) for 2019, which is consistent with previous studies and double that of EDGAR v4.3.2 for 2012. Sensitivity tests on PBL heights, on the derived regional background and on wind speeds suggest our divergence method is quite robust. It is also a fast and simple method to estimate the CH4 emissions globally.

TI  - First retrievals of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) from ground-based FTIR solar spectra recorded at remote sites, comparison with model and satellite data
T2  - ELEMENTA-SCIENCE OF THE ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) is the main tropospheric reservoir of NOx (NO thorn NO2). Its lifetime can reach several months in the upper cold troposphere. This enables the long-range transport of NOx radicals, under the form of PAN, far from the regions of emission. The subsequent release of NOx through the PAN thermal decomposition leads to the efficient formation of tropospheric ozone (O3), with important consequences for tropospheric oxidative capacity and air quality. The chemical properties of PAN have stimulated the progressive development of remote-sensing products by the satellite community, and recent additions open the prospect for the production of decadal and near-global time series. These products will provide new constraints on the distribution and evolution of this key trace gas in the Earth's atmosphere, but they will also require reliable measurements for validation and characterization of performance. We present an approach that has been developed to retrieve PAN total columns from ground-based high-resolution solar absorption Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. This strategy is applied to observations recorded at remote FTIR stations of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The resulting data sets are compared with total column time series derived from IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) satellite observations and to a global chemical transport model. The results are discussed in terms of their overall consistency, mutual agreement, and seasonal cycles. Noticeable is the fact that the FTIR data point to substantial deficiencies in the global model simulation over high latitudes, a poorly sampled region, with an underestimation of the PAN columns during spring, at the peak of the seasonal cycle. Finally, we suggest avenues for development that should make it possible to limit intra- or intersite biases and extend the retrieval of PAN to other NDACC stations that are more affected by water vapor interferences.

TI  - Detecting coffee leaf rust with UAV-based vegetation indices and decision tree machine learning models
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee leaf rust (CLR) is one of the most devastating leaf diseases in coffee plantations. By knowing the symptoms, severity, and spatial distribution of CLR, farmers can improve disease management procedures and reduce losses associated with it. Recently, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)-based images, in conjunction with machine learning (ML) techniques, helped solve multiple agriculture-related problems. In this sense, vegetation indices processed with ML algorithms are a promising strategy. It is still a challenge to map severity levels of CLR using remote sensing data and an ML approach. Here we propose a framework to detect CLR severity with only vegetation indices extracted from UAV imagery. For that, we based our approach on decision tree models, as they demonstrated important results in related works. We evaluated a coffee field with different infestation classes of CLR: class 1 (from 2% to 5% rust); class 2 (from 5% to 10% rust); class 3 (from 10% to 20% rust), and; class 4 (from 20% to 40% rust). We acquired data with a Sequoia camera, producing images with a spatial resolution of 10.6 cm, in four spectral bands: green (530-570 nm), red (640-680 nm), red-edge (730-740 nm), and nearinfrared (770-810 nm). A total of 63 vegetation indices was extracted from the images, and the following learners were evaluated in a cross-validation method with 10 folders: Logistic Model Tree (LMT); J48; ExtraTree; REPTree; Functional Trees (FT); Random Tree (RT), and; Random Forest (RF). The results indicated that the LMT method contributed the most to the accurate prediction of early and several infestation classes. For these classes, LMT returned F-measure values of 0.915 and 0.875, thus being a good indicator of early CLR (2 to 5% of rust) and later stages of CLR (20 to 40% of rust). We demonstrated a valid approach to model rust in coffee plants using only vegetation indices and ML algorithms, specifically for the disease's early and later stages. We concluded that the proposed framework allows inferring the predicted classes in remaining plants within the sampled area, thus helping the identification of potential CLR in non-sampled plants. We corroborate that the decision tree-based model may assist in precision agriculture practices, including mapping rust in coffee plantations, providing both an efficient non-invasive and spatially continuous monitoring of the disease.

TI  - Remote sensing satellite-based structural/alteration mapping for gold exploration in the Kette goldfield, Eastern Cameroon
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In-situ mineral prospecting studies in the tropics face challenging environmental conditions leading to paucity of data and structural mapping of new mineralizations. Here we present the case of the tropical mining goldfield of Kette in Cameroon to demonstrate remote sensing techniques for mineral exploration purposes. In this investigation Visible Near Infra-Red (VNIR) and Short Wave Infra-Red (SWIR) bands of Landsat-8 (OLI) and Landsat-7 (ETM+) images were used with field data for lineaments and hydrothermal alterations mapping. Semi-automatic and automatic extraction methods were applied through sobel directional filters to detect the contours in the image. PCA, MNF transformation and a band ratio of 4/2, 6/5 and 6/7 were applied to map alteration minerals. The result revealed NE-SW to ENE-WSW main trends. Gold mineralization occurrences are spatially associated with WNW-ESE to NW-SE (110 degrees-140 degrees) ranging lineaments/faults and show a strong correlation with medium to high lineament density zones. Hydrothermal alteration minerals are spatially associated closely with gold occurrences and known mining sites that are structurally controlled by the NE-SW to ENE-WSW shear zone. The high-prospect zones for gold exploration are located along the Mama and Mole fault, Ngoubesseli, BoubaraKoumbe Tiko, Gwe, and Ndambi I-Tezoukpe.

TI  - Deep learning-based framework for spatiotemporal data fusion: an instance of Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 NDVI
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-source, multi-temporal, and multi-resolution satellite images have been increasing over a couple of years. The spatiotemporal data fusion technique could be a promising solution to achieve the advantage of temporal and spatial details of multi-platform remote sensing images. Due to the unavailability of required temporal resolution of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of high-spatial-resolution dataset (e.g., Sentinel 2 A/B), the remote sensing-based crop monitoring is limiting in several parts of the world, primarily in the monsoon Asia and tropical region. We propose a deep learning-based framework to fill the gap of high-resolution NDVI value using corresponding low-spatial-resolution NDVI images. Time-series NDVI images from Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 are used to implement the proposed framework. We evaluate our method on two study areas with different climatic conditions: subtropical and temperate. The results demonstrate that spatiotemporal data fusion with our proposed framework is very effective to synthesize and generate new datasets which represents the unique features of both input sources, namely, spatial and temporal details of each input image regardless of the climatic and temporal variations.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the robustness of an advanced classification algorithm to spatially map heterogeneous, fragmented croplands using multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets. Four parameters derived from Sentinel-1 (backscatters in dual-polarization: sigma(o)(VH), sigma(o)(VV), cross-ratio (sigma(o)(VH)/sigma(o)(VV)), and radar vegetation index (RVI)) were considered to develop temporal patterns and correlate with un-classified time-series satellite imagery using time-weighted dynamic time warping (TWDTW) algorithm. Pixel and parcel based classifications were considered to identify four crop varieties (paddy, sugarcane, cotton and vegetables) subjected to two water limiting conditions (low stress-LS, high stress-HS). In-situ data were split-sampled (30:70 ratio) between training (to develop temporal patterns) and testing (to validate classification output). Overall accuracy of pixel and parcel based classifications were 63% and 76% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.58 and 0.73 respectively. In conclusion, parcel based TWDTW algorithm conditioned by temporal signatures of RVI has effectively delineated croplands with varying irrigation treatments for yield and damage assessment modeling studies.

TI  - A lead-width distribution for Antarctic sea ice: a case study for the Weddell Sea with high-resolution Sentinel-2 images
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Using Copernicus Sentinel-2 images we derive a statistical lead-width distribution for the Weddell Sea. While previous work focused on the Arctic, this is the first lead-width distribution for Antarctic sea ice. Previous studies suggest that the lead-width distribution follows a power law with a positive exponent; however their results for the power-law exponents are not all in agreement with each other. To detect leads we create a sea-ice surface-type classification based on 20 carefully selected cloud-free Sentinel-2 Level-1C products, which have a resolution of 10 m. The observed time period is from November 2016 until February 2018, covering only the months from November to April. We apply two different fitting methods to the measured lead widths. The first fitting method is a linear fit, while the second method is based on a maximum likelihood approach. Here, we use both methods for the same lead-width data set to observe differences in the calculated power-law exponent. To further investigate influences on the power-law exponent, we define two different thresholds: one for open-water-covered leads and one for open-water-covered and nilas-covered leads. The influence of the lead threshold on the exponent is larger for the linear fit than for the method based on the maximum likelihood approach. We show that the exponent of the lead-width distribution ranges between 1.110 and 1.413 depending on the applied fitting method and lead threshold. This exponent for the Weddell Sea sea ice is smaller than the previously observed exponents for the Arctic sea ice.

TI  - Impacts of meander migration on the Amazon riverine communities using Landsat time series and cloud computing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - River meander migration is a process that maintains biodiverse riparian ecosystems by producing highly sinuous rivers, and oxbow lakes. However, although the floodplains support communities with fish and other practices in the region, meandering rivers can directly affect the life of local communities. For example, erosion of river banks promotes the loss of land on community shores, while sedimentation increases the distance from house to the river. Therefore, communities living along the Jurua River, one of the most sinuous rivers on Earth, are vulnerable to long-term meander migration. In this study, the river meander migration was detected by using Landsat 5-8 data from 1984 to 2020. A per-pixel Water Surface Change Detection Algorithm (WSCDA) was developed to classify regions subject to erosion and sedimentation processes by applying temporal regressions on the water index, called Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (mNDWI). The WSCDA classified the meander migration with omission and commission errors lower than 13.44% and 7.08%, respectively. Then, the number of riparian communities was mapped using high spatial resolution SPOT images. A total of 369 communities with no road access were identified, the majority of which living in stable regions (58.8%), followed by sedimentation (26.02%) and erosion (15.18%) areas. Furthermore, we identified that larger communities (>20 houses) tend to live in more stable locations (70%) compared to smaller communities (1-10 houses) with 55.6%. A theoretical model was proposed to illustrate the main impacts of meander migration on the communities, related to Inundation, Mobility Change, and Food Security. This is the first study exploring the relationship between meander migration and riverine communities at watershed-level, and the results support the identification of vulnerable communities to improve local planning and floodplain conservation.

TI  - Migration, Vodou, and Pentecostalism: Haitian Immigrants-Their Conversion and Involvement in Pentecostal Churches
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LATIN AMERICAN RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, I analyze the key characteristic of Haitian Pentecostalism abroad through a literature review. Research on this topic shows that Haitian Pentecostal communities in foreign countries are part of a worldview with a common thread: the rejection of Vodou spirits. Scholarship analyzes the conversion process to Pentecostalism as a mechanism for severing the ties with Vodou spirits and a common element of Haitian Pentecostals in host societies. In the conclusion, I propose that the study on Haitian Pentecostalism is a worthwhile resource in the analysis of Latin American Pentecostalism. Moreover, the conversion in the Haitian case has a spiritual basis that has not been identified in the Latin American case. This spiritual basis allows the comparison between Haitian and Latin American Pentecostalism and, in this way, contributes to the understanding of the Pentecostal movement.

TI  - An automated and optimized geo-computation approach for spatial fire risk modelling using geo-web service orchestration
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire detection through space-based observations using thermal sensors is in operation since more than one decades. These active fire alerts are generated by using products from MODIS and SNPP-VIIRS satellites and are limited up to identification of active fire locations based on recorded temperature in satellite sensors. However, relation of fire location with forest type map, terrain profile and weather data are required for planning and monitoring of vulnerable areas. An attempt is made to develop online Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) and spatial model for forest fire risk mapping. The developed SDSS is based on Geospatial Web Service Orchestration (GWSO) workflow which enables forest fire risk alerts and advisories as Web Map Service, Geo SMS and a Geoportal application. User can use this SDSS with minimum technical skills and limited computation resources to generate daily forest fire risk map for fire monitoring and management.

TI  - District-scale numerical analysis of settlements related to groundwater lowering in variable soil conditions
T2  - CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a novel framework in which numerical modelling contributes to the performance of districtscale, subsidence-induced damage assessment in cities where ground settlements affect entire quarters. Therein, the implementation of expeditious procedures offers geotechnical engineers the possibility of contributing beyond the typical site scale. For this purpose, several "typified" hydro-geomechanical-loading (HGL) models, which represent (simplified) scenarios of masonry buildings undergoing settlements, were set up to account for different predisposing or triggering factors (i.e., soil heterogeneity, loading conditions, and groundwater variations) of settlement occurrence in built-up areas. These models exploit multi-source, wide-area input datasets encompassing the hydro-mechanical properties of geomaterials, in situ investigations and measurements (e.g., groundwater levels in wells), and innovative remote sensing data (i.e., DInSAR techniques). With reference to a district in Rotterdam City (the Netherlands), which was built on "soft soils", the numerical simulations of different scenarios (i) provide an overview of the comparative role of predisposing or triggering factors on settlement occurrence and (ii) allow assessments of the expected induced damage to masonry buildings over 30 years with the exploitation of fragility curves. Considering the widespread diffusion of such geohazards, the proposed approach could help prioritise (rather expensive) maintenance work to the built heritage within sustainable strategies for subsidence risk mitigation.

TI  - Difference in patterns of prescribing antidepressants known for their weight-modulating and cardiovascular side effects for patients with obesity compared to patients with normal weight
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Patients with depression and comorbid obesity may be more prone to weight modulating and cardiovascular side effects of selected antidepressants (AD). It is important to ascertain whether these AD prescriptions differ by patient weight status.Methods: Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) electronic medical records were used. Participants were adults with depression prescribed an AD in 2000-2016, with weight categories established before the first prescription. Logistic regression and mixed effects models were applied to examine associations between obesity and AD prescribing, adjusted for sex, age, and comorbidities. Machine learning algorithm random forest (RF) was used to evaluate the importance of weight in predicting prescribing patterns.Results: Of 26,571 participants, 72.4% were women, mean age was 38.9 years (standard deviation (SD)=14.2) and mean BMI 27.0 kg/m(2) (SD = 6.5); 9.5% had >= 1 comorbidity. Patients with obesity, compared to normal weight patients, were more likely to receive bupropion (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.24, 95%CI: 1.09,1.42), fluoxetine (aOR 1.14, 95%CI: 0.97,1.34), and amitriptyline (aOR 1.13, 95%CI: 0.93,1.36), and less likely to receive mirtazapine (aOR 0.55, 95%CI: 0.44,0.68) and escitalopram (aOR 0.88, 95%CI: 0.80, 0.97). RF analysis showed that weight was among the most important predictors of prescribing patterns, equivalent to age and more important than sex.Conclusions: AD prescribing patterns for patients with obesity appear to be different for selected AD types, including AD known for their weight-modulating and cardiovascular side effects. Longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether these prescribing patterns are associated with significant health outcomes.

TI  - Ecosystem Functioning Influences Species Fitness at Upper Trophic Levels
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change is severely affecting ecosystem functioning and biodiversity globally. Remotely sensed ecosystem functional attributes (EFAs) are integrative descriptors of the environmental change-being closely related to the processes directly affecting food chains via trophic cascades. Here we tested if EFAs can explain the species fitness at upper trophic levels. We took advantage of a long-term time series database of the reproductive success of the Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos)-an apex predator at the upper trophic level-over a 17-year period across a bioclimatic gradient (NW Spain; c. 29,575 km(2)). We computed a comprehensive database of EFAs from three MODIS satellite-products related to the carbon cycle, heat dynamics and radiative balance. We also assessed possible time-lag in the response of the Golden Eagle to fire, a critical disruptor of the surface energy budget in our region. We explored the role of EFAs on the fitness of the Golden Eagle with logistic-exposure nest survival models. Our models showed that the reproductive performance of the Golden Eagle is influenced by spatiotemporal variations in land surface temperature, albedo and vegetation productivity (AUC values from 0.71 to 0.8; sigma Wi (EFAs) from 0.66 to 1). Fire disturbance also affected ecological fitness of this apex predator-with a limited effect at 3 years after fire (a time-lagged response to surface energy budget disruptions; sigma Wi (Fire) = 0.62). Our study provides evidence for the influence of the matter and energy fluxes between land surface and atmosphere on the reproductive success of species at upper trophic levels.

TI  - Validation of methane and carbon monoxide from Sentinel-5 Precursor using TCCON and NDACC-IRWG stations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) mission with the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board has been measuring solar radiation backscattered by the Earth's atmosphere and surface since its launch on 13 October 2017. In this paper, we present for the first time the S5P operational methane (CH4) and carbon monoxide (CO) products' validation results covering a period of about 3 years using global Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) and Infrared Working Group of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC-IRWG) network data, accounting for a priori alignment and smoothing uncertainties in the validation, and testing the sensitivity of validation results towards the application of advanced co-location criteria. We found that the S5P standard and bias-corrected CH4 data over land surface for the recommended quality filtering fulfil the mission requirements. The systematic difference of the bias-corrected total column-averaged dry air mole fraction of methane (XCH4) data with respect to TCCON data is -0.26 +/- 0.56 % in comparison to -0.68 +/- 0.74 % for the standard XCH4 data, with a correlation of 0.6 for most stations. The bias shows a seasonal dependence. We found that the S5P CO data over all surfaces for the recommended quality filtering generally fulfil the missions requirements, with a few exceptions, which are mostly due to co-location mismatches and limited availability of data. The systematic difference between the S5P total column-averaged dry air mole fraction of carbon monoxide (XCO) and the TCCON data is on average 9.22 +/- 3.45 % (standard TCCON XCO) and 2.45 +/- 3.38 % (unscaled TCCON XCO). We found that the systematic difference between the S5P CO column and NDACC CO column (excluding two outlier stations) is on average 6.5 +/- 3.54 %. We found a correlation of above 0.9 for most TCCON and NDACC stations. The study shows the high quality of S5P CH4 and CO data by validating the products against reference global TCCON and NDACC stations covering a wide range of latitudinal bands, atmospheric conditions and surface conditions.

TI  - Cannabis detection from optical and RADAR data fusion: A comparative analysis of the SMILE machine learning algorithms in Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate crop mapping for agricultural monitoring requires the use of robust image classification algorithms. Cultivation of illegal cannabis is common in the Bekaa plain, Lebanon, as in some other areas of the world (Morocco, Afghanistan). Identification of cultivation sites is money and time consuming since it highly relies on knowledge of cultivation areas and field surveys. Machine-learning-based image classification provides an alternative method for cannabis detection. This paper presents a comparative analysis of four machine-learning classifiers implemented in Google Earth Engine: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting (GBT), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for cannabis and other crop type classification. We implement and test several image fusion approaches for optical (Sentinel-2, Landsat) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery (Sentinel-1) along with several combinations of surface textural features from Sentinel-1. Six different crop groups were classified over three years (2016, 2017, and 2018) in the Bekaa valley of Lebanon. In general, although SVM outperformed RF, GBT, and CART classifiers with an overall classification accuracy of more than 90%, RF and GBT provided more consistent results in terms of the cannabis cultivated area. SVM appears to be sensitive to the size of the training data. RF and GBT estimate an average cannabis area of 2800 ha in 2016, 2983 ha in 2017, and 5900 ha in 2018. Our results demonstrate that the fusion of radar and optical imagery can improve image classification accuracy by up to 5%. A marginal improvement in overall accuracy was observed when textural features were added. This is the first study that used image fusion and ML to estimate illegal cannabis cultivation areas in Lebanon and help evaluate the contribution of cannabis to the local economy. The combination of machine learning algorithms and imagery fusion proved reliable for crop classification in general and cannabis in particular.

TI  - A Novel Treatment of the Josephson Effect
T2  - JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM
M3  - Article
AB  - A new picture of the Josephson effect is devised. The radio-frequency (RF) signal, observed in a Josephson junction, is shown to stem from bound electrons, tunneling periodically through the insulating film. This holds also for the microwave-mediated tunneling. The Josephson effect is found to be conditioned by the same prerequisite worked out previously for persistent currents, thermal equilibrium and occurrence of superconductivity. The observed negative resistance behaviour is shown to originate from the interplay between normal and superconducting currents.

TI  - Generalization of the complete data fusion to multi-target retrieval of atmospheric parameters and application to FORUM and IASI-NG simulated measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of a growing need for innovatory techniques to take advantage of the largest amount of information from the great number of available remote sensing data, the Complete Data Fusion (CDF) algorithm was presented as a new method to combine independent measurements of the same vertical profile of an atmospheric parameter into a single estimate for a concise and complete characterization of the atmospheric state. The majority of the atmospheric composition measurements determine the altitude distribution of a great number of quantities: multi-target retrievals (MTRs) are increasingly applied to remote sensing observations to determine simultaneously atmospheric constituents with the purpose to reduce the systematic error caused by interfering species. In this work, we optimised the CDF for the application to MTR products. We applied the method to simulated retrievals in the thermal infrared and in the far infrared spectral ranges, considering the instrumental specifications and performances of IASING (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer New Generation) and FORUM (Far-Infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) instruments, respectively. The obtained results show that the CDF algorithm can cope with state vectors from MTRs, that must share at least one retrieved variable. In particular, the results show that the fused profile has the greatest number of degrees of freedom and the smallest error for all considered cases. The comparison between the CDF products and the synergistic retrieval ones shows the equivalence of the two methods when the linear approximation is adopted to simplify the treatment of the retrieval problem.

TI  - High-Resolution Mapping of Ice Cover Changes in Over 33,000 Lakes Across the North Temperate Zone
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - More than 50% of global lakes periodically freeze, and their lake ice phenology is sensitive to climate change. However, spatially detailed quantification of the changes in lake ice at the global scale is not available. Here, we map ice cover in >33,000 lakes throughout the North Temperate Zone (23.5 degrees-66.5 degrees N) using 0.55 million Landsat images from 1985 to 2020. Over this period, we found a remarkable reduction in median ice cover occurrence (ICO) (61% to 43%), which was strongly related to warming terrestrial mean surface temperatures (R-2 = 0.94, p < 0.05). Lakes in Europe showed the most pronounced ice loss (median ICO decreased from 50% to 24%), and extensive lake ice losses were also detected in the northern US, and central and eastern Asia. An overall increase in ice cover was identified from P2 (1999-2006) to P3 (2007-2014) due to regional decreased temperatures associated with the "global warming hiatus." Thehigh-resolution mapping of lake ice here provides essentialbaseline information whichcan be used to elucidate ice loss-induced environmental and societal impacts.

TI  - Clinical Molecular and Genomic Epidemiology of <i>Morganella</i> <i>morganii</i> in China
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Ongoing acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes has made Morganella morganii a new clinical treatment challenge. Understanding the molecular epidemiology of M. morganii will contribute to clinical treatment and prevention.Methods: We undertook a 6-year clinical molecular epidemiological investigation of M. morganii from three tertiary hospitals in China since 2014. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using a VITEK-2 system. All isolates were screened for beta-lactam and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes by PCR. Isolates carrying carbapenem-resistant genes were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The variation and evolution of these mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were then systematically analyzed.Results: Among all M. morganii isolates (n = 335), forty (11.9%) were recognized as multidrug resistant strains. qnrD1, aac(6')-Ib-cr, bla(TEM-104), and bla(CTX-M-162) were the top four most prevalent resistance genes. Notably, phylogenomic and population structure analysis suggested clade 1 (rhierBAPS SC3 and SC5) associated with multiple resistance genes seemed to be widely spread. WGS showed a bla(OXA-181)-carrying IncX3 plasmid and a Proteus genomic island 2 variant carrying bla(CTX-M-3), aac(6')-Ib-cr coexisted in the same multidrug resistant strain zy_m28. Additionally, a bla(IMP-1)-carrying IncP-1 beta type plasmid was found in the strain nx_m63.Conclusion: This study indicates a clade of M. morganii is prone to acquire resistance genes, and multidrug resistant M. morganii are increasing by harboring a variety of MGEs including two newly discovered ones in the species. We should be vigilant that M. morganii may bring more extensive and challenging antimicrobial resistance issue.

TI  - Natural and Anthropogenic Coastal Environmental Hazards: An Integrated Remote Sensing, GIS, and Geophysical-based Approach
T2  - SURVEYS IN GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Monitoring sources of environmental risks from rising groundwater levels and associated soil degradation is a substantial challenge in coastal regions of the world. The integration of remote sensing and subsurface data, followed by field geophysical surveys, provided an innovative approach for identifying sites susceptible to environmental risks from natural coastal interventions and anthropogenic activities. In this work, various remote sensing (Landsat-5-7-8 and ALOS/PALSAR-DEM), and subsurface (110 boreholes describing soil type, groundwater chemistry, and geotechnical clay plasticity) datasets were integrated in a geographic information system (GIS) environment to generate a site hazard susceptibility map (SHSM) for Suez city, Egypt, as an example of urban geohazard in coastal environments. Accordingly, the obtained very high susceptibility zone (2.95% of the area), located in the south-eastern regions, showed permanent wetlands since 1986, shallow groundwater level, and marine soil facies with thick clay layers. These conditions enhanced the risk of water salinity and swelling potentiality even without anthropogenic intervention. The constructed SHSM model was validated against the spatial distribution of affected infrastructures mapped by field observations and was found to provide accurate results. Additionally, the electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) profiles, collected over the vulnerable sites, revealed the presence of a buried paleo-sand channel extending from the Gulf of Suez and acting as a conduit for seawater inundation during winter seasons. These results highlight the significance of the proposed approach as a practical and cost-effective tool for coastal vulnerability mapping in order to better understand the complexity of multi-dimensions criteria for geohazard modelling. This holistic approach is an important phase to guide priorities of urban planning and would improve the analysis of coastal vulnerability and could be employed in other coastal cities worldwide.

TI  - Primary care provider-reported prevalence of vaccine and polyethylene glycol allergy in Canada
T2  - ANNALS OF ALLERGY ASTHMA & IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has highlighted the importance of accurate capture of vac-cine, and vaccine component, allergy. There remains a gap in the prevalence literature from the perspective of direct primary care provider (PCP) reporting at a population level. Objective: To determine the prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine and polyethylene glycol (PEG) allergy using electronic medical record data from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network repository. Machine learning algorithms were applied to evaluate for vaccine allergy documentation, and Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical codes were used for PEG allergy or allergy to common injectable medications containing PEG (CIMCP). Results: The prevalence of PCP-documented vaccine allergy in Canada was 0.037% (395/1,055,677) and of PEG allergy was 0.0009% (10/1,055,677). In total, 0.01% of patients had a documented allergy to either PEG or CIMCP (135/1,055,677). None of the patients with PEG allergy had a documented allergy to a CIMCP. Patients with vac-cine allergy and PEG allergy were significantly more likely to have other atopic comorbidities, including asthma (P < .001 for both), eczema (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively), rhinitis (P = .002 and P < .001, respectively), and food allergy (P < .001 for both). Significantly higher rates of depression (P < .001 and P < .001, respectively) and anxiety (P = .003 and P < .001, respectively) were found in those with vaccine allergy, or PEG allergy, than those without vaccine allergy or PEG allergy. Conclusion: This is the first study to estimate the prevalence of vaccine and PEG allergy in a national cohort that uses PCP documentation, revealing a low reported rate of vaccine allergy and PEG allergy.

TI  - Limitations of Remote Sensing in Assessing Vegetation Damage Due to the 2019-2021 Desert Locust Upsurge
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2019-2020 Desert Locust (DL) upsurge in East Africa threatened food security for millions in the region. This highlighted the need to track and quantify the damaging impacts of the swarming insects on cropland and rangelands. Satellite Earth observations (EO) data have the potential to contribute to DL damage assessments that can inform control measures, aid distribution and recovery efforts. EO can complement traditional ground based surveys (which are currently further limited due to COVID-19), by rapidly and cost effectively capturing the full spatial scale of the DL upsurge. However, EO-based techniques struggled to accurately quantify damage from this DL upsurge due to the sporadic and localized nature of infestations impacting scale, timing, and anomalous vegetation conditions. This study analyzed time series data from MODIS, the harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 product, and C-band radar data from Sentinel-1 to distinguish DL damage from normal senescence or other confounding factors from January to June 2020. These data were compared to in situ locust swarm, band, and non locust observations collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and PlantVillage. The methods presented did not produce results that could confidently differentiate senescence from locust activity, and may represent a limitation of publicly available remotely sensed data to detect DL damage. However, the higher spatial resolution data sets showed promise, and there is potential to explore commercially available satellite products such as Planet Labs for damage assessment protocols.

TI  - Omitting completion axillary lymph node dissection after detection of sentinel node micrometastases in breast cancer: first results from the prospective SENOMIC trial
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have indicated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) after positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy has no therapeutic effect, but they had possible selection bias and few patients undergoing mastectomy were included. Early results from the SENOMIC trial, which enrolled patients with breast cancer and SLN micrometastases who did not undergo completion ALND (of whom 38.3 per cent had mastectomy), support the omission of completion ALND.Background Completion axillary lymph node dissection has been abandoned widely among patients with breast cancer and sentinel lymph node micrometastases, based on evidence from prospective RCTs. Inclusion in these trials has been subject to selection bias, with patients undergoing mastectomy being under-represented. The aim of the SENOMIC (omission of axillary lymph node dissection in SENtinel NOde MICrometases) trial was to confirm the safety of omission of axillary lymph node dissection in patients with breast cancer and sentinel lymph node micrometastases, and including patients undergoing mastectomy. Methods The prospective SENOMIC multicentre cohort trial enrolled patients with breast cancer and sentinel lymph node micrometastases who had breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy at one of 23 Swedish hospitals between October 2013 and March 2017. No completion axillary lymph node dissection was performed. The primary endpoint was event-free survival, with a trial accrual target of 452 patients. Survival proportions were based on Kaplan-Meier survival estimates. Results The trial included 566 patients. Median follow-up was 38 (range 7-67) months. The 3-year event-free survival rate was 96.2 per cent, based on 26 reported breast cancer recurrences, including five isolated axillary recurrences. The unadjusted 3-year event-free survival rate was higher than anticipated, but differed between patients who had mastectomy and those who underwent breast-conserving surgery (93.8 versus 97.8 per cent respectively; P = 0.011). Patients who underwent mastectomy had significantly worse tumour characteristics. On univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, patients who had mastectomy without adjuvant radiotherapy had a significantly higher risk of recurrence than those who underwent breast-conserving surgery (hazard ratio 2.91, 95 per cent c.i. 1.25 to 6.75). Conclusion After 3 years, event-free survival was excellent in patients with breast cancer and sentinel node micrometastases despite omission of axillary lymph node dissection. Long-term follow-up and continued enrolment of patients having mastectomy, especially those not receiving adjuvant radiotherapy, are of utmost importance.

TI  - Male Breast Cancer: Treatment Trends, Reported Outcomes, and Suggested Recommendations
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Male breast cancer (MBC) is unfamiliar to most men, and its optimal treatment options are not well recognized by many treating physicians. The lack of MBC specific clinical trials contributes to the limitations of understanding MBC specific pathology, treatment options, and outcomes. This state-of-affairs contribute to perpetuating the use of treatment methods derived from our existing knowledge of female breast cancer (FBC). Previous studies demonstrate that men are often undertreated or disproportionately treated using more invasive surgical procedures even in the early stages of MBC. The purpose of this investigation was to thoroughly discuss current MBC treatment options, provide an evidence-based summary of their outcomes, note recent improvements, discuss important considerations and recommendations. Our goal is to aid the treatment decision process for patients and treating physicians.

TI  - Investigations on the Geometric Quality of AVHRR Level 1B Imagery Aboard MetOp-A
T2  - PFG-JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY REMOTE SENSING AND GEOINFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The products of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer/3 (AVHRR/3) sensors operating aboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and MetOp-A satellites are frequently used in meteorological applications. The geometric accuracy and stability of the sensors are regularly monitored by European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). As existing methods for evaluation resulted in a small number of check points only, a scientific project was initiated by EUMETSAT. The project aimed at the development of methods for improving the density and distribution of automatically generated check points for evaluating data having various spectral bands. The absolute, multi-temporal, and interband registration accuracy assessments of various meteorological satellites were carried out within the project including AVHRR Level 1B images. In this study, the geometric quality of AVHRR Level 1B products acquired from MetOp-A over Europe and North Africa regions was investigated. Global image mosaics with higher spatial resolutions were utilized as reference. The pre-processing methods applied to the images include warping to the same projection grid, image enhancement with Laplacian filter, and extraction of validity masks, which were used to eliminate cloud and water areas from processing. A 2D assessment approach was carried out using an area-based least squares matching method. The results show that the developed algorithm can produce dense and reliable check points. Biases ranging between 0.7 and 1.6 pixels (approximately 0.8-1.8 km) in x direction and 0.2-0.9 pixels (approximately 0.2-1.0 km) in y direction were obtained from the evaluated datasets. The standard deviations range are between 0.15 and 0.30 pixels. The multi-temporal geometric accuracy was found stable and the interband accuracy demonstrated high coherence of different spectral bands.

TI  - Seasonality and risk factors for grass seed foreign bodies in dogs
T2  - PREVENTIVE VETERINARY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Grass seed foreign bodies (GSFBs) are a familiar presentation, especially in dogs, associated with a variety of clinical signs depending on site of penetration and extent of migration. Seasonality and risk factors for GSFB occurrence were investigated using electronic health records from a sentinel voluntary network of 245 veterinary practices in the United Kingdom between 17th March 2014 and 18th September 2020. Clinical narrative text mining of 4,580,503 canine consultations produced a final case dataset of 1,037 consultations where GSFBs had been recorded in individual dogs. Cases of GSFBs were recorded in all months, with 940 (90.6 %) recorded between June and September. In particular, the odds of GSFBs in July was almost 176 times more than that of January (Odds ratio, OR, 175.6, 95 % Confidence interval, CI, 43.5-707.7, P < 0.001). Compared to the retriever breed type, spaniel breed types were 7.7 times more likely to present with a GSFB (CI 5.4-11.0, P < 0.001).Other significant risk factors associated with recorded GSFBs for this population included being male (OR = 1.4, CI 1.2-1.6, P < 0.001), and geographical location. When compared to the South East of England, risk was lowest in Wales (OR = 0.1, CI 0.0-0.3, P=<0.001), and highest in the East of England (OR = 1.9, 1.2-2.9, P = 0.003), and overall risk in urban areas was reduced (OR = 0.8, CI 0.7-1.0, P = 0.024). These observations provide a number of areas for temporally targeted health campaigns at specific types of dogs, to reduce the impact of GSFBs on canine welfare.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The indirect rainfall estimates by satellites and numerical models are the alternative options for the regions lacking enough and accurate ground observations. However, these indirect estimates often lack homogeneity and need to be evaluated before application. This study used gauge observations to test the accuracy of recently produced high-resolution satellite-based and numerical model output rainfall products over Ethiopia. Tropical Applications of Meteorology Using Satellite data and Ground-Based Observations (TAMSAT v3.1), Climate Hazard group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS v2.0), and the ERA5 reanalysis products were evaluated at monthly, seasonal, and annual temporal scales for the years 1992-2009. The satellite products showed nearly similar characteristics with much better accuracy than the model reanalysis output, which underestimated the rainfall amounts. Both satellite and reanalysis products captured the shapes of the rainfall at a monthly scale but less accurately at a seasonal scale. In general, the satellite-based products outperformed the reanalysis data set with a high correlation coefficient and index of agreement values, as well as low Root Mean Square Error and BIAS values. On the other hand, the reanalysis (ERA5) product showed a considerable underestimation in all sites. Therefore, satellite-based products are more reliable for researches in the region. However, the algorithms in both satellites need further calibration for a better estimation of seasonal rainfall amounts.

TI  - Assessment of aerosol burden over Ghana
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Although air pollution in Ghana is ranked number one in environmental health threats to public health and sixth to cause of deaths, routine monitoring is rare. This paper presents fourteen years (2005-2018) assessment of aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 3 km resolution from MODIS Aqua and Terra satellites to ascertain the Spatio-temporal and seasonal distribution of aerosols over Ghana and its major cities. The MODIS AOD at 3 km were validated against ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AODs to ascertain the suitability of the MODIS 3 km data for air quality application in the region. The contribution of distant aerosols to city aerosol loadings was also assessed with Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) backscatter model. A moderate-high aerosol burden (AODs similar to 0.50) was observed over Ghana with a significant contribution from the pre monsoon season. City centres of Takoradi and Kumasi showed higher aerosol loads (AODs similar to 0.80) than Accra and Tamale. The HYSPLIT model showed that distant or transported aerosol sources to the city centres were of both marine and land generated origins. Linear regression analysis between MODIS AOD and AERONET AOD showed a reasonably good correlation of 0.60 for Aqua and Terra. From the validation analysis, both Aqua and Terra satellites can be used for air quality monitoring over Ghana; however, more ground research must be conducted to ascertain better aerosol model assumptions for the region.

TI  - Spatio-temporal patterns and sustainable development of coastal aquaculture in Hainan Island, China: 30 Years of evidence from remote sensing
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast-growing coastal aquaculture industry provides nutritious seafood and huge wealth for society, but also affects the natural environment and coastal ecosystems. There is an urgent need to realize the sustainable development of coastal aquaculture with regard to the trade-off between economic development and ecological conservation. Satellite remote sensing provides long-term data on the distribution and dynamics of aquaculture, which is essential for the design of suitable policy interventions for sustainable development. In this study, Landsat time series were used to map the tendencies and dynamics of aquaculture ponds for 30 years (1987-2018) in the coastal area of Hainan Island, China. The results showed that (1) the coastal aquaculture area of Hainan Island first increased rapidly, then increased slowly, and then decreased slightly in the past 30 years, increasing by approximately 10 times. The largest annual change rate of aquaculture ponds was between 2000 and 2005 (1597 ha/year), followed by the period 1995-2000 (1414 ha/year). (2) The development of aquaculture was unbalanced in the space, and Wenchang City in the northeast of Hainan Island accounted for 47.87% of the total aquaculture area in 2018. The aquaculture centroids moved from the center of Hainan Island to the northeast with a total migration distance of 72.9 km from 1987 to 2018. (3) There were three different types of development tendencies in the coastal cities (counties) (aquaculture areas increased continually; aquaculture areas increased first and then decreased slightly; aquaculture areas increased first, and then decreased significantly), mainly related to the different regional characteristics and development orientations. The different evolution phases of coastal aquaculture in Hainan Island were driven by relevant national and local government policies. Formulating and implementing appropriate aquaculture policies according to local conditions, as well as promoting industrial upgrading of aquaculture with high-tech, are significant suggestions for sustainable aquaculture. This study provides baseline data for local managers to assess the development of coastal aquaculture and reference experiences of sustainable aquaculture for other tropical islands and countries.

TI  - Improved fire severity mapping in the North American boreal forest using a hybrid composite method
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fire severity is a key driver shaping the ecological structure and function of North American boreal ecosystems, a biome dominated by large, high-intensity wildfires. Satellite-derived burn severity maps have been an important tool in these remote landscapes for both fire and resource management. The conventional methodology to produce satellite-inferred fire severity maps generally involves comparing imagery from 1 year before and 1 year after a fire, yet environmental conditions unique to the boreal have limited the accuracy of resulting products. We introduce an alternative method - the 'hybrid composite' - based on deriving mean severity over time on a per-pixel basis within the cloud-computing environment of Google Earth Engine. It constructs the post-fire image from satellite data composited from all valid images (i.e., clear-sky and snow-free) acquired in the time period immediately after fire through the early growing season of the following year. We compare this approach to paired-scene and composite approaches where the post-fire time period is from the growing season 1 year after fire. Validation statistics based on field-derived data for 52 fires across Alaska and Canada indicate that the hybrid composite method outperforms the other approaches. This approach presents an efficient and cost-effective means to monitor and explore trends and patterns across broad spatial domains, and could be applied to fires in other regions, especially those with frequent cloud cover or rapid vegetation recovery.

TI  - Axillary evaluation in ductal cancer <i>in situ</i> of the breast: challenging the diagnostic accuracy of clinical practice guidelines
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY

AB  - Background Staging of the axilla is not routine in ductal cancer in situ (DCIS) although invasive cancer is observed in 20-25 per cent of patients at final pathology. Upfront sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) is advocated in clinical practice guidelines in certain situations. These include expected challenges in subsequent SLN detection and when the risk for invasion is high. Clinical practice guidelines are, however, inconsistent and lead to considerable practice variability. Methods Clinical practice guidelines for upfront SLND in DCIS were identified and applied to patients included in the prospective SentiNot study. These patients were evaluated by six independent, blinded raters. Agreement statistics were performed to assess agreement and concordance. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed, to assess guideline accuracy in identifying patients with underlying invasion. Results Eight guidelines with relevant recommendations were identified. Interobserver agreement varied greatly (kappa: 0.23-0.9) and the interpretation as to whether SLND should be performed ranged from 40-90 per cent and with varying concordance (32-88 per cent). The diagnostic accuracy was low with area under the curve ranging from 0.45 to 0.55. Fifty to 90 per cent of patients with pure DCIS would undergo unnecessary SLNB, whereas 10-50 per cent of patients with invasion were not identified as 'high risk'. Agreement across guidelines was low (kappa = 0.24), meaning that different patients had a similar risk of being treated inaccurately. Conclusion Available guidelines are inaccurate in identifying patients with DCIS who would benefit from upfront SLNB. Guideline refinement with detailed preoperative work-up and novel techniques for SLND identification could address this challenge and avoid overtreatment.Guidelines on axillary surgery for DCIS are unclear. Different guidelines were validated using a dataset from the prospective SentiNot study.Lay summary The decision whether to operate on the axilla in women with a diagnosis of ductal cancer in situ (DCIS) is based on the risk of an undiagnosed underlying invasive cancer and on the concern that resection of the breast will not allow for accurate axillary mapping afterwards. Guidelines stem from older knowledge and are heterogeneous. In this study, different breast cancer guidelines were tested in a patient cohort from the SentiNot prospective trial for uniformity of interpretation and diagnostic accuracy. Results show that guidelines did not allow for easy and uniform interpretation and had the predictive ability of the toss of a coin. This suggests that guidelines regarding the need of axillary evaluation in patients operated for DCIS need to be revised and that techniques that will address the conundrum should be developed.

TI  - Treatment of male breast cancer: meta-analysis of real-world evidence
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Breast cancer is rare in men and managed by extrapolating from breast cancer in women. The clinicopathological features of male breast cancer, however, differ from those of female breast cancer. Because clinical trials are rare, the synthesis of real-world data is one method of integrating sufficient evidence on the optimal treatment for this patient population. Methods PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Clinical studies were included if they evaluated the treatments of interest in male breast cancer; these evaluations included breast-conserving surgery (BCS) versus mastectomy, postmastectomy radiation therapy versus no radiation, the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and a comparison of various endocrine therapies. Results Forty studies were retrieved. The pooled estimate of overall survival (OS) revealed no difference between BCS and mastectomy groups. Postmastectomy radiation to the chest wall significantly increased OS relative to no postmastectomy radiation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.67, 95 per cent confidence interval 0.54 to 0.84). The pooled estimates of identification and false-negative rates of SLNB were 97.4 and 7.4 per cent respectively. Tamoxifen treatment was associated with significantly increased OS compared with no tamoxifen intake (HR 0.62, 0.41 to 0.95). Conclusion Identification and false-negative rates for SLNB were comparable to those in female breast cancer. Breast-conserving surgery can be effective and safe; postmastectomy radiation to the chest wall and 5-year tamoxifen treatment improves survival.Breast cancer is rare in men, and synthesis of real-world data is required to optimize its clinical management. This review indicated that breast-conserving therapy is safe, especially for tumours smaller than 2 cm. Postmastectomy radiation therapy to the chest wall improved survival despite total mastectomy.

TI  - How suitable are satellite rainfall estimates in simulating high flows and actual evapotranspiration in MelkaKunitre catchment, Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia?
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the suitability of Satellite Rainfall Estimates (SREs) in simulating high flows and Actual Evapo-transpiration (AET) is crucial for developing flood monitoring systems. Therefore, this study aims to assess i) the suitability of SREs in simulating both high flows and AET for different levels of model complexity, and ii) the effect of streamflow calibration on simulating AET for different rainfall inputs in Melkakunitre catchment, Upper Awash Basin, Ethiopia. Three state-of-the-art SREs (TRMM 3B42v7, IMERG v06B, and TAMSAT v3) were used and their usefulness in simulating high flows (Q5), daily streamflow, and wet season flows (from June to September) was assessed using the HBV-light model for the period 2003-2015. The model was set up for two levels of complexity: with and without considering the effect of orography on rainfall and temperature. More-over, the water balance derived AET was compared against three remotely sensed AET products, MOD 16A2, GLEAM v3, and SSEBob, so as to examine the effect of streamflow calibration on AET simulation. Results show that rainfall inputs and model complexity have a strong impact on simulating streamflow and AET. For all rainfall forcing datasets, the performance of the hydrological model improves when we consider the effects of orography on rainfall and temperature. The IMERG v06B and TAMSAT v3 products showed the highest and least perfor-mances in simulating all the three flow conditions, respectively. Moreover, the MODIS-AET is the best remotely sensed AET product in reproducing the water balance-derived AET for all rainfall inputs except TAMSAT v3. The HBV-light model parameters calibrated with streamflow provided better results for simulating AET as well. On average, the usefulness of the IMERG v06B product for simulating high flows and AET is outstanding and can be thus used for developing flood monitoring and management systems in the study catchment.

TI  - The Attitudes of Brazilian Breast Surgeons on Axillary Management in Early Breast Cancer-10 Years after the ACOSOG Z0011 Trial First Publication
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To evaluate the impact of the ACOSOG Z0011 trial on axillary breast cancer surgery management in Brazil following publication of that study (2010) and again in 2020. Patients and Methods A survey of members of the Brazilian Society of Mastology. Results Of 1627 breast surgeons, 799 (49.1%) completed and returned the questionnaire. For patients with the Z11 inclusion criteria, following detection of a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN), axillary dissection (AD) was recommended by 99.2% of respondents before publication of the study, 47.5% in 2010 and 18.5% in 2020 (p < 0.001). In breast-conserving surgery, if there were micro-metastases, 2.6% would perform AD, 30.3% axillary radiotherapy, and 67.1% no additional axillary treatment, while with macro-metastases, these proportions were 21.3%, 52.2%, and 26.5%, respectively. In cases of mastectomy and of nodal extracapsular extension, 43.4% and 36% of surgeons, respectively, recommended AD. For clinically negative axilla and suspicious findings at ultrasonography, 69% of the surgeons would apply the Z11 approach. Most applied the Z11 criteria in cases of younger patients (83.6%) and triple-negative and/or HER2 positive tumors (74%). AD was significantly more likely to be recommended by surgeons who did not work in academic institutes, who worked in locations other than capital cities, who were not board-certified, and who were >= 50 years old. Conclusions This survey revealed substantial changes in axillary surgery management in cN0/pathologically positive SLN, particularly following publication of the updated Z11 results and other similar studies. A better education environment and long-term follow-up were factors associated with the incorporation of Z11-related changes in practice.

TI  - Sensitivity of Middle Atmospheric Ozone to Solar Proton Events: A Comparison Between a Climate Model and Satellites
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Energetic particle precipitation (EPP) impact on the middle atmospheric ozone chemistry potentially plays an important role in the connection between space weather and Earth's climate system. A variant of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM-D) implements a detailed set of ionospheric D-region chemistry instead of a simple parameterization used in the earlier WACCM versions. This allows WACCM-D to capture the impact of EPP in more detail. Here, we validate the ion chemistry of the WACCM-D by analyzing the middle atmospheric ozone response to the EPP forcing during well-known solar proton events (SPEs). We use a multi-satellite approach to derive the middle atmospheric sensitivity for the SPE forcing as a statistical relation between the solar proton flux and the consequent ozone change. An identical sensitivity analysis is carried out for the WACCM-D model results, enabling one-to-one comparison with the results derived from the satellite observations. Our results show a good agreement in the sensitivity between satellites and the WACCM-D for nighttime conditions. For daytime conditions, we find a good agreement for the satellite data sets that include the largest SPEs (maximum proton flux >104 pfu). However, for those satellite data-sets with only minor and moderate SPEs, WACCM-D tends to underestimate the sensitivity in daytime conditions. In summary, the WACCM-D with its full ion chemistry and transportation demonstrates a realistic representation of the SPE sensitivity of ozone, and thus provides a conservative platform for long-term EPP impact studies.

TI  - In situ observations of turbulent ship wakes and their spatiotemporal extent
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In areas of intensive ship traffic, ships pass every 10 min. Considering the amount of ship traffic and the predicted increase in global maritime trade, there is a need to consider all types of impacts shipping has on the marine environment. While the awareness about, and efforts to reduce, chemical pollution from ships is increasing, less is known about physical disturbances, and ship-induced turbulence has so far been completely neglected. To address the potential importance of ship-induced turbulence on, e.g., gas exchange, dispersion of pollutants, and biogeochemical processes, a characterisation of the temporal and spatial scales of the turbulent wake is needed. Currently, field measurements of turbulent wakes of real-size ships are lacking. This study addresses that gap by using two different methodological approaches: in situ and ex situ observations. For the in situ observations, a bottom-mounted acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) was placed at 32m depth below the shipping lane outside Gothenburg harbour. Both the acoustic backscatter from the air bubbles in the wake and the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy were used to quantify the turbulent wake depth, intensity, and temporal longevity for 38 ship passages of differently sized ships. The results from the ADCP measurements show median wake depths of 13m and several occasions of wakes reaching depths > 18 m, which is in the same depth range as the seasonal thermocline in the Baltic Sea. The temporal longevity of the observable part of the wakes had a median of around 10 min and several passages of > 20 min. In the ex situ approach, sea surface temperature was used as a proxy for the water mass affected by the turbulent wake (thermal wake), as lowered temperature in the ship wake indicates vertical mixing in a thermally stratified water column. Satellite images of the thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8 were used to measure thermal wake width and length, in the highly frequented and thus major shipping lane north of Bornholm, Baltic Sea. Automatic information system (AIS) records from both the investigated areas were used to identify the ships inducing the wakes. The satellite analysis showed a median thermal wake length of 13.7 km (n = 144), and the longest wake extended over 60 km, which would correspond to a temporal longevity of 1 h 42 min (for a ship speed of 20 kn). The median thermal wake width was 157.5 m. The measurements of the spatial and temporal scales are in line with previous studies, but the maximum turbulent wake depth (30.5 m) is deeper than previously reported. The results from this study, combined with the knowledge of regional high traffic densities, show that ship-induced turbulence occurs at temporal and spatial scales large enough to imply that this process should be considered when estimating environmental impacts from shipping in areas with intense ship traffic.

TI  - Mast Cells Mediate Inflammatory Injury and Aggravate Neurological Impairment in Experimental Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Through Microglial PAR-2 Pathway
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular disease with high mortality and disability. Aberrant neuroinflammation has been identified as a critical factor accounting for the poor prognosis of SAH patients. Mast cells (MCs), the sentinel cells of the immune system, play a critical in the early immune reactions and participate in multiple pathophysiological process. However, the exact role of MCs on the pathophysiological process after SAH has not been fully understood. The current study was conducted to determine the role of MCs and MC stabilization in the context of SAH. Mouse SAH model was established by endovascular perforation process. Mice received saline or cromolyn (MC stabilizer) or compound 48/80 (MCs degranulator). Post-SAH evaluation included neurobehavioral test, western blot, immunofluorescence, and toluidine blue staining. We demonstrated that SAH induced MCs activation/degranulation. Administration of MC stabilizer cromolyn conferred a better neurologic outcome and decreased brain edema when compared with SAH+vehicle group. Furthermore, cromolyn significantly inhibited neuroinflammatory response and alleviated neuronal damage after SAH. However, pharmacological activation of MCs with compound 48/80 dramatically aggravated SAH-induced brain injury and exacerbated neurologic outcomes. Notably, pharmacological inhibition of microglial PAR-2 significantly reversed MCs-induced inflammatory response and neurological impairment. Additionally, the effect of MCs-derived tryptase in mediating neuroinflammation was also abolished by the microglial PAR-2 blockage in vitro. Taken together, MCs yielded inflammatory injury through activating microglia-related neuroinflammation after SAH. These data shed light on the notion that MCs might be a novel and promising therapeutic target for SAH.

M3  - Article
AB  - Increased urbanisation in developing countries has resulted in significant urban growth of towns and cities. The lights observed from the sky at night can be used as a proxy to monitor the process of the country's urban growth, development, and economy. The present study conducted an analysis using remote sensing data, i.e. (VIIRS DNB satellite datasets) for estimating changes in gross state domestic product (GSDP), bright illuminating areas and associated light pollution from regions of India for the year 2012-13 and 2018-19. Amongst states, the most populous state of India, Uttar Pradesh shows the highest contribution (11.96%) in 2018-19 for total sum of stable lights (SOL) for the nation. The highest annual mean SOL percentage increase (2012-13 to 2018-19) in night lights was witnessed in the state of Bihar (similar to 220%). A strong correlation is observed between log SOL and log GSDP for both the time periods viz. 2012-13 (R-2 = 0.88) and 2018-19 (R-2 = 0.82). Statistics revealed that there was a growth of 31.16% in bright lit areas from 2012-13 to 2018-19. 1.27% average increase in light pollution was observed from 2012-13 to 2018-19 in India.

AB  - The objective of the present work is to assess the wave power in the North Sea in the vicinity of the most relevant wind farms that are operating there. At this moment, the coastal environment of the North Sea is among the most significant areas in the world from the point of view of harvesting marine renewable energy. Furthermore, this area is also very relevant for offshore activities related to oil and gas extraction. From this perspective, its coastal environment would be a perfect candidate for the implementation of the wave projects, which would benefit from existing infrastructure. The ERA5 dataset has been considered for the evaluation of the wave power for the 30-year period (1989-2018). 10 reference points have been defined in the coastal environment of the sea covering the most relevant locations and for them, the mean wave power has been first assessed. After this, the seasonal and monthly variability of the wave power have been also evaluated together with some statistical parameters. The results show that the northern part of the sea has relatively significant wave energy resources and it can be a viable candidate for implementation of the future wave projects. However, the linear trends indicate a slight tendency of decrease of the wave power, but on the other hand, the coefficient of resource variation has small values. Finally, a comparison with the satellite data provided by the European Space Agency is also carried out for the 27-year period 1992-2018. While in general there is a very good concordance between the two datasets, for the reference points located in the north-eastern part of the sea, which are the most resourceful locations, the satellite data indicate higher values.

TI  - Improvements in transition times through the HIV cascade of care among gay and bisexual men with a new HIV diagnosis in New South Wales and Victoria, Australia (2012-19): a longitudinal cohort study
T2  - LANCET HIV
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Most studies assessing the HIV care cascade have typically been cross-sectional analyses, which do not capture the transition time to subsequent stages. We aimed to assess the longitudinal HIV cascade of care in Australia, and changes over time in transition times and associated factors.Methods In this longitudinal cohort study, we included linked data for gay and bisexual men (GBM) with a new HIV diagnosis who attended clinics participating in the Australian Collaboration for Coordinated Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance in New South Wales and Victoria between Jan 1, 2012, and Dec 31, 2019. We assessed three cascade transition periods: diagnosis to linkage to care (stage 1 transition); linkage to care to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation (stage 2 transition); and ART initiation to virological suppression (viral load <= 200 copies per mL; stage 3 transition). We also calculated the probability of remaining virologically suppressed after the first recorded viral load of less than 200 copies per mL. We used the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate transition times and cumulative probability of stage transition.Findings We included 2196 GBM newly diagnosed with HIV between 2012 and 2019 contributing 6747 person-years of follow-up in our analysis. Median time from HIV diagnosis to linkage to care (stage 1 transition) was 2 days (IQR 1-3). Median time from linkage to care to ART initiation (stage 2 transition) was 33 days (30-35). Median time from ART initiation to first recorded virological suppression (stage 3 transition) was 49 days (47-52). The cumulative probability of ART initiation within 90 days of linkage to care increased from 36.9% (95% CI 32.9-40.6) in the 2012-13 calendar period to 94.1% (91.2-96.0) in the 2018-19 calendar period and cumulative probability of virological suppression within 90 days of ART initiation increased from 54.3% (48.8-59.3) in the 2012-13 calendar period to 82.9% (78.4-86.4) in the 2018-19 calendar period. 91.6% (90.1-93.1) of GBM remained virologically supressed up to 2 years after their first recorded virological suppression event.Interpretation In countries with high cross-sectional cascade estimates such as Australia, the impact of treatment as prevention is better estimated using longitudinal cascade analyses.

TI  - Post-disturbance canopy recovery and the resilience of Europe's forests
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Forest ecosystems around the globe are facing increasing natural and human disturbances. Increasing disturbances can challenge forest resilience, that is, the capacity of forests to sustain their functions and services in the face of disturbance. Quantifying resilience across large spatial extents remains challenging, as it requires the assessment of the ability of forests to recover from disturbance. Here we analysed the resilience of Europe's forests by means of satellite-based recovery and disturbance indicators. Location Continental Europe (35 countries). Time period 1986-2018. Major taxa studied Gymnosperm and angiosperm woody plant species. Methods We used a comprehensive set of manually interpreted reference plots and random forest regression to model annual canopy cover from remote sensing data across more than 30 million disturbance patches in Europe over the time period 1986-2018. From annual time series of canopy cover, we estimated the time it takes disturbed areas to recover to pre-disturbance canopy cover levels using space-for-time substitution. We quantified forest resilience as the ratio between canopy disturbance and recovery intervals, with critical resilience defined as forest areas where canopy disturbances occurred faster than canopy recovery. Results On average across Europe, forests recover to pre-disturbance canopy cover within 30 years. The resilience of Europe's forests to disturbance is high, with recovery being > 10 times faster than disturbance on 69% of the forest area. However, 14% of Europe's forests had low or critical resilience, with disturbances occurring as fast or faster than forest canopy can recover. Main conclusions We conclude that Europe's forests are widely resilient to past disturbance regimes, yet changing climate and disturbance regimes could erode resilience.

TI  - Anatomical reasons for failure of dual-filter cerebral embolic protection application in TAVR: A CT-based analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF CARDIAC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The dual-filter Sentinel (TM) Cerebral Protection System (Sentinel-CPS) is increasingly used during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, complex vascular anatomy may challenge Sentinel-CPS deployment. Aim of the study We sought to investigate the impact of anatomic features of the aortic arch and the supra-aortic arteries on technical device failure of Sentinel-CPS application. Methods Analysis of the multislice computed tomography pre-TAVR aortograms of all patients undergoing TAVR with Sentinel-CPS between 2016 and 2020 (n = 92) was performed. We investigated the impact of aortic arch anatomy, configuration, and the angles of the supra-aortic arteries, including the determination of vascular tortuosity index on device failure of Sentinel-CPS application. Results The Sentinel-CPS was applied successfully in 83 patients (90.2%). Device failure in nine patients (9.8%) was due to the infeasibility to perform correct deployment of both filters (n = 7) and to obtain peripheral radial access (n = 2). Patients with a failure of Sentinel-CPS application had a higher right subclavian tortuosity index (217 [92-324] vs. 150 [42-252], p = .046), a higher brachiocephalic tortuosity index (27 [5-51] vs. 10 [0-102], p = 0.033) and a larger angulation of the brachiocephalic artery (59 degrees [22-80] vs. 39 degrees [7-104], p = .014) compared with patients with successful application. A brachiocephalic angle more than 59 degrees was predictive for device failure. No differences in aortic arch anatomy or common carotid artery tortuosity were detected between the groups. Conclusions Brachiocephalic tortuosity was found to be associated with failure of Sentinel-CPS application. Filter-based usage should be avoided in TAVR patients with a brachiocephalic angle more than 59 degrees.

TI  - Efficacy of sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer with low- or high-intermediate risk
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives This study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping using indocyanine green (ICG) in Chinese women with endometrial cancer (EC). Methods Consecutive EC patients undergoing SLN mapping at Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University were retrospectively reviewed. Overall and bilateral SLN detection rates and SLN locations were presented. Sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and agreement rate were calculated and were compared between patients with low-intermediate (LIR) or high-intermediate risk (HIR). Results There were 454 patients screened, with SLN mapping with ICG performed in 428 patients and systematic lymphadenectomy performed in 159 patients. Overall and bilateral SLN detection rates were 96.50% and 82.71%, respectively. The sensitivity of SLN mapping was 80.00%, and the NPV was 97.76%. SLNs were most commonly located in obturator and external iliac regions. Efficacy of SLN mapping was higher in LIR patients than in HIR patients, with sensitivities of 100.00% and 75.00% (p > 0.05), NPVs of 100.00% and 90.00% (p = 0.002), and agreement rates of 100.00% and 92.31% (p = 0.007), respectively. Conclusion SLN mapping with ICG had acceptable diagnostic efficacy in Chinese women with EC, but may cause more missed diagnoses in patients with HIR due to relatively low NPV and agreement rate.

TI  - Comparison of influenza surveillance systems in Australia, China, Malaysia and expert recommendations for influenza control
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The Western Pacific Region (WPR) is exposed each year to seasonal influenza and is often the source of new influenza virus variants and novel pathogen emergence. National influenza surveillance systems play a critical role in detecting emerging viruses, monitoring influenza epidemics, improving public disease awareness and promoting pandemic preparedness, but vary widely across WPR countries. The aim of this study is to improve existing influenza surveillance systems by systematically comparing selected WPR influenza surveillance systems. Methods Three national influenza surveillance systems with different levels of development (Australia, China and Malaysia) were compared and their adherence to World Health Organization (WHO) guidance was evaluated using a structured framework previously tested in several European countries consisting of seven surveillance sub-systems, 19 comparable outcomes and five evaluation criteria. Based on the results, experts from the Asia-Pacific Alliance for the Control of Influenza (APACI) issued recommendations for the improvement of existing surveillance systems. Results Australia demonstrated the broadest scope of influenza surveillance followed by China and Malaysia. In Australia, surveillance tools covered all sub-systems. In China, surveillance did not cover non-medically attended respiratory events, primary care consultations, and excess mortality modelling. In Malaysia, surveillance consisted of primary care and hospital sentinel schemes. There were disparities between the countries across the 5 evaluation criteria, particularly regarding data granularity from health authorities, information on data representativeness, and data communication, especially the absence of publicly available influenza epidemiological reports in Malaysia. This dual approach describing the scope of surveillance and evaluating the adherence to WHO guidance enabled APACI experts to make a number of recommendations for each country that included but were not limited to introducing new surveillance tools, broadening the use of specific existing surveillance tools, collecting and sharing data on virus characteristics, developing immunization status registries, and improving public health communication. Conclusions Influenza monitoring in Australia, China, and Malaysia could benefit from the expansion of existing surveillance sentinel schemes, the broadened use of laboratory confirmation and the introduction of excess-mortality modelling. The results from the evaluation can be used as a basis to support expert recommendations and to enhance influenza surveillance capabilities.

TI  - Study of the urban microclimate using thermal UAV. The case of the mid-sized cities of Arica (arid) and Curic′o (Mediterranean), Chile
T2  - BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of the urban microclimate requires detailed information that is not available in most cities. The monitoring of climate parameters is reduced to a limited number of stations that are useful for urban climate studies at local or zonal scales. Detailed information is generally obtained through field work and fixed sensors. There are some climate parameters that can be obtained from remote sensors, such as the surface emission temperature, however, this information is only available in medium or low-resolution images from satellite images. Currently, it is possible to generate detailed information with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). There are not many UAVs that can capture information on the surface emission temperature and those that can are, in general, prohibitively expensive. Only a few years ago a low-cost drone became available, the Mavic 2 dual, equipped with a thermal sensor, which qualitatively captures information from the thermal field. This article proposes the study of the urban microclimate of two mid-size Chilean cities using thermal images captured with the Mavic 2 dual drone, for which it was first necessary to process the images and convert their values to degrees Celsius. The values obtained are compared with those derived from Modis and Landsat satellite images, evalu-ating the correlation of the information.

TI  - Analysis of Water Body Segmentation from Landsat Imagery using Deep Neural Network
T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The water body segmentation is precious for assessing its role in ecosystem services with the circumstances of climate change and global warming. The accurate water body segmentation from Landsat imagery is great implication for water resource planning and socioeconomic development. Deep Neural Network has capability to extract the useful features of the water body of Landsat imagery and classify as water body and non-water body. In this paper, the water body segmentation is carried out by creating and training a deep learning network called SegNet which is derived from VGG16. Pixel Labeled Data of the input dataset are used for training the deep hidden units and the learned features are used to extract the water body in input test images. The Landsat images are used to implement the proposed and the existing methods. The performance measures such as accuracy, mean Boundary F1 Score (BF) score and IoU (Intersection Over Union) are used to compare the proposed method with the existing methods. The proposed method shows improved performance than the existing methods with the average accuracy of 96.7%. Also, the performance of the proposed method is examined with different number of iterations and different sets of training samples. The performance analysis results are good reference for application developers of deep neural network.

TI  - Suitability assessment of global, continental and national digital elevation models for geomorphological analyses in Italy
T2  - TRANSACTIONS IN GIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital elevation models (DEMs) represent a fundamental resource in geomorphological analysis. The increasing availability of open-access DEMs over wide areas is advantageous, but requires an evaluation of DEM quality and errors. This work applies a hierarchical assessment of global, continental and national DEMs in Italy in order to explore the differences and analyze the vertical accuracy, spatial error distribution and agreement of morphometric measurements. The selected DEMs are compared with local reference data as a ground points dataset, extracted from the national geodetic network, and regional DEMs at high spatial resolution, through both a qualitative and a quantitative approach. The results identify limits and potentialities of the selected DEMs, showing accuracy and errors in height representation, also affected by the topographic characteristics of the surface, such as steep slope in mountain zones and some defects in hydromorphological derivatives that could condition the geomorphological applications.

TI  - Monsoon-seasonal validation of MODIS aerosol optical depth and characterization using AERONET observation retrieve over Italy
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study used Angstrom Exponent (AE) relationship with Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) obtained from spacebased direct sky-radiometer of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and direct Sun algorithm surface-based AERONET network (level 2.0 version 3) to evaluate monsoon season (June-September) aerosol optical depth and characterization at 7 Italy sites: IMAA_POTENZA (40.60N, 15.72E), ISPRA (45.80N, 8.62E), LAMPEDUSA (35.51N, 12.63E), MESSINA (38.19N, 15.56E), MODENA (44.63N, 10.94E), ROME_TOR_VERGATA (41.83N, 12.64E) and VENISE (45.31N, 12.50E) from 2010 to 2019. Standardized anomaly and the standard deviation ratio method of analysis to address the robustness of AE were identified to classify aerosols typing. The extracted monsoon AOD correlation between MODIS and AERONET is (r = 0.95) which is plausible to determine discrepancy in data handling. In order to remove large influence of annual cycle, the data were first detrend. The results show that standard deviation value > 1 indicates monthly dominance than climatology. The standardized anomaly records (-0.22 +/- 0.13) for MODIS and AERONET AODs with corresponding correlation of (r = 0.96) in June. There is disparity in AOD data handling from MODIS in some periods, which could attribute that space-based interpretation, should be validated with ground-base observation over Italy. The fine mode aerosols due to high AE values interestingly present the characteristic of AOD dominance, but experience trans-seasonal change, where MODIS has weak correlation.

TI  - Dune bistability identified by remote sensing in a semi-arid dune field of northern China
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand dunes could have bistable states based on the observation that bare dunes and vegetation-stabilized dunes can coexist in the same area under the same environmental conditions. So far, more quantitative evidence on such an interesting phenomenon has remained elusive. In this study, the vegetation coverage and spatial distribution of dunes in the semi-arid Mu Us dune field, north-central China, were investigated by different remote sensing indices derived from the Landsat images using the Google Earth Engine platform, and the results were verified using the aerial images. Frequency distribution of vegetation coverage in many sub-regions (5 km x 5 km) across the dune field clearly shows two dominant peaks, one around 5% and the other around 40%, representing active and stabilized dune states, respectively. The boundaries between the patches of these two states are sharp, and have hardly shifted during the last twenty years. Such coexistence of bistable states is mostly distributed across a precipitation gradient from 200 to 400 mm in the study area. The relative portion of active dunes in total is reduced with increasing precipitation, while the dominant peaks of vegetation coverage for two dune states remain largely unchanged. All these lines of evidence are in accordance with the theory of alternative stable states and model predictions. Because the reversal would be difficult once the dunes shifted into an undesired state from the standpoint of environmental management, detecting and monitoring these transitions, which are often abrupt, is important for better process-based understanding of the mechanisms involved and anticipating future transitions.

TI  - Contrasting land-uses in two small river basins impact the colored dissolved organic matter concentration and carbonate system along a river-coastal ocean continuum
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human activities have led to an increase in land use change, with effects on the structure and functioning of ecosystems. The impact of contrasting land uses along river basins on the concentration of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) reaching the coastal zone, and its relationship with the carbonate system of the adjacent coastal ocean, is poorly known. To understand the relationship between land use change, CDOM and its influence on the carbonate system, two watersheds with contrasting land uses in southern Chile were studied. The samples were collected at eight stations between river and adjacent coastal areas, during three sampling campaigns in the austral summer and spring. Chemical and biological samples were analyzed in the laboratory according to standard protocols. Landsat 8 satellite images of the study area were used for identification and supervised classification using remote sensing tools. The Yaldad River basin showed 82% of native forest and the Colu River basin around 38% of grassland (agriculture). Low total alkalinity (A(T)) and Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC), but high CDOM proportions were typically observed in freshwater. A higher CDOM and humic-like compounds concentration was observed along the river-coastal ocean continuum in the Yaldad basin, characterized by a predominance of native forests. In contrast, nutrient concentrations, A(T) and DIC, were higher in the Colu area. Low CaCO3 saturation state (Omega(Ar) < 2) and even undersaturation conditions were observed at the coastal ocean at Yaldad. A strong negative correlation between A(T), DIC and Omega(Ar) with CDOM/fDOM, suggested the influence of terrestrial material on the seawater carbon chemistry. Our results provide robust evidence that land uses in river basins can influence CDOM/fDOM proportion and its influence on the carbonate chemistry of the adjacent coastal, with potential implications for the shellfish farming activity in this region.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel optical and radar data for mapping smallholder coffee production systems in Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Perennial commodity crops, such as coffee, often play a large role globally in agricultural markets and supply chains and locally in livelihoods, poverty reduction, and biodiversity. Yet, the production of spatial information on these crops are often overlooked in favor of annual food crops. Remote sensing detection of coffee faces a particular set of challenges due to persistent cloud cover in the tropical "coffee belt," hilly topography in coffee growing regions, diversity of coffee growing systems, and spectral similarity to other tree crops and agricultural land. Looking at the major coffee growing region in Dak Lak, Vietnam, we integrate multi-temporal 10 m optical Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to map three coffee production systems: i) open-canopy sun coffee, ii) intercropped and other shaded coffee and iii) newly planted or young coffee. Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE), we compute five sets of features in order to best enhance separability between coffee and other land cover and within coffee production systems. The features include Sentinel-2 dry and wet season composites, Sentinel-1 texture features, Sentinel-1 spatiotemporal metrics, and topographic features. Using a random forest classification algorithm, we produce a 9-class land cover map including our three coffee production classes and a binary coffee/non-coffee map. The binary map has an overall accuracy of 89% and the three coffee production systems have user accuracies of 65, 56, 71% for sun coffee, intercropped coffee and newly planted coffee, respectively. This is a first effort at large-scale distinction of within-crop production styles and has implications across many applications. The binary coffee map can be used as a high-resolution crop mask, whereas the detailed land cover map can inform monitoring of deforestation dynamics, biodiversity, sustainability certification and implementation of climate adaptation strategies. This work offers a scalable approach to integrating optical and radar Sentinel data for production of spatially explicit agricultural infor-mation and contributes particularly to tree crop and agroforestry mapping, which often is overlooked in between agricultural and forestry sciences.

TI  - Telemedicine trends at a comprehensive cancer center during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction This article reports on the effects of an early outbreak during the COVID-19 pandemic on visit volume and telehealth use by various specialists at a comprehensive cancer center. Materials and Methods The number of on-site and telehealth visits (THV) for medical and surgical specialties were obtained from scheduling software. Results Total visits were most drastically limited in April 2020 to a low point of 3139; THV made up 28% of all visits. For head and neck surgery, THV made up 54% and 30% of visits in April and May, respectively. Other specialties, such as psychiatry and palliative care, had higher levels of THV. For most specialties, the rebound in June through September did not make up for visits lost during the outbreak, and fiscal year (FY) 2020 had a 9% loss from FY 2019 with 5786 fewer total annual visits across all specialties. Conclusions While telemedicine was a helpful part of this cancer center's response to the initial COVID-19 surge, it was not able to replace the in-person services offered at the same center. The main strategy of physicians at this cancer center was to defer care, with telemedicine being an auxiliary response.

TI  - Assimilation of surface reflectance in snow simulations: Impact on bulk snow variables
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Data assimilation of snow observations significantly improves the accuracy of snow cover simulations. However, remotely-sensed snowpack observations made in areas of complex topography are typically subject to large error and biases, creating a challenge for data assimilation. To improve the reliability of ensemble snowpack simulations, this study investigated the appropriate conditions for assimilating MODIS-like synthetic surface reflectances. We used a simulation system that included the Particle Filter data assimilation technique. More than 270 ensemble simulations involving assimilation of synthetic observations were conducted in a twin experiment procedure for three snow seasons. These tests were aimed at establishing the spectral combination of MODIS-like reflectances that convey the more information in the assimilation system, rendering the most reliable snowpack simulation, and determining the maximum observation errors that the assimilation system could tolerate. The assimilation of the first seven MODIS-like bands, covering visible and near-infrared wavelengths, provided the best scores compared with any other band combination, and thus are highly recommended for use when possible. The simulation system tolerated a maximum deviation from ground truth of 5% without loss of performance. However, the assimilation of the first seven bands of true MODIS surface of reflectance fails on improving simulation results in rouged mountain areas.

TI  - Being Evangelical is Complicated: How Students' Identities and Experiences Moderate Their Perceptions of Campus Climate
T2  - REVIEW OF RELIGIOUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Evangelical Christian college students navigate campus buoyed by Christian privilege but may encounter silencing or othering tied to their religious beliefs, a feeling of incompatibility with their campus climate, and conflations of their religious and political beliefs that are inaccurate and discouraging. Unsupportive campus climates can discourage evangelical students from having productive exchanges across difference and deepening their own worldview commitments, which is concerning due to their general lack of interfaith participation that challenges stereotypes and unnuanced assumptions. Purpose This study explores how evangelical Christians perceive their campus climates and whether those perceptions are different based on other social identity intersections with gender, race, sexuality, and political affiliation. In addition to individual characteristics, how the campus environment and various curricular and co-curricular experiences moderate evangelical students' perceptions of the worldview climate is examined. Methods A sample of 1235 evangelical college students was examined via means, standard deviations, and ranges for six campus climate measures, one-way ANOVAs to examine whether those measures differed by different identity dimensions, and then multilevel modeling to better understand the role of campus experiences in evangelicals' perceptions of their campus climate. Results Evangelical students' campus climate perceptions were generally positive; more provocative encounters were reported by women than men and evangelical Asian students indicated more divisiveness, more insensitivity, and less space for support than their peers. Political affiliation also revealed several significant differences in perceived campus climate. Interfaith engagement through pre-college activities, formal and informal activities, and friendships were connected to perceptions of campus climate, with those reporting more engagement being more likely to have productive encounters across difference and to report insensitivity or divisiveness. Religious affiliation was the most significant institutional characteristic. Conclusions and Implications This study illuminates how collegiate experiences and campus environments exacerbate or attenuate evangelical Christian students' perceptions of the campus climate, and the results indicate that effective teaching practices where true interfaith experiences happen and that create inclusive space for evangelical students in the classroom are key to fostering development, especially in light of the social status ambiguity evangelical college students may be experiencing during their college years.

TI  - Plant cover as an estimator of above-ground biomass in semi-arid woody vegetation in Northeast Patagonia, Argentina
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of carbon storage in vegetation biomass is a crucial factor in the estimation and mitigation of CO2 emissions. Globally, arid and semi-arid regions are considered an important carbon sink. However, they have received limited attention and, therefore, it should be a priority to develop tools to quantify biomass at the local and regional scales. Individual plant variables, such as stem diameter and crown area, were reported to be good predictors of individual plant weight. Stand-level variables, such as plant cover and mean height, are also easy-to-measure estimators of above-ground biomass (AGB) in dry regions. In this study, we estimated the AGB in semi-arid woody vegetation in Northeast Patagonia, Argentina. We evaluated whether the AGB at the stand level can be estimated based on plant cover and to what extent the estimation accuracy can be improved by the inclusion of other field-measured structure variables. We also evaluated whether remote sensing technologies can be used to reliably estimate and map the regional mean biomass. For this purpose, we analyzed the relationships between field-measured woody vegetation structure variables and AGB as well as LANDSAT TM-derived variables. We obtained a modelbased ratio estimate of regional mean AGB and its standard error. Total plant cover allowed us to obtain a reliable estimation of local AGB, and no better fit was attained by the inclusion of other structure variables. The stand-level plant cover ranged between 18.7% and 95.2% and AGB between about 2.0 and 70.8 Mg/hm(2). AGB based on total plant cover was well estimated from LANDSAT TM bands 2 and 3, which facilitated a model-based ratio estimate of the regional mean AGB (approximately 12.0 Mg/hm(2)) and its sampling error (about 30.0%). The mean AGB of woody vegetation can greatly contribute to carbon storage in semi-arid lands. Thus, plant cover estimation by remote sensing images could be used to obtain regional estimates and map biomass, as well as to assess and monitor the impact of land-use change on the carbon balance, for arid and semi-arid regions.

TI  - Riverine flood mapping and impact assessment using remote sensing technique: a case study of Chenab flood-2014 in Multan district, Punjab, Pakistan
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Multan district is mainly prone to riverine floods but has remained understudied. Chenab flood-2014 was the worst flood that this district experienced in recorded history. This study applies remote sensing (RS) techniques to estimate the extent, calculate duration, assess the major causes and resulting impacts of the flood-2014, using Landsat-8 OLI images. These images were obtained for pre-flood, during-flood and post-flood instances. Secondary data of flood causing factors were obtained for comprehensive analysis. Spatially trained and validated datasets were obtained through Google Earth platform and Global positioning system. The supervised classification with maximum likelihood algorithm was used to classify land use and land cover of the study area. The Modified Normalized Difference Water Index was utilized to detect flood inundation extent and duration, and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index was utilized to monitor vegetation coverage and changes. The analysis allowed us to assess flood causes, and calculate the extent of the flooded areas with duration and recession, as well as damages to standing crops and built-up areas. The results revealed that the flood-2014 occurred due to heavy rains in early September in upper Chenab catchment. The flood inundation continued for around two months, which heavily affected agriculture and built-up areas. The present study introduces practical use of RS techniques to provide basis for effective flood inundation mapping and impact assessment, as an application for early flood response and recovery in the world.

TI  - Inter-correlation of hydrothermal mineral alteration zone in the vicinity of lineaments
T2  - CURRENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There are significant and effective roles of geological structures such as lineaments in mineral zone identification and interpretation, exploration and mapping of rock units, litho-boundaries, local tectonic zones and fractures, and hydrothermal alteration facies. The aim of this study was to extract lineaments of Jahajpur region of Bhilwara district, Rajashtan automatically and digitally using Sentinel 2A optical data. The automatic lineament extraction by 'LINE' algorithms tool with involvement of several processing steps and parameters of PCI Geomatica evaluated digitally extracted lineaments, geospatial analyses such as length of lineaments, lineament density and lineament orientation. The obtained results were validated through assessment of geomorphic and structural features interpretation by numerical, analogical, and geospatial analysis and field survey for a better understanding and correlation. The vicinity of extracted lineament and lineament densities show the various alteration minerals such as clay, talc, mica, dolomite and goethite. Thus, we can conclude that lineaments have excellent inter-relationship with hydrothermal alteration and weathering zones in the western Jahajpur belt, Rajasthan.

AB  - Waterbody identification from satellite images in an automated manner is one of the difficult tasks in the domain of Remote Sensing (RS). In recent years, several image processing approaches have been developed to process RGB or multispectral images to analyze the availability of land, water prediction, object detection, climate change, LULC, and many others. In this study, a Multi-data Fusion Network (MDFN) is developed to extract the sources of water by utilizing Sentinel-2 satellite images. The spatial features are extracted by proposed model from RS images by comprising multiple structural learning-assisted feature fusion layers for water resource prediction. To justify the prediction performance, the calculated outcomes of developed solution are correlated with the other approaches such as DeepLabv3+, VGG, NDWI, SegNet, DenseNet, and ResNet. The calculated outcomes define the prediction superiority over the other models by registering the high value of Precision, F1-score, Recall, and IoU with the value of 0.958%, 0.928%, 0.899%, and 0.874%, respectively.

TI  - Semantic modelling of Earth Observation remote sensing
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation (EO) based on Remote Sensing (RS) is gaining importance nowadays, since it offers a wellgrounded technological framework for the development of advanced applications in multiple domains, such as climate change, precision agriculture, smart urbanism, safety, and many others. This promotes the continuous generation of data-driven software facilities oriented to advanced processing, analysis and visualization, which often offer enhanced computing capabilities. Nevertheless, the development of knowledge-driven approaches is still an open challenge in remote sensing, besides they provide human experts with domain knowledge representation, support for data standardization and semantic integration of sources, which indeed enhance the construction of advanced on-top applications. To this end, the use of ontologies and web semantic technologies have shown high success in knowledge representation in many fields, in which the Earth Observation is not an exception. However, as argued by the research community, there is large room for improvement in the specific case of remote sensing, where ontologies that consider the special nature and structure of different satellital and airborne data products are demanded. This article addresses, in first instance, part of this need by proposing a semantic model for the consolidation, integration, reasoning and linking of data (and meta-data), in the context of satellital remote sensing products for EO. With this objective, an OWL ontology has been developed and an RDF repository has been generated to allow advanced SPARQL querying. Although the proposal has been designed to consider remote sensing data products in general, the current study is mainly focused on the Sentinel 2 satellite mission from the Copernicus Programme of the European Space Agency (ESA). Four different use cases are showcased to check potentials of the proposed semantic model in terms of ontology integration, federated querying, data analysis and reasoning.

TI  - Spatial autocorrelation study of fatal yellowing in organic oil palm in the eastern Amazon
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is a very important source of vegetable oil worldwide. While oil palm cultivation is not currently economically significant in Brazil, there is immense growth potential for this crop in the Amazon region, with no need for deforestation. Fatal yellowing (FY) is a major phytosanitary barrier to the development of oil palm cultivation in the region. Many plantations have been devastated by FY, but its causes are unknown. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatial autocorrelation of FY in the oil palm crop by applying Moran's Index (I). The experiment was carried out on a large farm (>8000 ha) in the municipality of Acara, in the state of Para (Brazil), with 139 plots of oil palm of different genetic materials and ages. The number of diseased plants per plot has been recorded since 2001 and used in the analysis. A positive autocorrelation of disease incidence was calculated based on the observations of the current study. By calculation of the Local Moran's I it was possible to identify the presence of high-incidence regions in the northeast and the central-west areas of the farm and low-incidence areas in the south and the north and in outlying plots. The approach described in this study was useful in identifying regions with the highest occurrence of FY, and could be useful in the management of this disease.

TI  - The Utility of Indocyanine Green Dye Fluorescence Lymphography and Angiography During Wide Excision of Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - SURGICAL INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives. Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma patients. Recent studies showed that indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence lymphography helps locating sentinel nodes better. Sometimes, flap reconstruction is needed after wide excision of tumor. Indocyanine green fluorescence also simplifies the intraoperative design of flaps. This study investigates the use of ICG fluorescence in patients with cutaneous melanoma during operation. Methods. We performed a single-center, retrospective study of subjects with cutaneous melanoma using ICG lymphograhy and/or angiography during wide excision of tumor between 2015 and 2019. Patients received a dermal injection of ICG and patent blue (PB) dye. The positive node was excised. Indocyanine green angiography was utilized to visualize better skin paddle during flap reconstruction if needed. Results. A total of 37 sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) were removed in 12 patients. Indocyanine green successful localization was found in 10 of the 12 patients (83%). Three patients were found with 6 metastatic nodes on final pathology. 100% of these 6 nodes were identified by ICG, while 83% (5/6) were positive PB. Three of the 12 patients received flap reconstruction after operation, and no major complications occurred. Conclusions. ICG dye lymphangiography is a good alternative for locating SLNs in patients with melanoma. It could also visualize well perfusion skin paddle during reconstruction. We reported a reproducible and simple method to utilize ICG fluorescence in cutaneous melanoma patients.

TI  - Towards a novel approach for Sentinel-3 synergistic OLCI/SLSTR cloud and cloud shadow detection based on stereo cloud-top height estimation
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-3 is an Earth observation satellite constellation launched by the European Space Agency. Each satellite carries two optical multispectral instruments: the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and the Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR). OLCI and SLSTR sensors produce images covering the visible and infrared spectrum that can be collocated in order to generate synergistic products. In Earth observation, a particular weakness of optical sensors is their high sensitivity to clouds and their shadows. An incorrect cloud and cloud shadow detection leads to mistakes in both land and ocean retrievals of biophysical parameters. In order to exploit both OLCI and SLSTR capabilities, image co-registration at ground level is needed. However, applying such collocation of the images results in cloud location mismatches due to the different viewing angles of OLCI and SLSTR, which complicates the synergistic cloud detection. This study seeks to provide a solution to correctly obtain the projected clouds based on the estimation of cloud top heights in order to better collocate clouds between sensors and detect their shadows. The study presents a forward and backward method to estimate the real nadir position of a cloud on the satellite image starting from an existing cloud mask, as well as the corresponding cloud projections on the surface depending on the solar and sensor viewing angles. The estimation of cloud top heights is based on differences in the cloud projections from SLSTR nadir and oblique views. Experimental results show that the stereo cloud matching based on maximum cross-correlation between SLSTR nadir and oblique spectra was the most robust method to match SLSTR clouds for both nadir and oblique views as compared to spectral distance and spectral angle minimization. We test the method over several images around the world, leading to higher overall accuracy (OA) as compared to Sentinel-3 official products, both in detecting SLSTR clouds and OLCI cloud shadows (SLSTR nadir OA = 93.6%, SLSTR oblique OA = 88.7%, OLCI cloud shadow OA = 93.9% for the stereo matcher, against 82.2%, 81.3% and 90.5%, respectively, for the official Sentinel-3 products). This study also provides a starting point in the development of a cloud screening approach for the upcoming Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) satellite mission, expected to fly in tandem with Sentinel-3.

TI  - Comment on "Recent global decline of CO<sub>2</sub> fertilization effects on vegetation photosynthesis" <i>COMMENT</i>
T2  - SCIENCE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Wang et al. (Research Articles, 11 December 2020, p. 1295), using photosynthesis proxies from long-term satellite records, report a significant decline in CO2 fertilization effects. We find that small systematic biases in Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data affect their analysis to the degree that the key finding is not robust. Caution is recommended when using AVHRR to detect changes in nearinfrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) trends and vegetation indices.

TI  - Effects and mechanisms of Cd remediation with zeolite in brown rice (Oryza sativa)
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effects of zeolite amendment on the Cd absorption and accumulation of two varieties of rice, ZY-18 (Zheyou 18, hybrid indica) and DL-5 (Donglian 5, conventional indica), planted in a slightly Cd-contaminated paddy soil, and the associated mechanisms were studied based on a pot experiment. The results showed that zeolite addition significantly reduced the Cd availability in the soil by the increasing of soil pH and the Cd sorption capacity of soil, as well as the reduction of Eh, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the water-soluble Fe/Mn in the soil. The decrease in the amount of Fe and Cd in iron plaques on rice roots treated with zeolite resulted in the reduction of Cd uptake by rice roots. Zeolite application decreased the Cd contents in the roots, stems and leaves, and finally the brown rice through the inhibition of uptake and translocation of Cd by rice plant. The Cd concentration in rice grains of ZY-18 was more decreased than that of DL-5, which was attributed to its higher pH and lower Eh, DOC, and Cd availability in the soil, higher mounts of iron plaque and Cd in plaques on rice roots, and lower rootto-grain transfer factor (TFroot-grain) of ZY-18.

TI  - Stability evaluation at Xishan Loess landslide using InSAR technique applying ascending and descending SAR data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The early identification and monitoring of landslides is of great significance to disaster assessment, mitigation, and prevention. Although interferometric radar technology can achieve large-scale and infinite-point with high-precision surface deformation monitoring, when the real deformation direction is different from the radar line of sight direction, its detection sensitivity will be reduced. We take the Xishan landslide group in Qinghai Province as the research object and use the ascending and descending Sentinel-1A data from January 9, 2019, to April 9, 2020, to reconstruct the slope direction velocity field based on conversion relationship; and using the mutual verification of ascending and descending orbit can obtain accurate and reliable unstable slope range. Adopting fusion of ascending and descending orbit data, with the decomposition of the deformation information of the Xishan landslide group, the vertical and east-west deformations of the slope are extracted, and the stability of the slope is analyzed based on the deformation characteristics of the landslide, topography, and site survey results.

TI  - Analytic and numerical methods for the Abel transform of exponential functions for planetary and cometary atmospheres
T2  - ICARUS
M3  - Article
AB  - Line-of-sight integration of emissions from planetary and cometary atmospheres is the Abel transform of the emission rate, under the spherical symmetry assumption. Indefinite integrals constructed from the Abel transform integral are useful for implementing remote sensing data analysis methods, such as the numerical inverse Abel transform. We propose analytical expressions obtained by a suitable, non-alternating, series development to compute those indefinite integrals. We establish expressions allowing absolute accuracy control of the convergence of these series and illustrate how this accuracy depends on the number of terms involved in the series computation. We compare the analytical method with numerical computation techniques, which are found to be sufficiently accurate as well. Inverse Abel transform fitting is then tested in order to establish that the expected emission rate profiles can be retrieved from the observation of both planetary and cometary atmospheres. We show that the method is robust, i.e. that it can be applied even when the properties of the observed atmosphere depart from the assumed ones, especially when Tikhonov regularization is included. A first application is conducted over observation of comet 46P/Wirtanen, showing some variability, possibly attributable to an evolution of the contamination by dust and icy grains.

TI  - Statistical inference for trends in spatiotemporal data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global change analyses are facilitated by the growing number of remote-sensing datasets that have both broad spatial extent and repeated observations over decades. These datasets provide unprecedented power to detect patterns of time trends involving information from all pixels on a map. However, rigorously testing for time trends requires a solid statistical foundation to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses. Appropriate statistical analyses are challenging because environmental data often have temporal and spatial autocorrelation, which can either obscure underlying patterns in the data or suggest false associations between patterns in the data and independent values used to explain them. Existing statistical methods that account for temporal and spatial autocorrelation are not practical for remote-sensing datasets that often contain millions of pixels. Here, we first analyze simulated data to show the need to account for both spatial and temporal autocorrelation in time-trend analyses. Second, we present a new statistical approach, PARTS (Partitioned Autoregressive Time Series), to identify underlying patterns and test hypotheses about time trends using all pixels in large remotesensing datasets. PARTS is flexible and can include, for example, the effects of multiple independent variables, such as land-cover or latitude, on time trends. Third, we use PARTS to analyze global trends in NDVI, focusing on trends in pixels that have not experienced land-cover change. We found that despite the appearance of overall increases in NDVI in all continents, there is little statistical support for these trends except for Asia and Europe, and only in some land-cover classes. Furthermore, we found no overall latitudinal trend in greening for any continent, but some latitude by land-cover class interactions, implying that latitudinal patterns differed among land-cover classes. PARTS makes it possible to identify patterns and test hypotheses that involve the aggregate information from many pixels on a map, thereby increasing the value of existing remote-sensing datasets.

TI  - A pharmacological approach assessing the role of mast cells in insulin infusion site inflammation
T2  - DRUG DELIVERY AND TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Extending the lifespan of subcutaneous insulin administration sets and infusion pumps requires overcoming unreliable insulin delivery induced by dermal reactions. All commercially available insulin formulations contain insulin phenolic preservatives (IPP), which stabilize the insulin molecule but result in unwanted cell and tissue toxicity. Mast cells, which are the first line of defense once the epithelium is breached, are particularly abundant beneath the skin surface. Thus, we hypothesize a sequence of events initiated by device insertion that activates skin mast cells (MC) that subsequently trigger neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage recruitment. The ensuing inflammatory response compromises effective insulin infusion therapy.MethodsWe employed a non-genetic, pharmacological approach to MC membrane stabilization using Cromolyn sodium (CS), which inhibits MC degranulation. These studies were conducted in our modified air pouch mouse model using non-diabetic and streptozotocin induced diabetic mice. We evaluated the impact of systemic CS through intraperitoneal injections, as well as the impact of local CS through co-infusion, on infusion catheter insertion and IPP-induced inflammation.ResultsCS at a concentration of 50 mg/kg minimized inflammation triggered in response to insulin phenolic preservatives present in standard insulin formulations. The resultant degree of tissue inflammation was comparable to that observed with saline injections.Conclusion Targeting MC has the potential to extend the longevity of insulin infusion sets by mitigating the inflammatory response. Future studies should be directed at employing other MC models, such as newer Cre/loxP mouse strains, to confirm the sentinel role of MC in insulin infusion therapy.

TI  - Giant ice rings in southern Baikal: multi-satellite data help to study ice cover dynamics and eddies under ice
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice cover on lakes is subject to atmospheric forcing from above and the influence of water dynamics and heat flux from below. One characteristic example of these influences in some large lakes, such as Lake Baikal in Russia, are the giant ice rings and the associated eddies under the ice cover. In April 2020 a giant ice ring appeared in southern Baikal, and a lens-like eddy was detected below the ice. We analysed the temporal changes of ice cover using satellite images from multiple satellite missions - MODIS on Terra and Aqua, Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel 2 MSI, Landsat 8, PlanetScope, satellite photography from the International Space Station, and radar altimetry data from Jason-3. Satellite imagery and meteorological data show unusual temporal changes of ice colour in April 2020, which were explained by water infiltration into the ice followed by the competing influences of cold air from above and the warm eddy below the ice. Tracking of ice floe displacement also makes it possible to estimate eddy currents and their influence on the upper water layer. Multi-satellite data contribute to a better understanding of the development of ice cover in the presence of eddies, the role of eddies in horizontal and vertical heat and mass exchange, and their impact on the chemistry and biology of the lakes and on human activity.

TI  - Estimation of all-sky 1 km land surface temperature over the conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a crucial parameter for hydrology, climate monitoring, and ecological and environmental research. LST products from thermal infrared (TIR) satellite data have been widely used for that. However, TIR information cannot provide LST data under cloudy-sky conditions. All-sky LST can be estimated from microwave measurements, but their coarse spatial resolution, narrow swaths, and short temporal range make it impossible to generate a long-term, high-resolution, accurate global all-sky LST global. This study proposes a methodology for generating the all-sky LST product by combining multiple data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), reanalysis, and ground in situ measurements using a random forest. Field measurements from the AmeriFlux and Surface Radiation Budget (SURFRAD) networks were used for model training and validation. Cloudy-sky and clear-sky LST models were developed separately. To further improve the accuracy of the cloudy-sky LST model, the conventional RF model was extended to incorporate temporal information. The models were validated using in situ LST measurements from 2010, 2011, and 2017 that were not used for the model training. For the cloudy-sky and clear-sky models, root-mean-square-error (RMSE) = 2.767 and 2.756 K, R2 = 0.943 and 0.963, and bias = -0.143 and - 0.138 K, respectively. The same validation samples were used to validate both the MODIS LST product under clear-sky conditions and allsky Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) LST product at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution, with RMSE = 3.033 and 4.157 K, bias = -0.362 and - 0.224 K, and R2 = 0.904 and 0.955, respectively. Additionally, the 10-fold cross-validation results using all the training datasets further indicate the model stability. The models were applied to generate the all-sky LST product from 2000 to 2015 over the conterminous United States (CONUS). Our product shows similar spatial patterns to the MODIS and GLDAS LST products, but it is more accurate. Both validation and product comparisons demonstrated the robustness of our proposed models in generating the allsky LST product.

TI  - Delineation of Groundwater Potential Zones (GWPZ) of Port Blair, Andaman Islands, India, using Multi Influencing Factors (MIF) method and geospatial techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study intended to delineate the groundwater potential zones (GWPZ) of Port Blair and its surrounding areas using the Multi Influencing Factor (MIF) method and geospatial techniques. Multiple data such as geology, geomorphology, slope, soil, drainage density, lineament density, rainfall, NDVI, and LULC were considered for delineating GWPZ. Spatially distributed maps/thematic layers of all the factors mentioned above were prepared using remotely sensed data and by using ground data. These thematic layers were allotted weights after referring to previous literature and study and by considering each layer's influence on groundwater. Finally, all the thematic layers were integrated, and overlay analysis was done to produce a map showing the GWPZ of Port Blair and its surrounding areas. The result (map) was categorized into high, medium, and low groundwater potential zones. This study shows that most of Port Blair's areas come under the medium GWPZ (63.4% of the study area), followed by high GWPZ (27% of the study area), and 10.6% of the area comes under low GWPZ. The most important and innovative part of this study is the physical verification of all the results obtained from the remote sensing and GIS techniques. The GWPZ map was compared with existing well discharge data and validated through the ROC curve, and it shows the study has "very good" accuracy. Finally, this study provides an expedient approach to delineate the GWPZ for practicable management and use of groundwater resources of the area to maintain the sustainability of this island.

TI  - Livestock Presence Influences the Seroprevalence of Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever Virus on Sympatric Wildlife in Kenya
T2  - VECTOR-BORNE AND ZOONOTIC DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is an emerging tick-borne zoonotic viral disease with the potential of causing public health emergencies. However, less is known about the role of wildlife and livestock in spreading the virus. Therefore, we aimed to assess how the interactions between African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) and cattle may influence the seroprevalence of CCHF across livestock-wildlife management systems in Kenya. The study included archived sera samples from buffalo and cattle from wildlife only habitats (Lake Nakuru National Park and Solio conservancy), open wildlife-livestock integrated habitats (Maasai Mara ecosystem and Meru National Park), and closed wildlife-livestock habitats (Ol Pejeta Conservancy) in Kenya. We analyzed 191 buffalo and 139 cattle sera using IDvet multispecies, double-antigen IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The seroprevalence toward Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) was significantly higher for buffalo compared to cattle (75.3% and 28.1%, respectively, p < 0.001). We obtained the highest seroprevalence among buffalo of 92.1% in closed wildlife only systems compared to 28.8% and 46.1% prevalence in closed-integrated and open-integrated systems, respectively. The regression coefficients were all negative for cattle compared to buffalo in both closed-integrated and open-integrated compared to wildlife only system. Our results show that CCHFV circulates among the diverse animal community in Kenya in spatially disconnected foci. The habitat overlap between cattle and buffalo makes cattle a "bridge species" or superspreader host for CCHFV and increases transmission risks to humans. The effect of animal management system on prevalence is depended on tick control on the cattle and not the animal per se. We conclude that buffalo, a host with a longer life span than livestock, is a reservoir and may serve as a sentinel population for longitudinal surveillance of CCHFV.

TI  - Association of residential greenness with geriatric depression among the elderly covered by long-term care insurance in Shanghai
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Residential greenness exposure has been linked to a number of physical and mental disorders. Nevertheless, evidence on the association between greenness and geriatric depression was limited and focused on developed countries. This study was aimed to investigate whether the relationship between residential greenness exposure and geriatric depression exists among the elderly with long-term care insurance (LTCI) in Shanghai, China. In 2018, a total of 1066 LTCI elderly from a cross-sectional survey completed a questionnaire in Shanghai. Residential greenness indicators, including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), were calculated from the Landsat 8 imagery data in different buffers (100-m, 300-m, and 500-m). Mediation analysis by perceived social support was conducted to explore potential mechanisms underlying the associations. In the fully adjusted model, one IQR increase of NDVI and SAVI in the 300-m buffer size was associated with an 11.9% (PR: 0.881, 95% CI: 0.795, 0.977) and 14.7% (PR: 0.853, 95% CI: 0.766, 0.949) lower prevalence of geriatric depression, respectively. Stronger association was observed in the elderly with lower education level, living in non-central area, and lower family monthly income. Perceived social support significantly mediated 40.4% of the total effect for NDVI 300-m buffer and 40.3% for SAVI 300-m buffer to the greenness-depression association, respectively. Our results indicate the importance of residential greenness exposure to geriatric depression, especially for the elderly with lower education level, living in non-central area, and lower family monthly income. Perceived social support might mediate the association. Well-designed longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm our findings and investigate the underlying mechanisms.

TI  - Global distribution of methane emissions: a comparative inverse analysis of observations from the TROPOMI and GOSAT satellite instruments
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We evaluate the global atmospheric methane column retrievals from the new TROPOMI satellite instrument and apply them to a global inversion of methane sources for 2019 at 2 degrees x2.5 degrees horizontal resolution. We compare the results to an inversion using the sparser but more mature GOSAT satellite retrievals and to a joint inversion using both TROPOMI and GOSAT. Validation of TROPOMI and GOSAT with TCCON ground-based measurements of methane columns, after correcting for retrieval differences in prior vertical profiles and averaging kernels using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, shows global biases of -2.7ppbv for TROPOMI and -1.0ppbv for GOSAT and regional biases of 6.7ppbv for TROPOMI and 2.9ppbv for GOSAT. Intercomparison of TROPOMI and GOSAT shows larger regional discrepancies exceeding 20ppbv, mostly over regions with low surface albedo in the shortwave infrared where the TROPOMI retrieval may be biased. Our inversion uses an analytical solution to the Bayesian inference of methane sources, thus providing an explicit characterization of error statistics and information content together with the solution. TROPOMI has similar to 100 times more observations than GOSAT, but error correlation on the 2 degrees x2.5 degrees scale of the inversion and large spatial inhomogeneity in the number of observations make it less useful than GOSAT for quantifying emissions at that scale. Finer-scale regional inversions would take better advantage of the TROPOMI data density. The TROPOMI and GOSAT inversions show consistent downward adjustments of global oil-gas emissions relative to a prior estimate based on national inventory reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change but consistent increases in the south-central US and in Venezuela. Global emissions from livestock (the largest anthropogenic source) are adjusted upward by TROPOMI and GOSAT relative to the EDGAR v4.3.2 prior estimate. We find large artifacts in the TROPOMI inversion over southeast China, where seasonal rice emissions are particularly high but in phase with extensive cloudiness and where coal emissions may be misallocated. Future advances in the TROPOMI retrieval together with finer-scale inversions and improved accounting of error correlations should enable improved exploitation of TROPOMI observations to quantify and attribute methane emissions on the global scale.

Time series synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery enables detection of reach-scale glacier melt characteristics across continents. We analyze C -band Sentinel-1 A/B SAR time series data, comprised of 32 741 Sentinel-1 A/B SAR images, and determine the duration of seasonal glacier melting for 105 432 mapped glaciers (83 102 km(2) glacierized area, defined using optical observations) in the HKH across the calendar years 2017-2019. Melt onset and duration are recorded at 90 m spatial resolution and 12 d temporal repeat. All glacier areas within the HKH exhibit some degree of melt. Melt signals persist for over two-thirds of the year at elevations below 4000 m a.s.l. and for nearly half of the calendar year at elevations exceeding 7000 m a.s.l. Retrievals of seasonal melting span all elevation ranges of glacierized area in the HKH region, extending greater than 1 km above the maximum elevation of an interpolated 0 degrees C summer isotherm and at the top of Mount Everest, where in situ data and surface energy balance models indicate that the Khumbu Glacier is melting at surface air temperatures below -10 degrees C. Sentinel-1 melt retrievals reflect broad-scale trends in glacier mass balance across the region, where the duration of melt retrieved in the Karakoram is on average 16 d less than in the eastern Himalaya sub-region. Furthermore, percolation zones are apparent from meltwater retention indicated by delayed refreeze. Time series SAR datasets are suitable to support operational monitoring of glacier surface melt and the development and assessment of surface energy balance models of melt-driven ablation across the global cryosphere.

TI  - Satellites for long-term monitoring of inland US lakes: The MERIS time series and application for chlorophyll-a
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes and other surface fresh waterbodies provide drinking water, recreational and economic opportunities, food, and other critical support for humans, aquatic life, and ecosystem health. Lakes are also productive ecosystems that provide habitats and influence global cycles. Chlorophyll concentration provides a common metric of water quality, and is frequently used as a proxy for lake trophic state. Here, we document the generation and distribution of the complete MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS; Appendix A provides a complete list of abbreviations) radiometric time series for over 2300 satellite resolvable inland bodies of water across the contiguous United States (CONUS) and more than 5,000 in Alaska. This contribution greatly increases the ease of use of satellite remote sensing data for inland water quality monitoring, as well as highlights new horizons in inland water remote sensing algorithm development. We evaluate the performance of satellite remote sensing Cyanobacteria Index (CI)-based chlorophyll algorithms, the retrievals for which provide surrogate estimates of phytoplankton concentrations in cyanobacteria dominated lakes. Our analysis quantifies the algorithms' abilities to assess lake trophic state across the CONUS. As a case study, we apply a bootstrapping approach to derive a new CI-to-chlorophyll relationship, Chl(BS), which performs relatively well with a multiplicative bias of 1.11 (11%) and mean absolute error of 1.60 (60%). While the primary contribution of this work is the distribution of the MERIS radiometric timeseries, we provide this case study as a roadmap for future stakeholders' algorithm development activities, as well as a tool to assess the strengths and weaknesses of applying a single algorithm across CONUS.

TI  - A legendary landscape in peril: Land use and land cover change and environmental impacts in the Wulagai River Basin, Inner Mongolia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mongolian Plateau, home to the world's largest contiguous temperate grasslands, has been known for its vast steppe landscapes and legendary history of the Mongol Empire. However, like temperate grasslands elsewhere around the world, the Mongolian steppe landscapes have been severely degraded by increasing human activities during the past several decades. The main objective of this study was to assess the landscape and ecosystem changes in the Wulagai River Basin (WRB) in Inner Mongolia, where China's last intact steppe ecosystem reportedly resides. Using remote sensing data and landscape metrics, we found that, during 1979-2016, WRB lost about 55 % of wetlands, 76 % of shrublands, and 46 % of sandy-land vegetation, with its most dominant vegetation type shifting from meadow steppe to dry steppe for the first time in history. Human land uses continued to intensify: cropland expanded by about 40 %; impervious surface area increased by almost 34 times; and surface coal mining rampaged through the heartland, tearing up vegetation and sucking up water near and far. The WRB landscape became more diverse compositionally (increasing land cover types), more fragmented ecologically (habitat loss and isolation), and more complex geometrically (anthropogenic and natural landscape elements entangled). Damming, mining, and overgrazing were the major direct drivers for the observed environmental changes. Government-sponsored restoration programs have had positive ecological changes across China, but landscape destruction and fragmentation in the Wulagai River Basin have continued. This dire situation demands urgent government policy intervention and stakeholder-involved governance actions to promote the sustainability of this legendary landscape.

TI  - Identification of artisanal mining sites in the Amazon Rainforest using Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) and Data Mining techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Para is a Brazilian state leader in deforestation and deserves special attention due to the intense artisanal mining activity that has caused severe environmental damage to the Amazon Rainforest. Remote sensing is an important tool for identifying areas degraded by mining activities. However, the large territorial extension of the Amazon Rainforest and the equally large corresponding database make the mapping by photointerpretation a costly and slow process. This study attempts to overcome this obstacle by employing the Geographic Object-Based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) approach together with Data Mining techniques in the automatic identification of areas degraded by artisanal mining in the Crepori National Forest (CNF). A NDVI image and a multiband image derived from Sentinel-2 data were segmented and the former proved to be more appropriate to the development of this research. The use of the Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS) algorithm in attribute selection led to a 55% database dimensionality reduction. Additionally, the results obtained in the decision tree construction by the J48 algorithm showed that the spectral attributes were the most relevant in the classification of artisanal mining areas, especially the attributes related to the near infrared (NIR) band. The attributes of textural and spatial origin also contributed to the model, whereas the contextual attribute was not relevant to our classification problem. The results from classification demonstrated that the 'Vegetation' class is the largest in the Crepori National Forest, representing 99.50% of the total area, followed by `Areas Degraded by Artisanal Mining' and 'Other Anthropized Areas', representing 0.17% of the total area, and, lastly, the 'Hydrography' class totaling 0.16%. Total anthropization in the CNF decreased between 2014 and 2017, from 2,955 ha to 2,506 ha. It is worth noting that, when compared with the Brazilian Forest Service's (Servico Florestal Brasileiro) data, our results reveal that more than 50% (679.46 ha) of artisanal mining areas mapped in 2017 were installed after 2014, majorly in the CNF southern region. The performance of our classification model is good, reaching a global accuracy of 88.18% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.84. In class-by-class indexes, the method presented a minimum precision of 0.79 and a minimum recall of 0.75, both referring to the 'Other Anthropized Areas' class.

TI  - Accuracy Evaluation and Parameter Analysis of Land Surface Temperature Inversion Algorithm for Landsat-8 Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many researchers have developed a variety of land surface temperature (LST) inversion algorithms based on satellite data. The main LST inversion algorithms include Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), Single Channel (SC) algorithm, Mono Window (MW) algorithm, and Split Window (SW) algorithm. In this study, nine LST inversion algorithms were designed using Landsat-8 data and meteorological station data to test the inversion efficiency of different algorithms in different seasons and different locations. The results show that the error of various LST inversion algorithms will increase with the rise of LST. R-2 of the inversion results of each LST algorithm and the measured data are all greater than 0.73 degrees C in winter and about 0.5 degrees C in the other seasons. By analyzing the stability of various algorithms inside and outside the city, it is found that the stability of each LST inversion algorithm inside the city is better than that outside the city. For the same surface features, the inversion temperature inside the city is 3-5 degrees C higher than that outside the city. In addition, the sensitivity of various inversion algorithms to parameters was also analyzed. The influence of atmospheric transmittance on RTE, SC, and MW inversion algorithms is in logarithmic form. The effect of emissivity on each algorithm is linear. The influence of NDVI on the algorithms is mainly through the estimation of surface emissivity parameters to affect the inversion results. The effect of ascending radiation on SC (LST4 and LST5) is linear and on RTE (LST1 and LST2) is logarithmic. The effect of downslope radiation on SC and RTE is linear. The influence of atmospheric water vapor content on SW (LST7) is nonlinear.

AB  - Our study suggests that the global CO2 fertilization effect (CFE) on vegetation photosynthesis has declined during the past four decades. The Comments suggest that the temporal inconsistency in AVHRR data and the attribution method undermine the results' robustness. Here, we provide additional evidence that these arguments did not affect our finding and that the global decline in CFE is robust.

AB  - Wang et al.

We find that their claims are artifacts of incorrect processing of satellite data and problematic methods for deriving and comparing CFE between satellite data and model simulations.

TI  - Incremental Spending Associated with Low-Value Treatments in Older Women with Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background In most women >= 70 years old with hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer, axillary staging and adjuvant radiotherapy provide no survival advantage over surgery and hormone therapy alone. Despite recommendations for their omission, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and adjuvant radiotherapy rates remain high. While treatment side effects are well documented, less is known about the incremental spending associated with SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy. Methods Using a statewide multipayer claims registry, we examined spending associated with breast cancer treatment in a retrospective cohort of women >= 70 years old undergoing surgery. Results 9074 women >= 70 years old underwent breast cancer resection between 2012 and 2019, with 78% (n = 7122) receiving SLNB and/or adjuvant radiotherapy within 90 days of surgery. Women undergoing SLNB were more likely to receive radiation (51% vs. 28%; p < 0.001 and OR = 2.68). Average 90-day spending varied substantially based upon treatment received, ranging from US$10,367 (breast-conserving surgery alone) to US$27,370 (mastectomy with SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy). The relative increases in 90-day treatment spending in the breast-conserving surgery cohort was 65% for SLNB, 82% for adjuvant radiotherapy, and 120% for both treatments. Conclusions SLNB and adjuvant radiotherapy have significant spending implications in older women with breast cancer, even though they are unlikely to improve survival.

TI  - Simulating the Transport and Dispersal of Volcanic Ash Clouds With Initial Conditions Created by a 3D Plume Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Volcanic ash transport and dispersion (VATD) models simulate atmospheric transport of ash from a volcanic source represented by parameterized concentration of ash with height. Most VATD models represent the volcanic plume source as a simple line with a parameterized ash emission rate as a function of height, constrained only by a total mass eruption rate (MER) for a given total rise height. However, the actual vertical ash distribution in volcanic plumes varies from case to case, having complex dependencies on eruption source parameters, such as grain size, speed at the vent, vent size, buoyancy flux, and atmospheric conditions. We present here for the first time the use of a three-dimensional (3D) plume model based on conservation laws to represent the ash cloud source without any prior assumption or simplification regarding plume geometry. By eliminating assumed behavior associated with a parameterized plume geometry, the predictive skill of VATD simulations is improved. We use our recently developed volcanic plume model based on a 3D smoothed-particle hydrodynamic Lagrangian method and couple the output to a standard Lagrangian VATD model. We apply the coupled model to the Pinatubo eruption in 1991 to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach. Our investigation reveals that initial particle distribution in the vertical direction, including within the umbrella cloud, has more impact on the long-range transport of ash clouds than does the horizontal distribution. Comparison with satellite data indicates that the 3D model-based distribution of ash particles through the depth of the volcanic umbrella cloud, which is much lower than the observed maximum plume height, produces improved long-range VATD simulations. We thus show that initial conditions have a significant impact on VATD, and it is possible to obtain a better estimate of initial conditions for VATD simulations with deterministic, 3D forward modeling of the volcanic plume. Such modeling may therefore provide a path to better forecasts lessening the need for user intervention, or attempts to observe details of an eruption that are beyond the resolution of any potential satellite or ground-based technique, or a posteriori creating a history of ash emission height via inversion.</p>

TI  - Epiphytic hydroid community as sentinels of seagrass condition and human impacts
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Negative human actions on seagrasses affect habitat condition and its associated fauna. Epiphytic hydroid's assemblage response to seagrass condition, water quality, and human impacts was evaluated in two bays of the Sabana-Camaguey Ecosystem of Cuba, using the presence of contamination, causeways, and trawling fishing as impact level proxies to the seagrass meadows. Thirty-eight species composed the hydroid's assemblage including five new records. Symmetroscyphus intermedius was the most abundant species and sensitive to indicators of the seagrass condition. Dynamena disticha and Gastroblasta sp. were sensitive to water quality predictors. Obelia bidentata was exclusive to the most impacted sites. Species richness and abundance were low in impacted sites and were highly affected by fishing trawling and causeways construction. Salinity, depth, NO2, pH, SSV, macroalgae cover, shoot density, and wet weight of Thalassia testudinwn were the best predictors for hydroid's assemblages. Results suggest epiphytic hydroids on tropical seagrass meadows as sentinel organisms.

TI  - Multiple drivers of invasive lionfish culling efficiency in marine protected areas
T2  - CONSERVATION SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Designing effective local management for invasive species poses a major challenge for conservation, yet factors affecting intervention success and efficiency are rarely evaluated and incorporated into practice. We coordinated regional efforts by divers to cull invasive lionfish (Pterois spp.) on 33 U.S. Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean protected coral reefs from 2013 to 2019 and estimated removal efficiency and efficacy as a function of environmental and habitat conditions, invasion status, and personnel expertise. Highly experienced individuals culling during crepuscular periods (<2 hr from sunrise/sunset) are three times more efficient (in terms of minutes) than novice divers during midday, suggesting: (a) retention of experienced individuals is key for efficient programs, and (b) planning culls with personnel and time of day in mind increases the number of sites covered with the same effort. Lionfish behavior and habitat characteristics had little effect on removal efficiency and efficacy, but divers had higher capture success at reefs with higher lionfish densities. We suggest reefs with persistently <20 fish ha(-1) as low priority, given that impacts to native fauna are unlikely and culling effectiveness declines to <50% below this level. Incorporating efficiency factors in spatial management planning along with density estimates derived from remotely sensed data can ensure limited resources for control are extended across a greater range of invaded habitats.

TI  - Satellite monitoring of forest fire impact and regeneration using NDVI and LST
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fire is a major hazard around the world that seriously affects the terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric systems. Remote sensing methods are found to be efficient in mapping forest fires and analyzing the postfire effects through change detection. The land surface temperature (LST) also gets affected with the change of vegetation cover over the region due to the forest fires. This work pertains to analysis of postevent effects of forest fires and regrowth of vegetation using LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of 2014, in which many forest fires occurred, and of 2018, to assess the vegetation regrowth in the forest range in and around Tirupati region (Andhra Pradesh, India). The LST was estimated using mono-window algorithm and NDVI by band ratioing method for the Landsat 8 imagery. The Landsat 8 datasets for February and March of 2014 and March of 2018 were used in the study. Analysis using LST and NDVI showed that 112-sq km area was affected by forest fires and detected forest regrowth. A change of 35.8% and 14.69% in mean NDVI and mean temperatures, respectively, was observed for the study area. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Axillary management based on American college of surgeons oncology group Z0011 criteria makes it possible to omit intraoperative diagnosis of sentinel lymph nodes in early breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The ACOSOG Z0011 trial has resulted in the omission of axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in early breast cancer patients with one or two metastatic sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). There has been increasing interest in the necessity of intraoperative assessment of SLNs in patients treated based on the Z0011 criteria. We evaluated the utility of intraoperative assessment in these eligible patients. A total of 1396 patients were treated following the Z0011 criteria from April 2012 to December 2019. We examined the proportion and clinicopathological features of patients who underwent ALND due to three or more metastatic SLNs and the sensitivity of intraoperative assessment. Only 16 (1.1%) patients had three or more metastatic SLNs diagnosed by intraoperative assessment, and they immediately underwent ALND. Of the clinicopathological factors, high clinical tumor stage (p = 0.002) and high Ki-67 labeling index value (p = 0.056) were more likely to be associated with the presence of three or more metastatic SLNs. The major independent risk factor for three or more metastatic SLNs was high clinical tumor stage (OR 3.94 [95% CI 1.42-11.0]; p = 0.009). Intraoperative assessment had low sensitivity (70.5%) and a high false-negative rate (29.5%) in detecting SLN metastases. The main finding of our study was the small proportion of patients who required ALND due to three or more metastatic SLNs according to the Z0011 criteria. The Z0011 strategy enables intraoperative assessment of SLNs to be omitted in early breast cancer patients.

AB  - This study evaluates the vertical accuracy of nine freely available digital elevation models (DEMs) with a medium spatial resolution for a typical mid-latitude flat to hilly landscape in the Rur catchment in Germany. All datasets were evaluated with two reference datasets, a 1 m DEM and a highly precise set of elevation control points. The accuracy was evaluated with regard to different slopes, landforms and land use. The results reveal in flat areas an average error of 2-4 m which increases about two to three times in undulated terrain. Areas with dense tree cover show a mean error of 6-10 m. The highest accuracies were achieved by the SRTM DEM, followed by other DEMs that mainly implemented SRTM data. TanDEM-X and Copernicus DEM showed ambivalent results showing a higher ratio of existing errors in the elevation product for vegetation and water areas that prevent a higher overall accuracy of these DEMs.

TI  - Support vector machine and data assimilation framework for Groundwater Level Forecasting using GRACE satellite data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater (GW) is a vital resource for human consumption, agriculture, environmental sustainability, and socio-economic development in different parts of the world. Besides, GW plays a crucial role in minimizing the impacts during extreme drought events. However, there is a fast decline in groundwater resources due to increased sectoral water demand compounded by reduced rainfall and rising temperature. Therefore, it is essential to develop appropriate tools to study spatio-temporal dynamics and predict groundwater levels to improve water resource management, especially during drought events. In this study, we applied machine learning algorithms based on support vector machines (SVMs), combined with data assimilation (DA) technique to predict the change in groundwater levels (CGWLs) at 1 to 3-month time scales for 46 GW wells located at the northeast United States. The in-situ climate variables and the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission-informed groundwater anomalies data (GWA) are used to develop the models. The results suggest that SVMs (SVM-DA) models forced with limited climate variables (i.e., precipitation, solar radiation, air temperature, infrared surface temperature) can forecast the CGWLs up to 3-month lead times at most of the locations. The addition of GRACE data as a forcing variable can improve the performance of SVMs at most of the stations, where a strong relationship exists between the CGWLs and the GWA. The SVM-DA model comparatively performed better than SVMs at most of the stations.

TI  - Determination of Evaporation from a Tailings Storage Facility Using Field Measurements and Satellite Observations
T2  - MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Most mining operations produce waste material, or tailings, which is commonly stored within impoundments known as tailings storage facilities (TSFs). A common TSF design involves depositing slurry on tailings 'beaches' which are sloped towards a containing wall or central pond which collects excess water. A crucial aspect of safely operating TSFs is managing the residual moisture content of the deposited tailings, which requires an accurate understanding of the water balance of the TSF. However, evaporation from a TSF is particularly hard to quantify as the degree of surface wetness varies spatially and temporally, and moisture content depends on the time since tailings deposition and the prevailing climate. This study addresses these issues at an active TSF by combining field measurements, models, and satellite observations. Evaporation from open water was measured using a floating evaporation pan and evaporation from the tailings beaches was investigated using micro-lysimeter measurements. Evaporation rates for different moisture contents were expressed as a fraction of open water evaporation and a strong relationship was developed for use in satellite analysis. Spatial and temporal patterns of open water and moisture content were determined at 20 m resolution using moisture indices applied to Sentinel-2 satellite scenes. Continuous open water evaporation rates and spatial moisture content information were combined to estimate total TSF evaporation. Comparison of TSF evaporation rates to those derived using an existing site water balance model showed very good agreement. The methodology developed could be applied at other locations around the world.

TI  - Estimating crop parameters using Sentinel-1 and 2 datasets and geospatial field data
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Crop monitoring is essential for ensuring food security in a global context of population growth and climate change. Satellite images are commonly used to estimate crop parameters over large areas, and the freely available Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 (S-1) and optical Sentinel2 (S-2) images are relevant for that purpose combining high temporal resolution and high spatial resolution. For this data article, field surveys were conducted from January to July 2017 in France to sample wheat and rapeseed crop parameters during the entire crops cycle. Phenological stages were identified in 83 wheat fields and 32 rapeseed fields in Brittany and Picardy regions. Moreover, Leaf Area Index (LAI), wet biomass, dry biomass and water content were sampled in three wheat fields and three rapeseed fields in Brittany. We assigned to each field sample 10 spectral bands and 12 vegetation indices from S-2 images and two backscattering coefficients, one backscattering ratio and four polarimetric indicators from S-1 images. This dataset can be used for crop monitoring in other regions, as well as for modelling development. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The concentration of chlorophyll-a in the aquatic environment is a good indicator to understand its tropic status and also used to monitor the biogeochemical parameter. The aim of this study is to identify the spectral signature of Hooghly River, India using Satlantic hyperspectral ocean colour radiometer and developing the regional algorithm for retrieval for chlorophyll-a concentration. This approach is based on the development of an empirical band ratio algorithm. The calibrated results between the in-situ chlorophyll-a and in-situ remote sensing reflectance show a good correlation with R2 = 0.77. In-situ and satellite validation also gives better accuracy (R2 = 0.78&0.73) in the estimation of chlorophyll-a concentration. So the satellite-based approach provides a good correlation with in-situ data. This study was helped in monitoring and retrieval of chl-a concentration in the Hooghly River, Kolkata.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of chlorophyll in six Araucanian lakes of Central-South Chile from Landsat imagery
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is an optically active compound commonly used as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass and trophic state in an aquatic system. This work aimed to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of Chl-a values in six Araucanian lakes in Central-South Chile. Here we combined in-situ Chl-a measurements and thirteen Landsat 8 satellite images to build a set of the linear and non-linear models to estimate Chl-a values in the lakes. Through the Taylor diagram, r Pearson, standard deviation, and other statistical indicators (R2, RMSE, IA, and MBE) the Chl-a models were validated. A qualitative/quantitative analysis to identify the species of microalgae present in the lacustrine systems was used. Next, Chl-a estimation maps were created to understand the spatial and seasonal behavior of this variable in each aquatic ecosystem. We observed that during the Summer months the Chl-a values are higher than in the Spring months for all lakes, except in Pirehueico lake. Moreover, the Chl-a models created predict with high accuracy, the results of statistical indicators are R2 0.94, IA > 0.80, RMSE <0.214 mu g/L, and MBE <-0.123 mu g/L. In the lake systems were found two invasive species, C. hirundinella, and Didymosphenia geminata, species recognized as bloom-forming in other aquatic systems. Finally, the Chl-a maps provided information on the monitoring of areas sensitive to Chl-a changes. This study is very important to conserve the water quality and early alert to forming phenomena like algal blooms which contributes to providing useful data for managers and policy-makers in Chilean lakes.

TI  - A neo-aristotelian perspective on the need for artificial moral agents (AMAs)
T2  - AI & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We examine Van Wynsberghe and Robbins (JAMA 25:719-735, 2019) critique of the need for Artificial Moral Agents (AMAs) and its rebuttal by Formosa and Ryan (JAMA 10.1007/s00146-020-01089-6, 2020) set against a neo-Aristotelian ethical background. Neither Van Wynsberghe and Robbins (JAMA 25:719-735, 2019) essay nor Formosa and Ryan's (JAMA 10.1007/s00146-020-01089-6, 2020) is explicitly framed within the teachings of a specific ethical school. The former appeals to the lack of "both empirical and intuitive support" (Van Wynsberghe and Robbins 2019, p. 721) for AMAs, and the latter opts for "argumentative breadth over depth", meaning to provide "the essential groundwork for making an all things considered judgment regarding the moral case for building AMAs" (Formosa and Ryan 2019, pp. 1-2). Although this strategy may benefit their acceptability, it may also detract from their ethical rootedness, coherence, and persuasiveness, characteristics often associated with consolidated ethical traditions. Neo-Aristotelian ethics, backed by a distinctive philosophical anthropology and worldview, is summoned to fill this gap as a standard to test these two opposing claims. It provides a substantive account of moral agency through the theory of voluntary action; it explains how voluntary action is tied to intelligent and autonomous human life; and it distinguishes machine operations from voluntary actions through the categories of poiesis and praxis respectively. This standpoint reveals that while Van Wynsberghe and Robbins may be right in rejecting the need for AMAs, there are deeper, more fundamental reasons. In addition, despite disagreeing with Formosa and Ryan's defense of AMAs, their call for a more nuanced and context-dependent approach, similar to neo-Aristotelian practical wisdom, becomes expedient.

TI  - Spotlight influenza: Extending influenza surveillance to detect non-influenza respiratory viruses of public health relevance: analysis of surveillance data, Belgium, 2015 to 2019
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Seasonal influenza-like illness (ILI) affects millions of people yearly. Severe acute respira-tory infections (SARI), mainly influenza, are a lead-ing cause of hospitalisation and mortality. Increasing evidence indicates that non-influenza respiratory viruses (NIRV) also contribute to the burden of SARI. In Belgium, SARI surveillance by a network of sentinel hospitals has been ongoing since 2011. Aim: We report the results of using in-house multiplex qPCR for the detection of a flexible panel of viruses in respiratory ILI and SARI samples and the estimated incidence rates of SARI associated with each virus. Methods: We defined ILI as an illness with onset of fever and cough or dysp-noea. SARI was defined as an illness requiring hospi-talisation with onset of fever and cough or dyspnoea within the previous 10 days. Samples were collected in four winter seasons and tested by multiplex qPCR for influenza virus and NIRV. Using catchment population estimates, we calculated incidence rates of SARI asso-ciated with each virus. Results: One third of the SARI cases were positive for NIRV, reaching 49.4% among children younger than 15 years. In children younger than 5 years, incidence rates of NIRV-associated SARI were twice that of influenza (103.5 vs 57.6/100,000 person-months); co-infections with several NIRV, respiratory syncytial viruses, human metapneumovi-ruses and picornaviruses contributed most (33.1, 13.6, 15.8 and 18.2/100,000 person-months, respectively). Conclusion: Early testing for NIRV could be beneficial to clinical management of SARI patients, especially in children younger than 5 years, for whom the burden of NIRV-associated disease exceeds that of influenza.

TI  - Climate justice in more-than-human worlds
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLITICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Theories of climate justice retain a persistent tension between transcorporeal entanglement and coherent individuality. The ontology of bodily separation required for accountability for polluters and reparation for the vulnerable enacts a worldview potentially inconsistent with the more-than-human relationality of climate change. Yet theories of material agency and posthuman becoming are criticised for offering limited guidance for political practice. Engaging with the bushfire smoke that blanketed eastern Australia throughout 2019/2020, I seek to revitalise climate justice by engaging with theories of more-than-human transcorporeality. To do so, I articulate an aspirational climate justice, where aspiration is understood as a yearning arising from inhibited breath. Aspirational climate justice considers the relationally composed human and non-human bodies that breathe, as well as the relationship - respiration - itself, as subjects, and offers a politics through which we might keep breathing together towards a more liveable world.

TI  - Evaluating the Feasibility and Efficacy of a Dual-Modality Nanoparticle Contrast Agent (Nanotrast-CF800) for Image-Guided Sentinel Lymph Node Mapping in the Oral Cavity of Healthy Dogs
T2  - FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A combination of pre and intraoperative sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping techniques have been suggested to optimize SLN detection. A novel liposomal nanoparticle, Nanotrast-CF800 (CF800), utilizes computed tomography lymphography (CTL) and near infrared fluorescence imaging (NIRF) for image-guided surgery and SLN mapping. This novel tracer agent has not been evaluated in companion animals. The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of CF800 for SLN mapping in the oral cavity of healthy dogs and to report any local adverse effects. Six healthy adult purpose-bred research dogs randomly received either 1 mL (group 1) or 2 mL (group 2) of CF800 injected into the submucosa at the level of the right canine maxillary tooth. CTL and percutaneous NIRF were performed at 1, 3, and 10 min, then 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 days post-injection (p.i). Overall, both CTL and NIRF identified SLNs in all dogs. The overall peak mean contrast enhancement of the SLNs was 73.98 HU (range 63.45-86.27 HU) at 2 days p.i. Peak fluorescence of the SLN occurred at 1 day p.i. The agent was retained within the SLN for at least 7 days for CTL and 4 days for percutaneous NIRF. No adverse effects were observed. Local administration of CF800 was simple and feasible for the detection of SLNs using CTL+NIRF in the head and neck of healthy dogs and was not associated with significant local adverse events.

TI  - Research on cropping intensity mapping of the Huai River Basin (China) based on multi-source remote sensing data fusion
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - As a key input variable to many global climates, land surfaces and crop models, cropping intensity (CI) accurately assesses and predicts crops' output, in view of the global decline in food production in recent years due to declining natural resources, urban expansion and declining quality of arable land. Hence, research on CI mapping can have a contribution to solve this problem. Unfortunately, existing remote sensing data for CI mapping research, including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat images, are not adequate for obtaining CI information at higher spatial and temporal resolution. In this regard, we develop an algorithm to extract CI based on per-pixel physiognomy. To be specific, the algorithm is based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform and constructs a high temporal (10 days) spatial (30 m) resolution dataset with the fusion of Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 A/B image data and extracts CI information using a time series of peak discovery method, threshold method and phenological period feature extraction to obtain the 2018 Chinese Huai River Basin (HRB) CI map. Our results suggest that the overall accuracy (OA) of CI extraction in the HRB is 92.72%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.864. The single-season crop, double-season crop and three-season crop account for 41.6%, 57.7% and 0.7% of the total farmland area, respectively. Compared to existing CI identification and extraction methods, this approach achieves higher accuracy in the identification and extraction of CI information over a larger area.

TI  - A machine learning model to estimate ambient PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations in industrialized highveld region of South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been linked to a substantial disease burden globally, yet little has been done to estimate the population health risks of PM2.5 in South Africa due to the lack of high-resolution PM2.5 exposure estimates. We developed a random forest model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations at 1 km(2) resolution in and around industrialized Gauteng Province, South Africa, by combining satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorology, land use, and socioeconomic data. We then compared PM2.5 concentrations in the study domain before and after the implementation of the new national air quality standards. We aimed to test whether machine learning models are suitable for regions with sparse ground observations such as South Africa and which predictors played important roles in PM2.5 modeling. The cross-validation R-2 and Root Mean Square Error of our model was 0.80 and 9.40 mu g/m(3), respectively. Satellite AOD, seasonal indicator, total precipitation, and population were among the most important predictors. Model-estimated PM2.5 levels successfully captured the temporal pattern recorded by ground observations. Spatially, the highest annual PM2.5 concentration appeared in central and northern Gauteng, including northern Johannesburg and the city of Tshwane. Since the 2016 changes in national PM2.5 standards, PM2.5 concentrations have decreased in most of our study region, although levels in Johannesburg and its surrounding areas have remained relatively constant. This is anadvanced PM2.5 model for South Africa with high prediction accuracy at the daily level and at a relatively high spatial resolution. Our study provided a reference for predictor selection, and our results can be used for a variety of purposes, including epidemiological research, burden of disease assessments, and policy evaluation.

TI  - Vegetation dynamics and responses to climate change and anthropogenic activities in the Three-River Headwaters Region, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) is an area of crucial significance for the ecological security of China. Owing to dramatic climate change and human activities driven by a series of ecological restoration projects, the ecological environment and vegetation have changed drastically in recent years. However, our knowledge of the current state and driving force of the change in the entire region is limited. This study mapped the spatiotemporal changes in vegetation coverage and quantitatively identified the contributions of climate change and anthropogenic factors to such variations from 2000 to 2018 using 133 MODIS NDVI images at 250 m resolution. The results show that over the past 19 years, the average NDVI demonstrated a fluctuating but upward trend, with a rate of increase of 0.0013 yr(-1). Areas with increased vegetation coverage accounted for 54.93% of the entire area, and among them, 18.52% showed a significant greening trend. Based on the Hurst exponent, areas with sustained increasing trends were primarily concentrated in the northeastern, western, and southwestern parts of the Yellow River region, and the western Yangtze River region. The average contributions of the precipitation, temperature, and sunshine duration to NDVI were 0.069, 0.098, and 0.059%.yr(-1), respectively. Sunshine duration had the greatest influence on the inter-annual change of NDVI during the entire study period, while the temperature was the main climatic factor from 2000 to 2010. The average contributions of climate change and anthropogenic factors to inter-annual variations of NDVI were 0.226 and -0.096%.yr(-1), respectively. The general climate conditions are beneficial to the vegetation recovery, whereas human activities negatively impact the vegetation growth. However, the ecological afforestation projects positively influenced the east Yellow River, Lancang River, and west Yangtze River regions.

TI  - Cyanobacterial pigment concentrations in inland waters: Novel semi-analytical algorithms for multi- and hyperspectral remote sensing data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacteria are notorious for producing harmful algal blooms that present an ever-increasing serious threat to aquatic ecosystems worldwide, impacting the quality of drinking water and disrupting the recreational use of many water bodies. Remote sensing techniques for the detection and quantification of cyanobacterial blooms are required to monitor their initiation and spatiotemporal variability. In this study, we developed a novel semi-analytical approach to estimate the concentration of cyanobacteria-specific pigment phycocyanin (PC) and common phytoplankton pigment chlorophyll a (Chl a) from hyperspectral remote sensing data. The PC algorithm was derived from absorbance-concentration relationship, and the Chl a algorithm was devised based on a conceptual three-band structure model. The developed algorithms were applied to satellite imageries obtained by the Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO (TM)) sensor and tested in Lake Kinneret (Israel) during strong cyanobacterium Microcystis sp. bloom and out-of-bloom times. The sensitivity of the algorithms to errors was evaluated. The Chl a and PC concentrations were estimated with a mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) of 16% and 28%, respectively. Sensitivity analysis shows that the influences of backscattering and other water constituents do not affect the estimation accuracy of PC (similar to 2% MAPD). The reliable PC/Chl a ratios can be obtained at PC concentrations above 10 mg m(-3). The computed PC/Chl a ratio depicts the contribution of cyanobacteria to the total phytoplankton biomass and permits investigating the role of ambient factors in the formation of a complex planktonic community. The novel algorithms have extensive practical applicability and should be suitable for the quantification of PC and Chl a in aquatic ecosystems using hyperspectral remote sensing data as well as data from future multispectral remote sensing satellites, if the respective bands are featured in the sensor.

TI  - Finding a suitable sensing time period for crop identification using heuristic techniques with multi-temporal satellite images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite crop identification processes are increasingly being used on a large scale, both to verify the crop and to improve production. As it is necessary to study phenological data over a period of time across a large territory, a lot of storage space is needed to save the satellite images and a lot of calculation time to analyse all this information. Sensing periods are usually established based on subjective expert criteria or previous experience. However, this decision may cause several differences when discriminating crop patterns, besides not guaranteeing good precision. These processes would greatly improve if the appropriate time periods could be found systematically using the minimum number of satellite images in the shortest possible time. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to determine a suitable sensing period for crop identification using Sentinel-2 images, applying hill climbing algorithms to the training sets of neural network models. We have used the method successfully in the 2020 Common Agricultural Policy campaign in the Extremadura region, Spain. The article also describes the use of the method in a case on tobacco detection in this region.

TI  - Contemporary Darwinism as a worldview
T2  - STUDIES IN HISTORY AND PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The most public-facing forms of contemporary Darwinism happily promote its worldview ambitions. Popular works, by the likes of Richard Dawkins, deflect associations with eugenics and social Darwinism, but also extend the reach of Darwinism beyond biology into social policy, politics, and ethics. Critics of the enterprise fall into two categories. Advocates of Intelligent Design and secular philosophers (like Mary Midgley and Thomas Nagel) recognise it as a worldview and argue against its implications. Scholars in the rhetoric of science or science communication, however, typically take the view that Darwinism isn't a worldview, but a scientific theory, which has been improperly embellished by some; they uphold the distinction between is and ought and argue that science is restricted to the former. This prompts an is-ought problem on another level. I catalogue the ways in which Darwinism plainly is a worldview and why commentators' beliefs that it ought not to be distorts their analysis. Hence, it is their own worldview that precludes them from accepting Darwinism's worldview implications.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Desmoid tumor is an uncommon tumor with variable spectrum ranged from being a locally lesion to an aggressive and destructive one. The current case aims to report a rare condition of desmoid type fibromatosis of the breast.Presentation of case: A 59-year-old female presented with a right breast mass for 9-months. Mammography showed a small speculated iso-hyper dense mass, just anterior to the pectoralis muscle measuring about 15 mm (M5) in longest axis. Ultrasound examination revealed an irregular mass with internal vascularity and posterior shadowing in the right breast with a single borderline lymph node (25 * 14 mm of 4 mm cortex). Wide local excision with sentinel axillary lymph nodes biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of desmoid type fibromatosis of the breast.Discussion: The etiology of this tumor is unknown, however, physical, hormonal and genetic factors have a significant role in the development of desmoid tumor.Conclusion: Desmid type fibromatosis of the breast is an uncommon, benign, locally aggressive fibroblastic tumor with lack of metastatic potential, it may present with features of malignancy.

TI  - Evaluating the state-of-the-art in remote volcanic eruption characterization Part II: Ulawun volcano, Papua New Guinea
T2  - JOURNAL OF VOLCANOLOGY AND GEOTHERMAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrospective eruption characterization is valuable for advancing our understanding of volcanic systems and evaluating our observational capabilities, especially with remote technologies (defined here as a space-borne system or non-local, ground-based instrumentation which include regional and remote infrasound sensors). In June 2019, the open-system Ulawun volcano, Papua New Guinea, produced a VEI 4 eruption. We combined data from satellites (including Sentinel-2, TROPOMI, MODIS, Himawari-8), the International Monitoring System infrasound network, and GLD360 globally detected lightning with information from the local authorities and social media to characterize the pre-, syn- and post-eruptive behaviour. The Rabaul Volcano Observatory recorded similar to 24 h of seismicity and detected SO2 emissions similar to 16 h before the visually-documented start of the Plinian phase on 26 June at 04:20 UTC. Infrasound and SO2 detections suggest the eruption started during the night on 24 June 2019 at 10:39 UTC similar to 38 h before ash detections with a gas-dominated jetting phase. Local reports and infrasound detections show that the second phase of the eruption started on 25 June 19:28 UTC with similar to 6 h of jetting. The first detected lightning occurred on 26 June 00:14 UTC, and ash emissions were first detected by Himawari-8 at 01:00 UTC. Post-eruptive satellite imagery indicates new flow deposits to the south and north of the edifice and ash fall to the west and southwest. In particular, regional infrasound data provided novel insight into eruption onset and syn-eruptive changes in intensity. We conclude that, while remote observations are sufficient for detection and tracking of syn-eruptive changes, key challenges in data latency, acquisition, and synthesis must be addressed to improve future near-real-time characterization of eruptions at minimally-monitored or unmonitored volcanoes.

TI  - Vegetation responses to climate extremes recorded by remotely sensed atmospheric formaldehyde
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate monitoring of vegetation stress is required for better modelling and forecasting of primary production, in a world where heatwaves and droughts are expected to become increasingly prevalent. Variability in formaldehyde (HCHO) concentrations in the troposphere is dominated by local emissions of short-lived biogenic (BVOC) and pyrogenic volatile organic compounds. BVOCs are emitted by plants in a rapid protective response to abiotic stress, mediated by the energetic status of leaves (the excess of reducing power when photosynthetic light and dark reactions are decoupled, as occurs when stomata close in response to water stress). Emissions also increase exponentially with leaf temperature. New analytical methods for the detection of spatiotemporally contiguous extremes in remote-sensing data are applied here to satellite-derived atmospheric HCHO columns. BVOC emissions are shown to play a central role in the formation of the largest positive HCHO anomalies. Although vegetation stress can be captured by various remotely sensed quantities, spaceborne HCHO emerges as the most consistent recorder of vegetation responses to the largest climate extremes, especially in forested regions.

TI  - Spatial framework vulnerability in riparian area in Sergipe: The case of the lower course of the Sao Francisco River
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrographic basins are dependent on riparian forests, being environments of natural water sources. Thus, environmental monitoring and diagnosis are necessary to promote their stability and ecological functions. This work brings the current situation of the riparian forest region in Sergipe, the Sao Francisco River. The study used images acquired from Sentinel 2A to calculate the maximum monthly values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for 2018 on Google Earth Engine. The land use and occupation map were carried out using the Maximum Likelihood and applied metrics of the landscapes. The area has 596 ha. The remaining forest area presents less than 40% (219 ha), reflecting about 60% of a degraded riparian forest. The relevant forest fragments were distant and had rare or no connectivity. This led to infer the risks posed to genetic diversity, both locally and regionally, regarding the most relevant plant species in the region. The methodology supported the knowledge about the management of this environment and how it can be applied to other regions with similar physiographic characteristics.

TI  - Disturbance frequency, intensity and forest structure modulate cyclone-induced changes in mangrove forest canopy cover
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Tropical cyclones are large-scale disturbances that can shape the structure and dynamics of mangrove forests. Although tropical cyclone activity overlaps extensively with the latitudinal distribution of mangrove forests, the relationships between cyclone intensity and frequency and mangrove forest canopy damage and recovery are not understood at the global scale. Using remote sensing data, we examined how mangrove forest structure, climate and cyclone characteristics influence canopy cover loss and recovery dynamics. Location Global tropics. Time period 2000-2020. Major taxa studied Mangrove trees. Methods Using two satellite-derived vegetation indices (the enhanced vegetation index and the normalized difference infrared index) from 86 cyclones affecting 56 mangrove sites across the globe, we quantified mangrove canopy loss in relationship to cyclones. Using linear regression and variance decomposition, we identified and ranked significant predictors of cyclone-induced canopy loss and recovery. Results Three-quarters of the studied cyclone disturbances resulted in canopy damage. Stands exposed to high wind speeds and those close to the cyclone paths were more severely damaged, whereas lower damage magnitudes were found in sites with greater past cyclone frequency. Canopy damage was greater in tall mangrove stands but decreased with higher aboveground biomass. The distance from the cyclone path and maximum wind speed were the most important factors, representing > 50% of the explained variation in cyclone damage. There was considerable variation in canopy damage among cyclones, but rates of recovery were similar across all mangrove sites, with the main predictor of recovery time being the degree of canopy loss. Main conclusions Our results suggest that the resistance of mangrove canopy cover to cyclone disturbance is variably tuned to the cyclone regime and vegetation characteristics, but resilience is inherent to the magnitude of canopy damage because the rate of forest canopy recovery appears to be consistent globally.

TI  - Deep Multimodal Fusion Network for Semantic Segmentation Using Remote Sensing Image and LiDAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Extracting semantic information from very-high-resolution (VHR) aerial images is a prominent topic in the Earth observation research. An increasing number of different sensor platforms are appearing in remote sensing, each of which can provide corresponding multimodal supplemental or enhanced information, such as optical images, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, infrared images, or inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. However, these current deep networks for LiDAR and VHR images have not fully utilized the complete potential of multimodal data. The stacked multimodal fusion network (MFNet) ignores the structural differences between the modalities and the manual statistical characteristics within the modalities. For multimodal remote sensing data and its corresponding carefully designed handcrafted features, we designed a novel deep MFNet that can use multimodal VHR aerial images and LiDAR data and the corresponding intramodal features, such as LiDAR-derived features [slope and normalized digital surface model (NDSM)] and imagery-derived features [infrared-red-green (IRRG), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and difference of Gaussian (DoG)]. Technically, we introduce the attention mechanism and multimodal learning to adaptively fuse intermodal and intramodal features. Specifically, we designed a multimodal fusion mechanism, pyramid dilation blocks, and a multilevel feature fusion module. Through these modules, our network realized the adaptive fusion of multimodal features, improved the receptive field, and enhanced the global-to-local contextual fusion effect. Moreover, we used a multiscale supervision training scheme to optimize the network. Extensive experimental results and ablation studies on the ISPRS semantic dataset and IEEE GRSS DFC Zeebrugge dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed MFNet.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Japanese encephalitis (JE) is the leading cause of childhood acute encephalitis syndrome (AES) in India. We enhanced the AES surveillance in sentinel hospitals to determine trends and virus etiologies in central India. Methods: The neurological hospitalizations among children <= 15 years were tracked by using the AES case definition implemented by the national program. Acute and convalescent sera along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens were collected and tested at the strengthened site hospital laboratories for anti-JE, anti-Dengue and anti-Chikungunya virus by IgM ELISA; along with Chandipura virus RT-PCR. Herpes simplex and enterovirus testing was undertaken at the reference laboratory. Results: Among 1619 pediatric neurological hospitalizations reported during 2015-16, AES case definition was fulfilled in 332 (20.5%) cases. After excluding 52 non-AES cases, 280 AES cases resident from study districts were considered eligible for study. The treating physicians diagnosed non-viral causes in 90 cases, therefore 190 (67.9%) of 280 AES cases were suspected with viral etiologies. We enrolled 140 (73.7%) of 190 eligible AES cases. Viral etiologies were confirmed in 31 (22.1%) of 140 enrolled AES cases. JE (n = 22) was the leading cause. Additional non-JE viral agents included Chikungunya (5), Dengue (2) and Chandipura (2). However, only 21 (9.4%) of 222 additional AES cases referred from peripheral hospitals were confirmed as JE. Conclusions: Japanese encephalitis virus continues to be the leading cause of childhood acute encephalitis syndrome in central India despite vaccination program. Surveillance needs to be intensified for assessing the true disease burden of Japanese encephalitis following vaccination program implementation.

TI  - Summer Maize Mapping by Compositing Time Series Sentinel-1A Imagery Based on Crop Growth Cycles
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate and timely mapping of summer maize is vital for agricultural management and food security. Time-series remotely sensed imagery provides a promising data resource for crop mapping by characterizing growth cycles over time. Therefore, this study explores summer maize mapping with composited time-series Sentinel-1A imagery of a typical crop field in China. First, time-series backscattering coefficients of major land-cover types (i.e. summer maize, peanut, forest, settlements, and water) are extracted from multi-temporal Sentinel-1A imagery. Second, according to the growth cycles of summer maize and peanut, the multi-temporal Sentinel-1A images are composited to enhance the characteristics of the summer maize growth cycle, while also eliminating redundant information and differences in phenology. Third, the decision-tree method is used to perform pixel-level classification; samples with an area of 1 km(2) are collected as validation datasets. The results show that Sentinel-1A VH-polarized images are more sensitive to the summer maize growth cycle than VV-polarized images. The summer maize cropping areas are estimated with an overall accuracy of 96.55% and a kappa coefficient of 0.93. The results suggest that multi-temporal Sentinel-1A imagery is capable of characterizing the growth cycle of summer maize, and provides a promising solution for accurate summer maize mapping, irrespective of weather conditions.

TI  - Clinical Value of Three Combined Ultrasonography Modalities in Predicting the Risk of Metastasis to Axillary Lymph Nodes in Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveThe present study aimed to assess the clinical value of conventional ultrasound (C-US), ultrasound elastography (UE), percutaneous contrast-enhanced ultrasound (P-CUES), and the combination of these three ultrasonography modalities for evaluating the risk of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis in breast invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).MethodsThis retrospective analysis included 120 patients with pathologically confirmed IDC who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). Based on the gold standard of postoperative pathology, ALN pathology results were evaluated and compared with findings obtained using C-US, UE, P-CUES, and the three modalities combined.Results(1) There was a statistically significant difference between the histological grade of the tumor and the pathological condition of ALNs. (2) The difference between C-US parameters and UE score were statistically significant. The accuracy of P-CEUS localization of SLNs was 100% (96/96) when compared with localization guided by methylene blue. The difference in the distribution of the four SLN enhancement patterns was statistically significant. (3) The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of C-US and UE were 75%, 71%, 58%, and 89%, and 71%, 72%, 50%, and 86%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of P-CUES were 91%, 82%, 78%, 92%, respectively. When all three modalities were combined, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 94%, 89%, 86%, and 95%, respectively. In the detection of ALN metastasis, there was a good correlation between histopathological results and evaluations based on the three combined ultrasonography modalities (kappa: 0.82, p<0.001).ConclusionsWhen compared to C-US, UE, or P-CEUS alone, the combination of the three ultrasonography modalities was found to be superior in distinguishing metastatic and non-metastatic ALNs. This combined strategy may aid physicians in determining the most appropriate approach to ALN surgery as well as the prognosis of breast IDC.

TI  - Trends in Snow Cover Duration Across River Basins in High Mountain Asia From Daily Gap-Filled MODIS Fractional Snow Covered Area
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - High Mountain Asia (HMA) has the largest expanse of snow outside of the polar regions and it plays a critical role in climate and hydrology. In situ monitoring is rare due to terrain complexity and inaccessibility, making remote sensing the most practical way to understand snow patterns in HMA despite relatively short periods of record. Here, trends in snow cover duration were assessed using MODIS between 2002 and 2017 across the headwaters of the region's primary river basins (Amu Darya, Brahmaputra, Ganges, Indus, and Syr Darya). Data limitations, associated with traditional binary mapping and data gaps due to clouds, were addressed with a daily, spatially and temporally complete, snow cover product that maps the fraction of snow in each pixel using spectral mixture analysis. Trends in fractional snow cover duration (fSCD) were calculated at the annual and monthly scale, and across 1,000 m elevation bands, and compared to trends in binary snow cover duration (SCD). Snow cover is present, on average, for 102 days across all basin headwaters, with the longest duration in western basins and shortest in eastern basins. Broadly, snow cover is in decline, which is most pronounced in elevation bands where snow is most likely to be present and most needed to sustain glaciers. Some of the strongest negative trends in fSCD were in the Syr Darya, which has 13 fewer days between 4,000-5,000 m, and Brahmaputra, which has 31 fewer days between 5,000-6,000 m. The only increasing tendency was found in the Indus between 2,000 and 5,000 m. There were differences between fSCD and SCD trends, due to SCD overestimating snow cover area relative to fSCD.

TI  - Effects of climate and land use changes on stream flow of Chitral river basin of northern highland Hindu-Kush region of Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDRO-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Adverse impacts of climate change on the ecosystem have been a significant concern in the last decades. However, the studies related to the impacts of climate change on water resources, especially in northern Pakistan are of great importance as this region is the main supplier of freshwater to the downstream areas. So, the present study was carried out in Chitral River Basin (CRB) to investigate the long term climatic and topographic changes. Spatiotemporal datasets from MODIS Land Cover Type product (MCD12Q1) from 2001 to 2018, ground-based observational climatic and hydrological data were used. Moreover, the Mann-Kendall trend test, linear regression analysis, correlation, and Sen's slope values for the mean annual and seasonal flows were assessed. The acquired results show that land use changes are the key non-natural factors in transforming the ecological and hydrological processes of CRB. The mixed and evergreen forest, shrubland, savannas, and barren land respectively decreased from 0.07 to 0.03%, 0.07 to 0.05%, 3.64 to 3.25%, and 70.10 to 67.17%, from 2001 to 2018. In addition, a considerable increment in snow cover from 8.79% to 10.71%, and slight increment in grasslands, wetlands, and croplands were also found between the period of observation. In addition, total annual precipitation and mean annual stream flow showed slight upward trends. Annual increment in total rainfall and snow covered area could be the possible reasons for the observed increased river flow.

TI  - Development of a Rapid Mangrove Zonation Mapping Workflow Using Sentinel 2-Derived Indices and Biophysical Dataset
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate to high resolution satellite imageries are commonly used in mapping mangrove cover from local to global scales. In addition to extent information, studies such as mangrove composition, ecology, and distribution analysis require further information on mangrove zonation. Mangrove zonation refers to unique sections within a mangrove forest being dominated by a similar family, genus, or species. This can be observed both in natural and planted mangrove forests. In this study, a mapping workflow was developed to detect zonation in test mangrove forest sites in Katunggan-It Ibajay (KII) Ecopark (Aklan), Bintuan (Coron), Bogtong, and Sagrada (Busuanga) in the Philippines and Fukido Mangrove Park (Ishigaki, Japan) using Sentinel-2 imagery. The methodology was then applied to generate a nationwide mangrove zonation map of the Philippines for year 2020. Combination of biophysical products, water, and vegetation indices were used as classification inputs including leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), fraction of photosynthetically-active radiation (FAPAR), Canopy chlorophyll content (Cab), canopy water content (Cw), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (MCARI), and red-edge inflection point (REIP). Mangrove extents were first mapped using either the Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC) algorithm or the Mangrove Vegetation Index (MVI)-based methodology. The biophysical and vegetation indices within these areas were stacked and transformed through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Regions of Interest (ROIs) were selected on the PCA bands as training input to the MLC. Results show that mangrove zonation maps can highlight the major mangrove zones in the study sites, commonly limited up to genera level only except for genera with only one known species thriving in the area. Four zones were detected in KII Ecopark: Avicennia zone, Nypa zone, Avicennia mixed with Nypa zone, and mixed mangroves zones. For Coron and Busuanga, the mapped mangrove zones are mixed mangroves, Rhizophora zone and sparse/damaged zones. Three zones were detected in Fukido site: Rhizophora stylosa-dominant zone, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza-dominant zone, and mixed mangrove zones. The zonation maps were validated using field plot data and orthophotos generated from Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) surveys, with accuracies ranging from 75 to 100%.

TI  - Monitoring of small-scale deformation at sea-filled Ordu-Giresun Airport, Turkey from multi-temporal SAR data
T2  - ENGINEERING FAILURE ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Today, many countries cannot meet the land demands brought about by rapid urbanization. Especially for coastal cities, this problem is even greater when the topography does not allow it, and filling projects are produced in order to eliminate the problem. Artificial areas built on the sea with filling have a sensitive and geologically active structure. This situation may cause negative effects, especially where the density of the population is high. Management of operational safety is very important in terms of public safety in buildings built on this type of filling. The airport surface should be monitored at regional scales in order to establish this security continuously. In this study, the surface deformation that occurred at Ordu-Giresun Airport, which was founded on the sea-filled area in 2011 and has been operating since 2015, was determined. The airport is the first one that was built on sea-filled land in Turkey and Europe. For the analysis, Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images spans between 2015 and 2020 are used with Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) technique. The results showed that maximum deformation determined at the breakwater and nearby taxiway. The half of the runway also indicated high rates of deformation, whereas the apron and the terminal indicated almost stable behavior.

TI  - Mapping and forecasting of rice cropping systems in central China using multiple data sources and phenology-based time-series similarity measurement
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise mapping and forecasting of rice cropping systems are essential for guaranteeing regional and even global food security. The central areas of China are the dominant Chinese rice-producing areas. However, due to limited land and a scarcity of skilled rural labourers in China, it has been difficult to meet the growing demand for rice production in recent years. Furthermore, the complex topography and climate in central China make it difficult to map paddy rice accurately. This paper maps the spatial pattern of rice in central China by using multiple data sources and a phenology-based time-series similarity approach, explores the driving forces for rice patterns through grey relational analysis (GRA), and presents a simulated future rice cropping system map by adding socio-economic factors to a cellular automata-Markov (CA-Markov) model. This study concluded that for 2015, the overall classification accuracy of rice was 88.12%, with a Kappa coefficient of 0.90. The planting acreage accuracies for single-and double-season rice in 2015 were 89.51% and 77.00%, respectively, and the corresponding R2 value for both were 0.80. From 2005 to 2015, the planting acreage of single-season rice significantly increased, while the planting acreage of double-season rice generally decreased. The planting acreage of total rice exhibited an overall increasing trend during 10 years. The cumulative temperature, slope and distance to water bodies were key influencing factors for the spatial distribution of rice. Compared with that for 2015, the simulated total planting area of rice for 2030 was slightly higher, and the spatial pattern of double-season rice exhibited an obvious southward trend. These findings show that the proposed rice mapping and forecasting method is effective. This method allows us to predict future rice patterns precisely under the influence of human activities in complex cropping conditions and various rice cropping systems.

TI  - Vulnerability mapping of the Paravanar sub-basin aquifer (Tamil Nadu, India) in SINTACS model for efficient land use planning
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Consideration of groundwater vulnerability as a planning parameter is imperative in the current context of depleting groundwater resources for the efficient land use planning. This study aims for groundwater vulnerability assessment by modifying SINTACS model and involve dynamics of land use change in a case study of Paravanar sub-basin in the Tamil Nadu state of south India. Thematic maps of land use generated from remote sensing data and associated field investigations were the input for the SINTACS model. These maps integrated in GIS helped to derive intrinsic vulnerability into very low, low, medium and high vulnerability categories. The strongest correlation (r = 0.74) between intrinsic vulnerability index and the water quality index, estimated from field observations, suggested better efficiency of this model compared to the conventional SINTACS index. Application of the modified SINTACS led to the conclusion that 12.2%, 28.7%, 45.9%, and 13.1% of the study area categorized very low vulnerability, low vulnerability, moderate vulnerability and high vulnerability, respectively and should be considered for efficient land use planning.

TI  - Early detection of spruce vitality loss with hyperspectral data: Results of an experimental study in Bavaria, Germany
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vitality loss of trees caused by extreme weather conditions, drought stress or insect infestations, are expected to increase with ongoing climate change. The detection of vitality loss at an early stage is thus of vital importance for forestry and forest management to minimize ecological and economical damage. Remote sensing instruments are able to detect changes over large areas down to the level of individual trees. The scope of our study is to investigate whether it is possible to detect stress-related spectral changes at an early stage using hyperspectral sensors. For this purpose, two Norway spruce (Picea abies) forest stands, both different in age and maintenance, were monitored in the field over two vegetation periods. In parallel, time series of airborne hyperspectral remote sensing data were acquired. For each stand 70 trees were artificially stressed (ring-barked) and 70 trees were used as control trees. The data collected in south-eastern Germany consists of measurements at multiple times and at different scales: (1) crown conditions were visually assessed in the field (2) needle reflectance spectra were acquired in the laboratory using a FieldSpec spectrometer, and (3) hyperspectral airborne data (HySpex) were flown at 0.5 m spatial resolution. We aimed for a simultaneous data acquisition at the three levels. This unique data set was investigated whether any feature can be discriminated to detect vitality loss in trees at an early stage. Several spectral transformations were applied to the needle and tree crown spectra, such as spectral derivatives, vegetation indices and angle indices. All features were examined for their separability (ring-barked vs. control trees) with the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm. As result, the younger, well maintained forest stand only showed minor changes over the 2-year period, whereas changes in the older forest stand were observable both in the needle and in the hyperspectral tree crown spectra, respectively. These changes could even be detected before changes were visible by field observations. The tree spectral reactions to ring-barking were first noticeable 11 months after ring-barking and 6 weeks before they were visible by field inspection. The most discriminative features for separating the two groups were the reflectance spectra and the spectral derivatives, over the VIs or angle indices. The tree crown spectra of the two groups could be separated by the RF classifier with a 79% overall accuracy at the beginning of the second vegetation period and 1 month later with 92% overall accuracy with high kappa index. The results clearly demonstrate the great potential of hyperspectral remote sensing in detecting early vitality changes of stressed trees.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The modern cities of the world are characterized by continuous warming status. Land surface temperature (LST) is a very important part of the environmental status of mixed urban land and it is intimately associated with normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The current study makes an attempt on the seasonal fluctuation of LST-NDVI relation on diversified land surface material in Raipur City of India by using a large Landsat dataset for different seasons from 1991-92 to 2018-19. The results present the considerable rising trend of mean LST (1.6 degrees C, 5.3 degrees C, 4.8 degrees C, and 1.1 degrees C in the pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon, and winter, respectively) during the study period. The LST and NDVI produce a strong negative correlation (- 0.74, - 0.54, - 0.63, and - 0.49 in these four seasons) on plants; a moderate negative correlation (- 0.42, - 0.34, - 0.42, and - 0.21 in the four aforesaid seasons) on the barren land and urban settlement; and an insignificant correlation (0.27, 0.08, 0.05, and 0.19 in the four abovementioned seasons) on water bodies. This study is helpful in future planning for the ecological development of a city in tropical environment.

TI  - Assessing Radiometric Calibration of FY-4A/AGRI Thermal Infrared Channels Using CrIS and IASI
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The quality of thermal infrared (TIR) radiances from the FY-4A advanced geostationary radiation imager (AGRI) and their derived products is very important for weather predictions. The demand for more accurate weather forecasting models is increasing, so it is necessary to evaluate and improve the calibration accuracy of AGRI. This study aims to evaluate the AGRI TIR radiometric calibration accuracy by comparing two well-calibrated hyperspectral radiometers, the cross-track infrared sounder (CrIS), and the infrared atmospheric sounding interferometer (IASI). Most of the AGRI TIR channels are calibrated with an absolute brightness temperature (Tb) bias less than 0.5 K currently. The Tb bias of AGRI and CrIS\IASI depends on the target temperature, and it is smaller and more stable for higher Tb and increases for lower Tb. CH_14 shows the largest Tb bias (-0.53 K) and standard deviation (0.64 K), CH_10 and CH_11 record slightly positive Tb biases, and the other four channels exhibit negative Tb biases. The diurnal mean Tb bias is very consistent except for CH_11, which varies greatly among different time bins. The Tb bias of CH_09 is very consistent after the calibration update in February 2018. CH_10 shows a gradual bias decrease with bias from 1.0 to 0.6 K. CH_11 shows a gradual bias decrease with bias from 0.4 to 0.1 K with large fluctuations. CH_14 shows a gradual bias decrease with large fluctuation and like CH_11. CH_12 and CH_13 exhibit seasonal variations where the Tb bias reaches its maximum around June and minimum around February. In general, the Tb bias shows different spatial patterns in different channels and CH_11 shows obvious spatial distribution characteristics that is monthly dependent.

AB  - Soil moisture represents many attributes of the geo-hydrological cycle and the climate system. Citizen science through social media as an emerging tool could be utilized to collect soil moisture data. A pilot study area was selected in Shahriar, Iran. A user interface and a sampling process (use of citizen science by subscribers) were designed to analyze the subjective and gravimetric soil moisture data. Furthermore, explanatory moisture condition (EMC), a new initiative to consider land use in soil moisture information from vegetation cover, was evaluated. A statistical artificial neural network was used for quantifying subjective data, and soil moisture layouts were produced by utilizing the ordinary kriging (OK) method. For cross-validating, the land surface temperature data from the MODIS satellite were retrieved. A platform for the region with 200 m grids resolution to collect daily soil moisture at eight ungauged stations is proposed to utilize subjective data from the subscribers and cross-validated with satellite data. A virtual station at the centroid of the pervious part of the study area was selected as a reference station for data collection daily or weekly to generate soil moisture time series. The results showed a high potential of utilizing satellite and citizen science data for real-time estimation of scarce soil moisture data in developing regions.

TI  - Investigation of Possible MODIS AOD Anomalies as Earthquake Precursors for Global Earthquakes
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes are among the major and destructive natural disasters on Earth. Thus, it is important to investigate whether the occurrence of earthquakes affects the behavior of atmospheric parameters. This study aims to examine the aerosol variations in the atmosphere from a multi-year perspective as the earthquake precursor for the eight Mw > 7.0 earthquakes over different locations on the world. In this study, we analyzed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) derived Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) data as an earthquake precursor. In this context, 4-year (the earthquake year and the previous 3 years) epicentral AOD values were evaluated for each earthquake. As an anomaly indicator, +/- 2 sigma (95% confidence level) interval was utilized after applying 15-day moving average filter to the AOD time series. The results showed that any significant pre-seismic fluctuation or distinctive signal was not detected for any of the events, except for the 2017 Iraq Mw = 7.3 earthquake. However, identical anomalies are also observed 8-10 times in a year, which are not related to an earthquake. Thus, it can be assumed as a coincidence rather than a precursory signal. As a consequence, according to the scientific methodology (long-term AOD analysis) used in this study, sufficient precursory events could not be associated with the earthquakes to confirm the hypothesis that pre-seismic aerosol anomalies occur in the atmosphere.

TI  - A novel classifier for improving wetland mapping by integrating image fusion techniques and ensemble machine learning classifiers
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Among all the natural features, wetlands are the most difficult to map and monitor because of their complicated morphology, i.e., their diverse shapes and sizes, ranging from open waterlogged regions with sparse vegetation to thickly wooded areas with a distant distribution pattern. Wetland mapping has been performed with optical remote sensing data for a long time; but the accuracy varies with time and space owing to the complexity of wetland systems. Therefore, the objective of this work is to examine the efficacy of a novel and unique approach to automated complex wetland mapping in Bangladesh's Sunamganj District, using combined image fusion with machine learning techniques. The image fusion technique was used to fuse the multispectral bands (MS) of Landsat 8 OLI (bands 5, 4, 3) with the panchromatic band of Landsat 8, (band 8). The quality of the fused images was determined by calculating the correlation between the spectral values of the original multispectral and fused images, as well as through edge detection techniques. In addition to this, four advanced machine learning classifiers, i.e. random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and decision tree (DT), were used to classify the complex wetland image. Furthermore, a hybrid classifier was created by applying an artificial neural network (ANN) to previously identified models and spectral bands of satellite images. To validate the identified wetland maps, the Kappa coefficient and root mean square error (RMSE) have been used. The result shows that in wetland mapping, the Brovey image fusion approach surpassed the Gram-Schmidt image fusion technique. In addition, the accuracy of all four machine learning classifiers was higher on the fused images than on the MS image. The proposed fused ANN-based hybrid model outperformed all fused and MS classification models in terms of accuracy (kappa: 89.4% and RMSE: 0.13). According to the findings of this study, imagefusion based machine learning classifiers could be used for wetland mapping in other regions of the world, as well as for mapping river dynamics, forest cover, urban growth, and croplands.

TI  - <i>TERT</i> Promoter Mutational Status in the Management of Cutaneous Melanoma: Comparison with Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: While BRAF mutations seem important for early melanomagenesis, mutations in the TERT promoter (TERTp) are related to metastasis. Yet, in conventional melanoma management, risk stratification does not depend on molecular biomarkers that can indicate the stage of progression, but rather on clinical, pathological, sentinel lymph node (SLN), and radiologic evaluation. The aim of this work was to evaluate the frequency and prognostic impact of TERTp mutations, comparing their predictive value to those of conventional procedures in melanoma management. Methods: Mutational analysis of a series of 91 cases was performed. The correlations between TERTp and BRAF mutational status and clinicopathological features were assessed. Results: The mutation rate was 33% for TERTp and 30% for BRAF. There was 68% concordance between primary and metastatic samples for TERTp mutations and 92% for BRAF mutations. TERTp mutations are significantly associated with the presence of BRAF mutations, features of worse prognosis, and a reduced disease-free survival. Also, TERTp mutational status was similar to SLN biopsy as a predictive factor of cutaneous melanoma recurrence and metastasis. Conclusions: The predictive value of TERTp mutations may be similar to that of SLN biopsy and its integration in the management algorithm of melanoma patients should be considered.

TI  - Impact of the changes in the completion lymph node dissection criteria and approval of adjuvant therapies on the real-world outcomes of Japanese stage III melanoma patients
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Completion lymph node dissection (CLND) has long been the standard treatment for stage III melanomas identified as metastasis on the sentinel node (SN-positive). Two major changes occurred in 2017 and 2018, the change in the CLND criteria for SN-positive patients and the approval of several adjuvant therapies could revolutionize such management approach. However, their effects have not been fully investigated on the real-world outcomes of stage III melanoma patients. Therefore, we investigated the impact of these changes on the prognosis of Japanese stage III melanoma patients. Methods Totally, 119 stage III, SN-positive melanoma patients were included. They were categorized into those diagnosed as SN-positive between January 2015 and June 2017 (pre-June 2017 group) and between July 2017 and December 2019 (post-July 2017 group). Recurrence-free survival (RFS), overall survival, and prognostic factors were analyzed. Results The frequency of patients who received CLND was significantly higher in the pre-June 2017 group (p = 0.001), and those who received adjuvant therapy were significantly higher in the post-July 2017 group (p < 0.001). The 2-year RFS was 50.1% and 68.5% in the pre-June and post-July 2017 groups, respectively (p = 0.049). Cox proportional hazards model analysis for RFS showed that adjuvant therapies reduce the risk of recurrence (hazard ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.99; p = 0.047). Conclusion Changes in the CLND criteria in SN-positive patients and the approval of adjuvant therapies for stage III melanomas have significantly impacted Japanese melanoma medicine. Adjuvant therapy tended to prolong patient's RFS while omitting immediate CLND had no significant negative influence on it.

TI  - Presence and biodistribution of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in <i>Paracentrotus lividus</i> highlight its potential application for environmental biomonitoring
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The first determination of presence and biodistribution of PFOA in ninety specimens of sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus from two differently contaminated sites along Palermo's coastline (Sicily) is reported. Analyses were performed on the sea urchins' coelomic fluids, coelomocytes, gonads or mixed organs, as well as on seawater and Posidonia oceanica leaves samples from the collection sites. PFOA concentration ranged between 1 and 13 ng/L in seawater and between 0 and 794 ng/g in P. oceanica. The analyses carried out on individuals of P. lividus from the least polluted site (A) showed PFOA median values equal to 0 in all the matrices (coelomic fluid, coelomocytes and gonads). Conversely, individuals collected from the most polluted site (B) showed median PFOA concentrations of 21 ng/g in coelomic fluid, 153 ng/g in coelomocytes, and 195 ng/g in gonads. Calculated bioconcentration factors of log(10)BCF > 3.7 confirmed the very bioaccumulative nature of PFOA. Significant correlations were found between the PFOA concentration of the coelomic fluid versus the total PFOA concentration of the entire sea urchin. PERMANOVA (p = 0.001) end Welch's t-test (p < 0.001) analyses showed a difference between specimens collected from the two sites highlighting the potential application of P. lividus as sentinel species for PFOA biomonitoring.

TI  - Prediction of COVID-19 pervasiveness in six major affected states of India and two-stage variation with temperature
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus disease knocked in Wuhan city of China in December 2019 which spread quickly across the world and infected millions of people within a short span of time. COVID-19 is a fast-spreading contagious disease which is caused by SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2). Accurate time series forecasting modeling is the need of the hour to monitor and control the universality of COVID-19 effectively, which will help to take preventive measures to break the ongoing chain of infection. India is the second highly populated country in the world and in summer the temperature rises up to 50 degrees, nowadays in many states have more than 40 degrees temperatures. The present study deals with the development of the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model to predict the trend of the number of COVID-19 infected people in most affected states of India and the effect of a rise in temperature on COVID-19 cases. Cumulative data of COVID-19 confirmed cases are taken for study which consists of 77 sample points ranging from 1st March 2020 to 16th May 2020 from six states of India namely Delhi (Capital of India), Madya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. The developed ARIMA model is further used to make 1-month ahead out of sample predictions for COVID-19. The performance of ARIMA models is estimated by comparing measures of errors for these six states which will help in understanding future trends of COVID-19 outbreak. Temperature rise shows slightly negatively correlated with the rise in daily cases. This study is noble to analyse the variation of COVID-19 cases with respect to temperature and make aware of the state governments and take precautionary measures to flatten the growth curve of confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections in other states of India, nearby countries as well.

TI  - Quantitative analysis of spatial distribution of land surface temperature (LST) in relation Ecohydrological, terrain and socio- economic factors based on Landsat data in mountainous area
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is considered as one of the most significantly effective factors on the regional climate and ecology, playing an important role in connecting surface energy and water exchange. In mountainous regions, LST reveals lots of inconsistencies due to the effect of such factors as topography, vegetation, solar radiation, etc. We sought to investigate the the temporal and spatial variation LST in different years and its relationship with effective factors in 5 dimensions using Multiple statistical methods, the sepidan region in northwest Iran. The multi-factorial land use, topographic (elevation, slope, aspect), biophysical indices (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference moisture index (NDMI), normalized difference built up index (NDBI), and modified of normalized difference water index (MNDWI)), socio-economic (fossil fuel CO2 emissions (FFCOE) and road density(RD)), and climate (temperature and solar radiation) was studied in the current research. To this end, Images of July 1998 and 2017 were extracted from Thematic Mapper (TM5) and Operational Land Imager/Thermal infrared sensors (OLI/TIRS8). Moreover, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), Best subset regression, and Hierarchical Partitioning Analysis (HP) were used to investigate the relationship between LST and relevant effective factors. The results indicated that the temperature range varied from 10 to 53 degrees C in the time period mentioned. The highest amount of LST was observed in barren land use and the lowest one was found in garden lands. An negative correlation was found between LST and elevation. On the other hand, the highest value of the Laps rate of surface temperature was observed in the southern aspects and the lowest one was observed in the western aspects. Furthermore, the highest and lowest values of lase rate were found in slopes less than 10 degrees, and in 50 to 60-degree slopes, respectively. The results of the OLS correlation indicated a negative correlation between LST and NDVI, NDMI, and MNDWI, and a positive correlation of LST with climatic and socio-economic indicators. LST's highest and lowest correlations were found to be with vegetation (R-2 = 0.95) and road density (R-2 = 0.1). Finally, while in 1998 temperature and vegetation were identified as the most influential factors on LST, it was the elevation that was found to be the most effective factor on LST in 2017 with the effective rate of 82.72%. This study offers a valuable viewpoint on the temporal and spatial variations of LST, their complexity, and the environmental factors that affect them. The viewpoint could, therefore, be used for prospective studies on the analysis of the ecosystem's reaction to climate changes. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of COSPAR.

TI  - Spatial assessment of PM10 hotspots using Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour and Naive Bayes
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial modelling and analysis can assist in improving the decision-making process of mitigating bad air quality. One of Malaysia's most harmful air pollutants is particulate matter (PM), which has been used to denote the Air Pollutant Index (API) for over 20 years. The spatial prediction of particulate matter less than 10 mu m (PM10) hotspots is crucial to be assessed as it adversely affects human health and the environment. Advanced prediction of PM10 hotspots can ensure adequate preparedness for air quality management and minimize its effects. The PM10 data acquired for 2012-2016 in Malaysia's urbanized and populated state, Selangor, was used for the modelling. The PM10 was modelled using remote sensing data such as elevation, slope, road density, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, Normalized difference Vegetation Index, built-up index, land surface temperature, and wind speed. Spatial modelling of the PM10 hotspot was done using a Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithms. Results revealed a good prediction of PM10 hotspot with model performance for KNN, RF, and NB are in terms of specificity: 0.98, 0.99, 0.92; precision: 0.98, 0.99, 0,92; recall: 0.94, 0.98, 0.91; and the overall accuracy is 0.96, 0.98, 0.91, respectively. The PM10 hotspot map produced by the RF model indicates that urbanized and industrialized areas have high PM10 concentration, which characterizes the harmful effect of air pollutants in urbanized regions. These models can therefore be used for spatial assessment of PM supporting the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 on Sustainable Cities and Communities.

TI  - Tailored axillary surgery in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer: Pre-planned feasibility substudy of TAXIS (OPBC-03 SAKK 23/16, IBCSG 57-18, ABCSG-53, GBG 101)
T2  - BREAST
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: We developed tailored axillary surgery (TAS) to reduce the axillary tumor volume in patients with clinically node-positive breast cancer to the point where radiotherapy can control it. The aim of this study was to quantify the extent of tumor load reduction achieved by TAS. Methods: International multicenter prospective study embedded in a randomized trial. TAS is a novel pragmatic concept for axillary surgery de-escalation that combines palpation-guided removal of suspicious nodes with the sentinel procedure and, optionally, imaging-guided localization. Pre-specified study endpoints quantified surgical extent and reduction of tumor load. Results: A total of 296 patients were included at 28 sites in four European countries, 125 (42.2%) of whom underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and 71 (24.0%) achieved nodal pathologic complete response. Axillary metastases were detectable only by imaging in 145 (49.0%) patients. They were palpable in 151 (51.0%) patients, of whom 63 underwent NACT and 21 had residual palpable disease after NACT. TAS removed the biopsied and clipped node in 279 (94.3%) patients. In 225 patients with nodal disease at the time of surgery, TAS removed a median of five (IQR 3-7) nodes, two (IQR 1-4) of which were positive. Of these 225 patients, 100 underwent ALND after TAS, which removed a median of 14 (IQR 10-17) additional nodes and revealed additional positive nodes in 70/100 (70%) of patients. False negative rate of TAS in patients who underwent subsequent ALND was 2.6%. Conclusions: TAS selectively reduced the tumor load in the axilla and remained much less radical than ALND.

TI  - Missing Information Reconstruction of Land Surface Temperature Data Based on LPRN
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature is the main driving force of most ecological processes on Earth, with temperature data often used as a key environmental indicator to guide various applications and research fields. However, collected temperature data are limited by the hardware conditions of the sensors and atmospheric conditions such as clouds, resulting in temperature data that are often incomplete. This affects the accuracy of results using the data. Machine learning methods have been applied to the task of completing missing data, with mixed results. We propose a new data reconstruction framework to improve this performance. Using the MODIS LST map over a span of 9 years (2000-2008), we reconstruct the land surface temperature (LST) data. The experimental results show that, compared with the traditional reconstruction method of LST data, the proportion of effective pixels of the LST data reconstructed by the new framework is increased by 3%-7%, and the optimization effect of the method is close to 20%. The experiment also discussed the influence of different altitudes on the data reconstruction effect and the influence of different loss functions on the experimental results.

TI  - A novel cotton mapping index combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cotton is an important cash crop in the world, as the main source of natural and renewable fiber for textiles. Accurate and timely monitoring of the cotton distribution is crucial for cotton cultivation management and international trade. However, most of the previous researches on cotton identification using remotely sensed images are highly dependent on training samples, and the collection of samples is time-consuming and expensive. To overcome this limitation, a new index, termed as Cotton Mapping Index (CMI), was developed in this study for automatic cotton mapping using time series of Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI) satellite data. Four sites in the United States (U.S.) and four sites in China were selected to develop and assess the performance of the CMI. The spectral characteristics derived from Sentinel-2 and backscattering coefficients derived from Sentinel-1 for cotton and non-cotton crops during the cotton growth period were analyzed. Considering the phenology differences of crops in different regions, the features at an adaptive window were adopted to construct the CMI. The results showed that at the peak greenness period, the multiplication of red-edge 1 and red-edge 2 band for cotton samples were much larger than those for non-cotton samples, whereas the spectral angle at the red band as well as the absolute values of backscattering coefficients in vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) polarization for cotton samples were much smaller than those for non-cotton samples. Based on these findings, the CMI was developed to identify cotton cultivated area within the cropland area. The overall accuracy of classification results for the sites in the U.S. was higher than 81.20%, and the mean relative error for the sites in Xinjiang of China was 26.69%. The CMI, which incorporated optical and radar features, had a better performance than the indices using optical features solely. The advantage of the CMI over supervised classifiers (i.e., k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine and random forest) is that no training samples are required. Moreover, the cotton distribution map can be obtained before the harvest using the CMI. These results indicated the potential of the CMI for cotton mapping. The applicability of CMI in other regions with different cropping systems and crop types needs to be further assessed in the future study.

TI  - UAV-based spatial pattern of three-dimensional green volume and its influencing factors in Lingang New City in Shanghai, China
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional green volume (TDGV) reflects the quality and quantity of urban green space and its provision of ecosystem services; therefore, its spatial pattern and the underlying influential factors play important roles in urban planning and management. However, little is known about the factors contributing to the spatial pattern of TDGV. In this paper, TDGV and land use intensity (LUI) extracted from high spatial resolution (0.05 m) remotely sensed data acquired by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), anthropogenic factors(1)) and natural factors(2)) were utilized to identify the spatial pattern of TDGV and the potential influencing factors in Lingang New City, a rapidly developed coastal town in Shanghai. The results showed that most of the TDGV was distributed in the western part of this new city and that its spatial variations were significantly axial. TDGV corresponded well with the chronologies of land formation, urban planning, and construction in the city. Generalized least squares (GLS) analysis of TDGV (grid cell size: 100 x 100 m) and its influencing factors showed that the TDGV in this new city was significantly negatively correlated with both LUI and distance from roads and significantly positively correlated with land formation time and distance from water. Distance from buildings did not affect TDGV. Additionally, the degree of influence decreased in the following order: distance from water > land formation time > distance from roads > LUI. These results indicate that the spatial pattern of TDGV in this new town was mainly affected by natural factors (i.e., the distance from water and land formation time) and that the artificial disturbances caused by rapid urbanization did not decrease the regional TDGV. The main factors shaping the spatial distribution of TDGV in this city were local natural factors. Our findings suggest that the improvement in local soil and water conditions should be emphasized in the construction of new cities in coastal areas to ensure the efficient provision of ecological services by urban green spaces.

T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To investigate the epidemiological features of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) in patients with acute diarrhea in China.Methods An active sentinel surveillance was performed in all-age patients with acute diarrhea in China, 2009-2018. DEC was isolated and identified by serological assay and PCR from stool samples.Results DEC was determined in 6.68% (6,119/91,651) of the patients, with higher positive rates among females than among males (6.97% vs. 6.46%) and among 18-59 years patients (7.88%) than among other age groups. Five pathotypes were identified, the most prevalent was enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC), followed by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), and enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC). Pediatric patients <5 years had higher positive rate of EAEC (2.07%), followed by EPEC (1.81%), and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) (0.31%), while the 18-59 years patients had higher infection of ETEC (2.36%). ETEC and EPEC were more frequently identified in urban than rural areas, with age and gender adjusted positive rate of 1.68% vs. 1.14% respectively, and 1.77% vs. 1.55%, while EIEC and EHEC were more frequently identified in rural areas.Conclusions These findings highlight the epidemiology features of DEC and underscores the need for conducting DEC surveillance.

TI  - Thermal and ecological assessment based on land surface temperature and quantifying multivariate controlling factors in Bogura, Bangladesh
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the world has shown considerable concerns about environmental degradation accompanied by urban expansion. In terms of size, Bogura is equivalent to most of the major cities in Bangladesh, yet no thermal and ecological assessment has ever been conducted here. This study uses multitemporal Landsat satellite images between 2001 and 2020 to investigate the thermal and ecological conditions of Bogura Sadar (sub-district). Land surface temperature (LST) is obtained from Landsat images using the widely used radiative transfer equation. The thermal and ecological conditions are evaluated by computing urban heat island (UHI) and urban thermal field variance index (UTFVI) from LST data. The influence of vegetation, built-area, water-body, and bare soil on LST are examined using land cover indices through pixel-level multivariate linear regression analysis. According to the findings of this sub-district-scale (urban and rural areas) study, the mean LST has increased by 0.62 degrees C in the last 20 years. As per local administrative-wise findings, LST has increased in most areas, regardless of their urban or rural function. The difference between the urban area and the rest of the surroundings was significant (1.74 degrees C) in 2020. In 2001, UHI affected area was 5.65 km(2), which expanded to 8.84 km(2) in 2020. Thermal and ecological conditions are worse in urban areas than its surrounding areas. The regression models of the LST and land cover indices could explain more than half (R-2: 0.66 to 0.73) of LST variation over the years. Land cover could explain the LST in 2020 to the least extent implying that anthropogenic activities have greater influence than earlier. Land cover could explain less than half of the LST variation in the urban area.

TI  - Using open data to detect the structure and pattern of informal settlements: an outset to support inclusive SDGs' achievement
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of informal settlements is the first step in planning and upgrading deprived areas in order to leave no one behind in SDGs. Very High-Resolution satellite images (VHR), have been extensively used for this purpose. However, as a cost-prohibitive data source, VHR might not be available to all, particularly nations that are home to many informal settlements. This study examines the application of open and freely available data sources to detect the structure and pattern of informal settlements. Here, in a case study of Jakarta, Indonesia, Medium Resolution satellite imagery (MR) derived from Landsat 8 (2020) was classified to detect these settlements. The classification was done using Random Forest (RF) classifier through two complementary approaches to develop the training set. In the first approach, available survey data sets (Jakarta's informal settlements map for 2015) and visual interpretation using High-Resolution Google Map imagery have been used to build the training set. Throughout the second round of classification, OpenStreetMap (OSM) layers were used as the complementary approach for training. Results from the validation test for the second round revealed better accuracy and precision in classification. The proposed method provides an opportunity to use open data for informal settlements detection, when: 1) more expensive high resolution data sources are not accessible; 2) the area of interest is not larger than a city; and 3) the physical characteristics of the settlements differ significantly from their surrounding formal area. The method presents the application of globally accessible data to help the achievement of resilience and SDGs in informal settlements.

TI  - Groundwater investigation of the artesian wells on the palaeochannels in parts of the Great Rann of Kachchh, Gujarat, India, using remote sensing and geophysical techniques
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Rann of Kachchh (GRK) in Gujarat, India, is the largest salt desert in the world, which is usually filled with seawater ingression during high tide from the Arabian Sea. As a result, the soil gets saturated with saline water that has percolated down for several meters. Groundwater exploration in Rann area is a challenging task due to the prevailing hostile environment. For this purpose, multisensor satellite data have been used to delineate the palaeochannels in search of an alternate source of drinking water. In GRK, palaeochannels represent the zone of elevated fluvial sediments with respect to the surroundings. Evolutionary history of the palaeochannels indicates upliftment of GRK area during Allah Bund faulting. For assessing the groundwater potential of the palaeochannels, high-resolution electrical resistivity tomography (HERT) surveys have been carried out with the pole-dipole method. Electrical resistivity tomograms along 710 m traverses to a depth of 250 m in Dharmsala and Gainda area show higher-resistivity zones (medium to coarse sand with brackish water) below a thick low-resistivity layer (clay with saline water). A few exploratory drillings in the area confirm the existence of the palaeochannels, which act as a confined aquifer below 100 m depth. The artesian condition of the two drilled wells at Gainda and Khardoi along the northern boundary of GRK may be attributed to hydraulic gradient along the confined layers from the Tharparkar region in Pakistan. Thus, HERT is found to be a faster and more cost-effective geophysical survey technique for study of the deep aquifer.

TI  - Radiative Impacts of Aerosols During COVID-19 Lockdown Period Over the Indian Region
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 lockdown restrictions influenced global atmospheric aerosols. We report aerosol variations over India using multiple remote sensing datasets [Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), Cloud-Aerosol Lidar, and Infrared Pathfinder (CALIPSO)], and model reanalysis [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)] during the lockdown implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak period from March 25 to April 14, 2020. Our analysis shows that, during this period, MODIS and CALIPSO showed a 30-40% reduction in aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) with respect to decadal climatology (2010-2019). The absorbing aerosol index and dust optical depth measurements also showed a notable reduction over the Indian region, highlighting less emission of anthropogenic dust and also a reduced dust transport from West Asia during the lockdown period. On the contrary, central India showed an similar to 12% AOD enhancement. CALIPSO measurements revealed that this increase was due to transported biomass burning aerosols. Analysis of MODIS fire data product and CAMS fire fluxes (black carbon, SO2, organic carbon, and nitrates) showed intense fire activity all over India but densely clustered over central India. Thus, we show that the lockdown restrictions implemented at the government level have significantly improved the air quality over northern India but fires offset its effects over central India. The biomass-burning aerosols formed a layer near 2-4 km (AOD 0.08-0.1) that produced heating at 3-4 K/day and a consequent negative radiative forcing at the surface of similar to-65 W/m(2) (+/- 40 W/m(2)) over the central Indian region.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSE To provide recommendations on the best strategies for the management and on the best timing and treatment (surgical and radiotherapeutic) of the axilla for patients with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS Ontario Health (Cancer Care Ontario) and ASCO convened a Working Group and Expert Panel to develop evidence-based recommendations informed by a systematic review of the literature. RESULTS This guideline endorsed two recommendations of the ASCO 2017 guideline for the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with early-stage breast cancer and expanded on that guideline with recommendations for radiotherapy interventions, timing of staging after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), and mapping modalities. Overall, the ASCO 2017 guideline, seven high-quality systematic reviews, 54 unique studies, and 65 corollary trials formed the evidentiary basis of this guideline. RECOMMENDATIONS Recommendations are issued for each of the objectives of this guideline: (1) To determine which patients with early-stage breast cancer require axillary staging, (2) to determine whether any further axillary treatment is indicated for women with early-stage breast cancer who did not receive NAC and are sentinel lymph node-negative at diagnosis, (3) to determine which axillary strategy is indicated for women with early-stage breast cancer who did not receive NAC and are pathologically sentinel lymph node-positive at diagnosis (after a clinically node-negative presentation), (4) to determine what axillary treatment is indicated and what the best timing of axillary treatment for women with early-stage breast cancer is when NAC is used, and (5) to determine which are the best methods for identifying sentinel nodes.

TI  - Recent changes in Indian monsoon in light of regionalization based on various rain features
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect of climate change on precipitation pattern is emerging out as a serious global challenge. However, the quantification and assessment of the climate change effect on precipitation are a challenging issue given the spatio-temporal inhomogeneity of rainfall. Previous studies mostly used only rain intensity information for the identification of climate change signature by selecting homogeneous rain regions. Rain climatology, however, has several other important characteristics like occurrence of multiple rain type, occurrence of extreme rain events and their spatial distribution. The present study provides a novel approach to combine satellite data with ground measurements for addressing this issue. In this study, the Indian subcontinent has been divided into homogeneous regions based on six different rain features, obtained from ground observations and TRMM satellite measurements of 12 years, using K-medoid clustering technique. The rain features showed distinguishable patterns in the resulting nine homogeneous rain zones and distinct behavioural patterns in the inter-relationships between the various rain features. To verify the consistency of the proposed regionalization, the recent changes in mean monsoon rain rates are then studied using 40 years of rain gauge measurements for these regions. Increasing trends in monsoon rain are observed in two homogeneous regions whereas five of them have shown decreasing signature of rain intensity. Although the present study focused only on monsoon rain over India, the results indicate the suitability of the proposed method as an efficient technique of identifying homogeneous region for other seasons and locations as well.

TI  - A Statistical Analysis of Residual Errors in Satellite Remote Sensing Reflectance Data From Oligotrophic Open Oceans
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a statistical analysis of how residual error from satellite remote sensing reflectance ( $R_{{rs}})$ depends on the environmental factors. Our results indicate that image coverage affects the data quality, and the residual error in high-quality data correlates significantly with the residual error in data heavily contaminated with stray light. Due to imperfectly corrected bidirectional reflectance, we found many residual error anomalies in the covarying relationship between residual error and illumination-observation geometry even though high-quality $R_{{rs}}$ data appeared more homogeneous than low-quality data. Additionally, we found underestimates of $R_{{rs}}$ in very oligotrophic tropical waters, and these residual errors positively covaried with sensor zenith angles at the edge of the scans because of strong atmospheric multi-scattering effects. Furthermore, we found that due to their strong correlation with $R_{{rs}}$ , the spectral relationship of residual errors should be dynamically reinitialized with the image, which is key to an inherent optical properties (IOPs) data processing system (such as IDAS) removing the residual errors from the $R_{{rs}}$ data. Doing so, and applying the IDAS algorithm, stray-light-contaminated $R_{{rs}}$ was recovered, obtaining comparable results to those achieved considering high-quality measurements. This permits to relax the corresponding quality check for generation of the Level-3 global area coverage $R_{{rs}}$ , largely improving the satellite spatiotemporal coverage and consequently the product accuracy.

TI  - Detecting and mapping invasive <i>Parthenium hysterophorus</i> L. along the northern coastal belt of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa using image texture
T2  - SCIENTIFIC AFRICAN
M3  - Article
AB  - Parthenium hysterophorus L. (parthenium) is a devastating weed that is spreading rapidly throughout three continents, including Africa. Traditionally, information on plant distribu-tion was collected using spatially restrictive, time-consuming and expensive methods. Re-mote sensing has revolutionized the collection of landscape feature data in recent years, making plant distribution studies more efficient. This study investigates the use of freely accessible SPOT-6 and Sentinenl-2 imagery to map parthenium and associated land cover. Specifically, it utilized texture analysis to compare the mapping capability of a 1.5 m SPOT-6 panchromatic band, 6 m multispectral SPOT-6 image and 10 m Sentinel-2 image. The Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) was used to classify the images and the variable importance in the projection (VIP) score was used to determine the significant predictor variables. Although all images adequately detected parthenium and surrounding land cover classes, the panchromatic band achieved the highest user's and producer's ac-curacies for parthenium and a higher overall classification accuracy (77%). The most signif-icant texture parameters computed by the SPOT-6 panchromatic band and selected by VIP were mean, correlation and homogeneity. Overall, this study shows the potential of image texture integrated with PLS-DA to effectively detect and map parthenium and surrounding land cover classes. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

T2  - AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cover crops significantly affect soil quality, and growth characteristics in apple orchards, but reports are scarce. Therefore, the present study was conducted on a 15-year-old apple orchard (cultivar 'Red Gold') at Kashmir valley (32 degrees 22 '-34 degrees 43 ' N, 73 degrees 52 '-75 degrees 42 ' E; 1850 m.a.s.l.) to determine the influence of grass (Festuca arundinaceae) and legume (Trifolium pratense) bi-culture (GLBC) on soil properties viz. soil organic carbon (SOC), labile carbon (LC), total nitrogen (TN), potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), iron (Fe); and plant growth characteristics like trunk girth (TG), trunk cross-sectional area (TCSA), fruit yield (FY), and yield efficiency(YE), relative to a no cover crop control. GLBC produced 27.9 +/- 3.9 and 7.5 +/- 0.8 tons/ha green and dry herbage. Plant growth characteristics differed significantly (p < 0.05), with highest TG (38.89 +/- 1.54 cm) and TCSA (123.07 +/- 9.61 cm(2)) in GLBC and lowest (36.22 +/- 0.97 and 107.11 +/- 5.72, respectively) in control. The treatments differed for FY and YE, and maximum FY (30.63 +/- 2.81 t/ha) and YE (0.25 +/- 0.01 kg/cm(2)) was recorded in GLBC. Average SOC (12.53 g kg(-1)), LC (0.90 g kg(-1)), and TN (0.76 g kg(-1)) were 20.7, 27.7, and 13.3% greater in GLBC than control at 0-30 cm depth. Relative to control, SOC accumulation in GLBC was 14.15%, and soils sequestered 3.04 Mg C ha(-1). For nutrients, differences between treatments were limited for Mg, moderate for P, and Cu; and strong for Mn and K. The findings convey that GLBC adds enough residues to soil to cause measurable changes in SOC and offers potential for C sequestration and soil sustainability.

TI  - The impact of land use and land cover changes on soil erosion in western Iran
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of long-term land use and land cover (LULC) changes requires up-to-date remotely sensed data to assess their effects on erosion. This is a particularly important assessment for regions with semi-arid landscapes where soils tend to be scarce and proper management necessitates matching LULC to local conditions to achieve sustainable land use. This study evaluates the impact of LULC changes on erosion using Landsat satellite imagery and the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation model on the plains around the Jarahi River and the Shadegan International Wetlands. Supervised-classification and maximum-likelihood methods were applied to pre-processed TM, ETM, and OLI images for 1989, 2003, and 2017 to prepare LULC maps. The areal extents of agricultural land, wetlands, waterbodies, and built-up regions increased by 9.48%, 2.52%, 3.44%, and 0.13% from 1989 to 2003, respectively. During this timeframe bare (or barren) lands and wetland vegetation decreased by 11.44% and 4.13%. Between 2003 and 2017, however, the areas of bare lands, waterbodies, and built-up areas increased 12.77%, 1.52%, and 0.30%, while agricultural lands, wetlands, and wetland vegetation decreased by 9.99%, 1.32%, and 3.27%. According to the results, the areal extent of erosion at a rate > 1.1-5 Mg ha(-1 )year(-1) has been increased by about 45.56%, 50.06% and 52.24 between 1989, 2003 and 2017. LULC changes led to increased soil erosion on agricultural and bare lands. This highlights the need to plan and manage changes to LULC to reduce erosion to and below sustainable levels. Nature-based solutions can be effectively used to reduce erosion.

TI  - Irrigated rice crop identification in Southern Brazil using convolutional neural networks and Sentinel-1 time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the world's staple food sources, with millions of tonnes produced and consumed every year. Therefore, mapping rice paddies is essential for agricultural management and ensuring food security. This study aimed to classify rice crops in southern Brazil using the SENTINEL-1 SAR time series and deep learning models, comparing two architectures (U-net and LinkNet) and four backbones (ResNet-34, ResNeXt-50, DenseNet-121, and VGG16). The time series construction considered ten images, each for a month, covering the rice planting cycle. The Convolutional Neural Network architectures were adapted to use multi-band data, allowing the extraction of features from all-temporal images. This approach provides capturing spatiotemporal information from rice plantations, which favors its detection. Besides, the research evaluated three data sets considering the polarizations: (a) VV-only, (b) VH-only, and (c) both VV and VH (VV + VH). The classification accuracies used to measure the performance of the models were the overall accuracy, F1-measure, area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), and the intersection over union (IoU). Results show that the VH + VV polarization combination yielded the best results, followed by VH-only and VV-only. The VV-only polarization had significantly worst results (nearly 10% less IoU than VH-only and nearly 15% less IoU compared to VV + VH). The results show that rice fields can be successfully classified with deep learning models and through our evaluation the LinkNet architecture with the ResNeXt-50 backbone showed the best results with an accuracy of 0.98, F1 of 0.93, AUPRC of 0.93, and IoU of 0.91.

TI  - Land-use and Land-cover Changes in Pastoral Drylands: Long-term Dynamics, Economic Change, and Shifting Socioecological Frontiers in Baringo, Kenya
T2  - HUMAN ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ongoing fragmentation of pastoral drylands is a matter of concern throughout Africa. Using the example of rangelands in northern Baringo County, Kenya, that were under uniform pastoral use until the late twentieth century, we trace land-use and land-cover changes (LULCCs) since the 1980s. Based on ethnographic, historical, and remote sensing data, we show how bush encroachment and dryland farming have led to the increasing modification and conversion of formerly open rangelands and the diversification of livelihoods. These LULCC dynamics are related to and driven not only by internal processes of socioeconomic change (e.g., sedentarization, changing rangeland management practices, growing markets for small stock, increasing stratification and cultural differentiation) but also by ecological processes such as wildlife defaunation and ecological invasions. Based on our findings, we suggest that a socioecological approach to Kopytoff's notion of the internal African frontier can be helpful in framing these LULCC-related dynamics.

TI  - Major landslides in Kerala, India, during 2018-2020 period: an analysis using rainfall data and debris flow model
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall-induced landslides on steep slopes are potential hazards to life and property. The state of Kerala in India is witnessing unprecedented death and damage since last 3 years due to landslides triggered by heavy rainfall. In this paper, we present a cause-impact analysis of landslides that occurred due to the monsoon rainfall in the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. We have created an event-based landslide inventory post-rainfall season for the entire state and then selected six major landslides for detailed analysis. Event-based landslide inventory maps are prepared from Earth observation satellite data such as Resourcesat-2, 2A, Cartosat-2S, WorldView-2, Pleiades-1A and 1B, SPOT-6 and 7 and Sentinel-2 acquired before and after the rainfall events. Then, rainfall data were analysed to find out the role of daily and antecedent rainfalls on landslide trigger. Finally, we have carried out numerical debris flow modeling to characterise landslides and assess the impact. Our results show that landslides are triggered by antecedent rainfall of variable durations and are mostly debris flow type that has followed the channel path. The runout length and lateral spreads are controlled by variable frictional parameters of the slope material. Furthermore, reactivation at the crown region is also noticed in few cases that need to be monitored.

TI  - Changes in suspended sediments in the Yangtze River Estuary from 1984 to 2020: Responses to basin and estuarine engineering constructions
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Suspended sediments in the estuary play an important role in regulating the erosion-accretion and shaping the geomorphological patterns. Yet, it can be strongly impacted by the human activities. Constructions of basin and estuarine engineering in the Yangtze River Estuary (YRE), including constructions of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) further upstream of the Yangtze River and Deep Waterway Project (DWP) in the estuary, have greatly modified the distribution of estuarine suspended sediment concentration (SSC). In this study, we retrieved the surface water SSC in the YRE from a total of 149 Landsat-TM/ETM+/OLI images (from 1984 to 2020) and 515 GOCI im-ages (from 2011 to 2020) to obtain its long-term dynamics. The results indicate that the SSC estimation model performed well with a mean absolute percentage error of 12.83% and a root mean square error of 0.027 g/L. The SSC in the YRE demonstrated an overall declining pattern over the past 37 years, particularly during the flood season, which was related to the decrease in the sediment discharge of Yangtze River. The SSC in different sub-regions across the entire YRE responded differently to the reduced sediment discharge caused by the im-poundment of the TGD. The SSC in the inner estuary responded promptly with a 40.3% decline noted immediately after the impoundment of the TGD, whereas hysteresis of SSC changes was found in the estuarine turbidity max-imum zone (TMZ) and have begun to decline by 20.0-30.0% in the recent 5 years. Constructions of local estuarine engineering, such as the DWP also exert important controls on the estuarine SSC dynamics by blocking the lateral transport of suspended sediments between the shoal and the river channel. Our results highlight the strong in-fluence of engineering constructions on the SSC dynamics in the world large river-influenced estuaries. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Atmospheric Correction of DSCOVR EPIC: Version 2 MAIAC Algorithm
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) onboard the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) provides multispectral images of the sunlit disk of Earth since 2015 from the L1 orbit, approximately 1.5 million km from Earth toward the Sun. The NASA's Multi-Angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) algorithm has been adapted for DSCOVR/EPIC data providing operational processing since 2018. Here, we describe the latest version 2 (v2) MAIAC EPIC algorithm over land that features improved aerosol retrieval with updated regional aerosol models and new atmospheric correction scheme based on the ancillary bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model of the Earth from MAIAC MODIS. The global validation of MAIAC EPIC aerosol optical depth (AOD) with AERONET measurements shows a significant improvement over v1 and the mean bias error MBE = 0.046, RMSE = 0.159, and R = 0.77. Over 66.7% of EPIC AOD retrievals agree with the AERONET AOD to within & PLUSMN; (0.1 + 0.1AOD). We also analyze the role of surface anisotropy, particularly important for the backscattering view geometry of EPIC, on the result of atmospheric correction. The retrieved BRDF-based bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) are found higher than the Lambertian reflectance by 8-15% at 443 nm and 1-2% at 780 nm for EPIC observations near the local noon. Due to higher uncertainties, the atmospheric correction at UV wavelengths of 340, 388 nm is currently performed using a Lambertian approximation.

TI  - Higher ultraviolet radiation during early life is associated with lower risk of childhood type 1 diabetes among boys
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Population-level ecological studies show type 1 diabetes incidence is inversely correlated with ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR) levels. We conducted a nested case-control study using administrative datasets to test this association at the individual level. Cases (n = 1819) were children born in Western Australia (WA) from 1980-2014, diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at <= 16 years. Controls (n = 27,259) were randomly selected from all live births in WA, matched to cases by sex and date of birth. Total ambient erythemal ultraviolet radiation (UVR) doses for each trimester of pregnancy and first year of life were estimated for each individual, using daily NASA satellite data that were date- and geographically-specific. Conditional logistic regression tested the association between UVR dose and case-control status. Type 1 diabetes risk was 42% lower in boys of mothers with third-trimester UVR dose in the highest (compared to the lowest) quartile (p = 0.04). Higher UVR in the first year of life was associated with lower type 1 diabetes risk among boys (p = 0.01). UVR dose was not associated with type 1 diabetes risk in girls. Higher UVR in late pregnancy and early life appear to interact with sex-specific factors to lower type 1 diabetes risk among boys in Western Australia.

TI  - Transformation Analysis on Landuse/Land Cover Changes for Two Decades Between 1999 and 2019 CE with Reference to Aquaculture-Nagapattinam Coast, Southeast India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Even though the aquaculture is more lucrative compared to other high yielding variety of agricultural activities, the leakage of chemicals and wastages affects other landuse and land cover including the nearby rice fields in different parts of coastal India. We mapped the landuse/land covers of crop land, plantation, land with shrub, land without shrub, rural, urban and marshy land at Nagapattinam coast of southeast India by using Landsat series satellite images (TM and OLI) and estimated the changes with transformation analysis to assess the impacts of brackish water aquaculture between 1999 and 2019 CE. In two decades, the brackish water aquaculture activities have increased 2.5 times from 23.87 km(2) to 61.34 km(2) mostly by using 6.76 km(2) of crop land, 18.67 km(2) of fallow land, 3.64 km(2) of marshy land and 2.3 km(2) of plantation area. The accuracy assessment was carried out using 180 sample locations for each year (1999, 2009 and 2019). The accuracy assessment analysis shows overall accuracy of 81.66% (1999), 82.22% (2009) and 80.55% (2019), and overall Kappa coefficient values are 0.80, 0.81 and 0.79 for 1999, 2009 and 2019, respectively. This shows that the prepared Lu/Lc features are accurate enough for landuse and land cover change investigations. Our results and maps provide quantitative data to take proper actions to regulate the anthropogenic land alteration practices in this ecologically sensitive coastal area.

TI  - National scale mapping of larch plantations for Wales using the Sentinel-2 data archive
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate spatial information regarding forest types and tree species is immensely important for efficient forest management strategies. In the UK and particularly in Wales, creating a spatial inventory of larch (Larix sps.) plantations that encompasses both the public and private forests has become one of the highest priorities of woodland management policies, particularly given the need to respond to the rapid spread of Phytophthora ramorum fungal disease. For directing disease control measures, national scale, regularly updated mapping of larch distributions is essential. In this study, we applied a ExtraTree classifier machine learning algorithm to multi-year (June 2015 and December 2019) multi-path composites of vegetation indices derived from 10 m Sentinel-2 satellite data (spectral range used in this study: 490-2190 nm) to map the extent of larch plantations across Wales. For areas identified as woody vegetation, areas under larch plantations were associated with a needle-leaved leaf type and deciduous phenology, allowing differentiation from broad-leaved deciduous and needle-leaved evergreen types. The model accuracies for validation, which included overall accuracy, producer's and user's accuracies, exceeded 95% and the F1-score was greater than 0.97 for all forest types. Comparison against an independent reference dataset indicated all map accuracies above 90% (F1-score higher than 0.92) with the lowest value being 90.3% for the producer's accuracy for larch. Short wave infrared and red-edge based indices were particularly useful for discriminating larch from other forest types. Capacity for updating information on clear-felling of larch stands through annual updates of a woody mask was also introduced. The resulting maps of larch plantations for Wales are the most current for Wales covering public as well as private woodlands and can be routinely updated. The classification approach has potential to be transferred to a wider geographical area given the availability of open-source multi-year Sentienl-2 datasets and robust calibration datasets.

TI  - ValLAI_Crop, a validation dataset for coarse-resolution satellite LAI products over Chinese cropland
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous validation efforts have been conducted over the last decade to assess the accuracy of global leaf area index (LAI) products. However, such efforts continue to face obstacles due to the lack of sufficient high-quality field measurements. In this study, a fine-resolution LAI dataset consisting of 80 reference maps was generated during 2003-2017. The direct destructive method was used to measure the field LAI, and fine-resolution LAI images were derived from Landsat images using semiempirical inversion models. Eighty reference LAI maps, each with an area of 3 km x 3 km and a percentage of cropland larger than 75%, were selected as the fine-resolution validation dataset. The uncertainty associated with the spatial scale effect was also provided. Ultimately, the fine-resolution reference LAI dataset was used to validate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product. The results indicate that the fine-resolution reference LAI dataset builds a bridge to link small sampling plots and coarse-resolution pixels, which is extremely important in validating coarse-resolution LAI products.

TI  - Population-based analysis of non-operative management and treatment patterns in older women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose To examine the proportion of older women with ER + HER2- breast cancer receiving non-operative management versus surgery, and to evaluate the use of axillary staging and adjuvant radiation in this population. Methods We queried the SEER database to identify all women aged 70 years or older with stage I-III ER + HER2- invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2016. We evaluated trends in non-operative management, breast surgery, axillary staging, and adjuvant radiation according to age at diagnosis. Results We identified 57,351 older women with ER + HER2- disease. Overall, 3538 (6.2%) of the cohort underwent non-operative management, 38,452 (67.0%) underwent breast-conserving surgery (BCS), and 15,361 (26.8%) underwent mastectomy. The proportion of patients undergoing non-operative management increased from 2.8% among 70-74-year-old women to 30.1% in those >= 90 years old (p < 0.001). In 53,813 women who underwent surgery, 36,850 (68.5%) underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy, while 10,861 (20.2%) underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Subgroup analysis of 29,032 older women undergoing BCS for stage I ER + HER2- breast cancer revealed a 14.2% rate of omission of axillary staging, increasing from 5.3% in those 70-74 years to 67.6% in those >= 90 years old (p < 0.001). Receipt of adjuvant radiation occurred in 63.3% of older women following BCS and 18% post-mastectomy, with similar trends towards omission in older age groups. Conclusion Primary breast surgery remains the dominant management strategy for the majority of older women with ER + HER2- breast cancer. Omission of axillary staging and adjuvant radiation are used in a minority of eligible women undergoing breast conservation for early-stage disease.

TI  - Discriminating pure <i>Tamarix</i> species and their putative hybrids using field spectrometer
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - South Africa is home to a native Tamarix species, while two were introduced in the early 1900s to mitigate the effects of mining on soil. The introduced species have spread to other ecosystems resulting in ecological deteriorations. The problem is compounded by hybridization of the species making identification between the native and exotic species difficult. This study investigated the potential of remote sensing in identifying native, non-native and hybrid Tamarix species recorded in South Africa. Leaf- and canopy-level classifications of the species were conducted using field spectroradiometer data that provided two inputs: original hyperspectral data and bands simulated according to Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, SPOT-6 and WorldView-3. The original hyperspectral data yielded high accuracies for leaf- and plot-level discriminations (>90%), while promising accuracies were also obtained using Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Worldview-3 simulations (>75%). These findings encourage for investigating the performance of actual space-borne multispectral data in classifying the species.

TI  - Do News Media Kill? How a Biased News Reality can Overshadow Real Societal Risks, The Case of Aviation and Road Traffic Accidents
T2  - SOCIAL FORCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Is irrational risk-avoiding behavior related to news media's heightened attention for the negative and exceptional? Based on the theoretical approaches of mediatization and cultivation, it is hypothesized how news media can present an overly negative and biased reality that can have a severe impact on society. Focusing on the case of travel accidents, we argue that a disproportional increase in news attention for low-probability high-consequence aviation accidents can distort audiences' risk perceptions such that driving is inaccurately perceived as a safer transportation alternative to flying, with potentially harmful consequences. This study accordingly documents results from time-series analyses (1996-2017) on US media attention for aviation and road accidents related to real-world data on travel behavior and fatal accidents. The over-time patterns expose how news media follow their own mediatized logic and reality: Negative incidents-i.e., both aviation and road accidents-become more prominent in the news over time, rather than accurately reflecting real-world trends. Next, since air travel is statistically the safest transportation mode, disproportionate attention for aviation accidents is argued to especially create a problematic distorted worldview among audiences. Accordingly, findings show how more media attention for aviation accidents is related to relatively more road traffic and more fatal road accidents in the subsequent months. We conclude that the media's systematic overrepresentation of rare aviation accidents can overshadow the more substantial risk of (long-distance) driving. This paper illustrates how a distorted media reality can potentially result in severe consequences in light of audiences' ill-informed fear perceptions and irrational risk-avoiding behavior.

TI  - Inland water quality parameters retrieval based on the VIP-SPCA by hyperspectral remote sensing
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing is considered an effective tool for monitoring inland water quality. Non-optically active water quality parameters are of great significance to the aquatic environment, although they are rarely used in practical remote sensing applications. This study aims to improve the performance of non-optically active water quality parameter retrieval models by optimizing the wavelength selection and apply to the newly hyperspectral imagery from the Advanced HyperSpectral Imager (AHSI) and Orbita HyperSpectral (OHS) sensors. Focusing on dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonia nitrogen, and total phosphorus (TP), we propose a hyperspectral dimension reduction method based on the variable importance projection (VIP) and segmented principal component analysis (SPCA) method to determine the sensitive bands of different water quality parameters. A total of 81 in-situ samples of water quality parameters and water spectral reflectance were collected in Shanghai between 2018 and 2019. These were analyzed and used to establish quantitative retrieval models. Furthermore, the principal component regression, partial least squares regression, and back-propagation (BP) network models were compared and partly applied to satellite hyperspectral images. The final results show that models based on VIP- SPCA performed better in the validation set, and the best model was COD estimated by BP (VIP-SPCA) with a coefficient of determination (R-2) raised from 0.56 to 0.74. The mean absolute percentage error ranged from 14.23% (COD) to 24.11% (TP). Overall, the AHSI and OHS concentration maps had consistent spatial distributions with monthly monitoring data and reasonable concentration levels. Therefore, the results validate the great potential of hyperspectral remote sensing for inland water quality parameter retrieval using VIP-SPCA.

TI  - Agency: What Does It Mean to Be a Human Being?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper will look at the results of what has been termed "the crisis of modernism" and the related rise of postmodern perspectives in the 19th and 20th centuries. It concentrates on what is arguably the chief casualty of this crisis - human agency - and the social science that has developed out of the crisis. We argue that modern and postmodern social science ultimately obviate human agency in the understanding of what it means to be a human being. Attention is given to the contemporary intellectual world and the way in which it has been deeply informed by neo-Hegelian and other postmodern scholarly trends, particularly in accounting for how agency has come to play little role in social science understanding of human action. The paper also offers an alternative conception of human agency to the commonly endorsed libertarian model of free choice. Finally, the paper argues that this view of agency preserves meaning and purpose in human action and counters the pervasive social science worldview that sacrifices agency and meaning to powerful invisible abstractions.</p>

AB  - This paper, firstly, investigates the relationship between clean energy and economic growth using satellite remote sensing data to proxy economic activities. Then, this paper constructs a spatial autoregressive model, spatial error model, and spatial Durbin model to study the spatial spillover effects of financial development and clean energy. Further, this paper adopts the difference-in-differences (DID) model and the propensity score matching-DID (PSM-DID) method to conduct quasi-natural experiments on clean energy and examine whether China's energy policy can promote clean energy, thereby promoting economic growth. The analysis results reveal a positive correlation between clean energy and economic growth; local financial development promotes clean energy in the region but negatively impacts the clean energy in surrounding areas. Moreover, the findings confirm a significant positive relationship between the "policy treatment effect" and clean energy. Finally, we put forward relevant policy recommendations based on the empirical results.

TI  - 3D autoencoder algorithm for lithological mapping using ZY-1 02D hyperspectral imagery: a case study of Liuyuan region
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A hyperspectral image (HSI) contains hundreds of spectral bands, which provide detailed spectral information, thus offering an inherent advantage in classification. The successful launch of the Gaofen-5 and ZY-1 02D hyperspectral satellites has promoted the need for large-scale geological applications, such as mineral and lithological mapping (LM). In recent years, following the success of computer vision, deep learning methods have shown their advantage in solving the problem of hyperspectral classification. However, the combination of deep learning and HSI to solve the problem of geological mapping is insufficient. We propose a new 3D convolutional autoencoder for LM. A pixel-based and cube-based 3D convolutional neural network architecture is designed to extract spatial-spectral features. Traditional and machine learning methods are employed as competing methods, trained on two real hyperspectral datasets, and evaluated according to the overall accuracy, F1 score, and other metrics. Results indicate that the proposed method can provide convincing results for LM applications on the basis of the hyperspectral data provided by the ZY-1 02D satellite. Compared with traditional methods, the combination of deep learning and hyperspectral can provide more efficient and highly accurate results. The proposed method has better robustness than supervised learning methods and shows great promise under small sample conditions. As far as we know, this work is the first attempt to apply unsupervised spatial-spectral feature learning technology in LM applications, which is of great significance for large-scale applications.

TI  - Extracting built-up land area of airports in China using Sentinel-2 imagery through deep learning
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In China, airports have a profound impact on people's lives, and understanding their dimensions has great significance for research and development. However, few existing airport databases contain such details, which can be reflected indirectly by the built-up land in the airport. In this study, a deep learning-based method was used for extraction of built-up land of airports in China using Sentinel-2 imagery and for further estimating their area. Here, a benchmark generation method is introduced by fusing two reference maps and cropping images into patches. Following this, a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the network architectures and select the positive impact bands in Sentinel-2 imagery. A well-trained model was used to extract the built-up land for China airports, and the relationship between China airports' built-up land and the carrying capacity of air transportation was further analysed. Results show that ResUNet-a outperformed U-Net, ResUNet, and SegNet, and the B2, B4, B6, B11, and B12 bands of Sentinel-2 had a positive impact on built-up land extraction. A well-trained model with an overall accuracy of 0.9423 and an F-1 score of 0.9041 and 434 China airports' built-up land was extracted. The four most developed airports are located in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, which matches China's political and economic development. The area of built-up land influenced the passenger throughput and aircraft movements. The total area influenced the cargo throughput, and we found a certain correlation among the built-up land, carrying capacity, and nighttime light.

TI  - Improving the spatial prediction of soil organic carbon using environmental covariates selection: A comparison of a group of environmental covariates
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - In the digital soil mapping (DSM) framework, machine learning models quantify the relationship between soil observations and environmental covariates. Generally, the most commonly used covariates (MCC; e.g., topographic attributes and single-time remote sensing data, and legacy maps) were employed in DSM studies. Additionally, remote sensing time-series (RST) data can provide useful information for soil mapping. Therefore, the main aims of the study are to compare the MCC, the monthly Sentinel-2 time-series of vegetation indices dataset, and the combination of datasets (MCC + RST) for soil organic carbon (SOC) prediction in an arid agroecosystem in Iran. We used different machine learning algorithms, including random forest (RF), Cubist, support vector machine (SVM), and partial least square regression (PLSR). A total of 237 soil samples at 0-20 cm depths were collected. The 5-fold cross-validation technique was used to evaluate the modeling performance, and 50 bootstrap models were applied to quantify the prediction uncertainty. The results showed that the Cubist model performed the best with the MCC dataset (R-2 = 0.35, RMSE = 0.26%) and the combined dataset of MCC and RST (R-2 = 0.33, RMSE = 0.27%), while the RF model showed better results for the RST dataset (R-2 = 0.10, RMSE = 0.31%). Soil properties could explain the SOC variation in MCC and combined datasets (66.35% and 50.82%, respectively), while NDVI was the most controlling factor in the RST (50.22%). Accordingly, results showed that time-series vegetation indices did not have enough potential to increase SOC prediction accuracy. However, the combination of MCC and RST datasets produced SOC spatial maps with lower uncertainty. Therefore, future studies are required to explicitly explain the efficiency of time-series remotely-sensed data and their interrelationship with environmental covariates to predict SOC in arid regions with low SOC content.

TI  - The design and implementation of GECAM satellite payload performance monitoring software
T2  - RADIATION DETECTION TECHNOLOGY AND METHODS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background The Gravitational wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) is primarily designed to spot gamma-ray bursts corresponding to gravitational waves. In order to achieve stable observations from various astronomical phenomena, the payload performance need to be monitored during the in-orbit operation. Method This article describes the design and implementation of GECAM satellite payload performance monitoring (GPPM) software. The software extracts the payload status and telescope observations (light curves, energy spectrums, characteristic peak fitting of energy spectrums, etc) from the payload data. Considering the large amount of payload status parameters in the engineering data, we have designed a method of parameter processing based on the configuration tables. This method can deal with the frequent changes of the data formats and facilitate program maintenance. Payload status and performance are monitored through defined thresholds and monitoring reports. The entire software is implemented in python language and the huge amount of observation data is stored in MongoDB. Conclusion The design and implementation of GPPM software have been completed, tested with ground and in-orbit payload data. The software can monitor the performance of GECAM payload effectively. The overall design of the software and the data processing method can be applied to other satellites.

TI  - Clinical implications of Indocyanine Green Fluorescence Imaging-Guided laparoscopic lymphadenectomy for patients with gastric cancer: A cohort study from two randomized, controlled trials using individual patient data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The value of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging in tracing metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) has rarely been reported. We aimed to evaluate the clinical implications of fluorescence imaging-guided lymphadenectomy and the sensitivity of fluorescent lymphography to detect metastatic LN stations in gastric cancer (GC).Materials and methods: This analysis pooled data from two randomized controlled trials (FUGES-012 and FUGES019 studies) on laparoscopic ICG tracer-guided lymphadenectomy for GC between November 2018 and October 2020. Patients who received ICG injection using either the intraoperative subserosal or preoperative submucosal approaches 1 day before surgery and underwent fluorescence imaging-guided lymphadenectomy were defined as the ICG group. Patients who underwent conventional lymphadenectomy without ICG injection and intraoperative imaging were defined as the non-ICG group.Results: Among 514 enrolled patients, the ICG and non-ICG groups included 385 and 129, respectively. A significantly higher mean number of LNs was retrieved in the ICG group than in the non-ICG group (49.9 vs. 42.0, P < 0.001). The ICG group showed a lower LN noncompliance rate than that in the non-ICG group (31.9% vs. 57.4%, P < 0.001). The sensitivity of fluorescence imaging for detecting all metastatic LN stations was 86.8%. The negative predictive value was 92.2% for nonfluorescent stations. For detecting all metastatic stations, subgroup analysis revealed 97.7%, 91.7%, 86.2%, and 84.3% sensitivities for pT1, pT2, pT3, and pT4a tumors, respectively. Regardless of gastrectomy type, the diagnostic accuracy for detecting all metastatic stations in the D1+ and D2 stations for cT1-cT2 disease reached 100%.Conclusion: ICG fluorescence imaging, using either the subserosal or submucosal approaches, assisted in the thorough dissection of potentially metastatic LNs, as recommended for individualized laparoscopic lymphadenectomy for GC.

TI  - Mapping of biophysical and biochemical properties of coastal tidal wetland habitats with Landsat 8
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal tidal wetlands are significant and vulnerable aquatic ecosystems. Quantitative remote sensing of biophysical and biochemical properties in coastal tidal wetland habitats through the inversion of physical models has vital practical significance for monitoring ecosystem function, environmental restoration, the global carbon, and nitrogen cycles. The objectives of this research were to map leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll content, as well as the sensible heat flux, latent heat flux, and productivity in Chongming Dongtan coastal tidal wetland habitats of China and to provide a mapping protocol of biophysical and biochemical properties in Chongming Dongtan wetland for environmental protection and restoration as well as assessment and monitoring. In order to obtain significant information for biodiversity protection and management, a method based on the Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes model and lookup table approach has been developed. The results derived from our study contain the reflectance values of Scirpus mariqueter and Phragmites australis spectra are lower than those commonly found for vegetated areas. This may be caused by the dark soil background and low LAI. Moreover, as for the values of latent heat flux (between 120 and 190 W m(-2) ) and productivity (between 3 and 14 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)), mudflats are lower than vegetation. However, the values of sensible heat flux (between 140 and 170 W m(-2)) of mudflats are higher than that of vegetation. (C) 2021 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - A novel-optimal monitoring model of rocky desertification based on feature space models with typical surface parameters derived from LANDSAT_8 OLI
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies monitoring the spatial distribution of rocky desertification have used single indices, a comprehensive index, or image classification. However, these approaches could not distinguish between the degrees of rocky desertification as they did not consider various influencing factors and their interactions. To avoid the above shortcomings, this study used the feature space model and seven typical land surface parameters to establish two categories of rocky desertification model: (1) a point-to-point model; and (2) a point-to-line model. A novel model for the optimal monitoring of rocky desertification was then proposed, which could take the comprehensive impacts of the human-nature system on the process of rocky desertification. The results showed that: (1) the feature space models provided a novel approach to large-scale monitoring of rocky desertification; (2) the point-to-line model incorporating the rock bare index (RBI)-dryness index feature space showed the optimal applicability for monitoring of rocky desertification, with a precision of 93.4%; and (3) the RBI performed the best in indicating the process of rocky desertification, with an average precision of 88.5%. The results of this study can act as a reference within the investigation of the spatiotemporal evolution of rocky desertification for karst mountain areas.

TI  - Deep Forest classifier for wetland mapping using the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are among the most important, yet in danger ecosystems and play a vital role for the well-being of humans as well as flora and fauna. Over the past few years, state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) tools have gained attention for wetland classification within the remote sensing community. However, the DL methods could have complex structure and their efficiency greatly depends on the availability of a large number of training data. Inspired by DL methods, yet with less complexity, the Deep Forest (DF) classifier is an advanced tree-based deep learning tool with a great capability for several remote sensing applications. Despite the effectiveness of DF classifiers, few research studies have investigated the potential of such a powerful technique for classification of remote sensing, with no documented research for wetland classification. Accordingly, the potential of the DF algorithm for the classification of wetland complexes has been investigated in this study. In particular, three well-known classifiers, namely Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Extra Tree (ET), were used as the tree-based classifier to build DF, for which the hyper parameter tuning is carried out to ensure the optimum classification accuracy. Three well-known tree-based classification algorithms, namely Decision Tree (DT), Conventional Random Forest (CRF), and Conventional Extreme Gradient Boosting (CXGB), as well as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are used as benchmark tools to compare the results obtained from the DF classifiers for wetland mapping. The results demonstrated that the DF-XGB classifier outperforms both DF-RF and DF-ET in terms of classification accuracy albeit with a longer training time. The results also confirmed the superiority of all three DF-based classifiers compared to the CRF and DT classifiers. For example, the DF-XGB improved the F1-score by 14%, 13%, 7%, 3%, and 1% for fen, swamp, marsh, bog, and shallow water, respectively, compared to the optimized CRF. The results indicated that the DF algorithm has great capability to be applied over large areas to support regional and national wetland mapping and monitoring.

TI  - Teaching militant humility against the aggressions of a neoliberal world
T2  - DISCOURSE-STUDIES IN THE CULTURAL POLITICS OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This article develops a militant teaching humility regarding the foundational aggression and violence of a neoliberal worldview within late capitalism. Mainly the article shows how such aggressions and violence take shape as schooling the self-interested consumer within a school market. This article also shows how such self-interest understands education in terms of individualism, comparison, and competition, ultimately leading to the destruction of the social fabric of the common good of democracies. The teaching strategy identified highlights the humility and discipline needed to transform the aggression and violence of late capitalism into a non-violent but consistent strategy for democratization. The strategy developed in the article takes inspiration from Judith Butler, Jacques Ranciere and Thich Nhat Hanh, and exemplifies what democratization in education implies today. This article concludes with teaching understood as an ethical and political concern in being for the other, in being interested in the freedom of the other.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The light use efficiency (LUE) approach is a well-established method for estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) over large areas using Earth observation data. The present study aims to determine maximum light use efficiency (LUEmax) values specific to the northwest Himalayan foothills of India. It also aims to estimate the spatio-temporal variability of GPP from 2001 to 2020 using remote sensing data in combination with eddy covariance data in the LUE-based model. The model was parameterized using different sets of default and calculated parameters. The study showed that the use of PFT-specific LUEmax and temperatures increased the accuracy of the model predictions. On validation, the LUE-based model predicted GPP showed R-2 = 0.82 for moist deciduous and R-2 = 0.83 for dry deciduous PFTs. The study revealed that with rigorous model parameterization, RS data can be used in an LUE-based model to achieve accurate spatio-temporal estimates of GPP.

TI  - Adjuvant Therapy for Stage III Melanoma Without Immediate Completion Lymph Node Dissection
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction For patients with stage III melanoma with occult lymph node metastasis, the use of adjuvant therapy is increasing, and completion lymph node dissection (CLND) is decreasing. We sought to evaluate the use of modern adjuvant therapy and outcomes for patients with stage III melanoma who did not undergo CLND. Methods Patients with a positive SLNB from 2015 to 2020 who did not undergo CLND were evaluated retrospectively. Nodal recurrence, recurrence-free survival (RFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and melanoma-specific survival were evaluated. Results Among 90 patients, 56 (62%) received adjuvant therapy and 34 (38%) underwent observation alone. Patients who received adjuvant therapy were younger (mean age: 53 vs. 65, p < 0.001) and had higher overall stage (Stage IIIb/c 75% vs. 54%, p = 0.041). Disease recurred in 12 of 34 patients (35%) in the observation group and 11 of 56 patients (20%) in the adjuvant therapy group. The most common first site of recurrence was distant recurrence alone (5/34 patients) in the observation group and nodal recurrence alone (8/90 patients) in the adjuvant therapy group. Despite more adverse nodal features in the adjuvant therapy group, 24-month nodal recurrence rate and RFS were not significantly different between the adjuvant and observation cohorts (nodal recurrence rate: 26% vs. 20%, p = 0.68; RFS: 75% vs. 61%, p = 0.39). Among patients with stage IIIb/c disease, adjuvant therapy was associated with a significantly improved 24-month DMFS (86% vs. 59%, p = 0.04). Conclusions In this early report, modern adjuvant therapy in patients who forego CLND is associated with longer DMFS among patients with stage IIIb/c disease.

TI  - Extent of Segmentectomy That Achieves Greater Lung Preservation Than Lobectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. This study sought to clarify the extent of segmentectomy that achieves greater lung preservation than lobectomy.Methods. This was a single-center retrospective cohort study involving 374 patients with lung cancer who were treated with either lobectomy or segmentectomy between 2013 and 2018. The percentage of preserved pulmonary function (%PPF) after surgery was compared among patients who underwent lobectomy (n = 164), segmentectomy of 2 or more segments (Seg >= 2S; n = 42), and segmentectomy of less than 2 segments (Seg <2S; n = 168). Using perfusion scintigraphy, forced expiratory volume in 1 second of the preserved target lobe was measured to examine its effect on the %PPF. The number of resected subsegments (SSs) in segmentectomy that made the %PPF higher than that observed with lobectomy was also examined.Results. Mean %PPF was lowest in those patients who underwent lobectomy (86%), followed by Seg >= 2S (89%) and Seg <2S (95%) (P < .001), but the dif ference between the lobectomy and Seg >= 2S was not significant (P = .21). The forced expiratory volume in 1 second of the preserved target lobe was significantly lower in the Seg >= 2S group than in the Seg <2S group (P < .001). The number of resected SSs was 6 to 12 in lobectomy, 4 to 7 in Seg .2S, and 1 to 4 in Seg <2S. Although the %PPF after segmentectomy of less than 5 SSs (Seg <5SS) was significantly higher than that after lobectomy (P < .001), the %PPF after segmentectomy of 5 or more SSs (Seg >= 5SS) was not significantly different from that after lobectomy (P = .68).Conclusions. Both the Seg >= 2S and Seg >= 5SS groups did not differ from lobectomy in %PPF because of the low function of preserved target lobe. (C) 2021 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons

TI  - The distribution of hepatitis C virus infection in Shanghai, China: a time-spatial study
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Shanghai, as a pilot city of China to achieve the goal of eliminating hepatitis C, its strategy of allocating medical resources is a pressing problem to be solved. This study aims to infer the time-spatial clustering patterns of HCV-infected cases, and grasp the dynamic genotype distribution of HCV, thereby inform elimination strategies of HCV with efficacy and efficiency. Methods Reported HCV cases including their demographic information in Shanghai city from 2005 to 2018 were released from the National Infectious Disease Reporting Information System, population data at community scale, geographical layers of hospitals, communities and districts were gathered from former research. Blood samples of HCV-infected individuals were collected during 2014-2018 from 24 sentinel hospitals, HCV-antibody test, qualitative nucleic acid test and NS5B/5'UTR gene amplification were performed accordingly to determine the genotypes of the specimen. Furthermore, global and local spatial self-correlation analysis of both acute and chronic HCV infections were conducted at community scale year by year, then time-spatial clusters of acute and chronic HCV infections and HCV genotype distribution of specimen collected from sentinel hospitals by districts were mapped by using Arcmap10.1. Results A total of 2631 acute HCV cases and 15,063 chronic HCV cases were reported in Shanghai from 2005 to 2018, with a peak in 2010 and 2017, respectively. The mean age of chronic HCV patients was 49.70 +/- 14.55 years, 3.34 +/- 0.32 years older than the acute (t = 10.55, P-value < 0.01). The spatial distribution of acute HCV infection formed one primary cluster (Relative Risk = 2.71), and the chronic formed one primary cluster and three secondary clusters with Relative Risk ranged from 1.94 to 14.42, meanwhile, an overlap of 34 communities between acute and chronic HCV clusters were found with time period spans varied from 6 to 12 years. Genotype 1 (N = 257, 49.71%) was the most prevalent HCV genotype in Shanghai, genotype 3 infections have increased in recent years. Baoshan district presented cluster of acute HCV and the highest proportion of genotype 2, Pudong new area was the cluster of chronic HCV and occupied the highest proportion of genotype 3. Conclusions Despite the low prevalence of HCV infection, it is still needed to push forward the elimination process in Shanghai, as there is a certain amount of HCV infected people waiting to be treated. The time-spatial clustering patterns and the dynamic of HCV genotype distribution together indicated a changing constitution of different transmission routes of HCV infection, thus, a focused strategy may be needed for high-risk population related to genotype 3 infection like drug users, in addition to an enforcement of the existing measures of preventing the iatrogenic and hematogenic transmission of HCV.

TI  - Who captures whom? Regulatory Misperceptions and the timing of cognitive capture
T2  - REGULATION & GOVERNANCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - To explain cognitive capture, economic sociologists often examine the structure of relationships between regulators and market participants. This paper argues that the nature of regulators' misperception should be subject to analysis as well. Different types of misperceptions develop over timelines of varying lengths. Depending on the misperception, different sets of relationships and parties may therefore be the cause of regulators' capture. The paper illustrates this point with a case study of regulators' failure to detect pervasive market power in California's electricity markets between 1998 and 2001. Existing explanations focus on sellers' short-term attempts to distract regulators from widespread evidence of market power. Using data from three archives and in-depth interviews, I show that the regulators did not fall prey to such "information problems." Instead, their misperception resulted from a more foundational "worldview problem." This error affects regulators' basic conception of the marketplace and can be traced to earlier and more gradual forms of influence exerted by utilities that, ironically, would become the victims of market power.

TI  - Quality assurance review: Intra-operative evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Intraoperative consultation (IOC) of axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy continues to play a role in selected breast cancer patients. The reported sensitivity rates for intraoperative SLN evaluation in breast cancer range from 47% to 80%. We study a center where the majority of SLN IOC is performed by imprint cytology, and a protocol was established to limit microscopic examination to three slides for a reporting TAT goal of 30 min. Methods Approval to conduct this study was obtained from the REB. A retrospective review was performed on all consecutive SLN cases sent for IOC. Reported IOC assessments of all cases were compared with the final pathology. Results Of 164 patients, there were 22 (13%) false negative IOC events, including 15 missed macro-metastasis and 7 missed micro-metastasis. The overall sensitivity for touch imprint in detecting SLNs macro-metastasis was 70.9%. Reporting total turnaround time was on average 3 min longer, whereas sensitivity and specificity were not significantly different in the two protocol periods. Conclusion Implementation of an IOC policy for a maximum of three slides for imprint cytology did not result in a significant impact on the sensitivity, specificity, or total turnaround time for SLN in breast cancer patients. False negative IOC events were mainly due to sampling error. Quality review was made difficult by limited documentation related to the gross handling of the specimens at IOC. System factors identified include insufficient space for the IOC report on the pathology requisition, and the lack of clearly communicated expectations for documentation.

TI  - Estimating monthly PM2.5 concentrations from satellite remote sensing data, meteorological variables, and land use data using ensemble statistical modeling and a random forest approach
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with various adverse health outcomes and poses serious concerns for public health. However, ground monitoring stations for PM2.5 measurements are mostly installed in populationdense or urban areas. Thus, satellite retrieved aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, which provide spatial and temporal surrogates of exposure, have become an important tool for PM2.5 estimates in a study area. In this study, we used AOD estimates of surface PM2.5 together with meteorological and land use variables to estimate monthly PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 3 km2 over Taiwan Island from 2015 to 2019. An ensemble twostage estimation procedure was proposed, with a generalized additive model (GAM) for temporal-trend removal in the first stage and a random forest model used to assess residual spatiotemporal variations in the second stage. We obtained a model-fitting R2 of 0.98 with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.40 mu g/m3. The leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) R2 with seasonal stratification was 0.82, and the RMSE was 3.85 mu g/m3, whereas the R2 and RMSE obtained by using the pure random forest approach produced R2 and RMSE values of 0.74 and 4.60 mu g/m3, respectively. The results indicated that the ensemble modeling approach had a higher predictive ability than the pure machine learning method and could provide reliable PM2.5 estimates over the entire island, which has complex terrain in terms of land use and topography.

TI  - Laparoscopic cholecystectomy: review of 1430 cases in Cure International Hospital, Kabul, Afghanistan
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the gold standard for the treatment of cholelithiasis in most countries of the world. The objective of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of LC in the surgery department of Cure International Hospital, Kabul, Afghanistan.Methods: A retrospective study was conducted on 1430 LC cases performed by the general surgery department of Cure International Hospital. Data was collected from patient files and the operation theatre registry for whom LC was performed during January 2008 through December, 2019.Results: Mean age was 45.77 +/- 13.45 years (14-90 years), with male/female ratio of 1:4.7. One third (33%) had comorbidities. Most of patients (similar to 97%) were classified as ASA grade I and II. Of all patients, 26.8% of males and 13.2% of females had gallbladder inflammation (OR = 2.203, 95% CI 1.56-2.61, P = 0.000). Overall mean duration of anesthesia was 75 +/- 25.6 min. The conversion rate to OC was 4.6% (N = 66), most commonly dense adhesions at Callot's triangle (3.8%). The intraoperative complication rate was 17.5% (N = 249), where bile/stone spillage was the most common indication (N = 235, 16.4%). Immediate postoperative complication rate was 2.4% (N = 35). Average length of stay (ALOS) after LC was 2.23 +/- 1.43 days (1-19 days).Conclusion: This study shows that elective LC can be performed safely in Afghanistan with comparable outcomes in terms of complications, conversion rates, and ALOS to other countries of the region and the world. Proper case selection and careful preoperative evaluation and management can decrease further conversion, intra- and postoperative complications.

TI  - Characteristics of the severe March 2021 Gobi Desert dust storm and its impact on air pollution in China
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - A dust storm that formed in the north of China and the southeastern part of Mongolia in March 2021 significantly deteriorated air quality over a large area of East Asia. According to the synoptic pattern, the cause of the dust storm was a cyclone with a significant drop in pressure leading to high winds and dry components of the soil over parts of the Gobi Desert becoming airborne. Data obtained from ground-based air quality monitoring stations show that the observed hourly PM10 concentration greatly exceeded the recommended maximum of 150 mu g/m3 with readings above 1500 mu g/m3 in the cities of Tianjin, Baoding, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Zhoukou. In Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Jinnan, Xining, Baotou, and Jining. In Handan, it was over 2000 mu g/m3. Cities where PM10 concentration exceeded 3900 mu g/m3 included Lanzhou, Hohhot, Changzhou, Alashan, Yan'an, Yulin, Hami, Jiuquan, Heze, Hotan, and Baiyin. Concentrations exceeded 7000 mu g/m3 on March 15th over parts of the provinces of Inner Mongolia, Hansu and Ningxia, in the cities of Ordos, Jinchang, Wuwei and Zhongwei. According to satellite data, the area of dust covered approximately 450,000 km2. MODIS and TROPOMI data demonstrated high aerosol optical depth (AOD) (more than 1) with a high ultraviolet aerosol index (UVAI) (more than 2), confirming the predominance of dust particles during the storm. Data from CALIPSO show the presence of a dense layer of dust extending from the earth's surface to a height of about 8 km. The Dust Regional Atmospheric Model (BSC-DREAM8b) demonstrates high synchrony with the satellite's surface dust concentration data, ranging from 640 to 1280 mu g/m3, and exceeding 2650 mu g/m3 in some areas. The purpose of this study is to analyze data from ground-based sensors, satellites, and atmospheric models to better understand the March 2021 dust storm event. The results may be useful for the implementation of protective and preventive measures for both the environment and human health, including air quality control.

TI  - Review of urban computing in air quality management as smart city service: An integrated IoT, AI, and cloud technology perspective
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Review
AB  - Cities foster economic growth. However, growing cities also contribute to air pollution and climate change. The paper provides a perspective regarding the opportunity available in addressing the urban air quality management (UAQM) issues using smart city framework in the context of 'urban computing'. Traditionally, UAQM has been built on sparse regulatory monitoring, enhanced with satellite data and forecast models. The 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' (4IR) technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data, artificial intelligence, smartphones, social and cloud computing are reshaping urban conglomerates, worldwide. Cities can harness these ubiquitous technologies in concert with traditional methods for betterment of air quality governance and to improve quality of life. This paper discusses the role of urban computing in UAQM through a review of scientific publications and 'grey literature' from technical reports of governments, international organizations and institutional websites. It provides an interdisciplinary knowledge repository on urban computing applications for air quality functions. It highlights the potential of integrated technologies in enabling data driven, strategic and real-time mitigation governance actions and helping citizens to take informed decisions. It recommends 'fit for the purpose' multitechnology framework for UAQM services in emerging smart cities.

TI  - 'My choice, my responsibility': views of Danish and Israeli female students on financing egg-freezing
T2  - CULTURE HEALTH & SEXUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, egg freezing has evolved from being an experimental medical technology to become a commercial enterprise, accompanied by heated feminist debate. This study examined the views of Danish and Israeli female students regarding the financing of social egg freezing (SEF) (self, state, employer or family), and their correlation with country and feminist identity. A total of 569 female students (283 from Denmark and 286 from Israel) completed a questionnaire composed of closed and opened-ended questions on SEF financing under different circumstances (e.g. career advancement, lack of a partner, lack of money). The majority of female students in both countries supported SEF self-financing. They wanted to keep fertility choices in the private domain, in part by separating the bodies of women from the state and the employer. We conclude that SEF exemplifies a neoliberal and gendered responsibilisation of women's reproductive futurity, yet self-identification as a feminist was found to be correlated with stronger support for state financing. In contrast, we found no correlation between feminist identity and support for company-sponsored egg freezing. Our findings suggest a relationship between holding a feminist worldview and public policy preferences.

TI  - Learning from multimodal and multisensor earth observation dataset for improving estimates of mangrove soil organic carbon in Vietnam
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying mangrove soil organic carbon (SOC) is key to better understanding the global carbon cycle, a critical phenomenon in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is challenging to have a large sample size in soil carbon measurements and analysis due to the high costs associated with them. In the current research, we propose a novel hybridized artificial intelligence model based on the categorical boosting regression (CBR) and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm for feature selection, namely, the CBR-PSO model for estimating mangrove SOC. We integrated multisensor optical (Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2) remote sensing data to construct and verify the proposed model, drawing upon a survey in 85 soil cores at 100 cm depth in the Red River Delta, Vietnam. The CBR-PSO model estimated the mangrove SOC ranging from 44.74 to 91.92 Mg ha(-1) (average = 68.76 Mg ha(-1)) with satisfactory accuracy (coefficient of determination (R (2)) = 0.809 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 9.30 Mg ha(-1)). We also compared the proposed model's capability with four machine learning techniques, i.e. support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR), and XGBR-PSO models. We show that multimodal and multisensor earth observation dataset combined with the CBR-PSO model can significantly improve the estimates of mangrove SOC. Our findings contribute novel and advanced machine learning approaches for robustness of SOC estimation using open-source software. Our novel framework, which is automated, fast, and reliable, developed in this study can be easily applicable to other mangrove ecosystems across the world, thus providing insights for a voluntary blue carbon offset marketplace for sustainable mangrove conservation.

TI  - A remote sensing-based area dataset for approximately 40 years that reveals the hydrological asynchrony of Lake Chad based on Google Earth Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the second largest lake in Africa, the extent of Lake Chad has over 50% seasonal variations with large parts of water under aquatic vegetation. Although a great area shrinkage since the 1960s divided the lake into two parts, namely, the northern and southern basins, it still feeds millions of people from four countries around it. Given sparse in situ measurements, remote sensing with seamless spatial coverage has served for acquiring the long-term area series of Lake Chad. This study retrieves the open (unvegetated) surface water area series of Lake Chad and the total inundation area, including open water and water under macrophytes, combining multiple remote sensing data from around 1980 to 2020 with satellite-based water level and in situ observations at the Bol gauge as validation and auxiliary. Results show that the total inundation area continuously recovered at a rate of 145 km(2)/year from 1982 to 2020 with large annual fluctuations. Approximately two- to three-month time lags between the open surface water and the total inundation area reveal the hydrological asynchrony of Lake Chad, which can be attributed by the large area of rooted macrophytes. The overspill of the southern surface water flowing over the Great Barrier into the northern lake also has a one-month lag with the open surface water of the southern lake. The Google Earth Engine-based online application can be easily shared for use and data downloaded by the general public, and the open code can be adjusted for any other lakes worldwide.

TI  - Improving the estimation of alpine grassland fractional vegetation cover using optimized algorithms and multi-dimensional features
T2  - PLANT METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an important basic parameter for the quantitative monitoring of the alpine grassland ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) acquisition of measured data and matching it with satellite remote sensing images at the pixel scale, the proper selection of driving data and inversion algorithms can be determined and is crucial for generating high-precision alpine grassland FVC products. Methods This study presents estimations of alpine grassland FVC using optimized algorithms and multi-dimensional features. The multi-dimensional feature set (using original spectral bands, 22 vegetation indices, and topographical factors) was constructed from many sources of information, then the optimal feature subset was determined based on different feature selection algorithms as the driving data for optimized machine learning algorithms. Finally, the inversion accuracy, sensitivity to sample size, and computational efficiency of the four machine learning algorithms were evaluated. Results (1) The random forest (RF) algorithm (R-2: 0.861, RMSE: 9.5%) performed the best for FVC inversion among the four machine learning algorithms driven by the four typical vegetation indices. (2) Compared with the four typical vegetation indices, using multi-dimensional feature sets as driving data obviously improved the FVC inversion accuracy of the four machine learning algorithms (R-2 of the RF algorithm increased to 0.890). (3) Among the three variable selection algorithms (Boruta, sequential forward selection [SFS], and permutation importance-recursive feature elimination [PI-RFE]), the constructed PI-RFE feature selection algorithm had the best dimensionality reduction effect on the multi-dimensional feature set. (4) The hyper-parameter optimization of the machine learning algorithms and feature selection of the multi-dimensional feature set further improved FVC inversion accuracy (R-2: 0.917 and RMSE: 7.9% in the optimized RF algorithm). Conclusion This study provides a highly precise, optimized algorithm with an optimal multi-dimensional feature set for FVC inversion, which is vital for the quantitative monitoring of the ecological environment of alpine grassland.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan regions are vulnerable to all kinds of natural hazards. On 7 February 2021, a deadly disaster occurred near the Tapovan, in Uttarakhand, Himalayas. During the event, large volume of debris along with broken glacial fragments flooded the Rishi Ganga River and washed away the nearby hydropower plants (Rishi Ganga and Tapovan), which was revealed from detailed analysis of multi spectral and bi-temporal satellite data. We present the impact of the Chamoli disaster on the flood plains and water quality of Himalayan rivers, Rishi Ganga near Tapovan, Alaknanda near Srinagar and Ganga near Haridwar and Bijnor. We used four locations along four sections of Himalayan rivers and have analysed various indices, modified normalized difference water index, normalized difference chlorophyll index, and normalized difference turbidity index, to study the changes in water quality and flood plains. On comparison of the spectral and backscattering coefficients derived from Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data, changes in the water quality and flood plains of the rivers were found.

TI  - <i>CanopyShotNoise</i> - An individual-based tree canopy modelling framework for projecting remote-sensing data and ecological sensitivity analysis
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Very few spatially explicit tree models have so far been constructed with a view to project remote-sensing data directly. To fill this gap, we introduced the prototype of the CanopyShotNoise model, an individual-based model specifically designed for projecting airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Given the nature of ALS data, the model focuses on the dynamics of individual-tree canopies in forest ecosystems, that is, spatial tree interaction and resulting growth, birth and death processes. In this study, CanopyShotNoise was used to analyse the long-term effects of the processes crown plasticity (C) and superorganism formation (S) on spatial tree canopy patterns that are likely to play an important role in ongoing climate change. We designed a replicated computer experiment involving the four scenarios C0S0, C1S0, C0S1 and C1S1 where 0 and 1 imply that the preceding process was switched off and on, respectively. We hypothesized that C and S are antagonistic processes, specifically that C would lead to increasing regularity of tree locations and S would result in clustering. Our simulation results confirmed that in the long run intertree distances decreased and canopy gap size increased when superorganisms were encouraged to form. At the same time, the overlap and packing of tree crowns increased. The long-term effect of crown plasticity increased the regularity of tree locations; however, this effect was much weaker than that of superorganism formation. As a result, gap patterns remained more or less unaffected by crown plasticity. In scenario C1S1, both processes interestingly interacted in such a way that crown plasticity even increased the effect of superorganism formation. Our simulation results are likely to prove helpful in recognizing patterns of facilitation with ongoing climate change.

TI  - Assessment of ecosystem resilience in Central Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has a profound impact on ecosystem stability. Recent studies still have insufficient understanding of the response of vegetation to climate change, especially the response of vegetation to short-term climate anomalies. Based on normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the meteorological data, this study conducted a quantitative assessment of the ecosystem resilience and resistance and analyzed the relationship between resistance, resilience and land cover. Furthermore, a new method was developed to identify ecologically fragile regions. The result showed that the resilience and resistance of the Central Asia ecosystem to short-term climate change are generally low. The relationship between resistance, resilience and vegetation cover was nonlinear. If there were too many or too few trees, the stability of the ecosystem was compromised. Ecologically fragile areas were found in transition areas from vegetation to non-vegetation. This study helps to better un-derstand and quantify vegetation resilience and resistance while explicitly taking short-term climate anomalies into account. The results provide more detailed guidelines for strengthening ecosystem management.

TI  - Assessing temporal dynamics on pelagic <i>Sargassum</i> influx and its relationship with water quality parameters in the Mexican Caribbean
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since 2011, massive inflows of pelagic Sargassum have been recorded in the Caribbean region, which has affected coastal ecosystems, mainly water quality and the flora and fauna that inhabit these areas. The aim of this study is to evaluate the temporal dynamics of Sargassum arrival and its relationship on water quality in three sites of the Mexican Caribbean (Mahahual, Xahuayxol and Xcalak). We used remote sensing tools to estimate Sargassum coverage and turbidity to know if these parameters vary throughout the year and are related. We measured in situ water quality parameters to identify variations, depending on the Sargassum quantity and leachate concentration. Our results of 26 Landsat 8-OLI images show higher Sargassum coverage and turbidity during the winter months and a high relationship between Sargassum coverage and turbidity in areas near the coast. Additionally, turbidity calculated from multispectral bands complemented satellite detection of Sargassum, as high turbidity values were identified in near-shore areas where satellite images could not detect the alga. Finally, water quality parameters showed an increase in ammonium concentration and decreased pH and oxygen levels in the areas with higher Sargassum accumulation and leachate concentration. This study provides a better understanding about temporal dynamics of Sargassum influx in the southern Mexican Caribbean and its relationship with water turbidity in order to develop strategies, management plans and harvesting policies that could prevent huge masses of Sargassum reaching the coast.

TI  - Estimating water balance components and their uncertainty bounds in highly groundwater-dependent and data-scarce area: An example for the Upper Citarum basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: Upper region of the Citarum basin in Indonesia.Study focus: Assessing water balance components in data-scarce regions using different ap-proaches could result in different outcomes. In the upper reaches of the Citarum River in West Java, Indonesia, for example, many previous studies found the groundwater storage to be depleting, while GRACE identifies a contrasting trend of increasing groundwater storage change. Therefore, in this study, we aim to improve the accuracy of water balance components estimates in the Upper Citarum basin. Firstly, we estimate groundwater abstraction volumes based on population size and a review of literature. Estimates of the other water balance components, namely the rainfall, actual evaporation, discharge, and groundwater storage change are derived from various global datasets and available measurements. We also use a distributed hydrological model, wflow_sbm, to yield additional estimates of discharge and actual evaporation. We compare each basin water balance estimate and quantify the uncertainty of some components using the Extended Triple Collocation (ETC) method.New hydrological insights for the region: ETC application on four different rainfall estimates suggests a preference of using CHIRPS product in the study area as it delivers r(2) of 0.56 and RMSE of 6.52 mm/day, compared to estimates from rainfall station (r(2) = 0.39, RMSE = 8.57 mm/day), SACA&D (r(2) = 0.29, RMSE = 10.46 mm/day), and TRMM (r(2) = 0.56, RMSE = 8.61 mm/day). With CHIRPS rainfall forcing, wflow_sbm model estimates of average daily actual evaporation and discharge are obtained. The results for actual evaporation (2.67 mm/day) are plausible with a narrow difference of less than 0.50 mm/day among other estimates. The simulated discharge results in a daily average of 5.38 mm/day, estimated between observation data (3.65 mm/day) and GloFAS-ERA5 product (6.12 mm/day). Combining precipitation, actual evaporation, and discharge with a groundwater abstraction estimate of 0.57 mm/day, the wflow_sbm-based groundwater storage change is estimated at a daily storage depletion of 0.82 mm/day. Using GLEAM actual evaporation estimates (3.13 mm/day) and observed daily discharge, on the other hand, results in surplus water of 0.45 mm/day for groundwater storage change. These results demonstrate the high uncertainty in capturing subsurface hydrological processes, although the groundwater storage change estimates are found close to the estimates based upon GRACE gravimetric satellite data of 0.25 mm/day, with a variance of 1.57 mm/day. To aid in estimating current and future basin-scale groundwater level changes to support operational water management and policy in the Citarum basin, considering the massive groundwater abstraction, a focus on subsurface hydrological components quantification is of great importance for future research.

TI  - Validation of Landsat-8 satellite-derived radiative energy fluxes using wireless sensor network data over Beas River basin, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present paper, spatio-temporal variability in surface radiative energy fluxes has been estimated for snow/ice-covered Beas River basin, lower Western Himalaya, India using remote sensing technology and evaluated with wireless sensor network (WSN) collected data at various elevation levels. Surface energy fluxes are derived using Landsat-8 satellite images and digital elevation model (DEM) at fine spatial resolution (similar to 30-m) during clear-sky days of the year 2016-2017. RMSE have been estimated in incoming shortwave, incoming longwave, outgoing longwave, net shortwave and net radiation flux and observed to be similar to 5%, similar to 6.3%, similar to 2.4%, similar to 18.9%, and similar to 28.3% of the respective mean values. Landsat-8 images in conjunction with DEM have shown the potential to retrieve variability in surface radiative energy fluxes at fine resolution in mountain terrain. Additionally, temporal variability in radiative radiation fluxes have also been explored on different elevation ranges and aspects slopes. The high energy fluxes have been estimated on southern slopes during analysis as compared to northern slopes in the present study. The paper appears to be the first for reporting net radiation flux for Himalayan snow cover at 30-m spatial resolution. The satellite-derived energy fluxes may be valuable in various applications associated with climatology, hydrology, wet-snow avalanche detection, land use land cover, mass balance, ecology, etc., especially in the absence of in situ data.

TI  - An unsupervised domain adaptation approach for change detection and its application to deforestation mapping in tropical biomes
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in environmental conditions, geographical variability and different sensor properties typically make it almost impossible to employ previously trained classifiers for new data without a significant drop in classification accuracy. Domain adaptation (DA) techniques been proven useful to alleviate that problem. In particular, appearance adaptation techniques may be used to adapt images from a specific dataset in such a way that the generated images have a style that is similar to the images from another dataset. Such techniques are, however, prone to creating artifacts that hinder proper classification of the adapted images. In this work we propose an unsupervised DA approach for change detection tasks, which is based on a particular appearance adaptation method: the Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN). Specifically, we extend that method by introducing additional constraints in the training phase of the model components, which make it preserve the semantic structure and class transitions in the adapted images. We evaluate the proposed approach on a deforestation detection application, considering different sites in the Amazon rain-forest and in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna) using Landsat-8 images. In the experiments, each site corresponds to a domain, and the accuracy of a classifier trained with images and references from one (source) domain is measured in the classification of another (target) domain. The results show that the proposed approach is successful in producing artifact-free adapted images, which can be satisfactory classified by the pre-trained source classifiers. On average, the accuracies achieved in the classification of the adapted images outperformed the baselines (when no adaptation was made) by 7.1% in terms of mean average precision, and 9.1% in terms of F1-Score. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the first unsupervised domain adaptation approach devised for change detection.

TI  - Regression in melanoma is significantly associated with a lower regional recurrence rate and better recurrence-free survival
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives The prognostic significance of regression in predicting melanoma recurrences is unknown. We present a large multicenter study correlating regression with recurrence. Methods The Sentinel Lymph Node Working Group database was queried from 1993 to 2018 for cases with regression data. Clinicopathologic factors were correlated with overall and first-site of recurrence and with recurrence-free survival (RFS). Results There were 4790 patients and the median follow-up was 39.6 months. Regression and recurrences were seen in 1081 (22.6%) and 773 (16.1%) cases, respectively. First-site locoregional and distant recurrences were seen in 412 (8.6%) and 352 (7.3%) patients, respectively. Regression was seen in 15.8% and 24.7% of all cases with and without recurrences (p < 0.0001), respectively, while regression was seen in 14.3% and 17.9% of first-site locoregional and distant recurrent cases, respectively, compared with 23.3% and 22.9% of patients with regression and without first-site locoregional and distant recurrences, respectively (p = 0.29). On multivariable analysis, after controlling for age, gender, thickness, ulceration, lymphovascular invasion, and sentinel lymph node status, regression significantly predicted improved RFS (p = 0.004) and fewer first-site regional recurrences (p = 0.017). Conclusion Our data suggest that regression is a favorable prognostic marker in melanoma and predicts significantly better RFS and decreased first-site regional recurrences.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring surface water bodies accurately is one of the most crucial applications of remote sensing. It is a global challenge in the times of climate change, since surface water is the most important component of the hydrological cycle. Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) method based on spectral index is calculated from the Green and Shortwave-Infrared (SWIR) bands, for monitoring surface water. This index helps to map surface water accurately based on the threshold using Otsu method for achieving higher level of accuracy. Earth observing satellite by ESA, Sentinel-2 provides multispectral images at a fine spatial and spectral resolution. This dataset has high potentiality for significantly mapping regional surface water, due to its frequent revisiting capabilities and spectral capabilities. Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform can be used for processing the huge datasets easily in the most efficient way for fast computation, storing and displaying the huge datasets. A pilot study has been carried out in Northwest part of India to demonstrate the effectiveness of mapping mean surface water for the temporal window June 2016 to March 2020 from Sentinel-2 using GEE so as to understand the patterns of surface water inundation at a regional scale.

TI  - Assessing the potential of using high spatial resolution daily NDVI-time-series from planet CubeSat images for crop monitoring
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The agricultural land use combined with agronomic management practices shall be structured on sustainable practices, guaranteeing both the maximization of productivity and environment preservation. NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) time-series has been recognized as a useful methodology to monitor crop development and its spatial distribution. However, there is always a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions in satellite data. Hence, high spatial and temporal resolutions from Planet CubeSat represent a possibility to overcome this trade-off. This paper investigated the potential of using high spatial resolution daily NDVI-time-series from Planet CubeSat images for crop monitoring. One hundred nineteen images from 2017, at 3 m ground sampling distance, over cotton, spring corn and winter wheat fields, were acquired and converted into NDVI. The harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm was applied to obtain a smoothed cloud and gap-free daily time-series. The 3 m daily time-series were resized to daily 9 and 30 m resolution; and resampled to temporal resolutions at 4, 8 and 16 days intervals to assess the impact of spatial and temporal resolution on NDVI time-series. NDVI time-series were evaluated by their minimum, maximum, average and coefficient of variation across the year. Principal component analysis (PCA) and the stepwise procedure were applied to assess optimum features (days across the year) to assist the NDVI-time-series interpretation. PCA and stepwise highlighted the best time across the year for NDVI-time-series interpretation. As the spatial resolution decreases, the range of NDVI and its standard deviation within field also decreases, leading to loss of within field spectral variability. At daily temporal resolution, slight differences in crop development can be detected in a very short time interval, but as the temporal resolution decreases the changes in crop development are detected at larger rates. The high temporal and spatial resolutions from Planet CubeSat images demonstrated great potential to monitor agricultural systems and can subsidize, on forthcoming research, the local and regional monitoring of agricultural areas and contribute to better management regarding strategic planning of governmental and corporate decision making over technical issues.

TI  - Estimating canopy cover in artificial forests using high spatial resolution GF-1 and ZY-3 images: across-sensor and across-site comparison
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy cover is an important parameter in forest ecosystems and has diverse applications in a wide variety of fields. However, estimation of forest canopy cover from high spatial resolution images is an arduous task. To evaluate the utility of high spatial resolution images for estimation of canopy cover of artificial forests, the performance of canopy cover estimation models across sensors and across sites was evaluated. Choosing Wangyedian Forest Farm and Gaofeng Forest Farm as experimental areas, based on Chinese high spatial resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite images, three models, namely multiple linear regression (MLR), generalized additive model (GAM), and Random Forest (RF) were established. The capabilities of the two data sources and three model types to estimate canopy cover of the forests were compared and the portability of the three models across sensors and sites was analysed. The ranges of the root mean square error (RMSE) and relative root mean square error (rRMSE) of the MLR, GAM, and RF models for each study area established from GF-1 and ZY-3 were 0.0632-0.1205 and 9.98-19.93%, respectively. GF-1 showed better performance than ZY-3 when using the same model type. Whether the objective was across sensors or across sites transplantation, the accuracy of the model decreased with transplantation of the model. The MLR model was non-significant when transplanted across sites and model migration failed, whereas across sensors and across sites transplantation of RF and GAM models was successful. The three evaluation indices of transplanted GAM models were significantly superior to those of transplanted RF and MLR models. Thus, the GAM model showed strong portability and the highest model stability.

TI  - The influence of training data variability on a supervised machine learning classifier for Structure from Motion (SfM) point clouds of rock slopes
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Supervised Machine Learning (ML) can be used to automatically interpret remote sensing data in engineering geology, with applications for rockfall and landslide characterization. However, supervised algorithms typically require very large training databases from which to learn predictive relationships, and there is little guidance on how to construct such a database in an earth science context with high temporal and spatial heterogeneity. This study builds a supervised classifier to perform basic rock slope characterization on Structure from Motion (SfM) point clouds collected under a variety of conditions. Eight datasets were collected in Colorado and Utah, USA, with multiple different sensor platforms (terrestrial and aerial), rock types, seasons, and lighting conditions, and each dataset was manually labeled to identify regions of vegetation, rock, soil, talus, and snow. A total of 2560 Random Forest models were built with different combinations of training datasets and combinations of geometric and color features. Most models were able to identify vegetation and rock with high accuracy (median F scores of 86% and 68% respectively), but performance for soil, talus, and snow was overall much poorer, and the median overall accuracy of generalized classifiers was 60%. Many characteristics of the training data were found to have significant effects on generalization accuracy, indicating that training datasets must be curated to be applicable to specific data collection parameters, seasons, lighting conditions, and geological settings. We conclude that high accuracy generalized results can be obtained, but the ML model must be carefully constructed, and its limitations acknowledged.

TI  - Seamless downscaling of the ESA CCI soil moisture data at the daily scale with MODIS land products
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial downscaling has recently become a crucial process in the regional application of coarse-resolution passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) products. Extensive gaps in auxiliary optical/thermal infrared observation data (mainly caused by cloud cover) and gaps in coarse-resolution passive microwave SSM data lead to spatiotemporal discontinuity in downscaled SSM maps, thereby limiting their applications. An improved downscaling method for the 25-km European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SSM product was proposed to obtain daily seamless downscaled SSM series at a 1-km scale. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra daily land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products were used as auxiliary data for the downscaling process. Prior to the spatial downscaling, an annual temperature cycle model was applied to the 1-km daily daytime LST data to fill the data gaps caused by cloud cover and to derive the spatial-seamless LST (gap-filled). Subsequently, the gap-filled ESA CCI SSM was generated at the original resolution based on the relationships among the SSM, LST, and NDVI. Finally, these were utilized to obtain a seamless downscaled series SSM at 1-km spatial resolution with a value-consistent downscaling method. The proposed method was applied to data obtained for the Iberian Peninsula from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. Based on the comparison with the precipitation dataset, the downscaled SSM exhibited strong temporal correlation with rainfall events. Evaluation using the in situ SSM from the REMEDHUS network highlighted the good performance of the downscaled SSM at network level with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.820. The root-mean-square-error, unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE), and bias were 0.091, 0.033, and 0.085 m(3)/m(3), respectively. A comparison with an alternative downscaled SSM product produced by the Barcelona Expert Center, one of the soil moisture and ocean salinity mission (SMOS)-downscaled SSM datasets, also indicated that the downscaled SSM has better spatiotemporal coverage and performance in terms of R and ubRMSE with reference to the REMEDHUS network. These results confirmed that the proposed method is an efficient and convenient downscaling process that can be used to generate high-resolution SSM data without spatiotemporal gaps. The downscaled SSM data improves the accuracy of the original passive microwave SSM product in describing regional SSM variations and shows good potential for related applications at regional scale.

TI  - Soft system methodology for maintenance and treatment budgeting for public-rented flats
T2  - FACILITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Public-rented flats in Jakarta Province operated by the Management Unit of Public-Rented Flats (MUPRF) experienced budget cuts for the maintenance and treatment activities during the COVID-19 pandemic that hit Indonesia in the early 2020. Currently, the budgeting scheme of the MUPRF uses the local government's budget in determining the expenditures of public-rented flat. This papers aims to propose an alternative budgeting scheme for the MUPRF. Design/methodology/approach Soft system methodology (SSM) was adopted to understand the public-rented flats as a whole system, so an alternative budgeting scheme for the MUPRF can be identified and developed. Interviews with an employee of the Department of Community Housing and Settlement of Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta Province were conducted. A rich picture, customer, action, transformation, worldview, owner and environment analyses, conceptual model and a proposed model were developed during the process. Findings Based on the SSM, it is found that becoming a local public service agency, the MUPRF can be more independent and flexible in managing their budget. The income generated by the public-rented flats can be used directly for their expenditure. Research limitations/implications Through the SSM, only a conceptual model is developed, which has not yet been implemented in practice. Future studies need to be carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the conceptual model. Originality/value This research analyses the public-rented flat as a whole system through SSM to identify factors and parties that are involved in the daily activities in public-rented flats to propose a suitable alternative for its budgeting scheme.

TI  - Long term displacement observation of the Ataturk Dam, Turkey by multi-temporal InSAR analysis
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring large infrastructures is vital for determining structural safety over time. Dams are structures that influence agricultural activities and have high economic contributions. The dams' structural safety was mainly addressed using conventional measurement techniques. However, these might not be time-efficient and practical, considering the large surfaces of dams. This paper presents a long-term InSAR analysis of the Ataturk Dam, Turkey's largest and one of the five biggest dams in Europe using ERS, ENVISAT, and Sentinel-1 satellites images. Since only Sentinel-1 data have acquisitions in ascending and descending orbits, we could estimate surface movements also in the vertical and east-west directions using both lines of sight (LOS) displacements. The results showed that the east-west movement is higher than vertical movement. As a result, we observe a maximum of 10 mm/yr displacement in the LOS direction at the dam's crest for period of 2003 and 2010, decreasing down the slope.

TI  - Snow Cover and Snow Persistence Changes in the Mocho-Choshuenco Volcano (Southern Chile) Derived From 35 Years of Landsat Satellite Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain regions have experienced above-average warming in the 20th century and this trend is likely to continue. These accelerated temperature changes in alpine areas are causing reduced snowfall and changes in the timing of snowfall and melt. Snow is a critical component of alpine areas - it drives hibernation of animals, determines the length of the growing season for plants and the soil microbial composition. Thus, changes in snow patterns in mountain areas can have serious ecological consequences. Here we use 35 years of Landsat satellite images to study snow changes in the Mocho-Choshuenco Volcano in the Southern Andes of Chile. Landsat images have 30 m pixel resolution and a revisit period of 16 days. We calculated the total snow area in cloud-free Landsat scenes and the snow frequency per pixel, here called "snow persistence" for different periods and seasons. Permanent snow cover in summer was stable over a period of 30 years and decreased below 20 km(2) from 2014 onward at middle elevations (1,530-2,000 m a.s.l.). This is confirmed by negative changes in snow persistence detected at the pixel level, concentrated in this altitudinal belt in summer and also in autumn. In winter and spring, negative changes in snow persistence are concentrated at lower elevations (1,200-1,530 m a.s.l.). Considering the snow persistence of the 1984-1990 period as a reference, the last period (2015-2019) is experiencing a -5.75 km(2) reduction of permanent snow area (snow persistence > 95%) in summer, -8.75 km(2) in autumn, -42.40 km(2) in winter, and -18.23 km(2) in spring. While permanent snow at the high elevational belt (>2,000 m a.s.l.) has not changed through the years, snow that used to be permanent in the middle elevational belt has become seasonal. In this study, we use a probabilistic snow persistence approach for identifying areas of snow reduction and potential changes in alpine vegetation. This approach permits a more efficient use of remote sensing data, increasing by three times the amount of usable scenes by including images with spatial gaps. Furthermore, we explore some ecological questions regarding alpine ecosystems that this method may help address in a global warming scenario.

TI  - Migration of the localization wire to the back in patient with nonpalpable breast carcinoma: A case report
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUNDDue to the increasing number of diagnosed nonpalpable breast cancer cases, wire localization has been commonly performed for surgical guidance to remove nonpalpable breast lesions. This report presents a rare case of localized wire migration to a subcutaneous lesion of the upper back in a breast cancer patient undergoing breast-conserving surgery.CASE SUMMARYA 48-year-old female was scheduled for breast-conserving surgery for left breast cancer. Ultrasonography guided wire localization was performed intraoperatively by surgeon to localize the nonpalpable breast cancer. After axilla sentinel lymph node biopsy, we realized that the wire was not visualized. The wire was not found in the operation field, including the breast and axilla. Breast-conserving surgery was performed after wire re- localization. Intraoperative chest posteroanterior view revealed that the wire was located on the level of midaxillary line. Two days after the operation, a serial simple X-ray revealed that the wire was located on the subcutaneous lesion of the back. The wire tip was palpable under the skin of the upper back, and the wire was removed under local anesthesia.CONCLUSIONHooked wire misplacement can lead to fatal complications. Surgeons must consider the possibility of wire migration during breast cancer surgery.

TI  - Detection of tunnel defects in friction stir welded aluminum alloy joints based on the in-situ force signal
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The demand for high quality and effective manufacturing has raised the need for defect identification in friction stir welding. This work aims to identify the tunnel defect inside the welded joint based on the feature of in-situ force signals. First, we measured the traverse force (Fx), lateral force (Fy) and plunge force (Fz) during the welding process and analyzed the variation characteristic of the force signals for the joints with and without tunnel defect. Then, fast Fourier transform was utilized to obtain the frequency components of the force signal for analyzing the cause of the waveform distortion of the welding force, which showed a direct relationship with the occurrence of the tunnel defect in the joint. The combination result of the frequency components indicated that the waveform distortion of Fx and Fy for the defective joint was mainly influenced by the first harmonic and third harmonic. Thus, a defect detection indicator was proposed by calculating the normalization ratio of the amplitudes of the third harmonic and first harmonic. Tshe best accuracy of the indicator from Fx for identifying the tunnel defect reached 96.42%. Furthermore, the simulation results of the FSW process provide a physical understanding of material flow and defect formation indicated by the first harmonic and third harmonic of Fx, which helps explain the high accuracy of the proposed indicator from Fx signal in the detection of tunnel defect.

TI  - Prediction of an Imminent Fracture After an Index Fracture - Models Derived From the Frisbee Cohort
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND MINERAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Patients who sustain a fracture are at greatest risk of recurrent fracture during the next 2 years. We propose three models to identify subjects most at risk of an imminent fracture, according to fracture site (any fracture, major osteoporotic fracture [MOF] or central). They were constructed using data of the prospective Frisbee cohort, which includes 3560 postmenopausal women aged 60 to 85 years who were followed for at least 5 years. A total of 881 subjects had a first incident validated fragility fracture before December 2018. Among these, we validated 130 imminent fractures occurring within the next 2 years; 79 were MOFs, and 88 were central fractures. Clinical risk factors were re-evaluated at the time of the index fracture. Fine and Gray proportional hazard models were derived separately for each group of fractures. The following risk factors were significantly associated with the risk of any imminent fracture: total hip bone mineral density (BMD) (p < 0.001), a fall history (p < 0.001), and comorbidities (p = 0.03). Age (p = 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively) and a central fracture as the index fracture (p = 0.04 and p = 0.005, respectively) were additional predictors of MOFs and central fractures. The three prediction models are presented as nomograms. The calibration curves and the Brier scores based on bootstrap resampling showed calibration scores of 0.089 for MOF, 0.094 for central fractures, and 0.132 for any fractures. The predictive accuracy of the models expressed as area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve (AUC) were 0.74 for central fractures, 0.72 for MOFs, and 0.66 for all fractures, respectively. These AUCs compare well with those of FRAX and Garvan to predict the 5- or 10-year fracture probability. In summary, five predictors (BMD, age, comorbidities, falls, and central fracture as the incident fracture) allow the calculation with a reasonable accuracy of the imminent risk of fracture at different sites (MOF, central fracture, and any fracture) after a recent sentinel fracture.

TI  - Genotoxicity, oxidative stress and lysozyme induction in <i>Clarias gariepinus</i> chronically exposed to water-soluble fraction of burnt tire ash
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The safety of aquatic ecosystems has been compromised by numerous anthropogenic activities, especially leachates from non-point source toxicants, leaching into aquatic systems. This study evaluated the toxicity of the water-soluble fractions (WSFs) of burnt tire ash (BTA) on Clarias gariepinus via a battery of integrated biomarkers. Juvenile C. gariepinus were exposed to sublethal (0.56, 1.12, and 2.24 g/L) concentrations of BTA, derived from 11.2 g/L median lethal concentration (96 LC50), at duration intervals of 1, 14, and 28 days, followed by a recovery trial that lasted for 14 days. Serum biochemical parameters, antioxidant enzyme activities of the gill and liver, lysozymes activity and erythron profile were assessed. The findings of the present study revealed that BTA-WSF induced prominent alterations on biochemical parameters, lysozymes activity and antioxidant enzymes activities in the exposed fish. Furthermore, toxicant exposure promoted oxidative stress, cellular damage and genotoxicity (erythrocytic nuclear and cellular abnormalities) in the exposed fish. In general, a post-exposure trial showed partial recovery from the exposure effects of the toxicant, following the evident modifications of serum enzymes and erythron pathopathology in the experimental model. Biomonitoring of BTA, using sentinel aquatic species such as C. gariepinus, provides insights into the ecotoxicological potency of this toxicant.

TI  - COVID-19 Induced Fingerprints of a New Normal Urban Air Quality in the United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Most countries around the world, including the United States, took actions to control COVID-19 spread that led to an abrupt shift in human activity. On-road NOx emissions from light and heavy-duty vehicles decreased by 9%-19% between February and March at the onset of the lockdown period in the middle of March in most of the US; between March and April, the on-road NOx emissions dropped further by 8%-31% when lockdown measures were most stringent. These precipitous drops in NOx emissions correlated well (r = 0.75) with tropospheric NO2 column amount observed by the Sentinel 5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P TROPOMI). Furthermore, the changes in TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 column amount across continental US between 2020 and 2019 correlated well with the changes in on-road NOx emissions (r = 0.68) but correlated weakly with changes in emissions from the power plants (r = 0.35). At the height of lockdown-related unemployment in the second quarter of 2020, the tropospheric NO2 column values decreased at the rate of 0.8 mu moles/m(2) per unit percentage increase in the unemployment rate. Despite the lifting of lockdown measures, parts of the US continued to have similar to 20% below normal on-road NOx emissions. To achieve this new normal urban air quality in the US, continuing remote work policies that do not impede economic growth may become one of the many options.

TI  - Phenomenology and Intercultural Questioning A Case of Chinese Philosophy
T2  - COMPARATIVE AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many recent works on the methodology of intercultural philosophy point to a fundamental dilemma of the discipline: if there is a common ground for intercultural understanding, then the essence of this ground is universal instead of multi-cultural; if there are irreducible and incommunicable factors in different cultures, then complete understanding seems to be impossible. In this paper, I propose that this dilemma is founded on the assumption that intercultural philosophy is equivalent to intercultural understanding. I argue that, however, intercultural philosophy should begin with questioning. Instead of understanding another culture using one's own conceptual scheme, intercultural questioning puts one's conceptual scheme and traditional worldview into question. The new questions obtained by phenomenologically reducing traditional thought will become a ground for intercultural dialogue without reducing one's culture to another culture. Finally, I will use a case in Chinese philosophy to demonstrate the process of intercultural questioning.

TI  - Effects of the Assimilation of Relative Humidity Reproduced From T-PARCII and Himawari-8 Satellite Imagery Using Dynamical Initialization and Ocean-Coupled Model: A Case Study of Typhoon Lan (2017)
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Effects of the assimilation of relative humidity (RH) reproduced from dropsonde data from the Tropical cyclones-Pacific Asian Research Campaign for Improvement of Intensity estimations/forecasts (T-PARCII) campaign and Himawari-8 satellite data on the simulation of Typhoon Lan (2017) were investigated herein using a weather research and forecasting model. The lateral boundary and initial conditions were obtained from Global Forecast System (GFS) forecast data. Four experiments varying from the initial vortex, assimilation of the reproduced RH (ARH), and ocean model (OCEAN, three-dimensional Price-Weller-Pinkel upper-ocean circulation model) activation were conducted for 42 h to evaluate tropical cyclone (TC) forecast performance: the GFS experiment and dynamical initialization (DI) experiments such as DI, DI-OCEAN, and DI-ARH-OCEAN, respectively. All track forecast errors were less than 100 km until landfall, that is, up to 36 h. TC intensity forecasts such as the minimum sea-level pressure and maximum surface wind speed were slightly improved in DI-related experiments compared to the GFS experiment. The DI-ARH-OCEAN experiment, in particular, demonstrated improvements in both TC forecasts and convective areas. The ocean-coupled experiments yielded significant sea surface temperature cooling in the rear-right quadrant of TC, forming a stable boundary layer that could suppress the convective activity, particularly in the lower troposphere. These findings support that compared to the original DI method, ARH could improve initial conditions, resulting in more accurate TC forecasts. Furthermore, it may argue the necessity and urgency of regular aircraft surveillance of TCs in the western North Pacific area.

TI  - Dynamic monitoring of surface water in the Tibetan Plateau from 1980s to 2019 based on satellite remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau is known as the "Asian water tower", and changes in its surface water distribution are important indicators of global climate change and the regional response to these changes. Dynamic monitoring of the surface water on the Tibetan Plateau is an important part of the research on the functions of the "third pole" of the earth and the Asian water tower. With the support of the Google Earth Engine cloud platform, this study used a spectral index-based fast extraction method to obtain surface water data from multi-temporal Landsat (Landsat 4, 5, and 8) satellite remote sensing images. Based on the extracted surface water data, we analyzed the spatiotemporal variations in the surface water of the Tibetan Plateau from 1980s to 2019. In this study, surface water area refers to the maximum coverage area of the surface water extracted from remote sensing images for one year, hereafter referred to as the surface water area. The results show that since 1980s, the overall surface water area of the Tibetan Plateau has increased, but not in a linear fashion. After a slight decrease from 1980s to 1995, the surface water area of the Tibetan Plateau increased steadily, except for a slight decrease in 2015, which may have been caused by the El Nino phenomenon. In terms of spatiotemporal distribution, different patterns exist in the various ecological regions of the Tibetan Plateau. The Inner ecological region had the greatest changes of surface water area among the ten ecological regions, accounting for 71.0% of the total surface water area increase from 1980s to 2019. The surface water bodies in the cold desert and the dry-winter subtropical climatic regions underwent the most changes, with their coefficients of variation being more than 20%. This study can provide data support for dynamic monitoring of surface water in the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Characteristics of Global Ocean Abnormal Mesoscale Eddies Derived From the Fusion of Sea Surface Height and Temperature Data by Deep Learning
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent satellite sea surface height (SSH) and sea surface temperature (SST) observations have shown that abnormal eddies, that is, warm cyclonic eddies and cold anticyclonic eddies occur sporadically in some regions, which triggers an essential question on the spatiotemporal distribution of abnormal eddies in the global ocean. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed to systematically mine information from the synergy of satellite-sensed global SSH and SST data over the 1996-2015, 20-year period. Abnormal eddies account for a surprising one-third of total eddies and are active along the Equatorial Current and high unstable currents. Normal (abnormal) eddies are stronger in winter (summer) in the North Hemisphere and vice versa in the Southern Hemisphere. The annual mean amplitudes of normal eddies are larger than that of abnormal eddies. Crucially, the daily number of normal (abnormal) eddies increased (decreased) 9.68 (11.80) every year.

TI  - Liquid Containing Clouds at the North Slope of Alaska Demonstrate Sensitivity to Local Industrial Aerosol Emissions
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud condensation nucleus control alter cloud solar albedo through cloud droplet size. Here, we leverage anthropogenic emissions at the North Slope of Alaska as a natural laboratory to study relationships between aerosols and Arctic liquid-containing clouds. Averaging 14 years of MODIS observations, we found a reduction in temporally averaged cloud effective radius (re) of up to 1.0 mu m related to localized pollution. Pronounced regional gradients in cloud frequency of occurrence and liquid water path prohibit the detection of potential changes of these variables. Observed changes of re alter radiative fluxes and increase cloud-reflected shortwave radiation by up to 0.8 W m(-)(2) in the Prudhoe Bay area for the period covered by observations (April-September). Due to the frequent occurrence of liquid-containing clouds, this implies that enhanced local emissions in Arctic regions can impact climate processes.

TI  - First Observations of a Transient Polynya in the Last Ice Area North of Ellesmere Island
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The area to the north of Ellesmere Island and Greenland contains the Arctic's thickest ice and it is predicted to be the last to lose its perennial ice, thus providing an important refuge for ice-dependent species. There is however evidence that this Last Ice Area is, like the entire Arctic, undergoing rapid changes that may reduce its suitability as a refuge. During May 2020, a polynya developed to the north of Ellesmere Island in a region where there are no reports of a previous development. We use a variety of remotely sensed data as well as an atmospheric reanalysis to document the evolution and the dynamics responsible for the polynya. In particular, we argue that anomalously strong divergent winds associated with an intense and long-lived Arctic anti-cyclone contributed to the development of the polynya as well as similar previously unreported events in May 1988 and 2004.

TI  - Twenty-first century hydrologic and climatic changes over the scarcely gauged Jhelum river basin of Himalayan region using SDSM and RCPs
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climatic and hydrological changes of the scarcely gauged mountainous basins remain a challenge to study due to unavailability of observed data. The recent study aims to assess these changes using spatial decision tool statistical downscaling method (SDSM) and snowmelt runoff model (SRM) for the twenty-first century under representative concentration pathways (RCPs). SDSM considered absolute partial correlation coefficient (abs. Pr.) to evaluate efficiency predictors or the predictands of the Jhelum river basin. The performance evaluation of SDSM assessed using coefficient of determination (R-2) values for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 under CMIP5 (CCSM4). The biases of the daily time series downscaled data removed by using mean-based biased correction method (MB-BC). Stream projection carried out using SRM by incorporating MODIS snow product. Statistical parameters R-2 and volume difference (Dv %) calculated for accuracy assessment of SRM for the simulated and observed discharge (2001-2018). Streamflow projections for the twenty-first century carried out by SRM using de-biased downscaled data. The R-2 indicator of SDSM ranged between 78-81% for temperature and 82-86% for precipitation under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The temperature results indicated an increasing trend of 1.5(o)C and 3.8(o)C for the twenty-first century under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The mean annual precipitation showed a rise of 2-7% while surface runoff projected a rising trend of 3.3-7.4% for RCP-4.5 and RCP-8.5 respectively till the end of the twenty-first century. The study results revealed that Jhelum basin will be wetter and warmer for the twenty-first century as compare to the baseline period. The hydrographs of the river predicted the occurrence of more extreme events in the region for the twenty-first century. These hydrographs may help for better water conservation and management strategies in the Jhelum basin for the twenty-first century.

TI  - Reanalysis Surface Mass Balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet Along K-Transect (2000-2014)
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of surface mass balance over the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) would contribute to understanding the cause of recent changes and would help to better estimate the future contribution of the GrIS to sea-level rise. Given the limitations of in-situ measurements, modeling, and remote sensing, it is critical to explore the opportunity to merge the available data to better characterize the spatial and temporal variation of the GrIS surface mass balance (SMB). This work utilizes a particle batch smoother data assimilation technique that yields SMB estimates that benefit from the snow model Crocus and a 16-day albedo product derived from satellite remote sensing data. Comparison of the results against in-situ SMB measurements shows that the assimilation of the albedo product reduces the root mean square error of the posterior estimates of SMB by 51% and reduces bias by 95%.

TI  - Contrasting seasonal pattern between ground-based PM<sub>2.5</sub> and MODIS satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) at an urban site in Hanoi, Vietnam
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the seasonal variations of the ground-based PM2.5 concentration measured at an urban site and Terra MODIS satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) in Hanoi, Vietnam, during the year 2016. The findings showed the large differences in terms of the seasonal variation of both PM2.5 concentration and columnar AOD. Clearly, the ground-based PM2.5 concentrations decreased during the summer period and highly increased during the late fall and winter periods. The Terra MODIS AOD values also decreased in summer, however, significantly increased in spring. Interestingly, the increasing trend of AOD which in contrast to the decreasing trend of PM2.5 concentration was found during the spring period, and vice versa for the winter period. The seasonal analysis of meteorological factors including relative humidity (RH), precipitation, and boundary layer height (BLH) as well as regional fire activities expressed that the increased columnar AOD in spring was largely influenced by the hygroscopic growth of aerosol induced by the increased RH, the larger BLH causing the more effective transport and mixing of atmospheric particles to higher altitudes, and especially the intensive fire activities in the Southeast Asian region during the spring period, whereas the significantly increased surface PM2.5 concentration in winter was partly attributed to the impact from the highly industrialized and polluted source region in the Pearl River Delta of China. Different from the spring and winter periods, the abundant precipitation amount and the dominance of maritime air masses arrived in Hanoi in summer were the main reasons for the low AOD and surface PM2.5 concentration during this period.

TI  - An urban energy balance-guided machine learning approach for synthetic nocturnal surface Urban Heat Island prediction: A heatwave event in Naples
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern European functional urban areas (FUAs) are increasingly subject to heatwave (HW) events, calling for an-ticipated climate adaptation measures. In the urban context, such adaptation strategies require a thorough under-standing of the built-up response to the incoming solar radiation, i.e., the urban energy balance cycle and its implications for the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Despite readily available, diurnal Land Surface Temperature (LST) data does not provide a meaningful picture of the UHI, in these midlatitudes FUAs. On the contrary, the mid-morning satellite overpass is characterized by the absence of a significant surface UHI (SUHI) signal, corre-sponding to the period of the day when the urban-rural air temperature difference is typically negative. Conversely, nocturnal high-resolution LST data is rarely available. In this study, an energy balance-based machine learning ap-proach is explored, considering the Local Climate Zones (LCZ), to describe the daily cycle of the heat flux components and predict the nocturnal SUHI, during an HW event. While the urban and rural spatial outlines are not visible in the diurnal thermal image, they become apparent in the latent and storage heat flux maps - built-up infrastructures up -take heat during the day which is released back into the atmosphere, during the night, whereas vegetation land sur-faces loose diurnal heat through evapotranspiration. For the LST prediction model, a random forest (RF) approach is implemented. RF results show that the model accurately predicts the LST, ensuring mean square errors inferior to 0.1 K. Both the latent and storage heat flux components, together with LCZ classification, are the most important ex-planatory variables for the nocturnal LST prediction, supporting the adoption of the energy balance approach. In fu -ture research, other locations and time-series data shall be trained and tested, providing an efficient local urban climate monitoring tool, where in-situ air temperature observations are not available.

TI  - The Monitoring Nitrous Oxide Sources (MIN<sub>2</sub>OS) satellite project
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Monitoring Nitrous Oxide Sources (MIN2OS) satellite project aims at monitoring global-scale nitrous oxide (N2O) sources by retrieving N2O surface fluxes from the inversion of space-borne N2O measurements that are sensitive to the lowermost atmospheric layers under favorable conditions. MIN2OS will provide emission estimates of N2O at a horizontal resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees on the global scale and 10 x 10 km(2) on the regional scale on a weekly to monthly basis depending on the application (e.g., agriculture, national inventories, policy, scientific research). Our novel approach is based on the development of: 1) a space-borne instrument operating in the Thermal InfraRed domain providing, in clear sky conditions, N2O mixing ratio in the lowermost atmosphere (900 hPa) under favorable conditions (summer daytime) over land and under favorable and unfavorable (winter nighttime) conditions over the ocean and 2) an atmospheric inversion framework to estimate N2O surface fluxes from the atmospheric satellite observations. After studying three N2O spectral bands (B1 at 1240-1350 cm(-1), B2 at 2150-2260 cm(-1) and B3 at 2400-2600 cm(-1)), a new TIR instrument will be developed, centered at 1250-1330 cm(-1), with a resolution of 0.125 cm(-1), a Full Width at Half Maximum of 0.25 cm(-1) and a swath of 300 km. To optimally constrain the retrieval of N2O vertical profiles, the instrument will be on-board a platform at-830 km altitude in a sun-synchronous orbit crossing the Equator in descending node at 09:30 local time in synergy with two other platforms (Metop-SG and Sentinel-2 NG) expected to fly in 2031-32 aiming at detecting surface properties, agricultural information on the field scale and vertical profiles of atmospheric constituents and temperature. The lifetime of the MIN2OS project would be 4-5 years to study the interannual variability of N2O surface fluxes. The spectral noise can be decreased by at least a factor of 5 compared to the lowest noise accessible to date with the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer-New Generation (IASI-NG) mission. The N2O total error is expected to be less than similar to 1% (similar to 3 ppbv) along the vertical. The preliminary design of the MIN2OS project results in a small instrument (payload of 90 kg, volume of 1200 x 600 x 300 mm(3)) with, in addition to the spectrometer, a wide field and 1-km resolution imager for cloud detection. The instruments could be hosted on a small platform, the whole satellite being largely compatible with a dual launch on VEGA-C. The MIN2OS project has been submitted to the European Space Agency Earth Explorer 11 mission ideas.

TI  - First Retrieval of AOD at Fine Resolution Over Shallow and Turbid Coastal Waters From MODIS
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The widely used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Dark-Target (DT) aerosol product fails to accurately retrieve Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over shallow and turbid Coastal Waters (CWs). To fill in gaps, and to improve land to ocean AOD continuity, we developed a coastal water retrieval algorithm at a spatial resolution of 1 km (CW-1km). CW-1km relies on observed top-of-atmosphere reflectance at 2.1 mu m (rho(2.1)), both to derive AOD and to perform a spatial variation test that enhances the existing DT masks for clouds and land. We show that the CW-1km improves spatial continuity of AOD between land, coast, and open ocean, while also increasing AOD product availability by 47.0%. Comparing with 15 years of marine aerosol network measurements, CW-1km AODs are validated to have a normalized mean bias of 1.0%, which is much smaller than 17.6% for the original DT product.

TI  - The Snow-Friction of Freestyle Skis and Snowboards Predicted From Snow Physical Quantities
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous research has shown that friction between ski and snow can vary substantially due to changes in snow conditions. The variation of friction affects the speed a freestyle skier or snowboarder (athlete) reaches during the in-run of a jump. Athletes risk severe injuries if their take-off speed is not within the right margin to land in the "sweet spot" zone. To reduce the risk of injury, snow park designers and competition managers need to calculate the speed athletes reach during the in-run. However, despite multiple attempts over the last decades, to date no model can predict ski-snow friction from snow physical quantities. Hence, simulations of in-run speeds suffer from insufficient validity. For the first time, this work combines kinematic athlete data and comprehensive snow surface measurements to infer the coefficient of friction of freestyle skis and snowboards across a wide range of snow conditions. Athletes' point mass kinematics were recorded at more than 200 straight gliding runs with differential global navigation satellite systems. The subjects' air drag and lift were deployed from wind tunnel measurements. Along with the kinematic data and data from wind measurements, a mechanical model of the athlete was established to solve the equation of motion for the coefficient of friction between ski/snowboard and snow. The friction coefficients for ski (snowboard) ranged from 0.023 +/- 0.006 (0.026 +/- 0.008) to 0.139 +/- 0.018 (0.143 +/- 0.017) and could be explained well (R-adj(2) = 0.77) from the measured snow parameters using a multivariate statistical model. Our results provide a new quantitative tool for practitioners to predict the friction of skis and snowboard on snow of various conditions, which aims to increase athletes' safety in slopestyle and big air.

TI  - Mitochondrial DNA: cellular genotoxic stress sentinel
T2  - TRENDS IN BIOCHEMICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - High copy number, damage prone, and lean on repair mechanisms are unique features of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that are hard to reconcile with its essentiality for oxidative phosphorylation, the primary function ascribed to this maternally inherited component of our genome. We propose that mtDNA is also a genotoxic stress sentinel, as well as a direct second messenger of this type of cellular stress. Here, we discuss existing evidence for this sentinel/effector role through the ability of mtDNA to escape the confines of the mitochondrial matrix and activate nuclear DNA damage/repair responses via interferon-stimulated gene products and other downstream effectors. However, this arrangement may come at a cost, leading to cancer chemoresistance and contributing to inflammation, disease pathology, and aging.

TI  - The spatiotemporal change of cropland and its impact on vegetation dynamics in the farming-pastoral ecotone of northern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the unfavorable soil conditions and water resources, the cropland use pattern in the farming-pastoral ecotone in northern China is complex. The program named "Grain for Green" has accelerated the cropland change. However, the complex cropland and retired cropland are challenging to monitor with remote sensing due to their spatially dispersed and easily confused with spectrally similar land use classes such as nature grasslands and non-cropped fields. Taking farming-pastoral ecotone in the northern foot of the Yinshan Mountains as a case study, we explored a classification approach for complex cropland and retired cropland, which was introduced as a specific land use class by using multi-temporal Landsat TM and OLI images with Google Earth Engine. During 1990-2000, cropland increased with a sharper growth and increased with a slower growth from 2001 to 2010, and then decreased significantly from 2011 to 2019, to lead the cropland area in 2019 was smaller than an area in 1990. We analyzed the spatiotemporal trajectories of retired cropland in 2019 using the Land Use Change Trajectory method to evaluate its source. In our finding, approximately 77% of retired cropland was labelled as cropland before 2019; albeit, not all retired cropland was converted from cropland. Moreover, we qualitatively assessed the vegetation dynamics in the study area by utilizing the long-term NDVI-mean value to reveal that vegetation coverage has shown a continuously increasing trend. It is related to the decline of cropland and the increase of retired cropland at the same rate. Our results highlighted that

TI  - Intra-annual land cover mapping and dynamics analysis with dense satellite image time series: a spatiotemporal cube based spatiotemporal contextual method
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land covers provide essential information for understanding and detecting ecosystem, resources, and environmental dynamics. However, they are generally mapped at coarser temporal scales to study the inter-annual changes, while scant attention has been paid to map intra-annual land cover dynamics at finer temporal scales. Moreover, existing studies are still limited in intra-annual land cover mapping with dense satellite image time series (SITS). Accordingly, this study proposed a novel approach to accurately classify dense SITS for mapping intra-annual land cover dynamics. First, dense SITS is segmented at multiple spatiotemporal scales to generate optimal spatiotemporal cubes (ST-cubes), which are chosen as classification units. Second, the ST-cubes based on spectral, textural, spatial, and temporal features are integratively defined and employed in SITS classification. Third, the spatiotemporal context is modeled by a spatiotemporally extended conditional random field model that measures both spatiotemporal features and semantic correlation between geographic objects. Finally, the proposed method is applied to map the intra-annual land cover dynamics. Comparative experiments of SITS classification are carried out between our method and three existing competitors in a suburban area in Beijing, China, with a dense Sentinel-2 SITS. Moreover, based on the classification results, we analyzed the quantitative intra-annual dynamics of land cover. The result shows that our approach achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy over existing methods, indicating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in mapping intra-annual land cover dynamics with dense SITS.

TI  - Landslide-lake outburst floods accelerate downstream hillslope slippage
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jinsha River, which has carved a 2-4 km deep gorge, is one of the largest SE Asian rivers. Two successive landslide-lake outburst floods (LLFs) occurred after the 2018 Baige landslides along the river. Using Sentinel-2 images, we examined the LLF impacts on downstream river channels and adjacent hillslopes over a 100 km distance. The floods increased the width of the active river channel by 54 %. Subsequently, major landslides persisted for 15 months in at least nine locations for displacements >2 m. Among them, three moving hillslopes similar to 80 km downstream from the Baige landslides slumped more than 10m 1 year after the floods. Extensive undercuts by floods probably removed hillslope buttresses and triggered a deformation response, suggesting strong and dynamic channel-hillslope coupling. Our findings indicate that infrequent catastrophic outburst flooding plays an important role in landscape evolution. Persistent post-flood hillslope movement should be considered in disaster mitigation in high-relief mountainous regions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal change and driving factors of the Eco-Environment quality in the Yangtze River Basin from 2001 to 2019
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Yangtze River Basin has a wide range and complicated topography. In recent years, under the background of climate and land cover change, the ecological response of the whole ecological quality of the Yangtze River Basin is still unknown. To reveal the spatiotemporal changes in ecological quality in the Yangtze River Basin from 2001 to 2019 and their relationship with environmental and topographical factors, this study used the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to calculate the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) based on the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) product image set, combined with the digital elevation data set and statistical yearbook. The data evaluated the ecological quality of the Yangtze River Basin and analyzed its causes. The results showed that: 1) the average RSEI of the Yangtze River Basin showed an overall upward trend, the growth rate was 0.027 (year(-1)), and the variation ranged from 0.5 to 0.568. The overall ecological quality rank was mainly neutral and slightly good. 2) The ecological quality of 85.7% of the Yangtze River Basin remains stable. A total of 11.2% of the regional ecological quality is improving, and 3.1% of the regional ecological quality is declining. Areas with reduced ecological quality are concentrated in the Hengduan Mountains. The dominant LST factor drives the deterioration of its ecological quality at a rate of -1.06 (year(-1)). The areas with improved ecological quality are concentrated in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The dominant WET factor drives its ecological quality to improve at a rate of 0.27 (year(-1)). 3) From the perspective of topography, the ecological quality of the Yangtze River basin shows a wave-like decline and first rises and then falls in elevation and slope (the elevation is bounded by 2000 m and 6000 m, and the slope is bounded by 15 degrees.). The average RSEI of the Yangtze River Basin is the highest on the northwest slope (0.554), and the ecological quality of sunny slopes is generally higher than that of shady slopes. The research shows that from 2001 to 2019, the overall ecological quality of the Yangtze River Basin has improved and evolved, but the ecological quality of the Hengduan Mountains has declined. Therefore, implementing different ecological protection policies in different regions is an important strategy for enhancing the stability of the ecosystem.

TI  - A System for Burned Area Detection on Multispectral Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The current remote sensing (RS) open data policy for multispectral (MS) missions such as Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8, together with the availability of free cloud distributed processing platforms such as Google Earth Engine, makes it possible the quick generation of burned area (BA) products even for nonexperts in the field. Indeed, fires and BAs can be detected using burn severity indices, which are usually obtained by simple band algebra operations. However, simple approaches can aid BA estimation only if typical error patterns are known and accounted for, especially when working at large (e.g., continental) scales. This article proposes an automatic BA detection system based on burn severity index thresholding, which integrates dedicated false and missed alarm mitigation strategies to improve the detection accuracy. The system is tested on Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 data over ten different locations in Europe and spanning year 2018. Three known burn severity indices plus a custom one defined to improve the performance in the considered study area are under study. Results show that burned index thresholding is possible within accuracy bounds slightly larger than the state of the art, which is acceptable by considering the proposed simplified processing framework.

TI  - A new oil spill detection algorithm based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Features of oil spills and look-alikes in polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images always play an important role in oil spill detection. Many oil spill detection algorithms have been implemented based on these features. Although environmental factors such as wind speed are important to distinguish oil spills and look-alikes, some oil spill detection algorithms do not consider the environmental factors. To distinguish oil spills and look-alikes more accurately based on environmental factors and image features, a new oil spill detection algorithm based on Dempster-Shafer evidence theory was proposed. The process of oil spill detection taking account of environmental factors was modeled using the subjective Bayesian model. The Faster-region convolutional neural networks (RCNN) model was used for oil spill detection based on the convolution features. The detection results of the two models were fused at decision level using Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. The establishment and test of the proposed algorithm were completed based on our oil spill and look-alike sample database that contains 1 798 image samples and environmental information records related to the image samples. The analysis and evaluation of the proposed algorithm shows a good ability to detect oil spills at a higher detection rate, with an identification rate greater than 75% and a false alarm rate lower than 19% from experiments. A total of 12 oil spill SAR images were collected for the validation and evaluation of the proposed algorithm. The evaluation result shows that the proposed algorithm has a good performance on detecting oil spills with an overall detection rate greater than 70%.

TI  - An Improved SRGAN Based Ambiguity Suppression Algorithm for SAR Ship Target Contrast Enhancement
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Y Due to the specific characteristics of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), there will be ambiguity interference in SAR images, resulting in low contrast of the ship target to the clutter. This letter proposes an improved super-resolution generative adversarial network (ISRGAN) based ambiguity suppression algorithm for SAR ship target contrast enhancement. The proposed ISRGAN is the first attempt of using GAN for SAR ambiguity suppression. As a post- processing procedure, it does not need prior information of SAR systems, so it can be applied to various observation scenes and different acquisition modes. The generator of ISRGAN embeds the residual dense network (RDN) to optimally fuse the global and local features of the image, and it effectively improves the completeness of the feature information used for SAR ship target contrast enhancement. The superiority of ISRGAN on ambiguity suppression is validated on the Chinese Gaofen-3 imagery.

TI  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2: The Role of the Main Components of the Innate Immune System
T2  - INFLAMMATION
M3  - Review
AB  - At the end of December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic began in Wuhan of China. COVID-19 affects different people with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic with recovery without hospitalization up to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The innate and adaptive immunity appears responsible for the defense against the virus and recovery from the disease. The innate immune system, as the first line of defense, is essential for the detection of virus and subsequent activation of acquired immunity. The innate immune response is carried out by sentinel cells such as monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells and by receptors known as pattern recognition receptors (PRR). These receptors can recognize various components of the virus, which lead to intracellular signaling and subsequently the synthesis of various cytokines. These cytokines then recruit other immune cells, activate adaptive immune responses, and inhibit viral spreading. The most common receptors include Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and RIG-I like receptors. This review describes the current knowledge about the interplay between innate immune responses and SARS-CoV-2 with a focus on the innate immune cells and the role of their receptors in viral RNA recognition, as well as their mechanisms for recognizing SARS-CoV-2.

TI  - Sediment transport at the network scale and its link to channel morphology in the braided Vjosa River system
T2  - EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article we apply the CASCADE network-scale sediment connectivity model to the Vjosa River in Albania. The Vjosa is one of the last unimpaired braided rivers in Europe and, at the same time, a data scarce environment, which limits our ability to model how this pristine river might respond to future human disturbance. To initialize the model, we use remotely sensed data and modeled hydrology from a regional model. We perform a reach-by-reach optimization of surface grain size distribution (GSD) and bedload transport capacity to ensure equilibrium conditions throughout the network. In order to account for the various sources of uncertainty in the calculation of transport capacity, we performed a global sensitivity analysis. The modeled GSD distributions generated by the sensitivity analysis generally match the six GSDs measured at different locations within the network. The modeled bedload sediment fluxes increase systematically downstream, and annual fluxes at the outlet of the Vjosa are well within an order of magnitude of fluxes derived from previous estimates of the annual suspended sediment load. We then use the modeled sediment fluxes as input to a set of theoretically derived functions that successfully discriminate between multi-thread and single-thread channel patterns. This finding provides additional validation of the model results by showing a clear connection between modeled sediment concentrations and observed river morphology. Finally, we observe that a reduction in sediment flux of about 50% (e.g., due to dams) would likely cause existing braided reaches to shift toward single thread morphology. The proposed method is widely applicable and opens a new avenue for application of network-scale sediment models that aid in the exploration of river stability to changes in water and sediment fluxes.

TI  - Evaluation of Radar/Optical Based Vegetation Descriptors in Water Cloud Model for Soil Moisture Retrieval
T2  - IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate consideration of vegetation descriptors in water cloud model (WCM) is necessary for precise SM retrieval. Most of the vegetation descriptors are sourced from optical remote sensors. The acquisitions from optical sensors are largely hampered by bad weather conditions. For all-weather monitoring, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) based vegetation descriptors are needed to identify and evaluate their performance for SM retrieval. The present study evaluates the various sources/combinations of SAR based vegetation descriptors in WCM to identify the better alternatives of optical-based vegetation descriptors. The performance of three radar-based vegetation descriptors, namely VH polarized backscattering coefficients, depolarization ratio and radar vegetation index (RVI) along with the one optical-based vegetation descriptor, namely leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS were utilized in WCM. The WCM for each vegetation descriptor has been performed using Sentinel-1 VV polarized backscattering coefficients and in- situ SM. The in- situ SM measurements were carried out in the fields around Varanasi District in India during the winter season sown with the wheat crop. The correlations coefficient (r), root mean square error (RMSE) and bias were used to evaluate the performances of vegetation descriptors in WCM for SM retrieval. The study showed that the depolarization ratio is the best for SM retrieval with accuracy of 0.096m(3)m(-3) followed by RVI, cross-polarized and LAI with 0.100m(3)m(-3), 0.124m(3)m(-3) and 0.124m(3)m(-3), respectively. Thus, the depolarization ratio can be used for the retrieval of SM using Sentinel-1 VV polarized backscattering coefficients over the wheat crop.

TI  - Localised labyrinthine patterns in ecosystems
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Self-organisation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in ecosystems. These systems can experience transitions from a uniform cover towards the formation of vegetation patterns as a result of symmetry-breaking instability. They can be either periodic or localised in space. Localised vegetation patterns consist of more or less circular spots or patches that can be either isolated or randomly distributed in space. We report on a striking patterning phenomenon consisting of localised vegetation labyrinths. This intriguing pattern is visible in satellite photographs taken in many territories of Africa and Australia. They consist of labyrinths which is spatially irregular pattern surrounded by either a homogeneous cover or a bare soil. The phenomenon is not specific to particular plants or soils. They are observed on strictly homogenous environmental conditions on flat landscapes, but they are also visible on hills. The spatial size of localized labyrinth ranges typically from a few hundred meters to ten kilometres. A simple modelling approach based on the interplay between short-range and long-range interactions governing plant communities or on the water dynamics explains the observations reported here.

TI  - Comparative analysis of Microcystis buoyancy in western Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microcystis is the predominant genus of harmful cyanobacterium in both Lake Erie and Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron and has the capacity to regulate the buoyancy of its colonies, sinking under certain conditions while floating towards the surface in others. Understanding the factors that control buoyancy is critical for interpretation of remote sensing data, modeling and forecasting harmful algal blooms within these two systems. To determine if Microcystis colony buoyancy in the two lakes responds similarly to diurnal light cycles, colony buoyant velocity (floating/sinking terminal velocity in a quiescent water column) and size were measured after manipulating the intensity of sunlight. Overall, there were more positively buoyant (floating) colonies in Lake Erie while most of the colonies in Saginaw Bay were negatively buoyant (sinking). In Lake Erie the colonies became less buoyant at increased light intensities and were less buoyant in the afternoon than in the morning. In both lakes, apparent colony density was more variable among small colonies (< 200 mu m), whereas larger colonies showed a diminished response of density to light intensity and duration. These findings suggest that colony density becomes less plastic as colonies increase in size, leading to a weak relationship between size and velocity. These relationships may ultimately affect how the bloom is transported throughout each system and will help explain observed differences in vertical distribution and movement of Microcystis in the two lakes.

TI  - Optimal combination of Arctic sea ice extent measures: A dynamic factor modeling approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The diminishing extent of Arctic sea ice is a key indicator of climate change as well as being an accelerant for future global warming. Since 1978, Arctic sea ice has been measured using satellite-based microwave sensing; however, different measures of Arctic sea ice extent have been made available based on differing algorithmic transformations of raw satellite data. We propose and estimate a dynamic factor model that combines four of these measures in an optimal way and accounts for their differing volatility and cross-correlations. We then use the Kalman smoother to extract an optimal combined measure of Arctic sea ice extent. It turns out that almost all weight is put on the NSIDC Sea Ice Index, confirming and enhancing confidence in the Sea Ice Index and the NASA Team algorithm on which it is based.

TI  - Coseismic Deformation and Speculative Seismogenic Fault of the 2017 <i>M</i> <sub>S</sub> 6.6 Jinghe Earthquake, China, Derived From Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - A M-S 6.6 earthquake struck Jinghe County in Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on August 9, 2017. The earthquake occurred near the eastern part of the Kusongmuxieke Piedmont Fault (KPF) in the southwest of Junggar Basin. Using two pairs of coseismic SAR image data from the ascending and descending tracks from Sentinel-1 (European Space Agency), we processed the interferograms to obtain the coseismic deformation field. We calculate the fault slip distribution of the earthquake based on the elastic half-space rectangular dislocation model with the available location, geometry from seismic data and the coseismic deformation data. The results show that the earthquake deformation field has the typical characteristics of thrust faulting. The uplift deformation field is about 28 km long and 20 km wide. The maximum displacements of InSAR line-of-sight to the ascending and descending tracks are 49 and 68 mm, respectively. The main slip is concentrated at the depth of 10-20 km. The inverted seismic moment is equivalent to a moment magnitude M-W 6.3. This result is very similar to the slip distribution from the seismological inversion. The maximum deformation area and the distribution of aftershocks are both on the west side of the mainshock. They mutually confirm the characteristics of a unilateral rupture. According to stress triggering theory, the aftershocks within 1 month after the mainshock in the layer 10-14 km deep may have been triggered by the mainshock, and the transferred stress increases the seismic risk of the eastern section of the KPF fault. After more than 1 year, a M-S 5.4 earthquake occurred to the southwest of the M (S) 6.6 Jinghe earthquake. Beacause the stress drop change (<0.01 MPa) is too small for the M-S 5.4 earthquake to have been directly triggered. Based on the analysis of multisource data and the detailed geological investigation, the thrust Jinghenan fault which north of Kusongmuxieke Piedmont fault is inferred to be the seismogenic fault of the M-S 6.6 Jinghe earthquake.

TI  - A novel automatic phenology learning (APL) method of training sample selection using multiple datasets for time-series land cover mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The long record of Landsat imagery, which is the cornerstone of Earth observation, provides an opportunity to monitor land use and land cover (LULC) change and understand the interactions between the climate and earth system through time. A few change detection algorithms such as Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) have been developed to utilize all available Landsat images for change detection and characterization at local or global scales. However, the reliable, rapid, and reproducible collection of training samples have become a challenge for time series land cover classification at a large scale. To meet the challenge, we proposed an automatic phenology learning (APL) method with the assumption that the temporal profiles of samples within the same land cover type are the same or similar at a local scale to generate evenly distributed training samples automatically. We designed the method to build land cover patterns for each category based on consensus samples derived from multiple existing scientific datasets including LANDFIRE's (LF) Existing Vegetation Type (EVT), USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD), National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland Data Layer (CDL), and National Wetlands Inventory (NWI). Then we calculated the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (twDTW) distance between any undefined samples and land cover patterns in the same geographical region as prior knowledge. Finally, we selected the optimal land cover category for each undefined sample from the land cover products based on the designed criteria iteratively using the twDTW distance as an indicator. The method was applied in the footprint of 10 selected Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) tiles in the eastern and western conterminous United States (CONUS) to produce annual land cover maps from 1985 to 2017. The accuracy assessment and visual comparison revealed that the APL method can generate reliable training samples without any manual interpretation, producing better land cover results especially for the grass/ shrub and wetland land cover classes. Applying the APL method, the overall accuracy of the annual land cover maps was improved by 2% over the accuracy of Land Change Monitoring, Assessment, and Projection (LCMAP) Collection 1.0 Science Products in the research regions. Our results also indicate that the APL method provides an approach for best use of different land cover products and meets the requirement of intensive sampling for training data collection.

TI  - Real-time fluorescence image-guided gastrointestinal oncologic surgery: Towards a new era
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Technological improvements are crucial in the evolution of surgery. Real-time fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) has spread worldwide, mainly because of its usefulness during the intraoperative decision-making processes. The success of any gastrointestinal oncologic resection is based on the anatomical identification of the primary tumor and its regional lymph nodes. FGS allows also to evaluate the blood perfusion at the gastrointestinal stumps after colorectal or esophageal resections. Therefore, a reduction on the anastomotic leak rates has been postulated as one of the foreseeable benefits provided by the use of FGS in these procedures. Although the use of fluorescence in lymph node detection was initially described in breast cancer surgery, the technique is currently applied in gastric or splenic flexure cancers, as they both present complex and variable lymphatic drainages. FGS allows also to perform intraoperative lymphograms or sentinel lymph node biopsies. New applications of FGS are being developed to assist in the detection of peritoneal metastases or in the evaluation of the tumor resection margins. The present review aims to provide a general overview of the current status of real-time FGS in gastrointestinal oncologic surgery. We put a special focus on the different applications of FGS, discussing the main findings and limitations found in the contemporary literature and also the promising near future applications.

TI  - Long-term spatial and temporal variations of aerosol optical depth during 2000-2020 over Zambia, southcentral Africa
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed at using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Terra) to investigate long-term spatial and temporal aerosol variations over Zambia during 2000-2020. Based on data availability, ground truthing for MODIS-Terra was done over Mongu in western Zambia using Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) data for 2001-2009. The correlation coefficient between MODIS-Terra and AERONET is 0.42 and statistically significant at 95% confidence level. The aerosol optical depth at 550nm (AOD(550)) and Angstrom exponent (AE(470-870)) annual mean spatial distribution indicates high and moderate to low patterns explaining distinct features of aerosol loadings from different areas over Zambia. Generally, the AOD(550) and AE(470-870) spatial gradient values increase from southern to northern Zambia explaining fine mode particles mainly produced by local intensive anthropogenic and urban/small and large-scale industrial emission activities in the cities. Seasonal climatology reveals that highest AOD(550) is observed during SON, followed by JJA, DJF, with the lowest recorded during MAM. It is also observed from AE(470-870) that fine particles are prominent during JJA and SON. The insignificant decreasing (increasing) trend of AOD(550) is revealed over Mwinilunga, Misamfu, Mfuwe, Choma, and Kabwe (Mongu). Further results showed that fire hotspot density intensifies over central parts of Africa, including Zambia from June to November. Moreover, the 5-day air mass back trajectory analysis suggests that aerosol sources over Zambia are associated with short- and long-distance ranges from East Africa, Congo Basin, Madagascar, and Atlantic and Indian oceans with diverse transport pathways in different seasons. These findings may help enhance a better understanding of climatic effects and atmospheric aerosol sources in Zambia.

AB  - CONSPECTUS: The spread of infectious diseases due to travel and trade can be seen throughout history, whether from early settlers or traveling businessmen. Increased globalization has allowed infectious diseases to quickly spread to different parts of the world and cause widespread infection. Posthoc analysis of more recent outbreaks.SARS, MERS, swine flu, and COVID19.has demonstrated that the causative viruses were circulating through populations for days or weeks before they were first detected, allowing disease to spread before quarantines, contact tracing, and travel restrictions could be implemented. Earlier detection of future novel pathogens could decrease the time before countermeasures are enacted. In this Account, we examined a variety of novel technologies from the past 10 years that may allow for earlier detection of infectious diseases. We have arranged these technologies chronologically from prehuman predictive technologies to population-level screening tools. The earliest detection methods utilize artificial intelligence to analyze factors such as climate variation and zoonotic spillover as well as specific species and geographies to identify where the infection risk is high. Artificial intelligence can also be used to monitor health records, social media, and various publicly available data to identify disease outbreaks faster than traditional epidemiology. Secondary to predictive measures is monitoring infection in specific sentinel animal species, where domestic animals or wildlife are indicators of potential disease hotspots. These hotspots inform public health officials about geographic areas where infection risk in humans is high. Further along the timeline, once the disease has begun to infect humans, wastewater epidemiology can be used for unbiased sampling of large populations. This method has already been shown to precede spikes in COVID-19 diagnoses by 1 to 2 weeks. As total infections increase in humans, bioaerosol sampling in high-traffic areas can be used for disease monitoring, such as within an airport. Finally, as disease spreads more quickly between humans, rapid diagnostic technologies such as lateral flow assays and nucleic acid amplification become very important. Minimally invasive point-of-care methods can allow for quick adoption and use within a population. These individual diagnostic methods then transfer to higher-throughput methods for more intensive population screening as an infection spreads. There are many promising early warning technologies being developed. However, no single technology listed herein will prevent every future outbreak. A combination of technologies from across our infection timeline would offer the most benefit in preventing future widespread disease outbreaks and pandemics.

TI  - Landscape analysis in a municipality in the arc of deforestation of the Brazilian Amazon rainforest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fight for the conservation of the Amazon region is anything but recent. Despite being one of the highest biodiversity assets in the world, it has undergone intense transformations of the landscape since the beginning of the anthropic "invasion" occupation. Changes in land use and occupation are observed for the municipality of Dom Eliseu, located in the zone characterized as the Arc of Deforestation. Given this premise, we designed this study to provide a quantitative understanding of forest fragmentation in the municipality of Dom Eliseu - PA. For this, cloud-free images from the TM (Landsat 5) and OLI (Landsat 8) sensors for 2008 and 2018 were used, respectively, for supervised classification of land use and land cover to identify the forest areas in the study area. The areas of each fragment were quantified and grouped into size classes, considering as very small (<5 ha), small (5-10 ha), medium (10-100 ha), and large (> 100 ha) fragments. The indexes used were area, edge, density and size, shape, and central. In total, 33,171 forest fragments were found in 2008, reduced to 32,385 in 2018, representing 42.71% of the forest cover area under study. Quantitative characterizations were made with groups of area indexes density and size, shape, and central area, the latter obtained for the distance of 100 m under edge effect. The area mapping infers that the forest fragments in the area are mainly found by very small fragments, smaller than 5 ha, indicating a high degree of forest fragmentation in this landscape during the two years under study.

TI  - Hearing, voicing and healing: Rivers as culturally located and connected
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, a collaborative writing group explores how we, two rivers, express ourselves over time, place and space, our energies long interpreted as veins and arteries carrying the Country's life affirming blood. Voiced as River: I, River, this position reflects a worldview in which interrelationship with living river is normal, and River Spirit is ever-present. It is a position underpinned by Indigenous narratives as riverine expressions of place-based love. At times, the article is also voiced as a writing group or individuals, with voices being interchanged where required for smooth reading. We see this as part of the decolonising process, which feels liberating and healing among the writers. Each writer is equally valued as co-creator, contributor, narrator and story teller. The two rivers, being Martuwarra Fitzroy River (Kimberley, Western Australia) and Unamen Shipu Romaine River (North Shore, Quebec, Canada), illustrate a common condition of being, through heritage, life, change and possibility. Through stories and voices, the socio-scientific implications of colonisation and lost connections become clear, considering the interaction, the dialogue and the cultural synthesis of living water systems that have always incorporated all life forms into rivers of life. As a way of navigating towards wholeness, Aboriginal knowledge systems and narratives for healing are used to bring together findings of this intercultural river learning journey.

TI  - Investigation of landslides with natural lineaments derived from integrated manual and automatic techniques applied on geospatial data
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lineament extraction has long been performed through extensive field mapping. Recent advances in the field of remote sensing have made possible the availability of imageries from earth observation satellites with different Spatio-temporal resolutions, paving way for new automatic, semi-automatic, and manual techniques for the extraction of natural lineaments. The study focuses on the extraction of lineaments representing tectonic fault zones; the lineaments are extracted automatically and semi-automatically/manually. Results show that indirect information about the tectonic lineaments can be derived through automatic techniques whereas, the semi-automatic techniques are more effective to directly identify them. Detailed analyses of lineaments and landslides revealed that areas near lineaments, in general, experienced higher frequency of landslides. Moreover, it is also observed that lineaments are not the only factor that affects landslide density; other parameters like slope and lithology were also found to be the controlling factors in determining the spatial landslide distribution. Lastly, some recommendations have been made based on observations.

TI  - A machine learning-based classification of LANDSAT images to map land use and land cover of India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The land use and land cover (LULC) maps are often required by planners and policymakers for effective planning and management interventions at the local, national, regional and global levels. Various attempts have been made to develop LULC maps using field-based surveys and by processing remotely sensed images. These maps can be developed using different tools and methodologies at different scales to achieve different levels of accuracy. With the advent of remote sensing technologies and its application in making LULC maps, attempts have been made to develop such maps with improved accuracy and consistency. The machine learning-based approaches have been attempted to develop LULC maps with varying levels of accuracy using different satellite images. Making LULC maps for a large region such as India covering a total area of ca. 3,287,469 km(2) can be a cumbersome process using conventional approaches. Thus the map was developed using remotely sensed images using machine learning algorithm (Mnlogit) on LANDSAT images (2005, 2006, 2007 and 2016) for entire India region. We developed LULC maps of years 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2016 to test the consistency of classification using the trained Mnlogit model using field survey based signatures for corresponding years in respective images. We could achieve reasonably good accuracy varying in the range of 80-86% during all four years. A Kappa statistic - K (hat), was obtained in the range of 0.71-0.81 which indicates reasonably good accuracy. The study can be replicated for other regions using other available satellite remote sensing images to obtain LULC maps. In general, the suggested approach in this study will help planners to obtain LULC maps at different time intervals to study land-use change dynamics in a shorter time and cost-effective way.

TI  - Remote sensing estimation of the concentration and sources of coloured dissolved organic matter based on MODIS: A case study of Erhai lake
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite remote sensing to estimate coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and identify its potential sources is important for monitoring lake water quality and implementing management strategies. In this study, taking Erhai Lake as an example and based on MODIS/Aqua satellite images and in-situ measured data, we used empirical and semi-empirical methods to develop algorithms for CDOM and the fluorescence index (FI370) from remote sensing reflectance (Rrs(lambda)). The temporal and spatial distributions of the CDOM concentration and FI370 in Erhai Lake during 2013-2019 were retrieved. The results show the following. (1) The band ratio (Rrs (469)+Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) model could estimate the CDOM absorption coefficient at 412 nm (aCDOM(412)) (R2=0.507), and it was relatively stable. Using the band ratio Rrs(645)/Rrs(469) combined with the chlorophylla (Chl-a) APProach by ELimination (APPEL) model, a semi-empirical inversion model of FI370 performed with satisfactory accuracy (R2=0.550) and was more accurate than the empirical algorithm (R2=0.505). (2) During the period of 2013-2019, the CDOM concentration in Erhai Lake generally decreased from the northern to the central to the southern parts of the lake, and the CDOM concentration was higher in summer and autumn than in spring and winter. FI370 was higher in the northern and western coastal waters and lower in the central, southern and eastern parts of the lake. FI370 in autumn and winter was higher than that in spring and summer. CDOM was affected by both terrestrial and internal sources, and their relative contributions were not the same in different seasons. (3) For different Chl-a concentrations, different CDOM concentration models had better retrieval effects, i.e., Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) and (Rrs(469)+Rrs(645))/Rrs(555) had the best performance when Chl-a 10 mu g/L and Chl-a 10 mu g/L, respectively. The inversion models established in this study offer improved quantifications of the CDOM concentration and the FI370 in Erhai Lake, providing important support for monitoring water quality and implementing efficient management strategies.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of built-up impervious surface area and interplay with land surface temperature in Pretoria, South Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluating changes in built-up impervious surface area (ISA) to understand the urban heat island (UHI) extent is valuable for governments in major cities in developing countries experiencing rapid urbanization and industrialization. This work aims at assessing built-up ISA spatio-temporal and influence on land surface temperature (LST) variability in the context of urban sprawl. Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager) and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) were used to quantify ISA using built-up Index (BUI) and spatio-temporal dynamics from 1993-2013. Thereafter using a suitable analytical sampling scale that represents the estimated ISA-LST, we examined its distribution in relation to elevation using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and also create Getis-Ord Gi* statistics hotspot maps to display the UHI extent. The BUI ISA extraction results show a high predictive accuracy with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUROC = 0.8487 for 1993, AUROC = 0.8302 for 2003, AUROC = 0.8790 for 2013. The ISA spatio-temporal changes within ten years interval time frame results revealed a 14% total growth rate during the study year. Based on a suitable analytical scale (90 x 90) for the hexagon polygon grid, the majority of ISA distribution across the years was at an elevation range of between >1200 m-1600 m. Also, Getis-Ord Gi* statistics hotspot maps revealed that hotspot regions expanded through time with a total growth rate of 19% and coldspot regions decreased by 3%. Our findings can represent useful information for policymakers by providing a scientific basis for sustainable urban planning and management.

TI  - Monthly rather than annual climate variation determines plant diversity change in four temperate grassland nature reserves
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant diversity is changing in the world; climate variation at annual scale is believed to drive these changes; however, the effects of climate variation at month scale are still unknown. Anxi, West Ordos, Xilingol, and Tumuji grassland nature reserves, located in northern China, have been well protected from human disturbance, are ideal areas to identify the drive forces for plant diversity change. Using Landsat images from 1982 to 2017, we analyzed the evolution of month- and annual-climate variables and spectral plant diversity indices, and explored the effects of the variability of temperature and precipitation on plant diversity and their relationship. The results showed that the diversity of the four grasslands was decreasing. Climate variables, in particular temperature at month scale, significantly related to grassland plant diversity. These results enlarge our understanding in how climate change driving plant diversity during a long term. Measurements coping with plant diversity decreasing may be more effective and earlier based on monthly climate variables.

TI  - New Operative Reporting Standards: Where We Stand Now and Opportunities for Innovation
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer's (CoC) new operative standards for breast cancer, melanoma, and colon cancer surgeries will require that surgeons provide synoptic documentation of essential oncologic elements within operative reports. Prior to designing and implementing an electronic tool to support synoptic reporting, we evaluated current documentation practices at our institution to understand baseline concordance with these standards. Methods Applicable procedures performed between 1 January 2018 and 31 December 2018 were included. Two independent reviewers evaluated sequential operative notes, up to a total of 100 notes, for documentation of required elements. Complete concordance (CC) was defined as explicit documentation of all required CoC elements. Mean percentage CC and surgeon-specific CC were calculated for each procedure. Interrater reliability was assessed via Cohen's kappa statistic. Results For sentinel lymph node biopsy, mean CC was 66% (n = 100), with surgeon-specific CC ranging from 6 to 100%, and for axillary dissection, mean CC was 12% (n = 89) and surgeon-specific CC ranged from 0 to 47%. The single surgeon performing melanoma wide local excision had a mean CC of 98% (n = 100). For colon resections, mean CC was 69% (n = 96) and surgeon-specific CC ranged from 39 to 94%. Kappa scores were 0.77, 0.78, -0.15, and 0.78, respectively. Conclusions We identified heterogeneity in current documentation practices. In our cohort, rates of baseline concordance varied across surgeons and procedures. Currently, documentation elements are interspersed within the operative report, posing challenges to chart abstraction with resulting imperfect interrater reliability. This presents an exciting opportunity to innovate and improve compliance by introducing an electronic synoptic documentation tool.

TI  - Customizing local and systemic therapies for women with early breast cancer: the St. Gallen International Consensus Guidelines for treatment of early breast cancer 2021
T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The 17th St Gallen International Breast Cancer Consensus Conference in 2021 was held virtually, owing to the global COVID-19 pandemic. More than 3300 participants took part in this important bi-annual critical review of the 'state of the art' in the multidisciplinary care of early-stage breast cancer. Seventy-four expert panelists (see Appendix 1) from all continents discussed and commented on the previously elaborated consensus questions, as well as many key questions on early breast cancer diagnosis and treatment asked by the audience. The theme of this year's conference was 'Customizing local and systemic therapies.' A well-organized program of pre-recorded symposia, live panel discussions and real-time panel voting results drew a worldwide audience of thousands, reflecting the farreaching impact of breast cancer on every continent. The interactive technology platform allowed, for the first time, audience members to ask direct questions to panelists, and to weigh in with their own vote on several key panel questions. A hallmark of this meeting was to focus on customized recommendations for treatment of early-stage breast cancer. There is increasing recognition that the care of a breast cancer patient depends on highly individualized clinical features, including the stage at presentation, the biological subset of breast cancer, the genetic factors that may underlie breast cancer risk, the genomic signatures that inform treatment recommendations, the extent of response before surgery in patients who receive neoadjuvant therapy, and patient preferences. This customized approach to treatment requires integration of clinical care between patients and radiology, pathology, genetics, and surgical, medical and radiation oncology providers. It also requires a dynamic response from clinicians as they encounter accumulating clinical information at the time of diagnosis and then serially with each step in the treatment plan and follow-up, reflecting patient experiences and treatment response.

TI  - Community-driven tree planting greens the neighbouring landscape
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Nature-based solutions to climate change are growing policy priorities yet remain hard to quantify. Here we use remote sensing to quantify direct and indirect benefits from community-led agroforestry by The International Small group and Tree planting program (TIST) in Kenya. Since 2005, TIST-Kenya has incentivised smallholder farmers to plant trees for agricultural benefit and to sequester CO2. We use Landsat-7 satellite imagery to examine the effect on the historically deforested landscape around Mount Kenya. We identify positive greening trends in TIST groves during 2000-2019 relative to the wider landscape. These groves cover 27,198 ha, and a further 27,750 ha of neighbouring agricultural land is also positively influenced by TIST. This positive 'spill-over' impact of TIST activity occurs at up to 360 m distance. TIST also benefits local forests, e.g. through reducing fuelwood and fodder extraction. Our results show that community-led initiatives can lead to successful landscape-scale regreening on decadal timescales.

TI  - Evaluation of different DEMs for gully erosion susceptibility mapping using in-situ field measurement and validation
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial variability in any kind of geomorphic studies based on terrain attributes are the most important issues. This terrain attributes and their respective characteristics play a significant role in the formation and expansion of ephemeral gullies. Therefore, nowadays, the accuracy of terrain based geomorphic studies has been mostly dependent on the resolution and quality of the DEM (digital elevation model) data. As the rate of erosional power of water flow is dependent on the terrain characteristics, therefore the extraction of several terrain features from DEM data is necessary in the study of gully erosion. This case study investigates the scaledependence of DEM-derived terrain factors in gully erosion susceptibility (GES). This work on Garhbeta-I C.D. Block has focused on the comparison among the predicted GES maps through five types of DEM i.e. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Cartosat-1, ALOS World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) and Advanced Land Observation satellite (ALOS) coupled with the machine learning modelling approach of artificial neural network (ANN), convolution neural network (CNN) and deep learning neural network (DLNN) algorithm. A total of sixteen conditioning factors were chosen for GES assessment based on the topographical, hydro-climatological conditions and multi-collinearity analysis. Here, importance variables are measured by mean decrease accuracy (MDA) method of random forest (RF) algorithm and the result is shown that elevation is the most important factor for gully occurrences. Validation result of receiver operating characteristics-area under curve (ROC-AUC) has been indicates that DLNN model in ALOS DEM (AUC = 0.958) gives the most optimal accuracy in GES assessment. The output maps can assist in identifying gully-prone risk areas, and several suitable with sustainable managements should be taken for conservation accordingly.

TI  - Spectral responses in rangelands and land cover change by livestock in regions of the Caatinga biome, Brazil
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to analyze fragments of rangelands through spectral responses and land cover change by livestock in regions of the Caatinga biome through remote sensing. For spectral behavior, the surface reflectance bidirectional (SRB) and spectral indexes of vegetation were used to verify the ragelands seasonality. Land cover change detection of Ouricuri and Taua through Landsat-8 images with a 16-day revisit interval, were processed in the Google Earth Engine platform (GEE) and software Quantum GIS version 2.18 (QGIS). In the GEE platform, annual mosaics and stacking of the spectral bands were generated for the classification of images, and in sequence the production of thematic maps in QGIS. The analysis of land cover change considered the classes: thinned Caatinga, conserved Caatinga, herbaceous vegetation, bare soil, water and others. The analysis of the spectral responses showed that the vegetation monitored in Ouricuri presented higher SRB in the infrared band and lower SRB in the red and blue bands, and that caused the pasture to produce higher vegetation indexes than the other locations. Through validation, it was observed that in Taua, there was an overall accuracy of 91% and Kappa index of 89%, and in Ouricuri there was an overall accuracy of 90% and Kappa index of 86%, indicating excellent correctness of the classification model. The classification model proved to be effective in verifying the temporal and spatial land cover change, making it possible to identify places with the vegetation that was most affected and susceptible to degradation and generation of political support to minimize damage to the Caatinga Biome.

TI  - PSI and GNSS derived ground subsidence detection in the UNESCO Heritage City of Ahmedabad, Western India
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Presently, ground subsidence in urban areas is becoming a peril to the infrastructure and society. In this study, we conducted a detailed analysis of the results, based on the Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and groundwater in the 'World Heritage City' of Ahmedabad, a major metro city in western India. The PSI technique is applied to measure the ground subsidence using the Sentinel 1 A dataset for the period 2017 to 2020. The results reveal a subsidence, maximum up to the level of 25 mm/yr in the areas of the southeast and west parts of the city. Analysis derived from GNSS results indicates a significant amount of ground subsidence based on the 2009-2020 dataset. Groundwater data (1995-2019) were analyzed to identify factors likely to cause ground subsidence and the results are in close agreement with the PSI and GNSS results.

TI  - Using satellite estimates of aboveground biomass to assess carbon stocks in a mixed-management, semi-deciduous tropical forest in the Yucatan Peninsula
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the spatial distribution of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) and its uncertainty is important to evaluate management and conservation policies in tropical forests. However, the scarcity of field data and robust protocols to propagate uncertainty prevent a robust estimation through remote sensing. We upscaled AGB from field data to LiDAR, and to landscape scale using Sentinel-2 and ALOS-PALSAR through machine learning, propagated uncertainty using a Monte Carlo framework and explored the relative contributions of each sensor. Sentinel-2 outperformed ALOS-PALSAR (R-2 = 0.66, vs 0.50), however, the combination provided the best fit (R-2 = 0.70). The combined model explained 49% of the variation comparing against plots within the calibration area, and 17% outside, however, 94% of observations outside calibration area fell within the 95% confidence intervals. Finally, we partitioned the distribution of AGB in different management and conservation categories for evaluating the potential of different strategies for conserving carbon stock.

TI  - Droughts and heatwaves in the Western Mediterranean: impact on vegetation and wildfires using the coupled WRF-ORCHIDEE regional model (RegIPSL)
T2  - CLIMATE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Droughts and heatwaves in the Mediterranean can induce plant activity decline and severe wildfires leading to considerable economic, social and environmental damages. This study aims at statistically quantifying the isolated and combined impacts of these extreme events based on a combination of regional land surface-atmosphere modeling and satellite observations of surface properties (MODIS). A simulation by the RegIPSL coupled regional model (ORCHIDEE-WRF) over the 1979-2016 period in the Western Mediterranean is used to identify heatwaves and droughts. After an evaluation of the model performance against surface observations of temperature and precipitation, a spatio-temporal analysis is conducted using specific indicators of extreme events: Percentile Limit Anomalies (PLA) and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The impact on vegetation and wildfires is assessed using the MODIS observations of Leaf Area Index (LAI), burned area (BA) and fire radiative power (FRP), clustered by simulated extreme weather events. Due to water stress, droughts lead to significant biomass decrease (- 10% LAI on average and reaching - 23% in some areas). The isolated effect of heatwaves is smaller (similar to- 3% LAI) so that the combined effect is dominated by the impact of droughts. Heatwaves and droughts significantly exacerbate wildfire regimes. Through synergistic effects, simultaneous droughts and heatwaves increase BA and FRP by 2.1 and 2.9 times, respectively, compared to normal conditions. By reducing biomass, droughts slightly decrease fuel availability. However, our results show that the inter-annual variation in fire activity is mainly driven by weather conditions rather than fuel load.

TI  - Application of Remote Sensing Technology in Sediment Estimating Entering the Dam Reservoirs due to Floods
T2  - SHOCK AND VIBRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aimed to use remote sensing technology to estimate the concentration of particulate materials in the water entering the reservoirs of dams and consequently investigate the possibility of estimating the amount of sediment carried to the reservoir by flood during the life of the dam and its annual estimate. Using an advanced spectrometer device (ASD), the reflectance values of water containing different amounts of particulate sediments were measured in the range of 400-2500 nm; then, these reflectance values were represented for the Landsat 8 satellite OLI bands using their spectral response functions. In the study of interband correlation with the number of particulate materials, band 2 (blue) and band 5 (near-infrared) were identified to prepare a specific and appropriate model. The specificity of the reflectance difference in the two abovementioned bands was presented as an exponential relationship between the concentration of particulate materials and spectral reflectance. In this model, the RMSE parameter for the maximum possible sediment concentration was equal to 1.57 and the parameter R2 was equal to 0.91. In the second step, at the same time as the satellite passed, the area was visited and the sediments of the Ardak dam reservoir were sampled by recording their location. To complete this research, two measures were performed simultaneously, calculating the concentration of particulate materials sampled in the laboratory environment and their location on the image. Then, the number of particulate materials is estimated by taking into account the coordinates recorded from the images on which the relevant corrections have been made. According to the extracted exponential model, the results of estimating the concentration of particulate matter obtained from the model and Landsat satellite images with the concentration of particulate matter obtained from sampling showed its complete compatibility with field surveys to validate this research.

TI  - Mental health and addiction service use among United States veterans with liver disease nationally in the Veterans Health Administration
T2  - JOURNAL OF PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose While many studies have shown that liver diseases (LD) can be caused or exacerbated by substance use disorders (SUD), few have examined the proportion of adults with LD and SUD who receive mental health and addiction treatment or correlates of such use. Design/methodology/approach Using national Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 data from the United States Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the authors studied all 43,246 veterans diagnosed with both LD and SUD in FY 2012 and compared those who received mental health treatment (n = 30,456; 70.4%) to those who did not (n = 12,790; 29.6%). Findings Veterans who received mental health treatment were less like to be older than 75 years of age, more likely to have served during recent Middle East conflicts (Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom), more likely to have been recently homeless and to have drug dependence as contrasted with alcohol dependence when compared with those who did not receive mental health treatment. Although the majority, 70.4%, received mental health treatment, only 30.6% of the total received specialized addiction treatment, and these veterans were more likely to experience homelessness and have drug dependence diagnoses. Originality/value This is the first study as per the authors' best knowledge that broadly examines mental health and addiction treatment received by veterans with LD and SUD. High rates of mental health treatment in this population likely reflect the integrated nature of the VHA and its emphasis on providing comprehensive services to homeless veterans. Further research is needed to identify barriers to specialized addiction treatment in this population.

TI  - MultiScene: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Multiscene Recognition in Single Aerial Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerial scene recognition is a fundamental research problem in interpreting high-resolution aerial imagery. Over the past few years, most studies focus on classifying an image into one scene category, while in real-world scenarios, it is more often that a single image contains multiple scenes. Therefore, in this article, we investigate a more practical yet underexplored task--multiscene recognition in single images. To this end, we create a large-scale dataset, called MultiScene, composed of 100,000 unconstrained high-resolution aerial images. Considering that manually labeling such images is extremely arduous, we resort to low-cost annotations from crowdsourcing platforms, e.g., OpenStreetMap (OSM). However, OSM data might suffer from incompleteness and incorrectness, which introduce noise into image labels. To address this issue, we visually inspect 14,000 images and correct their scene labels, yielding a subset of cleanly annotated images, named MultiScene-Clean. With it, we can develop and evaluate deep networks for multiscene recognition using clean data. Moreover, we provide crowdsourced annotations of all images for the purpose of studying network learning with noisy labels. We conduct experiments with extensive baseline models on both MultiScene-Clean and MultiScene to offer benchmarks for multiscene recognition in single images and learning from noisy labels for this task, respectively. To facilitate progress, we make our dataset and trained models available on https://gitlab.lrz.de/ai4eo/reasoning/multiscene.

T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work we have developed a novel algorithm for the determination of the total ozone column (TOC) from spectral top-of-atmosphere solar backscattered light measurements in the spectral range 400-1020nm performed by the ESA Ocean and Land Colour Instrument on board Sentinel-3A, B. The algo-rithm can be applied for scenes over bright underlying surfaces including clouds, snow and ice (e.g., over Antarctica), where the ozone absorption feature in the Chappuis absorption band is clearly seen in reg-istered top-of-atmosphere backscattered light spectra . The technique provides the possibility to perform the total ozone measurements on the spatial scale 300m, which can not be reached by other modern spaceborne measurements, aimed at total ozone observations such as TROPOMI, OMI, GOME-2, OMPS and other.

TI  - Building Footprint Generation Through Convolutional Neural Networks With Attraction Field Representation
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Building footprint generation is a vital task in a wide range of applications, including, to name a few, land use management, urban planning and monitoring, and geographical database updating. Most existing approaches addressing this problem fall back on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn semantic masks of buildings. However, one limitation of their results is blurred building boundaries. To address this, we propose to learn attraction field representation for building boundaries, which is capable of providing an enhanced representation power. Our method comprises two elemental modules: an Img2AFM module and an AFM2Mask module. More specifically, the former aims at learning an attraction field representation conditioned on an input image, which is capable of enhancing building boundaries and suppressing the background. The latter module predicts segmentation masks of buildings using the learned attraction field map. The proposed method is evaluated on three datasets with different spatial resolutions: the ISPRS dataset, the INRIA dataset, and the Planet dataset. From experimental results, we find that the proposed framework can well preserve geometric shapes and sharp boundaries of buildings, which brings significant improvements over other competitors. The trained model and code are available at https://github.com/lqycrystal/AFM_building.

TI  - Stimulus-specific responses in innate immunity: Multilayered regulatory circuits
T2  - IMMUNITY
M3  - Review
AB  - Immune sentinel cells initiate immune responses to pathogens and tissue injury and are capable of producing highly stimulus-specific responses. Insight into the mechanisms underlying such specificity has come from the identification of regulatory factors and biochemical pathways, as well as the definition of signaling circuits that enable combinatorial and temporal coding of information. Here, we review the multi-layered molecular mechanisms that underlie stimulus-specific gene expression in macrophages. We categorize components of inflammatory and anti-pathogenic signaling pathways into five layers of regulatory control and discuss unifying mechanisms determining signaling characteristics at each layer. In this context, we review mechanisms that enable combinatorial and temporal encoding of information, identify recurring regulatory motifs and principles, and present strategies for integrating experimental and computational approaches toward the understanding of signaling specificity in innate immunity.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates the spatiotemporal pattern of Land Use land cover (LULC) and land surface temperature (LST) in Abha for the years 1990, 2000, and 2018. This research also forecasts the future LULC and LST for the year 2028. The support vector machine (SVM) was utilised to classify the LULC for the periods 1990-. The LST for the same period was derived using the mono window algorithm. The artificial neural network-cellular automata model (ANN-CA) was employed to forecast LULC and LST for the year 2028. The results indicated that urban areas rose by 434.6% between 1990 and 2018, while the LST soared to 50 degrees C in 2018, covering half of the study area. The built-up area, as well as the high LST zone, will be expanded in 2028. As a result, sustainable management strategies should be implemented to limit uncontrolled urban sprawl and LST.

TI  - Very High Spatial Resolution Soil Moisture Observation of Heterogeneous Subarctic Catchment Using Nonlocal Averaging and Multitemporal SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A soil moisture estimation method was developed for Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ground range detected high resolution (GRDH) data to analyze moisture conditions in a gently undulating and heterogeneous subarctic area containing forests, wetlands, and open orographic tundra. In order to preserve the original 10-m pixel spacing, PIMSAR (pixel-based multitemporal nonlocal averaging) nonlocal mean filtering was applied. It was guided by multitemporal statistics of SAR images in the area. The gradient boosted trees (GBT) machine learning method was used for the soil moisture algorithm development. Discrete and continuous in situ soil moisture values were used for training and validation of the algorithm. For surface soil moisture, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the method was 6.5% and 8.8% for morning and evening images, respectively. The corresponding maximum errors were 34.1% and 33.8%. The pixelwise sensitivity to the training set and method choice was estimated as the variance of the soil moisture values derived using the algorithms for the three best methods with respect to the criteria: the smallest maximum error, the smallest RMSE value, and the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) value. It was, on average, 6.3% with a standard deviation of 5.7%. Our approach successfully produced instantaneous high-resolution soil moisture estimates on daily basis for the subarctic landscape and can further be applied to various hydrological, biogeochemical, and management purposes.

TI  - Retrieving vegetation biophysical parameters and GPP using satellite-driven LUE model in a National Park
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial biosphere plays an active role in governing the climate system by regulating carbon exchange between the land and the atmosphere. Analysis of vegetation biophysical parameters and gross primary production (GPP) makes it convenient to monitor vegetation's health. A light use efficiency (LUE) model was employed to estimate daily GPP from satellite-driven data and environmental factors. The LUE model is driven by four major variables, namely normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), air temperature, and moisture for which both satellite-based and ERA5-Land data were applied. In this study, the vegetation health of Dibru Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) in Assam has been analyzed through vegetation biophysical and biochemical parameters (i.e., NDVI, EVI, LAI, and chlorophyll content) using Sentinel-2 data. Leaf area index (LAI) varied between 1 and 5.2, with healthy forests depicted LAI more than 2.5. Daily GPP was estimated for January (winter) and August (monsoon) 2019 for tropical evergreen and deciduous forest types. A comparative analysis of GPP for two seasons has been performed. In January, GPP was found to be 3.6 gC m(-2) day(-1), while in August, GPP was 5 gC m(-2) day(-1). The outcome of this study may be constructive to forest planners to manage the National Park so that net carbon sink may be attained in DSNP.

AB  - Purpose Scientific knowledge has been a topic of interest for scholars for a long time; however, its impact on scientific decision- making and determining trust is severely underresearched. This study is aimed at determining the relationship between cultural and social attitudes and scientific knowledge and the impact of knowledge on trust in scientists in general. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a face-to-face survey, drawing from a nationally representative sample of the adult Serbian population (N = 1,451). The authors tested the following parameters: a. the levels of scientific knowledge within the Serbian population; b. social and cultural values as predictors of scientific knowledge and c. the effects of scientific knowledge on trust in scientists. Findings The analysis shows a moderate level of scientific knowledge, predominantly positive public attitudes towards scientists. The authors found that scientific knowledge indeed predicts trust in scientists on various issues, and so do cultural and social worldviews, both directly and even more significantly through the mediation of scientific knowledge. Originality/value This is the first attempt to assess the level of scientific knowledge among the Serbian public and evaluate its, as well as other factors', influence on public attitudes toward scientists in a time when trusting experts is of great relevance.

M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in wastewater produced interest in its use for sentinel surveillance at a community level and as a complementary approach to syndromic surveillance. With this work, we set the foundations for wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) in Portugal by monitoring the trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA circulation in the community, on a nationwide perspective during different epidemiological phases of the pandemic. The Charite assays (E_Sarbecco, RdRP, and N_Sarbecco) were applied to monitor, over 32-weeks (April to December 2020), the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA at the inlet of five wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which together serve more than two million people in Portugal. Raw wastewater from three Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) reference hospitals was also analyzed during this period. In total, more than 600 samples were tested.For the first weeks, detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was sporadic, with concentrations varying from 103 to 105 genome copies per liter (GC/L). Prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA increased steeply by the end of May into late June, mainly in Lisboa e Vale do Tejo region (LVT), during the reopening phase. After the summer, with the reopening of schools in mid-September and return to partial face-to-face work, a pronounced increase of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was detected. In the LVT area, SARS-CoV-2 RNA load agreed with reported trends in hotspots of infection. Synchrony between trends of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in raw wastewater and daily new COVID-19 cases highlights the value of WBE as a surveillance tool, particularly after the phasing out of the epidemiological curve and when hotspots of disease re-emerge in the population which might be difficult to spot based solely on syndromic surveillance and contact tracing. This is the first study crossing several epidemiological stages highlighting the long-term use of WBE for SARS-CoV-2. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Biophysical matter in a marine estuary identified by the Sentinel-3B OLCI satellite and the presence of terrestrial iron (Fe) nanoparticles
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of marine matter using the Sentinel-3B OLCI (Ocean Land Color Instrument) satellite is the most advanced technique for evaluating: the absorption of colored detrital and dissolved material (ADG_443_NN), total suspended matter concentration (TSM_NN) and of chlorophyll-a (CHL_NN) on a global scale. The objective is to analyze ADG_443_NN, TSM_NN and CHL_NN using the Sentinel-3B OLCI satellite and the presence of Fenanoparticles (NPs) + hazardous elements (HEs) in suspended sediments (SSs) in the maritime estuary of the Colombian city of Barranquilla. The study used the unpublished image of the Sentinel-3B OLCI satellite in the evaluation of ADG_443_NN, TSM_NN and CHL_NN in 72 sampled points. Subsequently, 36 samples of SSs were carried out in the Magdalena River, in the identification of Fe-NPs by advanced electron microscopies. The Sentinel-3B satellite revealed particulate accumulations in OCE1 through the intensity of OLCI in ocean. There was also a high Fe-NPs intensity of SSs in the Magdalena channel, spreading contamination to large regions.

TI  - Comparison of Multiple Surface Ocean Wind Products with Buoy Data over Blue Amazon (Brazilian Continental Margin)
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data for space-time characterization of wind fields in extensive oceanic areas have been shown to be increasingly useful. Orbital sensors, such as radar scatterometers, provide data on ocean surface wind speed and direction with spatial and temporal resolutions suitable for multiple applications and air-sea studies. Even considering the relevant role of orbital scatterometers to estimate ocean surface wind vectors on a regional and global scale, the products must be validated regionally. Six different ocean surface wind datasets, including advanced scatterometer (ASCAT-A and ASCAT-B products) estimates, numerical modelling simulations (BRAMS), reanalysis (ERA5), and a blended product (CCMP), were compared statistically with in situ measurements obtained by anemometers installed in fifteen moored buoys in the Brazilian margin (8 buoys in oceanic and 7 in shelf waters) to analyze which dataset best represents the wind field in this region. The operational ASCAT wind products presented the lowest differences in wind speed and direction from the in situ data (0.77 ms(-1) < RMSEspd < 1.59 ms(-1), 0.75 < R-spd < 0.96, -0.68 ms(-1) < bias(spd) < 0.38 ms(-1), and 12.7 degrees < RMSEdir < 46.8 degrees). CCMP and ERA5 products also performed well in the statistical comparison with the in situ data (0.81 ms(-1) < RMSEspd < 1.87 ms(-1), 0.76 < R-spd < 0.91, -1.21 ms(-1) < bias(spd) < 0.19 ms(-1), and 13.7 degrees < RMSEdir < 46.3 degrees). The BRAMS model was the one with the worst performance (RMSEspd > 1.04 m center dot s(-1), R-spd < 0.87). For regions with a higher wind variability, as in the southern Brazilian continental margin, wind direction estimation by the wind products is more susceptible to errors (RMSEdir > 42.4 degrees). The results here presented can be used for climatological studies and for the estimation of the potential wind power generation in the Brazilian margin, especially considering the lack of availability or representativeness of regional data for this type of application.

TI  - Mapping Floods in Urban Areas From Dual-Polarization InSAR Coherence Data
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have shown that the decrease of temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) coherence could be exploited to detect the appearance of floodwater in urban areas. However, as of today, approaches based on this principle only make use of single co-polarization images for identifying the presence of floodwater in the double-bounce feature. In this study, we take advantage of both co- and cross-polarization images to detect significant decreases of the multitemporal InSAR coherence in order to enhance the mapping of floodwater in urban areas. We consider that not only double-bounce scattering, but also multiple-bounce may occur in urban areas depending on how the building facades are oriented with respect to the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensor's line of sight. The Sentinel-1 (S-1) mission is particularly well suited for applying and testing this kind of approach due to the systematic availability of dual-polarization data. Using as a test case, the widespread flooding in the city of Houston, USA, caused by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, we demonstrate that the proposed methodology leads to an increase of the accuracy of the urban flood maps from 75.2% when only using the VV polarization, to 82.9% when using the dual polarization information.

TI  - Improvement of inorganic aerosol component in PM<sub>2.5</sub> by constraining aqueous-phase formation of sulfate in cloud with satellite retrievals: WRF-Chem simulations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High concentrations of PM2.5 in China have caused severe visibility degradation and health problems. However, it is still challenging to accurately predict PM2.5 and its chemical components in numerical models. In this study, we compared the inorganic aerosol components of PM2.5 (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium (SNA)) simulated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model fully coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) model with in-situ data in a heavy haze-fog event during November 2018 in Nanjing, China. Comparisons show that the model underesti-mates sulfate concentrations by 81% and fails to reproduce the significant increase of sulfate from early morning to noon, which corresponds to the timing of fog dissipation that suggests the model underestimates the aqueous-phase formation of sulfate in clouds. In addition, the model overestimates both nitrate and ammonium concen-trations by 184% and 57%, respectively. These overestimates contribute to the simulated SNA being 77.2% higher than observed. However, cloud water content is also underestimated which is a pathway for important aqueous-phase reactions. Therefore, we constrained the simulated cloud water content based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Liquid Water Path observations. Results show that the simulation with MODIS-corrected cloud water content increases the sulfate by a factor of 3, decreases the Normalized Mean Bias (NMB) by 53.5%, and reproduces its diurnal cycle with the peak concentration occurring at noon. The im -proved sulfate simulation also improves the simulation of nitrate, which decreases the simulated nitrate bias by 134%. Although the simulated ammonium is still higher than the observations, corrected cloud water content leads to a decrease of the modelled bias in SNA from 77.2% to 14.1%. The strong sensitivity of simulated SNA concentration to the cloud water content provides an explanation for the simulated SNA bias. Hence, uncertainties in cloud water content can contribute to model biases in simulating SNA which are less frequently explored from a process-level perspective and can be reduced by constraining the model with satellite observations.

TI  - A Global Meta-Analysis of Soil Salinity Prediction Integrating Satellite Remote Sensing, Soil Sampling, and Machine Learning
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the growing interest among researchers, satellite-based prediction of soil salinity remains highly uncertain. The improvements in prediction accuracy reported in previous studies are usually limited to a single area. We performed a meta-analysis of regional satellite-based soil salinity predictions combined with in situ soil sampling and machine learning. Based on R-2 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) collected, we evaluated the effects of various features on the model accuracy and established a Bayesian network to evaluate the joint causal effect of multifeatures. Most significant differences were found in soil sampling schemes and characteristics of the study area, including the mean and variability (averaged R-2 of 0.75 for soil sample sets with lower salinity variation and 0.62 for others) of the salinity, climate type (R-2 of 0.64 in arid areas and 0.74 in others), soil texture (R-2 of 0.66 in sandy areas and 0.57 in others), and the interval between sampling date and satellite data acquisition date (R-2 of 0.53 under the condition of over 15 days and 0.65 in others). Generally, using different satellite data has limited effects on model performance among which Sentinel-2 performed better (R-2 = 0.72) than Landsat (R-2 = 0.66). The sampling of subsamples for each sample should focus on their subpixel-scale spatial heterogeneity across satellite data rather than the number of subsamples. It is also necessary to select appropriate vegetation and salinity indices for different satellite data under different vegetation conditions. Among algorithms, random forests (R-2 = 0.70) and support vector machines (R-2 = 0.71) performed best.

TI  - Multi-sensor anomalous change detection in remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining multiple satellite remote sensing sources provides a far richer, more frequent view of the earth than that of any single source; the challenge is in distilling these petabytes of heterogeneous sensor imagery into meaningful characterizations of the imaged areas. Meeting this challenge requires effective algorithms for combining multi-modal imagery over time to identify subtle but real changes among the intrinsic data variation. Here, we implement a joint-distribution framework for multi-sensor anomalous change detection (MSACD) that can effectively account for these differences in modality, and does not require any signal resampling of the pixel measurements. This flexibility enables the use of satellite imagery from different sensor platforms and modalities. We use multi-year construction of the SoFi Stadium in California as our testbed, and exploit synthetic aperture radar imagery from Sentinel-1 and multispectral imagery from both Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8. We show results for MSACD using real imagery with implanted, measurable changes, as well as real imagery with real, observable changes, including scaling our analysis over multiple years.

TI  - Salinity regime of the northwestern Bering Sea shelf
T2  - PROGRESS IN OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Review
AB  - The present study has examined the long-term variability of water mass properties and its relation to sea ice production (SIP) in the northwestern Bering Sea shelf using hydrographic and satellite data, and output from atmospheric reanalysis. As per our analysis of hydrographic data in the summer seasons, significant variability in bottom water temperature and salinity was noted. The temperature in 2018 showed particularly remarkable warming of the whole water column throughout the Gulf of Anadyr (GOA) and cold pool (CP) region. These oceanic parameters exhibited correlations with SIP in the Anadyr polynya, which is identified as one of the most active polynyas in the Northern Hemisphere. Specifically, there were more saline and colder water during high SIP years, suggesting the influence of dense shelf water (DSW) that is formed during freezing processes; however, in low SIP years, bottom salinity has been observed to behave inversely, resulting in more saline water with lower SIP. We suggest that the influence of warm and saline water, originating from the Pacific, transported by ocean currents intensified by wintertime southerly winds in low-SIP years. The properties of bottom water in the semi-closed GOA are influenced by intrusion of the Pacific-originated water and DSW.

TI  - Favorable outcome with sentinel lymph node biopsy alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in clinically node positive breast cancer at diagnosis: Turkish Multicentric NEOSENTI-TURK MF-18-02-study
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Factors affecting local outcome were evaluated in patients with clinically node-positive (cN+) breast cancer at diagnosis, who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). Methods: Between 2004 and 2018, 303 cytopathology-proven cN (+) patients in a multicentric registry, who received NAC and underwent SLNB alone were analysed. All patients had regional nodal irradiation. Results: Median age was 46 (23-70). Of those, 211 patients had ypN0 disease (69.6%), whereas 92 pa-tients had ypN (+) disease including 19 (20.6%) isolated tumor cells (ITC), 33 micrometastases (35.9%) and 40 macrometastases (43.5%). At a median follow-up of 36 months (24-172), one patient (0.3%) with macrometastatic SLN was found to have locoregional recurrence as chest wall and supraclavicular LN metastases at the 60th month. Five-year disease-free survival (DFS) and disease specific survival (DSS) rates were 87% and 95%, respectively. Patients with cT3/4 (HR = 2.41, 95% CI; 1.14-5.07), non-luminal molecular pathology (HR = 2.60, 95% CI, 1.16-5.82), and non-pCR in the breast (HR = 2.11, 95% CI, 0.89-5.01) were found to have an increased HR compared to others in 5-year DFS. However, no dif-ference could be found between ypN0 and ypN ITC and micrometastasis (HR = 1.23, 95% CI, 0.44-3.47), whereas there was a slight increase in HR of patients with ypN macrometastasis versus ypN0 (HR = 1.91, 95% CI, 0.63-5.79). Conclusion: ALND could be avoided in meticulously selected cN (+) patients who underwent SLNB after NAC having breast and/or nodal pCR, cT1-2, or low volume residual nodal disease with luminal pa-thology, as long as axillary radiotherapy is provided.

TI  - Limited effects of tree planting on forest canopy cover and rural livelihoods in Northern India
T2  - NATURE SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many countries have adopted large-scale tree planting programmes as a climate mitigation strategy and to support local livelihoods. We evaluate a series of large-scale tree planting programmes using data collected from historical Landsat imagery in the state of Himachal Pradesh in Northern India. Using this panel dataset, we use an event study design to estimate the socioeconomic and biophysical impacts over decades of these programmes. We find that tree plantings have not, on average, increased the proportion of forest canopy cover and have modestly shifted forest composition away from the broadleaf varieties valued by local people. Further cross-sectional analysis, from a household livelihood survey, shows that tree planting supports little direct use by local people. We conclude that decades of expensive tree planting programmes in this region have not proved effective. This result suggests that large-scale tree planting may sometimes fail to achieve its climate mitigation and livelihood goals.Large-scale tree planting programmes have been implemented or planned for areas around the world suffering from deforestation, but this study presents evidence that such efforts may not necessarily deliver the desired environmental and economic outcomes.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of remotely sensed forest loss data in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Philippines
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR) in the Philippines is among the last forest frontiers in the country and is also home to 13 major watersheds in Northern Luzon that supply irrigation and hydroelectricity to other regions. However, it is faced with the deterioration of the quality of its watersheds due to forest loss driven mainly by agricultural expansion and illegal logging. Thus, this study was conducted to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of forest loss that could serve as a basis for policy decisions. Also, this paper determined the strength of relationships using Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) between forest loss and seven independent variables, which includes forest cover, agricultural areas, built-up, road network, and socio-economic data. This study utilized the Hansen Global Forest Change (HGFC), a Landsat-derived dataset from 2001 to 2019. Results revealed that 70,925 hectares (ha) of forest loss were detected with an annual deforestation rate of 3,744 ha/year across the region. Based on the validation, the accuracy of the HGFC data is 72%, but great caution should be observed when using the data with less than 0.2 ha due to very low accuracy. On a region-wide analysis, only the forest cover had a strong association with the forest loss with a computed r-value of 0.78. Conversely, on a provincial level, the explanatory variables had a strong to moderately strong correlation with deforestation. Hence, immediate, science-based, and sustained regional and multi-stakeholder efforts are necessary to conserve and protect the remaining forest cover in the region.

TI  - Effect of environmental stressors on the mRNA expression of ecdysone cascade genes in <i>Chironomus riparius</i>
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Chemical compounds produced by humans are continuously reaching the environment. In this work, we characterised the expression patterns of important endocrine-related genes involved in the ecdysone pathway in the fourth larval instar of the model species Chironomus riparius after exposure to three chemicals: ethinyl oestradiol (EE), nonylphenol (NP) and bis(tributyltin) oxide (TBTO). We used real-time PCR to analyse the gene expression levels of ecdysone receptor (EcR) and ultraspiracle (usp), two genes that encode the dimerising partners of the functional ecdysone receptor; the orphan receptor ERR (oestrogen-related receptor), with an unknown function in invertebrates; and E74, an early response gene induced by ecdysteroids. We estimated the bioaccumulation potential, bioavailability and physicochemical properties of these chemicals, together with a number of other exogenous agents known to interfere with the hormonal system. We also provide a review of previous transcriptional studies showing the effect of all these chemicals on ecdysone cascade genes. This analysis provides useful data for future ecotoxicological studies involving invertebrate species. Capsule Changes in transcriptional activities of EcR, E74, usp and ERR genes after exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals would be useful as molecular bioindicators of endocrine disruption in Chironomus riparius.

TI  - Assessment of the environmental effects of ecological water conveyance over 31 years for a terminal lake in Central Asia
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland river terminal lakes help maintain the regional ecological environment. However, terminal lakes in arid regions have shrunk dramatically over the past 50 years. We extracted the water areas of Taitema Lake in the arid region of Central Asia and calculated the fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) of the surrounding areas based on Landsat images from 1989 to 2019. We analysed the evolution and driving factors of the FVC and lake area before and after implementing an ecological water conveyance (EWC) project in 2000. The contributions of the driving factors were derived using regression analysis, and the effect coefficients were calculated with a path analysis. Results showed that before EWC (1989-1999), Taitema Lake was dry, the proportions of medium and high FVC areas were small, and FVC varied moderately. The contributions of land use and inflow water from Qarqan River to the regional FVC were 57.4% and 45.3%, respectively, and the effect coefficients of temperature and precipitation on FVC were 0.09 and 0.02, respectively. Human-dominated land-use change was the main factor affecting FVC change. After EWC (2000-2019), the water in Taitema Lake was restored, and the average annual proportions of medium and high FVC were 9.5% and 2.7% higher than the pre-EWC period, respectively. The contributions of land use and river inflow to the water area were 39.1% and 60.9%, and those to FVC were 40.7% and 59.3%, respectively. Precipitation had a slightly stronger effect on the water area and FVC than the temperature in the study area, whereas the influence of river inflow on the water area and FVC was less evident than that of the EWC. EWC can replenish lake water quickly, which is essential for improving the ecological environment of terminal lake areas.

TI  - Assessing PM<sub>2.5</sub>, Aerosol, and Aerosol Optical Depth Concentrations in Hefei Using Modis, Calipso, and Ground-Based Lidar
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPECTROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the complications in the measurement of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), this paper proposes a method using lidar for assessing PM2.5. By calculating the aerosol optical depth (AOD) for MODIS, CALIPSO, and ground-based lidar, the corrected PM2.5 was predicted. The results showed that AOD and PM2.5 had a linear relationship. The linear correlation coefficient between ground-based lidar AOD and PM2.5 was 0.81, and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and mean deviation (MD) were 24.43 and 18.41, respectively. The linear correlation coefficient between CALIPSO AOD and PM2.5 was 0.8, and its RMSE and MD were 42.91 and 33.25, respectively. The linear correlation between AOD and PM2.5 for VIIRS was approximately 0.7. This paper provides more possibilities for lidar observation and prediction of the environment.

TI  - Spatiotemporal differences in climate change impacts on vegetation cover in China from 1982 to 2015
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The impacts of climate change on vegetation cover in different regions in China are not entirely clear because of the interference of non-climatic factors, such as human activity. This study aims to analyze the spatiotemporal differences in climate impacts qualitatively and quantitatively by applying trend, correlation, and multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses to the data of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and two climatic factors (air temperature and precipitation) during 1982-2015 in China. The MLR equation linking two climatic variables with NDVI was used to identify the NDVI trend caused by climate change. We demonstrated that the central and eastern regions of China, dominated by deciduous and evergreen broadleaf forests, experienced a rapid increase in NDVI from 1982 to 2015. The response of NDVI to variations in temperature and precipitation exhibited large spatiotemporal differences across China, which was closely related to climatic conditions and vegetation types. Overall, warming, particularly the sharp rise in spring, was the main climatic driving force behind China's NDVI increase, and precipitation also influenced the NDVI increase in temperate grassland and desert regions due to the relatively arid climate, particularly in summer. The contributions of climate change to the total NDVI trend (CC) showed a large spatiotemporal heterogeneity across China. Overall, only 45% of the pixels (with a resolution of 8 km) in the study area showed that the MLR equations between NDVI and two climatic factors were significant at the 0.05 significance level during the growing season (April-October), and the average CC of these pixels was 38%. Among the eight vegetation sub-regions of China, the temperate desert and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau alpine meadow regions generally exhibited relatively larger CCs than other vegetation sub-regions in different seasons. At a national scale, the regional average CC reached 64% during the growing season. These results at multiple scales can help to deeply understand the mechanisms of regional environmental variation and sustainability.

TI  - Economic implications of ACOSOG Z0011 trial application into clinical practice at the European Institute of Oncology
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives: The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial demonstrated that in clinically node-negative women undergoing breast-conserving therapy (BCT) and found to have metastases to 1 or 2 sentinel nodes, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) alone resulted in rates of local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival equivalent to those seen after axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), but with significantly lower morbidity. Application of the Z0011 guidelines resulted in fewer ALNDs without affecting locoregional recurrence or survival. Changes in practice inevitably affect health care costs. The current study investigated the actual impact of applying the Z0011 guidelines to eligible patients and determined the costs of care at a single institution. Patients and methods: We compared axillary nodal management and cost data in breast cancer patients who met the Z0011 criteria and were treated with BCT and SLNB. Patients were allocated into two mutually exclusive cohorts based on the date of surgery: pre-Z0011 (June 2013 to December 2015) and post-Z0011 (June 2016 to December 2018). Results: Of 3912 patients, 433 (23%) and 357 (17.6%) patients in the pre-and post-Z0011 era had positive lymph nodes. ALND decreased from 15.3% to 1.57% in the post-Z0011 era. The mean overall cost of SLNB in the pre-Z0011 cohort was euro1312 per patient, while that for SLNB with completion ALND was euro2613. Intraoperative frozen section (FS) use decreased from 100% to 12%. Omitting the FS decreased mean costs from euro247 to euro176. The mean total cost in the pre-Z0011 cohort was euro1807 per patient, while in the post-Z0011 cohort it was euro1498. The application of Z0011 resulted in an overall mean cost savings of euro309 for each patient. Conclusions: Application of the Z0011 criteria to patients undergoing BCT at our institution results in more than half a million Euro cost savings. (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Analysis of Sedimentary Environment Conditions for Lacustrine Fine-Grained Sedimentary Rocks and Its Control of Lithofacies Development: A Case Study of the Lower Submember of Member 3 of Shahejie Formation in FY-1 Well, Dongying Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, China
T2  - GEOFLUIDS
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the studies on fine-grained sedimentation mainly focus on the rock type, sedimentary environment, sedimentation, and sequence stratigraphy, while those on the relationship between sedimentary environment and lithofacies development are rare. However, a clear understanding on the relationship is of great significance to the muddy shale oil and gas exploration. This paper studied the muddy shale of semideep and deep lacustrine facies in the lower submember of Member 3 of Shahejie Formation in FY-1 Well, Dongying Sag, Bohai Bay Basin, East China. Based on geochemical data, the sedimentary environment media conditions and vertical changes of this submember were analyzed by means of core description, thin section authentication, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and other technologies, and the relationship between sedimentary environment and lithofacies development was discussed. The results show that this environment underwent three stages and is featured by cyclicity. From the bottom up, it experienced the semideep, deep, and deep/semideep waters under the relatively dry-cold/relatively warm-wet, warm-wet, and warm-wet/relatively warm-wet paleoclimates, respectively. Correspondingly, the paleoredox transited three stages from reducibility to high reducibility to high reducibility/reducibility; the paleosalinity changed from saline water to brackish water to brackish/saline water. Paleoproductivity was low/relatively high at the beginning, then became high, and finally relatively high. In this submember, the lithofacies primarily includes organic-rich mudstone, organic-rich lime mudstone, organic-rich lime-bearing mudstone, and organic-contained argillaceous limestone/lime mudstone. The sedimentary environment controls the mineral composition and content in the lithofacies and thus determines the lithofacies types. Meanwhile, the cyclicity of environmental change not only leads to that of the lithofacies development but also affects the positions of the lithofacies and its assemblages in sequence stratigraphic framework.

TI  - SIGAN: Spectral Index Generative Adversarial Network for Data Augmentation in Multispectral Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Generative models are typically employed to approximate the distribution of deep features. Recently, these state-of-the-art methods have been applied to estimate image transformations by an unsupervised learning approach. In this letter, a novel spectral index generative adversarial network (SIGAN) is proposed for the generation of multispectral (MS) remote sensing images. This network is defined to effectively perform data augmentation starting from a limited number of training samples in the MS remote sensing domain for training deep learning models. The SIGAN model is able to capture class-specific properties in data augmentation, by incorporating the task-specific normalized spectral indices to model class-by-class properties of MS images. Experimental results obtained on a Sentinel 2 dataset show that the proposed model provides better performance than other generative adversarial networks (GANs) in MS data generation.

TI  - How does spatiotemporal variations and impact factors in CO2 emissions differ across cities in China? Investigation on grid scale and geographic detection method
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate assessments of the spatiotemporal variations and impact factors of CO2 emissions are crucial for developing effective and rational CO2 reduction policies. However, studies are still lacking that consider spatiotemporal variations in CO2 emissions at the grid scale and their impact factors in cities with different types of such emissions. This study proposes an improved estimation model to map the CO2 emissions of mainland China in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2018 based on nighttime light data, land use data, and population data. The resulting maps of estimated CO2 emissions in different regions are examined and compared with Landsat data and with the results of linear regression, quadratic polynomial carbon emission models, carbon emission models based on land use and carbon emission models based on population. This comparison shows that the model proposed in this study is more accurate than ordinary models, such as the linear regression and quadratic polynomial models. Using the results of this model, 356 mainland cities in China are divided into serviceoriented, industrial, agricultural and comprehensive cities, and the impact factors of each city are analyzed. The results show that China's CO2 emissions are still concentrated in its smaller regions, but the intensity of this concentration is gradually decreasing. The spatial distribution characteristics of the carbon emissions of cities have an obvious circle-layer effect; however, the CO2 emissions of large cities present a "W"-shaped distribution, while the CO2 emissions of small cities present a power function curve. Although GDP is the main factor affecting the CO2 emissions in various cities, the factors affecting different types of cities based on their CO2 emissions vary greatly. These results could improve the current understanding of the patterns of variation and influencing factors of CO2 emissions in different cities and provide a scientific basis for formulating CO2 emission reduction policies in accordance with local conditions.

TI  - Slowdown of the greening trend in natural vegetation with further rise in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data reveal widespread changes in Earth's vegetation cover. Regions intensively attended to by humans are mostly greening due to land management. Natural vegetation, on the other hand, is exhibiting patterns of both greening and browning in all continents. Factors linked to anthropogenic carbon emissions, such as CO2 fertilization, climate change, and consequent disturbances such as fires and droughts, are hypothesized to be key drivers of changes in natural vegetation. A rigorous regional attribution at the biome level that can be scaled to a global picture of what is behind the observed changes is currently lacking. Here we analyze different datasets of decades-long satellite observations of global leaf area index (LAI, 19812017) as well as other proxies for vegetation changes and identify several clusters of significant long-term changes. Using process-based model simulations (Earth system and land surface models), we disentangle the effects of anthropogenic carbon emissions on LAI in a probabilistic setting applying causal counterfactual theory. The analysis prominently indicates the effects of climate change on many biomes - warming in northern ecosystems (greening) and rainfall anomalies in tropical biomes (browning). The probabilistic attribution method clearly identifies the CO2 fertilization effect as the dominant driver in only two biomes, the temperate forests and cool grasslands, challenging the view of a dominant global-scale effect. Altogether, our analysis reveals a slowing down of greening and strengthening of browning trends, particularly in the last 2 decades. Most models substantially underestimate the emerging vegetation browning, especially in the tropical rainforests. Leaf area loss in these productive ecosystems could be an early indicator of a slowdown in the terrestrial carbon sink. Models need to account for this effect to realize plausible climate projections of the 21st century.

T2  - ANNALS OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective Sentinel lymph-node (SLN) mapping for early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is comprehensive and consequently time-consuming and costly. This study evaluated the clinical value of several SLN imaging components and analyzed the accuracy for SLN identification using a streamlined SLN imaging protocol in early-stage OSCC.Materials and methods This retrospective within-patient evaluation study compared both number and localization of identified SLNs between the conventional SLN imaging protocol and a streamlined imaging protocol (dynamic lymphoscintigraphy (LSG) for 10 min directly post-injection and SPECT-CT at similar to 2 h post-injection). LSG and SPECT-CT images of 77 early-stage OSCC patients, scheduled for SLN biopsy, were evaluated by three observers. Identified SLNs using either protocol were related to histopathological assessment of harvested SLNs, complementary neck dissection specimens and follow-up status.Results A total of 200 SLNs were identified using the streamlined protocol, and 12 additional SLNs (n = 212) were identified with the conventional protocol in 10 patients. Of those, 9/12 were identified on early static LSG and 3/12 on late static LSG. None of the additionally identified SLNs contained metastases; none of those in whom additional SLNs were identified developed regional recurrence during follow-up. Only inferior alveolar process carcinoma showed a higher rate of additionally identified SLNs with the conventional protocol (p = 0.006).Conclusion Early dynamic LSG can be reduced to 10 min. Late static LSG may be omitted, except in those with a history of oncological neck treatment or with OSCC featuring slow lymphatic drainage. Early static LSG appeared to be contributory in most OSCC subsites.

TI  - Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data for more accurate earthquake catalogs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The accuracy of earthquake catalogs limits the reliability of earthquake hazard assessment and the comprehensive understanding of earthquake mechanisms. Current seismic catalogs are based on the inversion of seismic wave data. The accuracy of their source parameters, which reflect the quantity and layout of seismic stations, and the crustal velocity model used, are often highly uncertain. The open source and popularization of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) deformation data offer the potential to provide more accurate source parameters for earthquake catalogs. In this study, we used same-source InSAR data and a consistent processing approach (i.e., the same sampling, inversion algorithm, and processing flow) to obtain the fault slip models and source parameters of 56 earthquakes, covering most of earthquakes observed by the Sentinel-1 since 2014; these were then used to form a unified InSAR earthquake catalog (U-InSAR). We then compiled a second InSAR earthquake catalog (C-InSAR) based on the source parameters of an additional 164 earthquakes inverted using InSAR deformation data from various sources by previous studies, among which 45 earthquakes included additional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data. The C-InSAR catalog was used to evaluate the impact of data sources and processing approach on the consistency of InSAR catalogs; we found no significant differences between the U-and C-InSAR catalogs. Secondly, the combined U-and C-InSAR catalogs were compared with seismological catalogs, and showed significantly improved seismic source locations, depths, moment magnitudes, fault strikes, fault dips, and fault rakes. Our results confirm the rationality and feasibility of constructing earthquake catalogs using source parameters from a variety of InSAR data sources and inversion algorithms. We emphasize that InSAR catalogs can provide an important supplement, improvement, and/or correction to seismological catalogs, and can provide important basic data for more refined and reliable research on earthquake mechanisms and hazard assessments. Finally, we set up a preliminary sharing and distribution system for InSAR-based catalogs.

TI  - Assessment of LST spatial and temporal changes in Jazmourian basin, southeast Iran
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an atmosphere-land interaction, which represents the first thermal reaction of the environmental changes occurring in the earth surface, being one of the most important factors used in the earth sciences. Jazmourian basin, in the southeast of Iran, is a fertile agricultural land with diverse topography and unique climatic conditions. Due to its significance as one of the most important agricultural poles of Iran, the LST variations are of great interest due to their high impact on the environmental processes, especially in the land cover. In recent years, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer images have been extensively used to estimate the LST due to their spatial and temporal homogeneity and freely available showing improved capabilities of climate analysis in the areas with scarce observation networks. We used a combination of MOD11C3 and MYD11C3 products of daytime and nighttime LST, covering the complete circadian cycle over Jazmourian basin, from 2003 to 2019. Results showed varied trends by months with a significantly positive increase in January. The spatial distribution revealed a generalized positive anomaly in the whole study area, with the highest values in central lowlands and lowest at eastern high elevations of the basin. The temporal and spatial analyses indicated high temperature differences between months and seasons as well as a wide range from -10 degrees C to 65 degrees C.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The study on land use and land cover (LULC) changes assists in analyzing the change and regulates environment sustainability. Hence, this research analyzes the Northern TN coast, which is under both natural and anthropogenic stress. The analysis of LULC changes and LULC projections for the region between 2009-2019 and 2019-2030 was performed utilizing Google Earth Engine (GEE), TerrSet, and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. LULC image is generated from Landsat images and classified in GEE using Random Forest (RF). LULC maps were then framed with the CA-Markov model to forecast future LULC change. It was carried out in four steps: (1) change analysis, (2) transition potential, (3) change prediction, and (4) model validation. For analyzing change statistics, the study region is divided into zone 1 and zone 2. In both zones, the water body shows a decreasing trend, and built-up areas are in increasing trend. Barren land and vegetation classes are found to be under stress, developing into built-up. The overall accuracy was above 89%, and the kappa coefficient was above 87% for all 3 years. This study can provide suggestions and a basis for urban development planning as it is highly susceptible to coastal flooding.

TI  - Towards a better understanding of conceptual difficulties in introductory quantum physics courses
T2  - STUDIES IN SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on teaching and learning quantum physics (QP) frequently explores students' conceptual difficulties to identify common patterns in their reasoning. The abstractness of QP is often found to be at the origin of students' conceptual difficulties. Due to this abstract nature students resort to common sense reasoning or classical thinking when they make meaning of QP phenomena. In this literature review, the 'abstractness' is closely investigated and nuanced to uncover what reasons for the abstractness students experience. Four reasons for students' conceptual difficulties can be categorised under the abstract nature of QP. These reasons are that students struggle a) to relate the mathematical formalism of QP to experiences in the physical world; b) to interpret counterintuitive QP phenomena and concepts; c) to transit from a deterministic to a probabilistic worldview; and d) to understand the limitations of language to express quantum phenomena, concepts, and objects. Combining these four reasons allows us to better understand the origin of conceptual difficulties in QP and why these difficulties persist over time. The implications of these findings for research and teaching practice are discussed.

TI  - Climate change and deforestation increase the vulnerability of Amazonian forests to post-fire grass invasion
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim We aimed to evaluate the vulnerability of the Amazon forest to post-fire grass invasion under present and future climate scenarios. Location Amazon Basin. Time period 1981-2017 and 2070-2099. Major taxa studied Plants. Methods We combined a fire-ecosystem model with remote sensing data and empirically-derived equations to evaluate the effects of a high-intensity fire (i.e., during an extreme drought) and logging in forest edges on tree canopy, and exotic grass cover under present and unmitigated climate change scenarios. We also contrasted simulated vegetation recovery time (as a function of climate variability) and current fire return intervals to identify areas in which fire-grass feedbacks could lock the system in a grass-dominated state. Results Under current climatic conditions, 14% of the Amazon was found to be vulnerable to post-fire grass invasion, with the south-eastern Amazon at the highest risk of invasion. We found that under unmitigated climate change, by the end of the century, 21% of the Amazon would be vulnerable to post-fire grass invasion. In 3% of the Amazon, fire return intervals are already shorter than the time required for grass exclusion by canopy recovery, implying a high risk of irreversible shifts to a fire-maintained degraded forest grassy state. The south-eastern region of the Amazon is currently at highest risk of irreversible degradation. Main conclusions Although resilience is evident in areas with low fire activity, increased fire frequency and intensity could push large Amazon forest areas towards a tipping point, causing transitions to states with low tree and high grass cover.

TI  - The Association Between the Number of Retrieved Pelvic Lymph Nodes and Ipsilateral Lower Limb Lymphedema in Patients With Gynecologic Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose While the risk of lower limb lymphedema (LLE) after radical surgery for gynecologic malignancies is multifactorial, the limited assessment of lymph nodes (LNs), such as sentinel LN biopsy, has been incorporated into a standard procedure. We assessed the relationship between the number of LNs retrieved from the hemipelvis and the incidence of ipsilateral LLE (iLLE). Methods This retrospective study included 103 women with gynecologic cancer who had LNs removed with minimally invasive surgery between January 2014 and December 2018. For early detection of LLE, the patients were followed up by a lymphedema specialist who complied with the International Society of Lymphedema criteria. Potential risk factors for LLE were collected, and the risk factors were further investigated according to the number of LNs removed in a side-specific manner. Results LLE was diagnosed in 32 (31.1%) patients, and most of them were diagnosed with unilateral (n = 22) LLE rather than bilateral (n = 10). The number of pelvic LNs removed (p = 0.018), no lymphatic mapping (p = 0.034), and radiation (p = 0.020) were associated with the development of one or both LLEs. A side-specific analysis revealed that the incidence of iLLE increased significantly when four or more LNs were removed from the hemipelvis compared with three or fewer LNs (22.9% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.048). Conclusions The number of pelvic LNs retrieved was associated with the incidence of LLE in patients with early gynecologic cancer. We identified the cutoff number per hemipelvis through side-specific analysis that could minimize the risk of iLLE. Further studies are needed to validate our results.

TI  - Soil moisture retrieval over agricultural fields through integration of synthetic aperture radar and optical images
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The soil roughness and two-way vegetation transmissivity parameters affect the radar backscattered signal; therefore, the results of the soil moisture retrieval from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. In this paper, the Improved Water Cloud Model was extended to specify the effects of the above parameters. The surface roughness parameter values were calculated for each ground measurement site using an artificial neural network. This parameter was then used in the proposed models to rectify the effects of surface roughness on soil moisture estimation. Also, the Normalized Difference Water Index, derived from Landsat 5 imagery, was used to account for the impact of the vegetation canopy on the SAR backscatter. The accuracy of the proposed model was assessed using AIRSAR C-, L-, and P-band data, ALOS PALSAR L-band and two reference data were collected during NASA's SMEX03 and SMAPVEX08 campaigns. The experimental results indicated that the proposed models had improved the RMSE and R values with respect to those in the IWCM in all bands and polarizations, with the highest values concerning the L band and VV polarization. In this band, the value of RMSE decreased by 0.002 (6.25%), and R increased by 0.054 (9.45%).

TI  - Impact of local vaccine subsidization programs on the prevention of mumps in Japan
T2  - HUMAN VACCINES & IMMUNOTHERAPEUTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In Japan, although a mumps vaccination is outside the national universal vaccination program, some local governments have implemented their own program. However, little is known regarding the implementation status and the impact of these programs. In this study, we investigated the impact on the prevention of mumps, after identification of the status of the local government subsidization programs. We identified the implementation status of the subsidization programs using the websites of local governments. We retrieved the number of reported mumps cases from designated sentinel sites through the Surveillance of Infectious Diseases System implemented according to the Infectious Disease Control Law. Using this data, the impact of the subsidization program on prevention of mumps was assessed by comparing the number of mumps cases per site during the 2015-2016 outbreak among the areas categorized by the subsidization status, using a Poisson regression model. As of 2019, 26.2% (456/1,739) of the local governments were considered as having subsidization programs. We retrieved 52,719 mumps cases from 2010 to 2019. The number of mumps cases per sentinel site tended to be low in areas implementing a subsidization program, compared with the no-implementation areas throughout the data collection period. The adjusted model confirmed that the subsidization program implemented between 2010 and 2015 impacted on the number of mumps cases during the 2015-2016 outbreak, with a decrease in the numbers. Further studies with detailed data including vaccination coverage should be conducted.

TI  - Locally adaptive change-point detection (LACPD) with applications to environmental changes
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose an adaptive-sliding-window approach (LACPD) for the problem of change-point detection in a set of time-ordered observations. The proposed method is combined with sub-sampling techniques to compensate for the lack of enough data near the time series' tails. Through a simulation study, we analyse its behaviour in the presence of an early/middle/late change-point in the mean, and compare its performance with some of the frequently used and recently developed change-point detection methods in terms of power, type I error probability, area under the ROC curves (AUC), absolute bias, variance, and root-mean-square error (RMSE). We conclude that LACPD outperforms other methods by maintaining a low type I error probability. Unlike some other methods, the performance of LACPD does not depend on the time index of change-points, and it generally has lower bias than other alternative methods. Moreover, in terms of variance and RMSE, it outperforms other methods when change-points are close to the time series' tails, whereas it shows a similar (sometimes slightly poorer) performance as other methods when change-points are close to the middle of time series. Finally, we apply our proposal to two sets of real data: the well-known example of annual flow of the Nile river in Awsan, Egypt, from 1871 to 1970, and a novel remote sensing data application consisting of a 34-year time-series of satellite images of the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index in Wadi As-Sirham valley, Saudi Arabia, from 1986 to 2019. We conclude that LACPD shows a good performance in detecting the presence of a change as well as the time and magnitude of change in real conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of extreme dust storm over the northwest Indo-Gangetic plain using WRF-Chem model
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses a high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with the chemistry module (WRF-Chem) to analyze the dust storm that occurred during 12-17 June 2018 over the northwest Indo-Gangetic Plain (NW-IGP). The performance of WRF-Chem is validated against the ground- and space-based datasets before being used to investigate the impact of the dust storm on the air quality and radiative changes. The aerosols and meteorological parameters from in situ, satellite and reanalysis were used to evaluate the WRF-Chem model. The horizontal and vertical distributions of dust aerosols reproduced by the WRF-Chem agree with the observations. However, the WRF-Chem-simulated mean aerosol optical depth (AOD similar to 1.21 +/- 0.17) is slightly underestimated compared to MODIS AOD (1.60 +/- 0.32). Furthermore, the evolution of dust storm and associated changes in atmospheric and air quality conditions are well simulated by the WRF-Chem. The ERA5 and WRF-Chem suggest that the dust storm is triggered by the low-pressure system over the NW-IGP, which helps in bringing the dust-laden air masses from the west and southwest of the study region with the strong southwesterly winds. Our results reveal that the dust storm has a significant impact on air quality and horizontal visibility. During the peak time of the dust storm, the horizontal visibility dropped drastically from 4 to 0.48 km. In addition, the daily averaged in situ and model-simulated PM10 and PM2.5 concentration abruptly increased by a factor of two on peak time of the storm that deteriorated the air quality. The WRF-Chem-simulated dust-induced net radiative forcing shows the surface cooling (- 16.18 +/- 3.88 Wm(-2)), atmospheric warming (+ 11.62 +/- 4.96 Wm(-2)) and top of the atmospheric cooling (- 4.57 +/- 0.92 Wm(-2)) due to the presence of elevated dust aerosols.

TI  - Application of an improved vegetation index based on the visible spectrum in the diagnosis of degraded pastures: Implications for development
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Inadequate pasture management causes land degradation through reduction of grass, increased presence of invasive plants or pests, compaction, erosion, and nutrient deficiency. The recognition of pasture degradation is therefore essential. Remote sensing satellite systems allow us to do so at regional-to global scales. A struggle is in progress nowadays is to improve detection accuracy and implement high-resolution surveys at farm scales using low-cost unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The pasture imagery can be translated into maps of degraded pasture using the popular NDVI as diagnostic parameter, but their generation using a UAV requires a high-cost NIR sensor, while the struggle is to use low-cost UAVs equipped with RGB cameras. The first step to recognize degraded pastures using RGB cameras is to define a suitable vegetation index. Thus, the purpose of this study was to present the total brightness quotient of red (TBQR), green (TBQG), and blue (TBQB) bands. The test to the index resorted to LANDSAT-8 satellite images captured over the environmental protection area of Uberaba River basin (Minas Gerais, Brazil) in the 2017-2019 period. The images were not captured by a UAV because the equipment was not then available. The results were promising given the large detection accuracy (88.63%) of the TBQG and the high (0.965) correlation between TBQG and NDVI. Besides, the TBQ-based areas of degraded pasture (17,486.3-25,180.1 hectares) were larger than the NDVI counterparts (12,066.9 hectares). This is an additional reason to oversight degraded pastures based on the TBQs, as they seek for improved environmental compliance and economic development.

TI  - Snapshot Wisconsin: networking community scientists and remote sensing to improve ecological monitoring and management
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological data collection is entering a new era. Community science, satellite remote sensing (SRS), and local forms of remote sensing (e.g., camera traps and acoustic recordings) have enabled biological data to be collected at unprecedented spatial and temporal scales and resolution. There is growing interest in developing observation networks to collect and synthesize data to improve broad-scale ecological monitoring, but no examples of such networks have emerged to inform decision-making by agencies. Here, we present the implementation of one such jurisdictional observation network (JON), Snapshot Wisconsin, which links synoptic environmental data derived from SRS to biodiversity observations collected continuously from a trail camera network to support management decision-making. We use several examples to illustrate that Snapshot Wisconsin improves the spatial, temporal, and biological resolution and extent of information available to support management, filling gaps associated with traditional monitoring and enabling consideration of new management strategies. JONs like Snapshot Wisconsin further strengthen monitoring inference by contributing novel lines of evidence useful for corroboration or integration. SRS provides environmental context that facilitates inference, prediction, and forecasting, and ultimately helps managers formulate, test, and refine conceptual models for the monitored systems. Although these approaches pose challenges, Snapshot Wisconsin demonstrates that expansive observation networks can be tractably managed by agencies to support decision making, providing a powerful new tool for agencies to better achieve their missions and reshape the nature of environmental decision-making.

TI  - Satellite-derived NDVI underestimates the advancement of alpine vegetation growth over the past three decades
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data are increasingly relied on to reveal the growth responses of vegetation to climate change, yet the vegetation growth tracking accuracy of these data remains unclear due to a lack of long-term field data. Here, we adopted a unique field-measured seasonal aboveground biomass dataset from 1982-2014 to assess the potential of using satellite-derived NDVI data to match field data in regard to the interannual variability in seasonal vegetation growth in a Tibetan alpine grassland. We revealed that Global Inventory Monitoring and Modeling System (GIMMS) NDVI data captured the advancement of field-measured vegetation growth throughout the entire study period but not from 2000-2014, while MODIS NDVI data still observed this advancing trend after 2000 to a limited extent. However, satellite-derived NDVI data consistently underestimated the advancement degree of field-measured vegetation growth, regardless of whether GIMMS or MODIS NDVI data were considered. We tentatively attribute this underestimation to an increased ratio of grass biomass to forb biomass, which could delay the advancement of NDVI development but not affect that of field-measured biomass development. Our results suggest that satellite-derived NDVI data may miss critical responses of vegetation growth to global climate change, potentially due to long-term shifts in plant community composition.

TI  - Efficient land desertification detection using a deep learning-driven generative adversarial network approach: A case study
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precisely detecting land cover changes aids in improving the analysis of the dynamics of the landscape and plays an essential role in mitigating the effects of desertification. Mainly, sensing desertification is challenging due to the high correlation between desertification and like-desertification events (e.g., deforestation). An efficient and flexible deep learning approach is introduced to address desertification detection through Landsat imagery. Essentially, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based desertification detector is designed and for uncovering the pixels influenced by land cover changes. In this study, the adopted features have been derived from multi-temporal images and incorporate multispectral information without considering image segmentation preprocessing. Furthermore, to address desertification detection challenges, the GAN-based detector is constructed based on desertification-free features and then employed to identify atypical events associated with desertification changes. The GAN-detection algorithm flexibly learns relevant information from linear and nonlinear processes without prior assumption on data distribution and significantly enhances the detection's accuracy. The GAN-based desertification detector's performance has been assessed via multi-temporal Landsat optical images from the arid area nearby Biskra in Algeria. This region is selected in this work because desertification phenomena heavily impact it. Compared to some state-of-the-art methods, including deep Boltzmann machine (DBM), deep belief network (DBN), convolutional neural network (CNN), as well as two ensemble models, namely, random forests and AdaBoost, the proposed GAN-based detector offers superior discrimination performance of deserted regions. Results show the promising potential of the proposed GAN-based method for the analysis and detection of desertification changes. Results also revealed that the GAN-driven desertification detection approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to assess the performance of the Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 sensors to map forest fires. We choose two fire events, the Haddad fire and the Sidi Ferdjani fire, in northwestern Tunisia in 2017. Several spectral indices were derived from each sensor and the performance of each spectral index was assessed. A validation exercise was undertaken for each fire to compare the spatial matching between the burned area retrieved from each spectral index and its homologue obtained from the Emergency Management Service (EMS). Our results indicate that Delta NBR and its relativized version RBR derived from both sensors exhibit the highest discrimination power (M-statistic values >2.5). The Sentinel sensor is slightly more efficient than the Landsat 8 in mapping burned scars, but both sensors produce acceptable results. We conclude that both sensors could be a good alternative to EFFIS data, particularly when there is a need to detect details inside the burned areas.

TI  - Analysis of trends and changes in the successional trajectories of tropical forest using the Landsat NDVI time series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetative growth of forest canopies changes their spectral response, which can be detected by multispectral sensors and enhanced by utilizing the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The structural variability of canopies in heterogeneous forests can also be related to successional stages. Thereby, a spatiotemporal methodology is presented to associate the 3D photogrammetric information, derived from aerial images, with the NDVI time series extracted from the Landsat imagery, using spatial units connected to ecological succession. The technique is based on time series clustering within superpixels (extracted from the local variance of tree heights) and on trend analysis of the canopy using the breaks for additive season and trend (BFAST) algorithm. The study was conducted in a tropical native forest remnant (Inland Atlantic Forest) in the western region of Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We investigated the relationship between the variability of the forest vertical structure and the NDVI temporal trajectory associated with vegetation vigor in the period from 1984 to 2010. The experiments produced a regularized time series of overlaid superpixels. The cluster statistical analysis was successful in separating the NDVI trajectory into ten classes associated to successional stages, in which the evolution of the vegetation vigor could be observed and compared within degraded, transitional, and preserved areas. Such areas overlapping with the ten trajectory classes allowed us to quantify that 59.9% of the clusters were related to preserved areas, 30.1% to transitional areas, and 10.0% to degraded areas. Additionally, the BFAST algorithm allowed the identification of trend measures and the occurrence of disturbance events within these trajectory classes based on the vegetation response. Therefore, the classification of NDVI trajectory clusters helps to understand how the areas in a heterogeneous forest with different succession stages develop spectrally. Furthermore, monitoring secondary forests is essential for the conservation of biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, and carbon stock, among other values.

TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for exposure to <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> in slaughterhouse workers in western Kenya
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Toxoplasma gondii is a zoonotic protozoan parasite infecting warm-blooded animals. Infection in people can occur through ingestion of oocysts passed in the faeces of the definitive hosts; ingestion of bradyzoites in the tissue of infected intermediate hosts; or exposure to tachyzoites in raw milk and eggs. Slaughterhouse workers are considered a high-risk group for T. gondii exposure because of their contact with raw meat, although a positive relationship between handling raw meat and T. gondii seropositivity has not been demonstrated in all studies. This study aimed to determine the seroprevalence of antibodies to T. gondii in slaughterhouse workers in Kenya and identify risk factors associated with seropositivity. Methods A survey of slaughterhouse workers was conducted in 142 slaughter facilities in the study area. Information regarding demographics, contact with livestock, meat consumption, and practices in the slaughterhouse was collected using structured questionnaires. Commercial ELISAs were used to detect IgM and IgG antibodies against T. gondii and a multi-level logistic regression model was used to identify potential risk factors for seropositivity in slaughterhouse workers. Results The apparent prevalence of antibodies to T. gondii was 84.0% (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 81.2-86.5%) for IgG and 2.2% (95% CI 1.3-3.5%) for IgM antibodies. All IgM positive individuals were IgG positive. Risk factors for exposure to T. gondii were: increasing age (Odds Ratio (OR) 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.05); owning poultry (OR 2.00; 95% CI 1.11-3.62); and consuming animal blood (OR 1.92; 95% CI 1.21-3.03). Conclusions The seroprevalence of antibodies to T. gondii was very high in this population and considerably higher than published values in the general population. Risk factors included age, owning poultry and drinking animal blood which were consistent with previous reports but none were specifically associated with working in the slaughterhouse. In this instance slaughterhouse workers may represent a useful sentinel for the general population where the level of exposure is also likely to be high and may signify an unidentified public health risk to vulnerable groups such as pregnant women. A detailed understanding of the epidemiology of infection is required, which should include an assessment of incidence, mortality, and burden since T. gondii infection is likely to have life-long sequelae.

TI  - Death primes in advertisements: how international advertisers can ensure their message is effective
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mortality salience is omnipresent in the life of consumers. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, when consumers retire, or when they consider products related to death such as life insurance. This research examines how consumers' level of religious commitment and geographic location influence response to death primes in advertisements. Using terror management theory as a conceptual framework, three experiments examine differences between consumers sampled from countries in Asia and the Americas. Study 1 reveals that consumers sampled from an Asian (vs. American) country respond more positively to death primes (vs. no prime) in advertisements. Study 2 replicates these findings and shows that religious commitment moderates such effects, with lower religious commitment consumers being more reactive to death primes than higher religious commitment consumers. Study 3 confirms religion's influence by priming religion and identifies perceived product need as mediating the relationship between the interaction of religion x death prime x country and advertised product evaluations. Practical implications for international advertising are provided.

TI  - Above-ground biomass estimation models of mangrove forests based on remote sensing and field-surveyed data: Implications for C-PFES implementation in Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The free charge and open-source of remote sensing imagery, including Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, offer new opportunities for forest-based AGB mapping and monitoring, especially mangrove forests in the tropics. Modelling relationships between mangrove AGB estimation-based survey and remote sensing data (spectral bands and vegetation indices) have not been evaluated in Quang Ninh Province, Vietnam. In this study, we evaluated the capability of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data for the retrieval and predictive mapping of mangrove AGB in Mong Cai Coast, Quang Ninh Province as a case study. We used 2019 Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 to develop AGB estimation models through stepwise linear regression approaches in R statistics. We developed models each from spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The results showed that the models based on spectral bands and vegetation indices derived from Sentinel-2 were more accurate in predicting the overall AGB of mangrove forests than those of Landsat-8 data. High correlation values between AGB and Sentinel 2-derived vegetation indices (Model 6.6, r(2) = 0.973; Model 6.7, r(2) = 0.982; Model 6.8, r(2) = 0.988) and Landsat-8-derived vegetation indices (Model 6.1, r(2) = 0.927; Model 6.2, r(2) = 0.927; Model 6.3, r(2) = 0.939); and between AGB and Sentinel-2-derived spectral bands (Model 5.5, r(2) = 972; Model 5.4, r(2) = 0.975); between AGB and Landsat-8 derived spectral bands (Model 5.2, r(2) = 0.913; Model 5.3, r(2) = 0.935; Model 5.1, r(2) = 0.855) were obtained. The developed AGB estimation models have high prediction accuracy, agreements of observed and predicted AGB values of 89.88% for Landsat-8 derived vegetation index (Model 6.2), 96.51% for Sentinel-2 derived vegetation index (Model 6.6). Overall, both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 provide satisfactory results in the retrieval and predictive mapping of mangrove AGB. Our study suggests that mangrove conservation under C-PFES schemes should be applied over Quang Ninh Coast based on AGB estimation models developed. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Integration of phlebotomine ecological niche modelling, and mapping of cutaneous leishmaniasis surveillance data, to identify areas at risk of under-estimation
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Passive surveillance systems are thought to under-estimate the true incidence of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) by two- to five-fold. Ecological niche models based on remotely sensed data can identify environmental factors which favor phlebotomine vectors. Here we report an integrated approach to identifying areas at risk of cutaneous leishmaniasis by applying spatial analysis methods to niche model results, and local surveillance data, in two locations in Colombia with differing vector ecology. The objective was to identify townships in which later phases of the project could implement community-based surveillance to obtain direct estimates of under-reporting.Materials and methods: The study was carried out in one municipality in each of two departments of the Andean region of Colombia: Pueblo Rico in Risaralda, and Rovira in Tolima. Niche mapping by maximum entropy, based on published and unpublished existing locations of Pintomyia (Pifanomyia) longiflocosa and Psychodopygus panamensis, and using variables on land cover, climate and elevation. Field catches were done in each municipality to test predictions of high relative probability of presence. The niche model results were included as a predictor in a conditional autoregressive spatial model, in which the outcome variable was the number of cases by township, as detected by passive surveillance.Results: Having rarefied 173 geolocated records, 46 of Pi. longiflocosa and 57 of Ps. panamensis were used for the niche modelling. At the national level, both species had high relative probability of presence on parts of the slopes of the three Andean cordilleras. Pi. longiflocosa also has a high relative probability of presence in the higher parts of the Magdalena valley, as does Ps. panamensis in some areas close to the Caribbean coast. At the local level, field catches confirmed that Pi. longiflocosa was the most abundant species in Rovira, and likewise Ps. panamensis in Pueblo Rico. The spatial regression showed that the incidence of ACL, according to surveillance, was positively, but not statistically significantly, associated with the relative probability of presence from the risk model.Conclusions: These niche maps bring together published and unpublished results on phlebotomine species which are important vectors in Colombia. Maps of the fitted values of incidence were used to guide the selection of townships in which further phases of the study will attempt to quantify the extent of under-estimation of ACL incidence.

TI  - Multi-hazard susceptibility and exposure assessment of the Hindu Kush Himalaya
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountainous regions are highly hazardous, and these hazards often lead to loss of human life. The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH.

TI  - Incidence of complications, organizational problems, and errors: Unexpected events in 1605 patients
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Besides surgical complications, a variety of adverse events may affect patients' comfort and outcome. The purpose of this prospective study was to identify the incidence and impact of all unexpected events in pediatric surgical patients. Methods: All unexpected events that occurred in our department during the period of February 2017- July 2018 were prospectively assessed. Complications associated with surgery, non-surgical treatment, errors and organizational problems were included. Events were classified using a modified version of Clavien-Dindo. Sentinel events were defined as death, serious injury, or the risk thereof (grade IV-V). Organizational events were analyzed separately. All events were discussed during morbidity and mortality conferences, and the results and measures were documented. Results: Unexpected events occurred in 297 of 1605 patients (18.5%), of whom 1124 (70%) had undergone surgery. More than half of all events were not associated with an operation ( n = 237; 54%). The severity of all events was mostly minor (grade I-IIIb; n = 410; 94%). Twenty-eight sentinel events (IV-V) occurred (6% of all events). Twenty-two (2%) patients died; however, none of these deaths were related to surgery. The top 5 events included organizational problems in 78 instants (18%), wound healing disorders in 44 (10%), recurrence of initial problems in 36 (8%), dislocation of indwelling catheters in 26 (6%) and bleeding in 16 (4%). Errors were identified in 15 patients (3%). We derived 10 changes of concepts of management or treatment. Conclusion: The incidence of unexpected events in pediatric surgical patients is high when complications associated with surgical and non-surgical treatment and organizational alterations are documented prospectively. In our study, most events were minor and did not substantially affect patients' outcomes. Prospective assessment helped to identify organizational shortcomings and develop preventive strategies.

TI  - Logging Amazon forest increased the severity and spread of fires during the 2015-2016 El Nino
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires degrade Amazon forest and its natural functions. Logging, deforestation and the increased frequency of prolonged droughts have contributed to the high recurrence of forest fires in the Amazon. Fires have impacted areas that, until recently, were considered immune to fire, such as the southern portion of the Brazilian state of Roraima, which is characterized by forest types that occur in environments with high natural humidity but that are now strongly impacted by selective logging (SL). The objective of this study was to determine the severity and spread of fire in the forests of southern Roraima, taking as a reference the great forest fire that occurred during the 2015-2016 El Nin tilde o. We mapped fire scars and forest biomass from remote sensing and data from forest inventories in a 6657.3 km2 study area, of which 6512.4 km2 (97.8%) had originally been forest and 5412.3 km2 (81.3%) was still forest in 2016. The 2015/2016 fires affected an estimated at 682.2 km2, or 12.6% of the area that was still forest in 2016. Vulnerability maps of the forest were made using the weights-of-evidence method. The biomass impacted by fire totaled 26.4 x 106 Mg, representing 9.5% of the total mapped for the study area (277.4 x 106 Mg). The biomass killed by the fire totaled 5.9 x 106 Mg, representing 22.3% of the biomass affected by the fires. The highest level of fire severity (very strong) proportionally affected 84.6% more forest biomass inside than outside SL areas. Forest vulnerability to fires increased by 265.5% in terms of area and by 400.7% in terms of biomass when exposed to SL. Logging also increased the severity of fires when they occurred: a hectare of burned forest was 85.9% more likely to have a "very strong" fire if it had been previously logged, and burned areas that had been logged lost, on average, 2.9% more of their pre-fire biomass to the fire than those that had not been logged (86.5 Mg ha- 1 versus 84.0 Mg ha-1). Considering only the ombrophilous forest, the mean biomass of forest that was logged and burned was 310.7 Mg ha- 1, or 30.8% lower than the mean biomass of 448.7 Mg ha- 1 in logged but unburned areas, showing a substantial biomass loss to fire (average of 138.0 Mg ha-1). SL more than doubled the impact of fire on biomass loss as compared to the impact of the logging itself. In addition to its contribution to carbon emissions and other impacts, the amplifying effect of SL on forest fires indicates that the assumption that authorized forest management projects in Amazonia are sustainable is unwarranted. The future role of this practice should be rethought, existing projects should be subject to close inspection and control, and unauthorized logging should be identified and repressed. The policy of allowing sale of wood from clearcutting projects should be rethought because it provides a loophole for laundering wood from illegal logging.

TI  - Summer Phytoplankton Blooms Induced by Upwelling in the Western South China Sea
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During summer, phytoplankton blooms occur frequently off the southeast Vietnam coast in the western South China Sea (WSCS). Using multi-source remote sensing data, such as sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface wind (SSW), aerosol optical thickness (AOT), sea level anomalies (SLA), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) data from 1998 to 2020 and in situ observations of analyzed data, we report the patterns of spatial variation of summer phytoplankton blooms in this region. The partial correlation and multiple stepwise linear regression analyses reveal that Ekman transport (ET) and Ekman pumping velocity (EPV) exert a greater impact on the summer phytoplankton blooms than the other environmental factors, suggesting that the phytoplankton blooms in the region may be mainly triggered by the enhanced nutrients by wind-induced upwelling and vertical mixing. AOT only weakly correlates with Chl-a concentration in the region, probably these prominent abundant nutrients in the region come from upwelling and convective-overturn. A northeastward jet causes the distribution of high Chl-a in the WSCS to be plume-shaped. A new finding in this study is that the northward current in this area may cause the northward deviation of phytoplankton blooms from the areas of upwelling.

TI  - Representativeness of the FluWatchers Participatory Disease Surveillance Program 2015-2016 to 2018-2019: How do participants compare with the Canadian population?
T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: FluWatch is Canada's national surveillance system that monitors the spread of influenza. Its syndromic surveillance component monitors the spread of influenza-like illness (ILI) in near-real time for signals of unusual or increased activity. Syndromic surveillance data are collected from two main sources: the Sentinel Practitioner ILI Reporting System and FluWatchers.We evaluated the representativeness of the most recent participant population to understand changes in representativeness since 2015, to identify demographic and geographic gaps and correlates/determinants of participation to characterize a typical participant.METHODS: In this serial cross-sectional study, characteristics of participants during four consecutive influenza seasons (2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019) were compared with the 2016 Canadian Census and the 2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 National Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Coverage Surveys. Associations between demographic factors and the level of user participation were also analyzed among the 2018-2019 FluWatchers population.RESULTS: Infants (0-4 years) and older adults (65 years and older) were under-represented in FluWatchers across all four influenza seasons. Female and urban participants were significantly over-represented. Vaccination coverage remained significantly higher among the FluWatchers populations from the past four influenza seasons across all age groups. Level of participation among FluWatchers was associated with age and vaccination status, but not with sex or geography. Over its four years of implementation, the FluWatchers participant population became more representative of the Canadian population with respect to age and geography (urban/rural and provincial/territorial).CONCLUSION: FluWatchers participants under-represent the tails of Canada's age distribution and over-represent those who engage in health promoting behaviours as indicated by high influenza vaccine coverage, consistent with typical volunteer-based survey response biases. Representativeness would likely improve with targeted recruitment of under-represented groups, such as males, older adults and Canadians living in rural areas.

TI  - Water vapor anomaly over the tropical western Pacific in El Nino winters from radiosonde and satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Using radiosonde observations at five stations in the tropical western Pacific and reanalysis data for the 15 years from 2005 to 2019, we report an extremely negative anomaly in atmospheric water vapor during the super El Nino winter of 2015/16 and compare the anomaly with that in the other three El Nino winters of the period. A strong specific humidity anomaly is concentrated below 8 km of the troposphere with a peak at 2.5-3.5 km, and a column-integrated water vapor mass anomaly over the five radiosonde sites has a large negative correlation coefficient of -0.63 with the oceanic Nino3.4 index but with a lag of about 2-3 months. In general, the tropical circulation anomaly in the El Nino winter is characterized by divergence (convergence) in the lower troposphere over the tropical western (eastern) Pacific; thus, the water vapor decreases over the tropical western Pacific as upward motion is suppressed. The variability of the Hadley circulation is quite small and has little influence on the observed water vapor anomaly. The anomaly of the Walker circulation makes a considerable contribution to the total anomaly in all four El Nino winters, especially in the 2006/07 and 2015/16 eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino events. The monsoon circulation shows a remarkable change from one event to another, and its anomaly is large in the 2009/10 and 2018/19 central Pacific (CP) El Nino winters and small in the two EP El Nino winters. The observed water vapor anomaly is caused mainly by the Walker circulation anomaly in the super EP event of 2015/16 but is caused by the monsoon circulation anomaly in the strong CP event of 2009/10. The roles of the Hadley, Walker, and monsoon circulations in the EP and CP events are confirmed by the composite EP and CP El Ninos based on the reanalysis data for 41 years. Owing to the anomalous decrease in upward transport of water vapor during the El Nino winter, lower cloud amounts and more outgoing long wave radiation over the five stations are clearly presented in satellite observation. In addition, a detailed comparison of water vapor in the reanalysis, radiosonde, and satellite data shows a fine confidence level for the datasets; nevertheless, the reanalysis seems to slightly underestimate the water vapor over the five stations in the 2009/10 winter.

However, determining the factors that regulate the seasonal changes of MPB and its distribution patterns at larger scales is hindered by the considerable spatial and temporal variability in these environments. Here, we studied the dynamics of intertidal MPB biomass, cover, and net growth rates in a south European tidal flat (Cadiz Bay, Spain) over a four-year period using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) calculated from Sentinel-2 satellite images. Pixels dominated by different benthic communities (MPB, Zostera sp., Caulerpa sp. and green macroalgae) were identified at a 10-m resolution using a Random Forest (RF) machine learning classification algorithm. MPB dominated the intertidal zone. MPB cover did not show a clear seasonal pattern and was clearly higher in the middle of the intertidal range of sea level. Despite interannual variability, MPB biomass was always higher during winter, coinciding with observations from other low latitude intertidal flats with temperate climate, and in the upper-middle intertidal. Net rates of MPB biomass change, calculated from the differences in MPB NDVI over time, showed maximal net growth rates from autumn to winter and maximum loss rates during spring and summer, although with high variability. Our study demonstrates that RF algorithms allow mapping MPB and other intertidal communities from Sentinel-2 multispectral satellite imagery accurately obtaining invaluable information from large areas at very high spatio-temporal resolution. The dissimilarities observed in the patterns of MPB variables over time or sea level, indicate differences in their ecological regulation, still largely unknown both here and in other temperate climate intertidal flats. High resolution remote sensing can aid in their detailed and systematic study producing a more integrated view of these systems and contributing to their science-based management and conservation.

TI  - Microplastics Contamination in Commercial Green Mussels from Selected Wet Markets in Thailand
T2  - ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mussels have been identified as sentinel organisms (around the world) that indicate microplastic (MP) pollution. Since they are filter feeders, they easily uptake MPs. Mussels sold in commercial markets have been identified as an ideal way to directly quantify human exposure to MPs through seafood consumption. There are no studies reported on MP contamination of market-sold species in Thailand. This study investigates the level of MP contamination in market-sold green mussels, which is a popular seafood in Thailand. A total of 90 green mussels (Perna viridis) collected from three markets were analyzed for the number, polymer types, and morphology of the MPs. Fourier-Transform Infrared Micro-Spectroscopy (micro-FTIR) analysis was used for polymer identification. Nile Red (NR) tagging was used for the enumeration of MPs. MPs were widely discovered in green mussels from all three markets with 100% detection frequency. The average abundance of MPs in green mussels was quantified as 7.32 +/- 8.33 items/mussel and 1.53 +/- 2.04 items/g (wet weight). Ethylene/propylene copolymer followed by low-density polyethylene (PE-LD), polypropylene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were found. Fragments (75.4%) were the most common morphotype, followed by fibers (24.6%). Results indicate that the consumption of green mussels as a food can be one of the exposure pathways for the Thai population. Moreover, smaller size MPs were predominant, which are reported to cause higher impacts.

TI  - FluWatchers: Evaluation of a crowdsourced influenza-like illness surveillance application for Canadian influenza seasons 2015-2016 to 2018-2019.
T2  - Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Sentinel influenza-like illness (ILI) surveillance is an essential component of a comprehensive influenza surveillance program. Community-based ILI surveillance systems that rely solely on sentinel healthcare practices omit important segments of the population, including those who do not seek medical care. Participatory surveillance, which relies on community participation in surveillance, may address some limitations of traditional ILI systems.OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate FluWatchers, a crowdsourced ILI application developed to complement and complete ILI surveillance in Canada.METHODS: Using established frameworks for surveillance evaluations, we assessed the acceptability, reliability, accuracy and usefulness of the FluWatchers system 2015-2016, through 2018-2019. Evaluation indicators were compared against national surveillance indicators of ILI and of laboratory confirmed respiratory virus infections.RESULTS: The acceptability of FluWatchers was demonstrated by growth of 50%-100% in season-over-season participation, and a consistent season-over-season retention of 80%. Reliability was greater for FluWatchers than for our traditional ILI system, although both systems had week-over-week fluctuations in the number of participants responding. FluWatchers' ILI rates had moderate correlation with weekly influenza laboratory detection rates and other winter seasonal respiratory virus detections including respiratory syncytial virus and seasonal coronaviruses. Finally, FluWatchers has demonstrated its usefulness as a source of core FluWatch surveillance information and has the potential to fill data gaps in current programs for influenza surveillance and control.CONCLUSION: FluWatchers is an example of an innovative digital participatory surveillance program that was created to address limitations of traditional ILI surveillance in Canada. It fulfills the surveillance system evaluation criteria of acceptability, reliability, accuracy and usefulness.

TI  - Exemplifying the Effects Using WetSpass Model Depicting the Landscape Modifications on Long-Term Surface and Subsurface Hydrological Water Balance in Bilate Basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The alteration of spatial patterns of landscape interrupts water balance components in Bilate basin of Ethiopia. The aim is to characterize the spatio-temporal variation of surface-subsurface hydrological water balance using the WetSpass model comprising of soil type, topography, groundwater depth, and slope. Environment for Visualizing Images (ENVI) and Arc-GIS software were assimilated for the classification of Landsat images from 1989 to 2019 replicating the forest, shrub, and grasslands which decrease by 4.0%, 9.41%, and 14.87%, respectively, and agricultural land increasing by 27.06% from 1989 to 2019. The goodness of fit in surface runoff and subsurface flow for the two model outputs with the square of regression (R-2) of 0.79 and 0.81, while the root mean square errors (RMSEs) 8.26 mm and 8.39 mm for 1989 and 2019, respectively, were calculated. Average annual interception, groundwater recharge, surface runoff, and actual-evapotranspiration were 36.4 mm, 127.34 mm, 614.95 mm, and 517.59 mm, respectively, revealing that WetSpass works remarkably in simulating the components of the hydrological water balance.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of land surface albedo and associated influencing factors on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo plays a crucial role in the land surface energy budget and climate. This paper identified the spatiotemporal variations of surface albedo on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 1982 to 2015, and quantified the relationships between the spatial and temporal patterns of the albedo and associated influencing factors (snow cover, vegetation, and soil moisture) on the seasonal and interannual basis using satellite products and reanalysis data. It was determined that the albedo presented a distinct spatial variability, with high values in mountainous areas and low values on the southeastern TP. Spatially, average albedo exhibited a positive correlation with snow cover and negative correlations with vegetation and soil moisture. Average albedo over the whole TP had a clear seasonal cycle with a peak in winter and a minimum value in summer, which is dictated by seasonal changes in snow and vegetation covers. Annual average albedo exhibited a weakly downward trend, which was mainly contributed by a significant decrease in summer, pointing to the important role in vegetation dynamics for temporal change of the albedo. On the regional basis, interannual variation of albedo was more responsive to snow cover over the snow-and vegetation-coexisting area than the snow-covered area, and to changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) over the vegetation-covered area than the snow-and vegetation-coexisting area; albedo had a weakly negative correlation with soil moisture over bare soil. Furthermore, our results indicated that snow cover was the dominant factor for albedo change on mountainous areas, and vegetation change predominated the variation of albedo on the eastern, southern, and northwestern TP. Specifically, variations in snow cover contributed more than those of vegetation to the interannual albedo variation over the Three Rivers Headwater Region. These results would be beneficial for better understanding the climate and eco-environment changes over the TP. (c) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Cloud-Native Coastal Turbid Zone Detection Using Multi-Temporal Sentinel-2 Data on Google Earth Engine
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of clarity in turbid coastal waters interferes with light attenuation and hinders remotely sensed studies in aquatic ecology such as benthic habitat mapping and bathymetry estimation. Although turbid water column corrections can be applied on regions with seasonal turbidity by performing multi-temporal analysis, different approaches are needed in regions where the water is constantly turbid or only exhibits subtle turbidity variations through time. This study aims to detect these turbid zones (TZs) in optically shallow coastal waters using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 surface reflectance datasets to improve the aforementioned studies. The herein framework can be paired with other aquatic ecology remote sensing studies to establish the clear water focus area and can also be used by decision makers to identify rehabilitation areas. We selected the coastlines of Guinea-Bissau, Tunisia, and west Madagascar as our case studies which feature wide-ranging turbidity intensities across tropical, subtropical, and Mediterranean waters and applied three different methods for the TZ detection: Otsu's method for bimodal thresholding, linear spectral unmixing, and Random Forest (RF) machine learning method on Google Earth Engine as an end-to-end process. Based on our experiments, the RF method yields good results in all study regions with overall accuracies ranging between 88 and 96% and F1-scores between 0.87 and 0.96. TZ detection is highly site-specific due to the inter-class variability that is mainly affected by the nature of the suspended materials and the environmental characteristics of the site.

TI  - A novel intelligence approach based active and ensemble learning for agricultural soil organic carbon prediction using multispectral and SAR data fusion
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring agricultural soil organic carbon (SOC) has played an essential role in sustainable agricultural management. Precise and robust prediction of SOC greatly contributes to carbon neutrality in the agricultural industry. To create more knowledge regarding the ability of remote sensing to monitor carbon soil, this research devises a state-of-the-art low cost machine learning model for quantifying agricultural soil carbon using active and ensemble-based decision tree learning combined with multi-sensor data fusion at a national and world scale. This work explores the use of Sentinel-1 (S1) C-band dual polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2) multispectral data, and an innovative machine learning (ML) approach using an integration of active learning for land-use mapping and advanced Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for robustness of the SOC estimates. The collected soil samples from a field survey in Western Australia were used for the model validation. The indicators including the coefficient of determination (R-2) and root - mean - square - error (RMSE) were applied to evaluate the model's performance. A numerous features computed from optical and SAR data fusion were employed to build and test the proposed model performance. The effectiveness of the proposed machine learning model was assessed by comparing with the two well-known algorithms such as Random Forests (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict agricultural SOC. Results suggest that a combination of S1 and S2 sensors could effectively estimate SOC in farming areas by using ML techniques. Satisfactory accuracy of the proposed XGBoost with optimal features was achieved the highest performance (R-2 = 0.870; RMSE - 1.818 tonC/ha) which outperformed RF and SVM. Thus, multi-sensor data fusion combined with the XGBoost lead to the best prediction results for agricultural SOC at 10 m spatial resolution. In short, this new approach could significantly contribute to various agricultural SOC retrieval studies globally. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Three Gorges Dam alters the footprint of particulate heavy metals in the Yangtze Estuary
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Two scenarios were selected to simulate the situation before the closure of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD) in 1996 (Scenario 1) and after the completion of the Three Gorges Project in 2010 (Scenario 2). A modified polar coordinated segmented quantification method was proposed to quantify the heavy metal footprint excursion in Scenarios 1 and 2 and further evaluate their influence on the six sensitive targets in the Yangtze Estuary. Scenario 3 was utilised to analyse the negative effects of the footprint range on the spatio-temporal overlap of the Chinese sturgeon juveniles arriving in the estuarine reserve, set in the TGD-altered biological rhythm. Each scenario comprises four simulation sites from March to September, including three major urban sewage outlets, named Bailonggang (BLG), Zhuyuan (ZY), Shidongkou (SDK), and the upstream pollution source, represented by Xuliujing (XLJ). The results showed that the increased discharge in the dry season moved the post-TGD footprint further away from Chongming Island. Additionally, the outward side footprint was formed during the flood season, when the average discharge was lower than that during the pre-TGD period, being 'pushed' to the northwest by the monsoon and Taiwan warm current, resulting in a narrowing of the overall extent. The TGD positively impacted the XLJ and BLG simulation sites, given their shrinking footprint range and the decreasing trajectories of intruding sensitive targets in Scenario 2, in contrast to SDK and ZY.

TI  - An integrated assessment on the warming effects of urbanization and agriculture in highly developed urban agglomerations of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization and agriculture, the two major and concurrent land use activities, can dramatically alter land surface temperature (LST) through multiple biophysical processes. However, previous studies mainly focused on the warming effects of urbanization in large cities and/or urban core areas that may greatly underestimate the land use impacts on regional climate. Using natural forest as a reference, we assessed the LST changes of both urbanization and agriculture in the three most developed urban agglomerations of China (Jing-Jin-Ji, JJJ; Yangtze River Delta, YRD; Pearl River Delta, PRD) according to satellite observations. Results show that the urban dominated lands warm the daytime LST substantially, especially in the south subtropical PRD (with an annual mean intensity of 5.5 degrees C), and the highest do not occur in the core cities. The crop-dominated lands also warm the daytime LST dramatically, especially in the temperate semi-humid JJJ (with an annual mean intensity of 3.9 degrees C). The daytime warming effects increase significantly from 2003 to 2018 mainly due to urban expansion in crop-dominated and mixed lands. The two land uses continue to warm the LST at night though in a lower magnitude in the PRD. However, the urban-dominated lands warm the LST slightly and the crop-dominated lands cool the LST substantially at night in the JJJ and YRD. Overall, the crop-dominated and/or mixed lands dominate the regional LST changes owing to their large areas. We further show that the daytime warming effects of the two land uses are likely caused by the changes of evapotranspiration, whereas the nighttime cooling effects might be mainly due to the changes in surface albedo and roughness. Our results highlight the importance of considering the urbanization in small-medium sized satellite cities and the more widespread agricultural activities in rural areas when assessing the regional climate change and formulating the mitigation strategies.

TI  - Assessing the effects of 2D/3D urban morphology on the 3D urban thermal environment by using multi-source remote sensing data and UAV measurements: A case study of the snow-climate city of Changchun, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect has many adverse impacts on natural and social environments. A better understanding of how complex urban biophysical and social structures affect UHI is crucial to improve urban thermal environments. However, few studies have investigated the effects of 2D/3D urban morphology on land surface temperature (LST) and vertical air temperature simultaneously. Using LST data retrieved from Landsat 8 images and vertical temperatures at different heights collected from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) measurements, this study investigated the effects of 2D and 3D urban morphology on the 3D urban thermal environment among different urban function zones (UFZs) in the snow-climate city of Changchun, China. Our main findings are: (1) the average difference in vertical temperature between heights of 1.5 and 100 m was 1.78 degrees C and the temperature decreasing rate was 0.027 degrees C/m when the height was lower than 30 m, compared to 0.014. C/m for 30-100 m. (2) Although 3D metrics had significant impact on LST, the relationships between the 2D metrics and LST were much stronger, accounting for 61% of the variations in LST. Additionally, the 2D composition metrics had stronger correlations with LST than the configuration metrics. The influence of 3D building metrics on LST was context-dependent for different UFZs. Increasing building height could reduce LST in residential UFZs but increase LST in industrial UFZs. (3) The effect of 2D urban morphology on the vertical temperature was stronger than that on the 3D ones when the height was lower than 30 m; however, opposite results were obtained when the height was greater than 30 m. The effects of 2D or 3D metrics on vertical temperature vary depending on whether the height is larger or smaller than a threshold, which is related to the characteristics of the building height. In general, 30 m appeared to be the threshold in our study. (4) The performances of models that used both 2D and 3D metrics to explain both LST and 3D thermal environments were better than those of models that used either 2D or 3D metrics alone, especially in UFZs such as residential areas.

TI  - FY-3E: The First Operational Meteorological Satellite Mission in an Early Morning Orbit
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Fengyun-3E (FY-3E), the world's first early-morning-orbit meteorological satellite for civil use, was launched successfully at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on 5 July 2021. The FY-3E satellite will fill the vacancy of the global early-morning-orbit satellite observation, working together with the FY-3C and FY-3D satellites to achieve the data coverage of early morning, morning, and afternoon orbits. The combination of these three satellites will provide global data coverage for numerical weather prediction (NWP) at 6-hour intervals, effectively improving the accuracy and time efficiency of global NWP, which is of great significance to perfect the global earth observing system. In this article, the background and meteorological requirements for the early-morning-orbit satellite are reviewed, and the specifications of the FY-3E satellite, as well as the characteristics of the onboard instrumentation for earth observations, are also introduced. In addition, the ground segment and the retrieved geophysical products are also presented. It is believed that the NWP communities will significantly benefit from an optimal temporal distribution of observations provided by the early morning, mid-morning, and afternoon satellite missions. Further benefits are expected in numerous applications such as the monitoring of severe weather/climate events, the development of improved sampling designs of the diurnal cycle for accurate climate data records, more efficient monitoring of air quality by thermal infrared remote sensing, and the quasi-continuous monitoring of the sun for space weather and climate.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background Brachycephalic dogs (BCD) are increasingly popular companion animals and widely recognized to suffer from respiratory compromise based upon their conformation; however, the actual percentages of BCD in veterinary ICUs are unknown. This study aimed to evaluate a canine ICU census, as well as the presence, development, and severity of respiratory compromise in BCD using syndromic surveillance. Key Findings Ten institutions provided surveillance data twice weekly over an 11-week study period. The total canine ICU census was 1254 dogs hospitalized during the days and times of the study period; of this population, 125 (10%) were BCD. Fifty-six (45%) BCD were hospitalized in ICUs because they were perceived to be at risk of respiratory complications while recovering from general anesthesia or had a nonrespiratory condition requiring ICU admission, with the remaining 69 dogs (55%) being treated for respiratory disease. Twenty dogs (16%) developed respiratory complications requiring ICU admission after initially being hospitalized for another condition. Four percent of dogs were supported with mechanical ventilation. Clinical Significance Syndromic surveillance was a useful method for evaluating the number of BCD in a veterinary ICU. Almost 1 in 5 BCD developed respiratory compromise after initial evaluation for an unrelated problem. Ongoing evaluation of the medical issues associated with brachycephaly is warranted.

TI  - First retrieval of absorbing aerosol height over dark target using TROPOMI oxygen B band: Algorithm development and application for surface particulate matter estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Constraint of the vertical distribution of aerosol particles is crucial for the study of aerosol plume structure, aerosol radiative effects, and ultimately monitoring surface air pollution. We developed an algorithm to retrieve the aerosol optical central height (AOCH) of absorbing aerosols by using, for the first time, the oxygen (O-2) A and B absorption band measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over dark targets. For the retrieval, narrow band radiance at seven channels ranging from ultraviolet (UV) to shortwave infrared (SWIR) are convolved from TROPOMI hyperspectral measurements. Subsequently, cloudy pixels are screened out by using the slope of spectral reflectance, while aerosol types (dust and smoke) are classified by the wavelength dependence of aerosol path radiance in conjunction with UV aerosol index. Surface reflectance over land is derived from the MODIS surface bi-directional reflectance climatology, and over water from the GOME-2 surface Lambert-equivalent reflectivity (LER) database. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) and AOCH are retrieved through an approach of look-up-table accounting for AERONET-based dust and smoke optical properties. For multiple smoke and dust plume events around the world, our retrieved AOCH values agree with space-borne lidar CALIOP counterparts, with a mean bias of <0.15 km and a correlation coefficient of 0.85-0.87. Due in part to adding the O-2 B band, our retrieval represents an aerosol extinction peak height better than the TROPOMI operational Level 2 aerosol layer height retrieved from only the O-2 A band. The latter shows 0.5-2 km low bias, especially over land. Finally, the high potential of AOCH for improving surface PM2.5 estimates is also illustrated with a case study in which the high bias of surface PM2.5 in MERRA-2 data is corrected after being scaled by the retrieved AOCH.

TI  - Summer phytoplankton blooms off the Somali coast in the South-western Arabian Sea from remote sensing observations
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - Summer phytoplankton blooms appear frequently off the Somali coast in the southwestern Arabian Sea (AS), where strong reversal monsoon and summer upwelling is prevailing. Distinct high chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentrations in summer were displayed in the western AS, especially in the region off the Somali coast. The spatial and inter-annual variations of the summer high Chl-a were studied using satellite data including ocean color and wind vectors. Under ocean conditions including monsoon winds, Ekman transport (ET) and Ekman pumping velocity (EPV), as well as geostrophic current and aerosol precipitation, the possible mechanisms of high Chl-a was investigated. The summer high Chl-a presented strong inter-annual variations in the southwestern AS. The results of simple correlation analysis indicated that there were good correlations between the ET and Chl-a, as well as between EPV and Chl-a. These implied that the ET and EPV may cause uplift of nutrients into the upper layer of the western AS from subsurface or coastal regions, inducing high Chl-a in the southwestern AS, especially in the region off the Somali coasts in summer. The multiple/partial correlation analysis implied further that EPV-induced upwelling may be more helpful than the ET-induced upwelling in the coastal region off Somalia, leading to probably more significant influence of EPV upwelling on the phytoplankton bloom than upwelling by ET. Aerosol precipitation in the southwestern AS also played an important role in high Chl-a in the deep offshore AS (i.e., Section B in Fig. 1(a)), as second only to ET and sea surface temperature (SST), and even higher than EPV. A novel finding is that the influence of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) is evident in the offshore region and the dust precipitation is more importantsources to oligotrophic water. Both the stability of the upper ocean and the aerosol precipitation may play more evident roles in the open regions of the southwestern AS off Somali.

TI  - Leveraging Google Earth Engine platform to characterize and map small seasonal wetlands in the semi-arid environments of South Africa
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although significant scientific research strides have been made in mapping the spatial extents and ecohydrological dynamics of wetlands in semi-arid environments, the focus on small wetlands remains a challenge. This is due to the sensing characteristics of remote sensing platforms and lack of robust data processing techniques. Advancements in data analytic tools, such as the introduction of Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform provides unique opportunities for improved assessment of small and scattered wetlands. This study thus assessed the capabilities of GEE cloud-computing platform in characterising small seasonal flooded wetlands, using the new generation Sentinel 2 data from 2016 to 2020. Specifically, the study assessed the spectral separability of different land cover classes for two different wetlands detected, using Sentinel-2 multi-year composite water and vegetation indices and to identify the most suitable GEE machine learning algorithm for accurately detecting and mapping semi-arid seasonal wetlands. This was achieved using the object based Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Naive Bayes (NB) advanced algorithms in GEE. The results demonstrated the capabilities of using the GEE platform to characterize wetlands with acceptable accuracy. All algorithms showed superiority, in mapping the two wetlands except for the NB method, which had lowest overall classification accuracy. These findings underscore the relevance of the GEE platform, Sentinel-2 data and advanced algorithms in characterizing small and seasonal semi-arid wetlands. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Source apportionment and human health risk assessment of trace metals and metalloids in surface soils of the Mugan Plain, the Republic of Azerbaijan
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Mugan Plain is the most productive area in the Republic of Azerbaijan, but a previous study confirmed trace metal and metalloid (TM&M) contamination with Cr, Ni and Pb, and the potential ecological risk of As was estimated. However, no industrial activity was previously reported in this area; thus, a source apportionment model using positive matrix factorization (PMF) was employed to identify pollution sources, and a human health risk assessment was conducted to evaluate noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks. Surface soil samples were collected from 349 sites, and six major elements (Si, Ca, Cl, P, S and Sr) and 8 TM&Ms (As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) were analyzed by X-ray fluorescence and employed for further apportionment and risk assessment. As a result, the PMF model showed 7 factors, assigned to natural activity (12.9%), dry riverbed (13.6%), surface accumulation (3.1%), desalinization activity (3.2%), residential activity (12.3%), fossil fuel combustion (35.5%) and agricultural activity (19.3%). The PMF model characterized certain areas with desalinization activity in the previous Soviet period and with surface accumulation of salt, and these findings were confirmed by additional field surveys and historical Landsat satellite images. The risk assessment results showed that there was no risk for the adults, while for children, there was a noncarcinogenic risk, but no carcinogenic risk. Dermal contact was estimated to be the primary pathway, and Ni and As were identified as the most problematic TM&Ms for noncarcinogenic and carcinogenic risks, respectively. According to the results, fossil fuel combustion associated with heating and vehicle transportation was estimated to be the main source of pollution, contributing 42.6% of the noncarcinogenic and 48.0% of the carcinogenic risks. These results can provide scientific guidance to understand and prevent the risk of TM&Ms on the Mugan Plain.

TI  - Evaluation of spatial-temporal variation performance of ERA5 precipitation data in China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - ERA5 is the latest fifth-generation reanalysis global atmosphere dataset from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, replacing ERA-Interim as the next generation of representative satellite-observational data on the global scale. ERA5 data have been evaluated and applied in different regions, but the performances are inconsistent. Meanwhile, there are few precise evaluations of ERA5 precipitation data over long time series have been performed in Chinese mainland. This study evaluates the temporal-spatial performance of ERA5 precipitation data from 1979 to 2018 based on gridded-ground meteorological station observational data across China. The results showed that ERA5 data could capture the annual and seasonal patterns of observed precipitation in China well, with correlation coefficient values ranging from 0.796 to 0.945, but ERA5 slightly overestimated precipitation in the summer. Nonetheless, the results also showed that the accuracy of the precipitation products was strongly correlated with topographic distribution and climatic divisions. The performance of ERA5 shows spatial inherently across China that the highest correlation coefficient values locate in eastern, Northwestern and North China and the lowest biases locate in Southeast China. This study provides a reliable data assessment of the ERA5 data and precipitation trend analyses in China. The results provide accuracy references for the further use of precipitation satellite data for hydrological calculations and climate numerical simulations.

TI  - Diagnostic Criteria for Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema of the Upper Extremity: The Need for Universal Agreement
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - With advances in breast cancer treatments and resultant increased survival rates, emphasis has been placed on post-treatment complications such as breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL), a chronic, negative sequela of breast cancer treatment. Accurate BCRL diagnosis necessitates longitudinal screening beginning at preoperative baseline. Prospective screening programs incorporating symptoms, objective measurements and clinical examination allow for early detection, early intervention, and improved BCRL prognosis. Currently, varied diagnostic criteria for BCRL exist, and this lack of consensus leads to variation in diagnostic and screening practices across institutions. This review outlines current diagnostic tools, including subjective and objective measurement methods and clinical examination. The merits of different criteria are evaluated and recommendations are made regarding measurement tools and diagnostic criteria for BCRL. Ultimately, the BCRL diagnostic process should be universalized and combine objective measurements, clinical evaluation, and symptoms assessment, and adhere to the best practices of the measurement tools used.

TI  - Aerosol data assimilation and forecast using Geostationary Ocean Color Imager aerosol optical depth and in-situ observations during the KORUS-AQ observing period
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops an aerosol data assimilation and forecast system using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) and the three-dimensional variational (3D-VAR) data assimilation method. The system assimilates the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) satellite and surface particulate matter (PM) observations. The simulation domain covers Northeast Asia at 15 km horizontal resolution, and the assimilation and forecast skill is evaluated for the Korea-US Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) intensive observing period. Observing system experiments (OSEs) are conducted to examine the changes in quality of assimilation and forecast skills sensitive to the assimilated observational input data. The baseline model simulation underestimates AOD and surface PM concentration in most regions, in which the assimilation of satellite and in-situ data improves the mean biases and spatial distribution. Moreover, it improves the forecast skill of the surface concentration of PM10 and PM2.5. The results from the OSEs indicate that the assimilation of GOCI AOD only slightly enhances the forecast skill. However, most of the skill improvement comes from the surface PM assimilation, showing a practically useful level of skill until 12 hours from the initial state. The marginal improvement in the PM10 forecasts by the GOCI AOD suggests the non-negligible difference between column-representing AOD and the surface PM concentration.

TI  - Intraurban heterogeneity of space-time land surface temperature trends in six climate-diverse cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface urban heat islands (SUHIs) are present in all cities, derived from their thermal properties. While looking at the spatiotemporal variability of land surface temperature (LST), there is still a gap in understanding patterns of change. In this paper, we analysed diurnal and nocturnal annual mean LST trends in continental (Beijing), temperate (Mexico City and Santiago), and arid (Cairo, Hyderabad, and Riyadh) cities employing 1 km MODIS data (2003-2019). Each time-series was assessed with the structure of a space-time cube. Hot and cold spots were detected for each year and the LST trends were analysed. Each pixel was classified into different space-time LST trends and their SUHIs were estimated. Cities exhibit trends of increasing temperatures in cold and hot spots for diurnal and nocturnal data. Temperatures are increasing faster in hot spots for diurnal and in cold spots for nocturnal scenes. Steady hot spots and warming hot spots exhibit the highest SUHIs for day and night. Our approach provides a framework to empirically delineate the spatial intraurban heterogeneity of LST patterns over time. This spatially explicit information provides insights into urban areas requiring heat mitigation strategies and can be used to monitor the performance of measures already implemented for climate adaptation.

TI  - Monitoring and Mathematical Model Analysis of Dynamic Changes in Land Resources Based on SAR Sensor Image
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring and analysis of dynamic changes in land resources can detect the changes of land aimed at a single-band or multiband remote sensing image of multiple phases in a given region or target with image processing methods and can also extract the change information and realize remote sensing monitoring through the comprehensive analysis of multiphase remote sensing images. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image change monitoring technology, with the advantages of high resolution, high precision, real-time service, and rapid imaging, can achieve qualitative or quantitative analysis of targets and is gradually widely used in quarterly monitoring, emergency monitoring, postbatch verification, law-enforcement inspection and land inspection, and other remote sensing data acquisitions and analyses. Therefore, on the basis of summarizing the research results of previous research works, this paper expounded the current situation and significance of the researches on the monitoring and analysis of dynamic changes in land resources; elaborated the development background, current situation, and future challenges of SAR sensor data; introduced the methods and principles of band setting, polarization mode, geometric correction, and image filtering; proposed the status target identification of land resources; explored the dynamic information discovery of land resources; conducted the dynamic change monitoring of land resources based on SAR sensor data; analyzed the basis and characteristics of SAR sensor data; performed the generalization and optimization of land resource information; demonstrated the dynamic change analysis of land resources based on SAR sensor data; compared the acceptance ability and accuracy of SAR sensor data; and discussed the discovery and extraction of dynamic information of land resources. The results show that the SAR sensor data can monitor the characteristics of scattering points in land resource observation scenes and can obtain the change information of ground object by distance component and band component, so that the SAR system can make two-dimensional imaging of land resources directly in front of the receiving platform. Thus, the SAR data obtained by multisystem parameters shows great application potential in land resource monitoring, which provides the possibility of decoupling to remove land resources and surface roughness and thus provides possible solutions for land resource analysis in complex environment. The results of this paper provide a reference for the follow-up studies on the monitoring and analysis of dynamic changes in land resources based on SAR sensor data.

TI  - Forest Loss is Accelerating Along the US Gulf Coast
T2  - ESTUARIES AND COASTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea-level rise is impacting the longest undeveloped stretch of coastline in the contiguous United States: The Florida Big Bend. Due to its low elevation and a higher-than-global-average local rate of sea-level rise, the region is losing coastal forest to encroaching marsh at an unprecedented rate. Previous research found a rate of forest-to-marsh conversion of up to 1.2 km(2) year(-1) during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, but these studies evaluated small-scale changes, suffered from data gaps, or are substantially outdated. We replicated and updated these studies with Landsat satellite imagery covering the entire Big Bend region from 2003 to 2016 and corroborated results with in situ landscape photography and high-resolution aerial imagery. Our analysis of satellite and aerial images from 2003 to 2016 indicates a rate of approximately 10 km(2) year(-1) representing an increase of over 800%. Areas previously found to be unaffected by the decline are now in rapid retreat.

TI  - Future climate change impacts on runoff of scarcely gauged Jhelum river basin using SDSM and RCPs
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is a global issue and causes great uncertainties in runoff and streamflow projections, especially in high-altitude basins. The quantification of climatic indicators remains a tedious job for the scarcely gauged mountainous basin. The study investigated climate change by incorporating GCM (CCSM4) using SDSM method for RCPs in the Jhelum river basin. Historical climatic data were coupled with Aphrodite data to cope with the scarcity of weather stations. SDSM was calibrated for the period 1976-2005 and validated for the period 2006-2015 using R-2 and RMSE. Future climatic indicators were downscaled and debiased using MB-BC method. The de-biased downscaled data and MODIS data were used to simulate discharge of Jhelum river basin using SRM. Simulated discharge was compared with measured discharge by using Dv% and NSE. The R-2 and RMSE for SDSM range between 0.89-0.95 and 0.8-1.02 for temperature and 0.86-0.96 and 0.57-1.02 for precipitation. Projections depicted a rising trend of 1.5 degrees C to 3.8 degrees C in temperature, 2-7% in mean annual precipitation and 3.3-7.4% in discharge for 2100 as compared to baseline period. Results depicted increasing trend for climatic indicators and discharge due to climate change for the basin.

TI  - Evaluation of fractional clear sky over potential astronomical sites
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of the night-time cloud fraction (CF) is found to be one of the key parameters for evaluating the number of useful nights at an astronomical site. This work evaluates useful astronomical night-time observation over eight sites using a minimum threshold of CF from 21 years (2000-2020) of ground-based hourly visual and daily satellite data along with 41 years (1980-2020) of long-term hourly reanalysis data. The estimated number of photometric nights is underestimated by 8-24 per cent using the reanalysis data at Indian Astronomical Observatory-Hanle in comparison with the visual observations, while the estimated number of spectroscopic nights is 70-75 per cent per year and in good agreement with the visual observations. Among the astronomical sites, Paranal is found to be the best for astronomical observations, with 87 per cent spectroscopic nights per year. On the other hand, Hanle, Ali and Devasthal, located in the Himalayan region, exhibit an average of 68-78 per cent spectroscopic nights per year based on long-term reanalysis data, while Merak exhibits 61-68 per cent spectroscopic nights per year. Vertical profiles and global horizontal distributions for CF and related variable parameters are further compared among the sites. Global CF trends based on 41 years of reanalysis data show a decreasing tendency over most land regions and an increasing tendency over oceanic regions as well as over the Sahara desert, Middle East, and Indian subcontinent along the adjacent Tibetan Plateau. Such different CF trends between the ocean and land regions are thought to be the result of differential surface warming and water vapour changes associated with climate change.

TI  - Performance of surface winds from atmospheric reanalyses in the Southwestern South Atlantic Ocean
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea surface wind (10-m high) is one of the most important variables for oceanic applications. The zonal and meridional surface wind components from seven global atmospheric reanalyses [National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)/National Center for Atmospheric Research Reanalysis 1, NCEP/Department of Energy Reanalysis 2, NCEP/climate forecast system reanalysis (CFSR), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Interim Reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA-55), the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application V2, and the ERA5 Reanalysis] were compared with surface winds retrieved from QuikScat/SeaWinds and Ascat scatterometers, and with surface ground winds measured in eight coastal meteorological stations, at the Southwestern South Atlantic Ocean, between 35 degrees and 55 degrees S and 55 degrees and 70 degrees W, approximately. Bias, root mean squared error and the Pearson linear correlation coefficient for the zonal and meridional wind components were estimated in this study. The effects of the atmospheric stability, the surface currents and the discontinuity between land and sea roughness on the satellite data are discussed in this paper. It was concluded that Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Application, Version 2 reanalysis is the product that better fitted with satellite data, and ERA5 follows it in performance. CFSR, ERA-Interim and JRA-55 reanalyses also presented very good performances. Surface winds from NR1 and NR2 reanalysis showed the largest differences with satellite data. ERA5 reanalysis was the database that better compared with the coastal observations measured at the meteorological stations. Surface winds measured at meteorological stations are, in general, worse represented by the reanalyses than satellite data. This last could be due to the discontinuity between land and sea roughness, and because the topography is not completely represented by the atmospheric global models.

TI  - Evidence of micro-evolution in <i>Crocidura russula</i> from two abandoned heavy metal mines: potential use of <i>Cytb</i>, <i>CYP1A1,</i> and <i>p53</i> as gene biomarkers
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Heavy metals accumulated in the environment due to the mining industry may impact on the health of exposed wild animals with consequences at the population level via survival and selection of the most resistant individuals. The detection and quantification of shifts in gene frequencies or in the genetic structure in populations inhabiting polluted sites may be used as early indicators of environmental stress and reveal potential 'candidate gene biomarkers' for environmental health assessment. We had previously observed that specimens of the Greater white-toothed shrew (Crocidura russula) from two heavy metal mines in Southern Portugal (the Aljustrel and the Preguica mines) carried physiological alterations compared to shrews from an unpolluted site. Here, we further investigated whether these populations showed genetic differences in genes relevant for physiological homeostasis and/or that are associated with pathways altered in animals living under chronic exposure to pollution, and which could be used as biomarkers. We analysed the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cytb) gene and intronic and/or exonic regions of four nuclear genes: CYP1A1, LCAT, PRPF31, and p53. We observed (1) population differences in allele frequencies, types of variation, and diversity parameters in the Cytb, CYP1A1, and p53 genes; (2) purifying selection of Cytb in the mine populations; (3) genetic differentiation of the two mine populations from the reference by the p53 gene. Adding to our previous observations with Mus spretus, we provide unequivocal evidence of a population effect exerted by the contaminated environment of the mines on the local species of small mammals.

TI  - Transceiver design for high altitude pseudo satellite aided dual satellite systems
T2  - COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work focuses on a dual satellite system (DSS) where two multiple spot beam geosynchronous satellites transmit simultaneously on the same frequency across all spot beams. The intra-satellite co-channel interference is managed through precoding, while the inter-satellite co-channel interference is managed with successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the user terminals. The SIC eliminates the strongest co-channel interference from an adjacent satellite while treating the remaining interfering signals as noise. The power required at the transmitter to achieve the desired data rate is formulated as a semidefinite programming problem and relaxed rank constraints. The SIC-based receivers are shown to achieve a better data rate than traditional detectors that treat co-channel interference as noise while saving transmit power at the satellites. Though SIC-based DSS achieves better throughput than a single satellite system, the receiver complexity is high. A high-altitude pseudo satellite (HAPS) aided DSS is proposed to address this issue. In the case of HAPS-aided DSS, users within each spot beam are served by a HAPS, and the HAPSs use SIC to detect signals from satellites. The user terminals in HAPS-aided DSS can use simple detectors as HAPS eliminates co-channel interference through precoding. The full-duplex HAPS-aided DSS is shown to outperform SIC-based DSS.

TI  - Global dust optical depth climatology derived from CALIOP and MODIS aerosol retrievals on decadal timescales: regional and interannual variability
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We derived two observation-based global monthly mean dust aerosol optical depth (DAOD) climatological datasets from 2007 to 2019 with a 2 degrees (latitude) x 5 degrees (longitude) spatial resolution, one based on Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and the other on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations. In addition, the CALIOP climatological dataset also includes dust vertical extinction profiles. Dust is distinguished from non-dust aerosols based on particle shape information (e.g., lidar depolarization ratio) for CALIOP and on dust size and absorption information (e.g., fine-mode fraction, Angstrom exponent, and single-scattering albedo) for MODIS, respectively. The two datasets compare reasonably well with the results reported in previous studies and the collocated Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) coarse-mode AOD. Based on these two datasets, we carried out a comprehensive comparative study of the spatial and temporal climatology of dust. On a multi-year average basis, the global (60 degrees S-60 degrees N) annual mean DAOD is 0.032 and 0.067 according to CALIOP and MODIS retrievals, respectively. In most dust-active regions, CALIOP DAOD generally correlates well (correlation coefficient R>0.6) with the MODIS DAOD, although the CALIOP value is significantly smaller. The CALIOP DAOD is 18 %, 34 %, 54 %, and 31 % smaller than MODIS DAOD over the Sahara, the tropical Atlantic Ocean, the Caribbean Sea, and the Arabian Sea, respectively. Applying a regional specific lidar ratio (LR) of 58 sr instead of the 44 sr used in the CALIOP operational retrieval reduces the difference from 18 % to 8 % over the Sahara and from 34 % to 12 % over the tropical Atlantic Ocean. However, over eastern Asia and the northwestern Pacific Ocean (NWP), the two datasets show weak correlation. Despite these discrepancies, CALIOP and MODIS show similar seasonal and interannual variations in regional DAOD. For dust aerosol over the NWP, both CALIOP and MODIS show a declining trend of DAOD at a rate of about 2 % yr(-1). This decreasing trend is consistent with the observed declining trend of DAOD in the southern Gobi Desert at a rate of 3 % yr(-1) and 5 % yr(-1) according to CALIOP and MODIS, respectively. The decreasing trend of DAOD in the southern Gobi Desert is in turn found to be significantly correlated with increasing vegetation and decreasing surface wind speed in the area.

TI  - Use of multifrequency (C-band and L-band) SAR data to monitor peat subsidence based on time-series SBAS InSAR technique
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Peatlands in tropical regions like Indonesia are undergoing irreversible subsidence due to changes in land use (e.g., deforestation) and land management practices (e.g., drainage alteration), resulting in massive amounts of soil carbon loss. Several satellite-borne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors are operating concurrently at different frequencies, providing potentially useful data for monitoring surface motion over tropical peatlands. This study focused on the capability of C-band (SENTINEL-1) and L-band (PALSAR-2) SAR data to monitor the surface changes in the tropical peatlands area of Bengkalis Island, Indonesia, by applying time-series interferometric SAR (InSAR) with the small baseline subset (SBAS) technique. The average vertical velocity measured by SENTINEL-1 and PALSAR-2 for the period of 2018-2019 was -1.41 and -2.65 cm yr(-1), respectively. We also explored the potential of groundwater level (GWL) data converted to vertical displacement for validating SBAS InSAR. PALSAR-2 performed the best, exhibiting lower RMSE values for each land use compared to SENTINEL-1, with an overall RMSE of 1.383 and 1.988 cm yr(-1), respectively. Also, the subsidence rates of SENTINEL-1 were underestimated, showing a significantly lower mean subsidence difference (0.96 cm yr(-1)) than the reference. Our GWL-based subsidence data offered an alternative validation method for InSAR-based subsidence estimation. Therefore, the integration of time-series InSAR and GWL data can provide crucial information for monitoring the degradation of tropical peatlands.

TI  - Quantization of the coupling mechanism between eco-environmental quality and urbanization from multisource remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization in central and eastern China has posed a major threat to the green sustainable development of the ecological environment. However, the understanding of the interactive coupling mechanism between urbanization and eco-environmental quality (EEQ) remains to be developed. Understanding their interactive coupling mechanism is of great significance to achieve the urban sustainable development goal. By using multi-source remote sensing data, we intended to answer "What are the temporal and spatial characteristics of urbanization and EEQ in the central and eastern regions of China on the pixel scale in the past 24 years, and what is the coupling mechanism between the urbanization and the EEQ?". To answer these questions, we improved a pixel-based model (i.e., RSEI-2) to assess the EEQ in China and explored the coupling mechanism between the urbanization and the EEQ in central and eastern China with the combination method of mathematics and graphics. The results showed that the urbanization and the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of the whole region continually increased from 1992 to 2015, especially in the three major urban agglomerations. The CCD of the provinces in these regions exhibited a strong spatial dependence, with the spatial distribution pattern of "low inside, high outside, high in the east and low in the west". The EEQ did not change significantly, whilst the three major urban agglomerations showed a significant downward trend. Most importantly, this study found that the urbanization determined the development of the CCD lying within the critical value. In addition, the improved RSEI-2 in this study provided great convenience for monitoring the EEQ in China. This study fills the gap in studying the interaction mechanism between the urbanization and the EEQ, and also provides a new perspective for the research on the urban sustainable development in China and even the world.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Wetland Dynamics on Lake Abaya-Chamo, The Main Rift Valley of Ethiopia
T2  - HELIYON
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands worldwide and in Ethiopia have long been subject to severe degradation due to anthropogenic factors. This study was aimed at analyzing the impact of land use/land cover dynamics on Lake Abaya-Chamo wetland from 1990-2019. Data were acquired via Landsat TM of 1990, ETM + of 2000, and OLI of 2010 and 2019 images plus using interview. Supervised classifications (via ERDAS14 and ArcGIS10.5) were applied to detect land use/land cover classes. Change matrix model and Kappa coefficients were used for analysis of the land use/land cover dynamics in the lake-wetland. It was found that forest; water body, shrub land, agricultural land, settlement and swamp area were the main land use/land cover classes. Wetland/swamp area has continuously declined throughout 1990-2000, 2000-2010 and 2010-2019 where its magnitude of shrinkage in the respective periods was 11.4 % (700 ha), 16 % (867 ha) and 31.3 % (1,424 ha). While 'settlement' and 'water body' of the lake-wetland increased at progressively increasing magnitudes of changes in three periods within 1990-2019, 'shrub land' and wetland/'swamp' declined at progressively increasing magnitudes of loss in the same periods. Siltation, rapid population growth-led expansion of settlement and irrigation-based farming were the main drivers of the land use/land cover dynamics and degradation of the lake-wetland. Thus, consistent mapping and integrated actions should be taken to curb the threats on the sustainability of the lake-wetland in Southern Ethiopia. To reduce the impact of LULC dynamics on wetlands, the regime should: advance a clear political, institutional and legal framework for wetland management.

TI  - Analyzing the spatio-temporal variation of the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from district heating systems with "Coal-to-Gas" transition: Evidence from GTWR model and satellite data in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the spatio-temporal heterogeneous effects of socioeconomic and meteorological factors on CO2 emissions from combinations of different district heating systems with "Coal-to-Gas" transition can contribute to the development of future low-carbon energy systems that are efficient and effective. This work downscales city-level CO2 emissions to a 3 x 3 km(2) gridded level in northern China during 2012 to 2018. By employing the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (GTWR) model, nighttime light (NTL) data are adopted as a proxy of the level of urbanization, and the Temperature-Humidity-Wind (THW) Index is used as a proxy of meteorological factors in the downscaling model. The results showthat, for more than 85% of the cities, urbanization significantly enhances the CO2 emissions of district heating systems, while the THWIndex shows negative impacts on CO2 emissions. Significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity exists. The grids with the highest CO2 emissions from coal-fired boilers (grids with annual variation >0.59 Gg CO2/year) are mainly located in nonurban areas of the two megacities Beijing and Tianjin and also in the capital cities of each province. Urbanization has larger effects on the CO2 emissions of natural gas-fired boilers than of coal-fired boilers and combined heat and power (CHP). The average growth rate of CO2 emissions of gas-fired boilers in the urban areas of the study regions was approximately 4.7 times that of nonurban areas. The spatio-temporal heterogeneous impacts of urbanization on CO2 emissions should therefore be considered in future discussions of clean heating policies and climate response strategies.

TI  - Scenario simulation of ecological risk based on land use/cover change-A case study of the Jinghe county, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Jinghe County of the Ebinur Lake Basin was chosen as the study area. Based on Landsat TM / OLI images obtained in 2007 and 2017, this paper attempts to use CLUE-S model to predict LUCC under three different scenarios (Natural Development scenario, Farmland Protection scenario, Water Resources Protection scenarios) in 2027. Landscape indices and ecological risk index were calculated and spatially interpolated for the whole region, and the results of ecological risk could be divided into five different zones: extremely low, low, moderate, high and extremely high. They were carried out for assessing the spatial-temporal changes in ecological risk for each landscape pattern. The results show that: (1) Among the three scenarios designed in this paper, the spatial distribution of LUCC in the Water Resource Protection scenario has the most obvious changes, followed by the Farmland Protection scenario and the Natural Development scenario becomes the third. In the water resources protection scenario, the scale of the desert decreases, but the forest and grass part increases, which is conducive to ecological improvement. (2) the distribution area of high ecological risk areas was the largest of three different scenarios, especially the farmland protection scenario. The area of low-risk level is the largest under the water conservation scenario. The ecological risk of LUCC under the water resources protection scenario is lower, which is better for ecological environment. (3) Water bodies mainly concentrate upon low ecological risk degree, ac-counting for approximately 62.8%, 82.2%, and 73.1% of low ecological risk; Farmland mainly lies in the low-risk areas, accounting for 59.1%, 63.5% and 68.8% of the lower ecological risk levels; In 2027, the unused land and other land types are the main land types of the higher ecological risk areas under three different scenarios, whose proportions are 67.40%, 68.24% and 65.90%, respectively.

TI  - Endometrial cancer in Lynch syndrome
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - Lynch syndrome (LS) is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by germline pathogenic variants (PVs) in mismatch repair (MMR) genes. LS-associated endometrial cancer (LS-EC) is the most common extraintestinal sentinel cancer caused by germline PVs in MMR genes, including MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2. The clinicopathologic features of LS-EC include early age of onset, lower body mass index (BMI), endometrioid carcinoma and lower uterine segment involvement. There has been significant progress in screening, diagnosis, surveillance, prevention and treatment of LS-EC. Many studies support universal screening for LS among patients with EC. Screening mainly involves a combination of traditional clinical criteria and molecular techniques, including MMR-immunohistochemistry (MMR-IHC), microsatellite instability (MSI) testing, MLH1 promoter methylation testing and gene sequencing. The effectiveness of endometrial biopsy and transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) for clinical monitoring of asymptomatic women with LS are uncertain yet. Preventive strategies include hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) as well as chemoprophylaxis using exogenous progestin or aspirin. Recent research has revealed the benefits of immunotherapy for LS-EC. The NCCN guidelines recommend pembrolizumab and nivolumab for treating patients with advanced or recurrent microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) EC.

TI  - Application of remote sensing and geographic information systems in irrigation water management under water scarcity conditions in Fayoum, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Egypt suffers from severe water scarcity, which affects the sustainability of agricultural production. Therefore, the sustainable use of available water resources under water scarcity requires the adoption of water allocation policies favoring conservative and efficient use. Water management with free satellite data and geographical information system modeling capabilities can be a valuable approach for optimizing the benefits from the available water resources to meet the requirements for agricultural lands. This study aims to (i) detect and evaluate changes in agricultural areas because of urbanization and reclamation activities using Landsat data in 1999, 2009, and 2019 and (ii) update the irrigation water demand by monitoring the seasonal changes of agricultural area based on normalized difference vegetation index. Water management of Fayoum Governorate in Egypt is characterized by a non-uniform distribution flow over its canals; thus, two pilot areas are selected. The first site is the Sinnuris canal, the served areas of which represents the urbanization problem. The other site is the Gharaq canal, the served areas of which represents the urbanization and agricultural expansion situations. The results reveal that changes in agricultural areas considerably affect the uniformity of water management. Urbanization activities reduce the agricultural area by similar to 5.0% and 5.7% in Sinnuris and Gharaq served areas, respectively. However, the newly cultivated lands in Gharaq preserve an increase of 5.8% in the total agricultural area. The considerably changed water allocation strategies in these districts since Sinnuris has an excess of 1.5 m(3)/s of water supply, while the Gharaq area faced an irrigation shortage of 0.26 m(3)/s in 2019. As per the proposed approach, the decision-makers can readjust the water allocation plan to satisfy the water requirements for other demand areas.

TI  - Satellite data and machine learning reveal a significant correlation between NO2 and COVID-19 mortality
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has officially spread all over the world since the beginning of 2020. Although huge efforts are addressed by scientists to shed light over the several questions raised by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, many aspects need to be clarified, yet. In particular, several studies have pointed out significant variations between countries in per-capita mortality. In this work, we investigated the association between COVID-19 mortality with climate variables and air pollution throughout European countries using the satellite remote sensing images provided by the Sentinel-5p mission. We analyzed data collected for two years of observations and extracted the concentrations of several pollutants; we used these measurements to feed a Random Forest regression. We performed a cross-validation analysis to assess the robustness of the model and compared several regression strategies. Our findings reveal a significant statistical association between air pollution (NO2) and COVID-19 mortality and a significant role played by the socio-demographic features, like the number of nurses or the hospital beds and the gross domestic product per capita.

AB  - This paper describes the specifications of the surface soil volumetric water content (Theta) [m(3)/m(3)] product derived from Sentinel-1 (S-1) data and assessed in the study "Sentinel-1 soil moisture at 1 km resolution: a validation study"[1]. The S-1 Theta product consists of Theta mean and standard deviation values at 1 km spatial resolution and is expected to support applications in agriculture and hydrology as well as the Numerical Weather Prediction at regional scale [2]. The retrieval algorithm is a time series based short term change detection that is implemented in the "Soil MOisture retrieval from multi-temporal SAR data"(SMOSAR) code (v2.0). The provided dataset represents an example of the developed S-1 Theta product and consists of a time series of 183 S-1 Theta images over Southern Italy from January 2015 to December 2018. The maps were produced for each ascending S-1 acquisition date on the Relative Orbit Number (RON) 146 and the temporal gap between consecutive maps is 6 days (when both S-1A and S-1B data are available) or 12 days.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of a novel high-resolution dedicated axillary PET system in the assessment of regional nodal spread of disease in early breast cancer
T2  - QUANTITATIVE IMAGING IN MEDICINE AND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In early breast cancer, a non-invasive method with higher sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) is needed to identify and recognize more indolent axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). This study aimed to assess whether a novel high-resolution dedicated ALN positron emission tomography (LymphPET) system could improve sensitivity in detecting early breast cancer (clinical N0-N1 stage).Methods: A total of 103 patients with clinical stage T1-2N0-1M 0 breast cancer were evaluated by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) LymphPET. The maximum single-voxel PET uptake value of ALNs (maxLUV) and the tumor-to-background ratio (TBR) for fat (TBR1) and muscle (TBR2) tissue were calculated. Then, 78 patients with cN0 stage breast cancer received sentinel lymph node biopsy alone or combined with axillary lymph node dissection (ALND), and 25 patients with cN1 stage breast cancer underwent fine-needle aspiration.Results: A total of 99 invasive breast carcinoma cases were included in this study. The diagnostic sensitivity of LymphPET was 88%, specificity was 79%, false-negative rate was 12%, the false-positive rate was 21%, positive predictive value was 75%, NPV was 90%, and accuracy was 83%. The maxLUV was superior to TBR1 and TBR2 in detecting ALNs, with 0.27 being the most optimal cutoff value.Conclusions: The F-18-FDG LymphPET system can be used to identify and recognize more indolent ALNs of breast cancer due to greater sensitivity and a much higher NPV.

TI  - Accessory breast cancer in the inframammary region: a case report and review of the literature
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Although a few cases of accessory breast cancer (ABC) have been reported, most were in the axillary region. We encountered an extremely rare case of ABC in the inframammary region (IMR). Case presentation The patient was a 68-year-old postmenopausal woman who had noticed a congenital accessory nipple in her left IMR with slight, occasional discharge 20 years ago. Recently, she noticed a mass under the accessory nipple and visited a nearby clinic; fine-needle aspiration cytology of the mass revealed that it was malignant. She presented to our department 2 weeks after she had noticed the mass. Physical and imaging examinations showed an irregular tumor mass 1.7 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm in size connected to the accessory nipple beneath the left normal breast. Neither distant metastasis nor lymph node swelling was observed. Ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy revealed the mass to be invasive ductal carcinoma. We diagnosed her tumor as ABC in the left IMR; cT1cN0M0: stage IA. Curative wide resection with sentinel node biopsy was performed. Intraoperative evaluation of the frozen section revealed a hot and green ipsilateral axillary lymph node that was free from carcinoma; therefore, nodal dissection was avoided. Histopathological examination including immunochemical staining revealed that the tumor was invasive ductal carcinoma arising from the accessory breast tissue, scirrhous type, 1.7 x 1.4 x 1.0 cm in size, with a solid intraductal component. There was no lymphovascular infiltration, and the surgical margin was 1.5 cm or more. The tumor was estrogen and progesterone receptor-positive, Her2/neu-negative, and had a Ki-67 labeling index of 20%. There was no involvement of the three hot and/or green nodes. The final classification was pT1cN0(sn)M0: stage IA. Letrozole 2.5 mg/day will be administered for 5 years as adjuvant hormonal therapy. Conclusions A cutaneous and/or subcutaneous lesion except for proper breast tissue on the milk line, or mammary ridge from axilla to groin may be an accessory breast tissue. Its serial abnormalities must be worried malignant potential to ductal carcinoma which needs some imaging and pathological examinations for definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment according to the usual orthotopic breast cancer without delay.

TI  - Mapping weather risk-A multi-indicator analysis of satellite-based weather data for agricultural index insurance development in semi-arid and arid zones of Central Asia
T2  - CLIMATE SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - Index insurance has been introduced as a solution to tackle several challenges that prevail in the agricultural insurance sector of developing countries. One of the main implementation challenges in these countries is the lack of reliable weather data for index development and implementation. The increasing availability of satellite data could ease the constraints of data access. Meanwhile, the suitability of various satellite products for yield estimation across world regions has to undergo a thorough assessment. This study contributes to the literature by systematically analyzing the accuracy of some globally available satellite data, namely the Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP), Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station (CHIRPS), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) compared to ground-level weather information for 14 different indicators for the case of Uzbekistan. Our analysis indicates that those sources may provide the necessary data for an accessible and adequate climate service. However, a considerable risk of overestimation and underestimation depending on the source of satellite data may exist, especially for precipitation data in the conditions of Central Asia. Among the tested datasets, GSMaP showed a relatively better performance than CHIRPS in precipitation estimation for drought and flood detection. In order to reduce detection inaccuracy, the application of satellite weather products for index insurance is possible when temporal aggregation (e.g., monthly, seasonal) is considered. Globally available climate data could serve as a good source to establish index insurance products in Central Asia; however, a careful selection of source and index is required.

TI  - Geospatial Analysis of Soil Erosion including Precipitation Scenarios in a Conservation Area of the Amazon Region in Peru
T2  - APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tilacancha Private Conservation Area provides fresh water to the city of Chachapoyas. Therefore, the amount of soil lost in the year and under precipitation scenarios was determined. Individually, the values of the factors were obtained: rain erosivity (R) in 2019 and simulating increase and decrease of 15% of rainfall, soil erodibility (K), length and degree of slope (LS), land cover (C), and conservation practices (P); they were integrated into USLE, obtaining A = R * K * LS * PC, (t/ha.yr). Six ranges of erosion were found, and the ACP had areas where from 0.4 to 665.20 t/ha.yr of soil was lost. A 15% reduction in rainfall would represent a loss of soil from 0.20 to 301.56 t/ha.yr and an increase in rainfall by 15%, and the erosion ranges would vary from 0.2 to 1028.84 t/ha.yr.

TI  - What's New with Endoscopic Treatments for Early Gastric Cancer in the "Post-ESD Era"?
T2  - DIGESTION
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Endoscopic treatments for gastric cancers have still been progressing even after the great success of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Summary: In further advancements of ESD, safe and less-invasive procedures are challenged by managing postoperative bleeding, one of the major adverse events in ESD. Covering the mucosal defect after removal of lesions appears reasonable and effective for preventing delayed bleeding from the post-ESD ulcers. Shielding with biodegradable sheets is attempted on clinical trials, which show equivocal results. Although suturing of the mucosal rims is technically challenging, pilot studies demonstrate favorable outcomes for avoiding post-ESD bleeding even in cases at high risk. In cases after noncurative resection of ESD, the selection of patients who truly require additional gastrectomy with lymph node dissection is important to provide necessary surgery. Risk stratification of lymph node metastases and surgery has been developed, which offers tailor-made management to each patient considering the risks and benefits. In surgery, function-preserving gastrectomy to minimize the resection area in both lymphadenectomy and the primary site is clinically introduced. The sentinel node navigation surgery is promising to realize the minimally invasive gastrectomy, and it should strongly fit ESD as well as laparoscopic endoscopic cooperative surgery or endoscopic full-thickness resection, although nonexposure approaches are desirable. Key Message: Development for less-invasive managements on gastric cancer will be continued in step with the advancement of endoscopic treatments.

TI  - Timely prediction potential of landslide early warning systems with multispectral remote sensing: a conceptual approach tested in the Sattelkar, Austria
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - While optical remote sensing has demonstrated its capabilities for landslide detection and monitoring, spatial and temporal demands for landslide early warning systems (LEWSs) had not been met until recently. We introduce a novel conceptual approach to structure and quantitatively assess lead time for LEWSs. We analysed "time to warning" as a sequence: (i) time to collect, (ii) time to process and (iii) time to evaluate relevant optical data. The difference between the time to warning and "forecasting window" (i.e. time from hazard becoming predictable until event) is the lead time for reactive measures. We tested digital image correlation (DIC) of best-suited spatiotemporal techniques, i.e. 3m resolution PlanetScope daily imagery and 0.16m resolution unmanned aerial system (UAS)-derived orthophotos to reveal fast ground displacement and acceleration of a deep-seated, complex alpine mass movement leading to massive debris flow events. The time to warning for the UAS/PlanetScope totals 31/21 h and is comprised of time to (i) collect - 12/14 h, (ii) process - 17/5 h and (iii) evaluate - 2/2 h, which is well below the forecasting window for recent benchmarks and facilitates a lead time for reactive measures. We show optical remote sensing data can support LEWSs with a sufficiently fast processing time, demonstrating the feasibility of optical sensors for LEWSs.

TI  - Liquid Phase Cloud Microphysical Property Estimates From CALIPSO Measurements
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A neural-network algorithm that uses CALIPSO lidar measurements to infer droplet effective radius, extinction coefficient, liquid-water content, and droplet number concentration for water clouds is described and assessed. These results are verified against values inferred from High-Spectral-Resolution Lidar (HSRL) and Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) measurements made on an aircraft that flew under CALIPSO. The global cloud microphysical properties are derived from 14+ years of CALIPSO lidar measurements, and the droplet sizes are compared to corresponding values inferred from MODIS passive imagery. This new product will provide constraints to improve modeling of Earth's water cycle and cloud-climate interactions.

TI  - Rethinking Satellite Data Merging: From Averaging to SNR Optimization
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Merging of multiple satellite datasets is a simple yet effective way to reduce prediction error. However, most merging methods for satellite data today are based on weighted averaging first proposed in 1969 for economic forecasting, which does not provide optimal outcomes when applied to satellite data. If our aim is to produce a merged data product that minimizes the prediction errors against a prediction target, there is no reason to insist that the merged product be an average of the parent datasets. A more disciplined approach based on mathematical optimization would be to minimize prediction errors. However, formulating merging as an optimization problem is insufficient by itself as the statistics needed for optimization, e.g., signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of parent products, are often unavailable in practice and must be estimated jointly. In this article, we address both of these problems for data merging. We first formulate optimal merging of satellite data as a SNR optimization (SNR-opt), and propose an estimation method to jointly estimate the required SNRs. This SNR-based approach has a natural interpretation as a multi-input single-output Wiener filter. Through extensive experimental validation on three global-scale satellite-derived soil moisture and land surface temperature products, we demonstrate that our SNR-opt significantly improves merging over the existing weighted averaging scheme.

TI  - 'Don't panic people! Trump will tweet the virus away': memes contesting and confirming populist political leaders during the COVID-19 crisis
T2  - INFORMATION COMMUNICATION & SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - When the COVID-19 pandemic triggered a global health crisis in early 2020, memes of populist political leaders were disseminated in abundance on social media. At first sight, these political memes satirized and exposed the hazardous actions, appearances and communicative strategies of the populist leaders in this unforeseen situation that not only unsettled existing power balances, but also standard modes of professional and personal conduct. Based on a thematic analysis of memes of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump during the COVID-19 crisis, this paper finds, however, that the political memes' critical and affirmative power conflated. This challenged their potential as counter-narratives to the actions and communication of these populist leaders. We argue that this can be explained by an overlap in the communicative form of populism and memes: Political memes are a social media genre that uses incongruent humor to expose the contradictions, conflicts and hypocrisy of populist politicians. Similarly, populist politicians communicate in polarizing and personalizing rhetoric that emphasizes conflicts and the mischiefs of others on social media and beyond. This raises the broader question of how populist leaders might be criticized and their actions subjected to scrutiny in political memes without feeding into their own communicative patterns and logics, and thus unintentionally confirming their worldview and interpretations of events.

TI  - Predictors of positive axillary non-sentinel lymph nodes in breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy after neoadjuvant systemic therapy
T2  - RADIOTHERAPY AND ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: To assess the rate of positive non-sentinel lymph nodes (non-SLNs) after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (NAST) in breast cancer (BC) following positive sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Materials and methods: From institutional database, 265 consecutive patients receiving NAST for cT1-3, any N, M0 BC between 2001 and 2018 were identified. Patients presented clinically negative axilla before surgery and were candidate for SLNB. Following metastatic SLNB, completion axillary lymph node dissection (AxLND) was performed. Non-SLNs rate was investigated using multivariate (MV) logistic regression models. The distribution of non-SLNs across the axilla was observed. Results: Positive non-SLNs were found in 62.3% of cases and showed no correlation with SLN metastasis size. At MV, statistically significant variables associated with non-SLNs were older age (p = 0.025), clinically positive lymph nodes (p = 0.002), SLN extracapsular extension (ECE, p = 0.001), and higher ratio of positive SLNs/total SLNs (p = 0.016). ECE and higher nodal ratio were independent predictors of III axillary level positivity. By categorizing patients in intermediate-and high-risk groups using the study variables, positive non-SLNs were found in the range of 23-56% across the three axillary levels, rates which did not support radiotherapy volume deescalation. The III axillary level lower involvement (6.3%) was better identified with the RAPCHEM trial criteria based on the ypN status after AxLND. Conclusions: Involved non-SLNs rate following positive SLNB after NAST is nearly double the rate observed after primary surgery, supporting some intervention on the axilla. If AxLND is limited to I and II level, the involvement of the III level up to 31% of the cases seems to require some additional treatment, while the omission in selected cases needs further investigation.

TI  - Soil Moisture Estimation Using Atmospherically Corrected C-Band InSAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A methodology to generate calibrated maps of soil moisture from C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images processed by SAR interferometry (InSAR) technique is presented. The proposed methodology uses atmospheric phase delay (APD) maps obtained from a time series of Sentinel-1 interferograms, to disentangle the APD and soil moisture contributions to Sentinel-1 interferograms. We show how the high spatial resolution and short temporal baseline of Sentinel-1 image can help to estimate soil moisture using a daisy chain InSAR processing. The estimated soil moisture maps are compared with in situ data collected by five soil moisture sensors installed in an experimental field, characterized by bare soil, located close to Lisbon, Portugal. Results show that after removing the APD effects in SAR interferogram, there is a correction of the bias in the soil moisture estimation and an improvement in the correlation coefficient with the soil moisture measurements, from 0.38 to 0.78. Soil moisture changes were measured during a sequence of rain events in the winter season. A root-mean-square (rms) error less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3) was found over a variety of meteorological conditions.

TI  - Insights Into Unveiling a Potential Role of Tertiary Lymphoid Structures in Metastasis
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - Tertiary lymphoid structures (TLSs) develop in non-lymphatic tissue in chronic inflammation and cancer. TLS can mature to lymph node (LN) like structures with germinal centers and associated vasculature. TLS neogenesis in cancer is highly varied and tissue dependent. The role of TLS in adaptive antitumor immunity is of great interest. However, data also show that TLS can play a role in cancer metastasis. The importance of lymphatics in cancer distant metastasis is clear yet the precise detail of how various immunosurveillance mechanisms interplay within TLS and/or draining LN is still under investigation. As part of the tumor lymphatics, TLS vasculature can provide alternative routes for the establishment of the pre-metastatic niche and cancer dissemination. The nature of the cytokine and chemokine signature at the heart of TLS induction can be key in determining the success of antitumor immunity or in promoting cancer invasiveness. Understanding the biochemical and biomechanical factors underlying TLS formation and the resulting impact on the primary tumor will be key in deciphering cancer metastasis and in the development of the next generation of cancer immunotherapeutics.</p>

TI  - Classification of Remote Sensing Images With Parameterized Quantum Gates
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This letter studies how to program and assess a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) for classifying Earth observation (EO) satellite images. In this exploratory study, we assess a PQC for classifying a two-label EO image dataset and compare it with a classic deep learning classifier. We use the PQC with an input space of only 17 quantum bits (qubits) due to the current limitations of quantum technology. As a real-world image for EO, we selected the Eurosat dataset obtained from multispectral Sentinel-2 images as a training dataset and a Sentinel-2 image of Berlin, Germany, as a test image. However, the high dimensionality of our images is incompatible with the PQC input domain of 17 qubits. Hence, we had to reduce the dimensionality of the input images for this two-label case to a vector with 16 elements; the 17th qubit remains reserved for storing label information. We employed a very deep convolutional network with an autoencoder as a technique for the dimensionality reduction of the input image, and we mapped the dimensionally reduced image onto 16 qubits by means of parameter thresholding. Then, we used a PQC to classify the two-label content of the dimensionally reduced Eurosat image dataset. A PQC classifies the Eurosat images with high accuracy as a classic deep learning method (and with even better accuracy in some instances). From our experiment, we derived and enhanced deeper insight into programming future gate-based quantum computers for many practical problems in EO.

TI  - The influence of window size on remote sensing-based prediction of forest structural variables
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Determining the appropriate window size is a critical step in the estimation process of stand structural variables based on remote sensing data. Because the value of the reference laser and image metrics that affect the quality of the prediction model depends on window size. However, suitable window sizes are usually determined by trial and error. There are a limited number of published studies evaluating appropriate window sizes for different remote sensing data. This research investigated the effect of window size on predicting forest structural variables using airborne LiDAR data, digital aerial image and WorldView-3 satellite image. Results In the WorldView-3 and digital aerial image, significant differences were observed in the prediction accuracies of the structural variables according to different window sizes. For the estimation based on WorldView-3 in black pine stands, the optimal window sizes for stem number (N), volume (V), basal area (BA) and mean height (H) were determined as 1000 m(2), 100 m(2), 100 m(2) and 600 m(2), respectively. In oak stands, the R-2 values of each moving window size were almost identical for N and BA. The optimal window size was 400 m(2) for V and 600 m(2) for H. For the estimation based on aerial image in black pine stands, the 800 m(2) window size was optimal for N and H, the 600 m(2) window size was optimal for V and the 1000 m(2) window size was optimal for BA. In the oak stands, the optimal window sizes for N, V, BA and H were determined as 1000 m(2), 100 m(2), 100 m(2) and 600 m(2), respectively. The optimal window sizes may need to be scaled up or down to match the stand canopy components. In the LiDAR data, the R-2 values of each window size were almost identical for all variables of the black pine and the oak stands. Conclusion This study illustrated that the window size has an effect on the prediction accuracy in estimating forest structural variables based on remote sensing data. Moreover, the results showed that the optimal window size for forest structural variables varies according to remote sensing data and tree species composition.

TI  - Systematic literature review of current treatments for stage I-III Merkel cell carcinoma
T2  - FUTURE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Aim: There is a need to evaluate current treatments for stages I-III of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Materials & methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to understand how patients with stage I-III MCC are treated and assess efficacy, safety, health-related quality of life and economic impact of current therapies. Embase was searched using the following inclusion criteria: publications from 2014 to 2019, in English, with adult patients (>= 18 years) with early-stage MCC (i.e., stages I-III) and any interventions/comparators. Publications were excluded if they included only patients with stage IV MCC, had no distinction between early and advanced or metastatic MCC or had no extractable data. Results: A total of 18 retrospective studies were included. Few studies had evidence that surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy significantly increased survival versus surgery alone in early MCC. Limited safety data were reported in three studies. None of the studies reported data on health-related quality of life or economic impact of treatment in patients with early-stage MCC. Conclusion: Although surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy was a common treatment, no clear standard of care exists for stages I-III MCC and treatment outcomes need to be improved. All studies were retrospective with a high variability in sample sizes; hence, findings should be interpreted with caution.

TI  - A satellite-data-driven framework to rapidly quantify air-basin-scale NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions and its application to the Po Valley during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates timely estimates of the resultant perturbations to anthropogenic emissions. Here we present a novel framework based on the relationships between observed column abundance and wind speed to rapidly estimate the air-basinscale NOx emission rate and apply it at the Po Valley in Italy using OMI and TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric column observations. The NOx chemical lifetime is retrieved together with the emission rate and found to be 15-20 h in winter and 56 h in summer. A statistical model is trained using the estimated emission rates before the pandemic to predict the trajectory without COVID-19. Compared with this business-asusual trajectory, the real emission rates show three distinctive drops in March 2020 (-42 %), November 2020 (-38%), and March 2021 (-39%) that correspond to tightened COVID-19 control measures. The temporal variation of pandemicinduced NOx emission changes qualitatively agrees with Google and Apple mobility indicators. The overall net NOx emission reduction in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic is estimated to be 22%.

TI  - An LSTM neural network for improving wheat yield estimates by integrating remote sensing data and meteorological data in the Guanzhong Plain, PR China
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop growth condition and production play an important role in food management and economic development. Therefore, estimating yield accurately and timely is of vital importance for regional food security. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model represents a deep network structure to incorporating crop growth processes, which has been proven to accommodate different types and representations of data, recognize sequential patterns over long time spans, and capture complex nonlinear relationships. The LSTM model was developed to estimate wheat yield in the Guanzhong Plain by integrating meteorological data and two remotely sensed indices, vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) and leaf area index (LAI) at the main growth stages. Considering the LSTM model has characteristics of memorizing time series information, we adopted different time steps to estimate wheat yield. The results showed that the accuracy of yield estimation was highest (RMSE = 357.77 kg/ha and R-2 = 0.83) under two time steps and the input combination (meteorological data and two remotely sensed indices). We evaluated the yield estimation accuracy of the optimal LSTM model performance compared with the back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine (SVM). As a result, the LSTM model outperformed BPNN (R-2 = 0.42 and RMSE = 812.83 kg/ha) and SVM (R-2 = 0.41 and RMSE = 867.70 kg/ha), since its recurrent neural network structure that can incorporate nonlinear relationships between multi-features inputs and yield. To further validate the robustness of the optimal LSTM method, the correlations between estimated yield and measured yield at the irrigation sites and the rain-fed sites from 2008 to 2016 were analyzed, and the results demonstrated that the proposed model can serve as an effective approach for different type sampling sites and has better adaptability to interannual fluctuations of climate. Our findings demonstrated a reliable and promising approach for improving yield estimation.

TI  - Error Characterization of Satellite SSS Products Based on Extended Collocation Analysis
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Triple collocation analysis is an effective method for assessing the error of observation systems with independent random error. However, this error independence is often violated, and systems show clear error correlations. Whereas many efforts have been devoted, the cause and determination of this error correlation are still challenging. In this work, we reveal that the error correlation is actually a signal observed by some systems, and taking this signal as the error correlation between systems will bias the error estimation results. Therefore, we define it as the representativeness signal instead of the representativeness error. Based on the multiscale signal approach and extended collocation analysis, we discuss the cause of this representativeness signal and its effect on sea surface salinity (SSS) data validation by synthesized experiments, satellite, buoy, and climatology products. The results suggest that the representativeness signal may vary with the different behaviors of observed variables. For SSS, the representativeness signal lies in satellite data with medium resolutions and similar representativeness. However, the in situ and climatology data, which have different resolutions compared with satellites, do not show apparent representativeness signals with satellite data. The data collocation procedure also affects the representativeness signal, which decreases with increasing collocation intervals. The extended collocation analysis can estimate the error of SSS products in most cases but may not provide robust estimation when the collocation data pairs are limited.

TI  - The efficiency of a combined injection technique for sentinel lymph node mapping in intermediate-high-risk endometrial cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping was considered for treating endometrial cancer (EC) which was apparent confined to the uterus. Nevertheless, intermediate-high-risk EC patients have super high risk to undergo isolated para-aortic lymph node metastases comparing with low-risk patients. Therefore, this investigation aimed to compare the efficacy of two SLN methods in detecting para-aortic lymph node metastases. Methods According to SLN mapping injection methods, intermediate-high-risk EC patients who received both SLN mapping and systematic lymphadenectomy were divided into the combined group (fundal and cervical injections) and the cervical group (cervical injection only). Results The para-aortic SLN detection rate in the combined group (40.4%) was higher than that in the cervical group (4.4%) with p < 0.001. While the differences concerning the sensitivity, false-negative rate, and negative predictive value between the two groups were not significant. The survival outcomes of patients were comparable between the two groups. Conclusion Our data showcased that the combined (fundal and cervical) injection had a higher detection rate of para-aortic SLNs than cervical injection only. The efficiency of SLN mapping and the survival outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. Further investigations are warranted to assess the value of combined injection regarding SLN technique.

TI  - Geochemical behavior and fractionation characteristics of rare earth elements (REEs) in riverine water profiles and sentinel Clam<i> (Corbicula</i><i> fluminea)</i> across watershed scales: Insights for REEs monitoring
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing global demand for rare earth elements (REEs) has led to their recognition as emerging contaminants; however, the effect that biota have on the cycling of these elements at the watershed scale is not currently well understood. In this study, water samples and field freshwater clams Corbicula fluminea were concurrently collected along watershed gradients, and concentration profiles of 14 naturally occurring REEs were measured in operationally defined water fractions and soft tissues of the freshwater clams. Moreover, Post Archean Australian Shale (PAAS) normalized REE patterns, fractionation indices, and anomalous values were determined to further extract characteristic features. As a result, both the water and biological samples had variable REE compositions, with higher concentrations of light REEs (LREEs) than middle REEs (MREEs) and heavy REEs (HREEs), while decreasing concentrations were generally observed as filter pore size decreased, implying that large colloidal and particulate fractions were important carriers of REEs. The spatial distribution patterns of REEs revealed a clear site effect among profiles, with variability more pronounced among watersheds and with peaks in sites from a small watershed near the hotspots of the mining area, and then exhibited a decreasing trend with distance from there. Meanwhile, significant bioaccumulation of REEs was observed potentially reflecting different degrees of contamination gradients among the watersheds. The PAAS-normalized distribution patterns tended to be slightly enriched in MREEs, producing a peculiar "roof-shaped" feature and characteristic fractionation. Remarkably, bio-concentration factors (BCFs) highlighted the importance of large colloidal and particulate phases in assessing biologically available REEs for filter-feeding species. Collectively, our study strongly favored that accumulation patterns and fractionation characteristics of REEs in C. fluminea can serve as a reliable indicator of geochemical behavior, providing a promising biomonitoring tool to quantitatively denote different degrees of REE contamination and assess possible impacts in mining watersheds.

TI  - Estimation of the Hourly Aerosol Optical Depth From GOCI Geostationary Satellite Data: Deep Neural Network, Machine Learning, and Physical Models
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a new deep learning method was developed to estimate the spatiotemporal properties of the hourly aerosol optical depth (AOD) because existing physical models are limited in their abilities to separate the reflectance between aerosols and the underlying surface over land, accurately and effectively. By incorporating geostationary ocean color imagery (GOCI), multispectral bands were applied to train data-driven models to estimate the high-spatiotemporal-resolution AOD over Northeast Asia. Physical model and traditional machine learning (ML) models (the random forest (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models) were compared with the deep neural network (DNN) model to evaluate its accuracy, implementing hold-out validation and k-fold cross-validation approaches. In the statistical results of the hold-out validation, the DNN model showed the higher accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.112, mean bias error (MBE) = 0.007, and correlation coefficient (R) = 0.863) relative to the traditional SVR (RMSE = 0.123, MBE = -0.010, and R = 0.833) and RF (RMSE = 0.125, MBE = 0.004, and R = 0.825) models. The DNN model also exhibited the best performance for most statistical metrics among the traditional SVR, RF, and selected physical models (except for the correlation coefficients and index of agreement) in the spatial and temporal cross-validation analyses. Although the DNN model was trained using the match-up dataset between the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance from GOCI multispectral bands and AErosol RObotic NETwork measurements, it showed high spatial and temporal generalization performance owing to its deeper and more complicated network structure. Hourly GOCI AOD data obtained using a deep learning approach with high accuracy are expected to be useful for the quantification of aerosol contents and monitoring of diurnal variations in the AOD.

TI  - Social worldviews and the likelihood of engaging in preemptive strikes
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the present studies was to examine the connections that the dangerous and competitive social worldviews had with the likelihood of engaging in preemptive strikes. More specifically, the focus was on the possibility that the associations these social worldviews had with the likelihood to engage in preemptive strikes may be mediated by perceived threat and certain psychological states (e.g., fear). The results of three studies with large Israeli community samples revealed partial support for our hypotheses using preemptive strike dilemmas concerning a business partnership (Study 1; N = 1629), a romantic relationship (Study 2; N =1481), and a home intruder (Study 3; N = 1502). As expected, the dangerous social worldview had a positive indirect association with the likelihood of engaging in preemptive strikes through perceived threat in each study. In contrast, the competitive social worldview had positive direct associations with the likelihood to engage in preemptive strikes in each study but the indirect association through perceived threat was less consistent. Discussion focuses on the implications of these results for understanding the roles that perceived threat may play in the connections between social worldviews and the likelihood of engaging in preemptive strikes.

TI  - Mapping floodplain bathymetry in the middle-lower Amazon River using inundation frequency and field control
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the geomorphic classification and bathymetry (at 100 m) of 12 major floodplains along a 900 km reach of the middle-lower Amazon River (Manaus - Monte Alegre; total floodplain area of 5164 km2), based on the inundation frequency (IF) derived from 36 yr of Landsat data. Using a mathematical relationship between IF and surveyed depth at the Curuai floodplain in June 2004, this IF-depth model is applied across floodplains of the middle-lower Amazon to estimate bathymetry. The applicability of the model is justified by similar grain size distribution (dominantly silt and clay) of sediment in the surface water of floodplain lakes (the main materials constructing the floodplains), as well as a hydrogeomorphic classification of this reach: seven floodplains lying on the alluvial plain dominated by the Amazon-flood pulse (Type I), three floodplains incised in valleys dominated by sediment-poor upland tributaries (Type II) and two floodplains of mixed types. This classification is used to distinguish the sensitivity of floodplains to the IF-depth model, where Type I floodplains of higher sensitivity provide a more accurate depth estimation. The bathymetry for both types is validated with field survey data across eight floodplains (covering over 200 km survey distance) collected in June - July 2016 and adjusted by the difference between mean June 2004 and June/July 2016 water level. Correlation coefficients of 0.87 (Type I) and 0.94 (Type II) indicate a strong relationship between estimated and measured depth for both floodplain types, while the root mean square error of 1.03 m (Type I) and 1.02 m (Type II) suggest that bathymetry is estimated to around 1 m error, equivalent to 10.9% and 10.8% of maximum water level variability, respectively. We offer the first field-validated and complete bathymetry map for the middle-lower Amazon River with accuracy that can be used to evaluate the role of floodplains in influencing biodiversity, sedimentation, flood control and biogeochemical cycling.

TI  - Contextualizing Thermal Effluent Impacts in Narragansett Bay Using Landsat-Derived Surface Temperature
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This work utilizes remotely sensed thermal data to understand how the release of thermal pollution from the Brayton Point Power Station (BPPS) affected the temperature behavior of Narragansett Bay. Building upon previous work with Landsat 5, a multi-satellite analysis is conducted that incorporates 582 scenes from Landsat 5, Landsat 7, and Landsat 8 over 1984-2021 to explain seasonal variability in effluent impacts, contrast data after the effluent ceased in 2011, identify patterns in temperature before and after effluent ceased using unsupervised learning, and track how recent warming trends compare to the BPPS impact. Stopping the thermal effluent corresponds to an immediate cooling of 0.26 +/- 0.1 degrees C in the surface temperature of Mt. Hope Bay with respect to the rest of Narragansett Bay with greater cooling of 0.62 +/- 0.2 degrees C found near Brayton Point; though, cooling since the period of maximal impact (1993-2000) totals 0.53 +/- 0.2 degrees C in Mt. Hope Bay and 1.04 +/- 0.2 degrees C at Brayton Point. During seasons with lower solar radiation (winter) and lower mean river input (autumn and late summer), the BPPS effluent impact is more prominent. The seasonal differences between the high impact and low impact periods indicate that river input played an important role in the heat balance when emissions were lower, but surface fluxes dominated when emissions were higher. Putting the BPPS effluent in context, Landsat data indicates that Narragansett Bay warmed 0.5-1.2 degrees C over the period of measurement at an average rate of 0.23 +/- 0.1 degrees C/decade and that net warming in Mt. Hope Bay is near zero. This trend implies that Narragansett Bay has experienced climatic warming over the past four decades on the scale of the temperature anomaly in Mt. Hope Bay caused by the BBPS effluent.

TI  - PCA driven watershed prioritization based on runoff modeling and drought severity assessment in parts of Koel river basin, Jharkhand (India)
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming influencing regional climate is playing a significant role in triggering the recurrent drought. The current study demonstrates a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) driven watershed prioritization in a part of Koel river basin by runoff computation during monsoon season along with assessment of Vegetation Health Index (VHI) derived from MODIS satellite data during the period from 2000 to 2017. Koel river catchment area of 7,261 sq km was divided into 82 sub-watersheds based on drainage networks derived from Survey of India (SOI) topographical map on scale 1: 50,000. High resolution satellite image of Sentinel-2 was used to prepare land use land cover map. Soil conservation service curve number method (SCS CN) was used to estimate runoff. Result obtained from runoff estimation of 82 sub watersheds shows high runoff (50 to 60% of rainfall) with 290,000 m(3) total runoff volume in the upper and middle parts of the catchment dominated by agricultural/fallow and barren lands whereas low runoff was estimated (20 to 30%) with 29,467 m(3) in the lower catchments where a large area is covered with forests. The value of satellite based VHI ranges between 23 to 53 with major parts of the area exhibiting values less than 30 reflecting poor vegetation health. Most of the sub-watersheds in parts of Ranchi, Lohardaga, Gumla and Khunti districts experienced high total runoff with poor vegetation health index reflecting more proneness to drought. Watershed prioritization was done based on correlation among four parameters viz., rainfall, drought zones, direct runoff and total runoff through PCA. Strong correlation between total runoff volume and drought areas was used for watershed prioritization which indicated 42 sub-watersheds (4,703 sq km) in the upper catchment required high prioritization. The outcomes of study would help proper planning of water resources and soil moisture management to overcome the recurrent drought conditions at watershed level.

TI  - Explaining discrepancies between spectral and in-situ plant diversity in multispectral satellite earth observation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In light of the ongoing global biodiversity crisis, the urge to monitor and map terrestrial plant biodiversity at large spatial extents has spurred research on adequate quantitative methods. The use of spectral diversity metrics from different remote sensing platforms has emerged as a promising tool for such biodiversity assessments. Satellite remote sensing presents the next frontier for implementation of these methods to assess plant diversity with spatial and temporal continuity at truly regional or global scales. However, the question of what exactly is monitored by spectral diversity metrics from relatively coarse multi-spectral satellite observations has remained largely unanswered. In this research, we examined which components contribute to satellite remotely sensed spectral diversity. We assessed the relationships between spectral diversity and in-situ taxonomic and trait diversity, and evaluated the role of confounding factors, vegetation cover, and landscape morphology (slope and elevation), in shaping these relationships. Hereto, we used Sentinel-2 imagery and in-situ field trait and species count data collected in the Montesinho-Nogueira Natura 2000 site (Portugal) together with radiative transfer models to quantify the theoretical link between in-situ trait diversity and simulated spectral diversity. Through the use of linear mixed-effect models, our results highlight that variation in vegetation cover dominates the Sentinel-2's spectral diversity signal (contributing 53-84% of the R2marginal). The vegetation cover component encompasses spatial variability in canopy architecture traits as well as the fraction of bare soil and plant litter spectra. These elements together strongly impact the overall spectral diversity signal, as shown both in our radiative transfer simulations and empirical comparisons. Next to vegetation cover, we found that taxonomic diversity is a significant predictor and covariate of spectral diversity, while the role of leaf trait diversity appeared insignificant in our multispectral dataset. Variation in vegetation cover dominated the spectral diversity signal in our study while it is not necessarily correlated with plant diversity. We, therefore, recommend that future applications of multi-spectral diversity metrics consider the impact of vegetation cover, including soil variability and the role of morphological traits, in shaping leaf trait - canopy reflectance relationships to better understand the ambiguous performance of spectral diversity as a proxy of plant diversity. This will result in higher robustness, consistency, and scalability of spectral diversity metrics for predicting in-situ plant diversity across scales, sensors, and ecosystems in regional biodiversity assessments.

TI  - Gaussian Markov random fields improve ensemble predictions of daily 1 km PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> across France
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - ( )Understanding the health impacts of particulate matter (PM) requires spatiotemporally continuous exposure estimates. We developed a multi-stage ensemble model that estimates daily mean PM2.5 and PM10 at 1 km spatial resolution across France from 2000 to 2019. First, we alleviated the sparsity of PM2.5 monitors by imputing PM2.5 at more common PM10 monitors. We also imputed missing satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) based on modelled AOD from atmospheric reanalyses. Next, we trained three base learners (mixed models, Gaussian Markov random fields, and random forests) to predict daily PM concentrations based on AOD, meteorology, and other variables. Finally, we generated ensemble predictions using a generalized additive model with spatiotemporally varying weights that exploit the strengths and weaknesses of each base learner. The Gaussian Markov random field dominated the ensemble, outperforming mixed models and random forests at most locations on most days. Rigorous cross-validation showed that the ensemble predictions were quite accurate, with mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.72 mu g/m(3) and R-2 of 0.76 for PM2.5; PM10 MAE was 4.26 mu g/m(3) and R-2 0.71. Our predictions are available to improve epidemiological studies of acute and chronic PM exposure in urban and rural France.

TI  - Selecting informative bands for partial least squares regressions improves their goodness-of-fits to estimate leaf photosynthetic parameters from hyperspectral data
T2  - PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The plant photosynthetic capacity determines the photosynthetic rates of the terrestrial biosphere. Timely approaches to obtain the spatiotemporal variations of the photosynthetic parameters are urgently needed to grasp the gas exchange rhythms of the terrestrial biosphere. While partial least squares regression (PLSR) is a promising way to predict the photosynthetic parameters maximum carboxylation rate (V-cmax) and maximum electron transport rate (J(max)) rapidly and non-destructively from hyperspectral data, the approach, however, faces a high risk of overfitting and remains a high hurdle for applications. In this study, we propose to incorporate proper band selection techniques for PLSR analysis to refine the goodness-of-fit (GoF) in estimating V-cmax and J(max). Different band selection procedures coupled with different hyperspectral forms (reflectance, apparent absorption, as well as derivatives) were examined. Our results demonstrate that the GoFs of PLSR models could be greatly improved by combining proper band selection methods (especially the iterative stepwise elimination approach) rather than using full bands as commonly done with PLSR. The results also show that the 1st order derivative spectra had a balance between accuracy (R-2 = 0.80 for V-cmax, and 0.94 for J(max)) and denoising (when a Gaussian noise was added to each leaf reflectance spectrum at each wavelength with a standard deviation of 1%) on retrieving photosynthetic parameters from hyperspectral data. Our results clearly illustrate the advantage of using the band selection approach for PLSR dimensionality reduction and model optimization, highlighting the superiority of using derivative spectra for V-cmax and J(max) estimations, which should provide valuable insights for retrieving photosynthetic parameters from hyperspectral remotely sensed data.

TI  - Prognostic factors of head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review
T2  - JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Head and neck cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HNCSCC) is a non-melanoma skin cancer that is mostly caused by solar ultraviolet radiation exposure. While it usually has an excellent prognosis, a subset of patients (5%) develops nodal metastasis and has poor outcomes. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature and evaluate the prognostic factors of HNCSCC in order to better understand which patients are the most likely to develop metastatic disease.Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed on PubMed and EMBASE to identify the studies that evaluated the prognostic factors of HNCSCC. Prognostic factors were deemed significant if they had a reported p-value of < 0.05. Proportions of studies that reported a given factor to be statistically significant were calculated for each prognostic factor.Results: The search yielded a total of 958 citations. Forty studies, involving a total of 8535 patients, were included in the final analysis. The pre-operative/clinical prognostic factors with the highest proportion of significance were state of immunosuppression (73.3%) and age (53.3%); while post-operative/pathological prognostic factors of importance were number of lymph nodes involved with carcinoma (70.0%), margins involved with carcinoma (66.7%), and tumor depth (50.0%).Conclusion: This systematic review is aimed to aid physicians in assessing the prognosis of HNCSCC and identifying the subsets of patients that are most susceptible to metastasis. It also suggests that immunosuppressed patients with a high-risk feature on biopsy, such as invasion beyond subcutaneous fat, could possibly benefit from a sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Surgical technique for sentinel lymph node sampling in endometrial cancer using the articulated HOOK monopolar instrument
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGICAL CANCER
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - Lymph node status represents an important prognostic factor in endometrial cancer (EC) that can help guide post-operative adjuvant treatment.(1) The benefits of sentinel lymph node (SLN) sampling over lymphadenectomy in EC are well established.(2-4) The use of the HOOK monopolar instrument to facilitate this dissection is not documented. The objective of this video is to stepwise demonstrate the feasibility and advantages of using the HOOK to perform SLN sampling in EC. This video report is part of an institutional, investigational board-approved study. The surgery was performed in a 77-year-old woman who presented to our center with a grade 1 endometroid EC on endometrial biopsy. At the onset of surgery, a frozen aliquot of 0.4 mL indocyanine green reconstituted with 3.6 mL of saline solution was used to infiltrate the cervix at the 3 and 9 o'clock positions. The SLN was identified using the fluorescence-guided camera of the Xi DaVinci robotic system (Sunnyvale, California, USA). Several minutes after the injection the SLN was identified and a dissection was performed using the HOOK monopolar instrument. After dissection, the SLN was extracted and sent to pathology for evaluation by ultra-staging. The final pathology revealed a stage II grade 2 tumor, and the patient underwent external beam pelvic radiotherapy and vaginal brachytherapy. We conclude that the use of the articulated HOOK monopolar instrument appears feasible and advantageous for SLN sampling in EC.

M3  - Article
AB  - The spread of COVID-19 during 2020 impacted the whole world and still affecting the lives of people living in some parts of the world. The spread of this epidemic started in the US in late March 2020 and became a major issue in April due to an outburst of COVID-19 cases. Most of the countries in the world imposed complete to partial lockdown, but in the US, few states imposed lockdowns. Even after the advisory of the various Government department, the mobility data suggest that there was an enhancement (10-15%) in mobility during March 2020. Later sudden drop in mobility was observed during April 2020. The fall in aerosols optical depth (AOD), particulate matter concentration, NO2, and Ozone are observed along with the positive shifts in the SO2. In some of the states, AOD shows pronounced decline during May and June (5-40.90%), in the month of May more than 80% decline was observed compared to the month of June 2020. In the month of April 2020, up to 73.64% decline was observed in NO2, and 70-99% in the months of May and June 2020. We found a good relationship between the mobility data and improvement in the air quality of the US. The changes were not significant compared to other countries in the world due to scattered lockdown policy, but in the US a pronounced change is observed during April month compared to March and May.

TI  - ERA5-Land: a state-of-the-art global reanalysis dataset for land applications
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - Framed within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) of the European Commission, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) is producing an enhanced global dataset for the land component of the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5), hereafter referred to as ERA5-Land. Once completed, the period covered will span from 1950 to the present, with continuous updates to support land monitoring applications. ERA5-Land describes the evolution of the water and energy cycles over land in a consistent manner over the production period, which, among others, could be used to analyse trends and anomalies. This is achieved through global high-resolution numerical integrations of the ECMWF land surface model driven by the downscaled meteorological forcing from the ERA5 climate reanalysis, including an elevation correction for the thermodynamic near-surface state. ERA5-Land shares with ERA5 most of the parameterizations that guarantees the use of the state-of-the-art land surface modelling applied to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. A main advantage of ERA5-Land compared to ERA5 and the older ERA-Interim is the horizontal resolution, which is enhanced globally to 9 km compared to 31 km (ERA5) or 80 km (ERA-Interim), whereas the temporal resolution is hourly as in ERA5. Evaluation against independent in situ observations and global model or satellite-based reference datasets shows the added value of ERA5-Land in the description of the hydrological cycle, in particular with enhanced soil moisture and lake description, and an overall better agreement of river discharge estimations with available observations. However, ERA5-Land snow depth fields present a mixed performance when compared to those of ERA5, depending on geographical location and altitude. The description of the energy cycle shows comparable results with ERA5. Nevertheless, ERA5-Land reduces the global averaged root mean square error of the skin temperature, taking as reference MODIS data, mainly due to the contribution of coastal points where spatial resolution is important. Since January 2020, the ERA5-Land period available has extended from January 1981 to the near present, with a 2- to 3-month delay with respect to real time. The segment prior to 1981 is in production, aiming for a release of the whole dataset in summer/autumn 2021. The high spatial and temporal resolution of ERA5-Land, its extended period, and the consistency of the fields produced makes it a valuable dataset to support hydrological studies, to initialize NWP and climate models, and to support diverse applications dealing with water resource, land, and environmental management.

TI  - Shrinking thermokarst lakes and ponds on the northeastern Qinghai-Tibet plateau over the past three decades
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the changes in thermokarst lake dynamics has a significant contribution to landscape-scale hydrology, ecology, and assessment of carbon budgets in permafrost regions. Changes in the number and areal extent of thermokarst lakes and ponds were quantified in a representative permafrost area (150 km(2)) in the south-central Headwater Area of the Yellow River (HAYR). Water-body inventories were generated from Landsat satellite imageries using the supervised Maximum Likelihood Classification method for three periods: 1986, 2000, and 2015. From 1986 to 2015, the number of water bodies larger than 0.36 ha decreased by 40% (461-277), while the total surface area decreased by 25% (542-406 ha). The ponds category (smaller than 1 ha) recorded the most substantial change, as their number decreased by 44% and their water-surface area by 41%. Many lakes disintegrated, partially drained, and formed several remnant ponds, while the majority of the ponds did not drain completely, but shrank below 0.36 ha. These shrinking patterns are consistent with the warming climate in the HAYR, which suggests intense permafrost degradation. Future research will be focused on a better understanding of water-heat dynamics of thermokarst lakes and ponds in association with permafrost degradation at a landscape scale.

TI  - Evaluation of snow extent time series derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer global area coverage data (1982-2018) in the Hindu Kush Himalayas
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term monitoring of snow cover is crucial for climatic and hydrological studies. The utility of long-term snow-cover products lies in their ability to record the real states of the earth's surface. Although a long-term, consistent snow product derived from the ESA CCI+ (Climate Change Initiative) AVHRR GAC (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer global area coverage) dataset dating back to the 1980s has been generated and released, its accuracy and consistency have not been extensively evaluated. Here, we extensively validate the AVHRR GAC snow-cover extent dataset for the mountainous Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region due to its high importance for climate change impact and adaptation studies. The sensor-to-sensor consistency was first investigated using a snow dataset based on long-term in situ stations (1982-2013). Also, this includes a study on the dependence of AVHRR snow-cover accuracy related to snow depth. Furthermore, in order to increase the spatial coverage of validation and explore the influences of land-cover type, elevation, slope, aspect, and topographical variability in the accuracy of AVHRR snow extent, a comparison with Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data was included. Finally, the performance of the AVHRR GAC snow-cover dataset was also compared to the MODIS (MOD10A1 V006) product. Our analysis shows an overall accuracy of 94 % in comparison with in situ station data, which is the same with MOD10A1 V006. Using a +/- 3 d temporal filter caused a slight decrease in accuracy (from 94 % to 92 %). Validation against Land- sat TM data over the area with a wide range of conditions (i.e., elevation, topography, and land cover) indicated overall root mean square errors (RMSEs) of about 13.27 % and 16 % and overall biases of about -5.83 % and -7.13 % for the AVHRR GAC raw and gap-filled snow datasets, respectively. It can be concluded that the here validated AVHRR GAC snow-cover climatology is a highly valuable and powerful dataset to assess environmental changes in the HKH region due to its good quality, unique temporal coverage (1982-2019), and inter-sensor/satellite consistency.

TI  - Droughts across China: Drought factors, prediction and impacts
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a complicated and costly natural hazard and identification of critical drought factors is critical for modeling and forecasting of droughts and hence development of drought mitigation measures (the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index) in both space and time. Here we quantified relationships between drought and 23 drought factors using remote sensing data during the period of 2002-2016. Based on the Gradient Boosting Algorithm (GBM), we found that precipitation and soil moisture had relatively large contributions to droughts. During the growing season, the relative importance of Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI-7) for SPEI3, SPEI6, SPEI9, and SPEI12 reached as high as 50%. However, during the non-growing season, the Snow Cover Fraction (SCF) had larger fractional relative importance for short-term droughts in the Inner Mongolia and the Loess Plateau which can reach as high as 10%. We also compared Extremely Randomized Trees (ERT), H2O based Deep Learning (Model developed by H2O.deep learning in R H2O.DL), and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for drought prediction at various time scales, and found that the ERT model had the highest prediction performance with R-2 > 0.72. Based on the Meta-Gaussian model, we quantified the probability of maize yield reduction in the North China Plain under different compound dry-hot conditions. Due to extreme drought and hot conditions, Shandong Province in North China had the highest probability of >80% of the maize yield reduction; due to the extreme hot conditions, Jiangsu Province in East China had the largest probability of >86% of the maize yield reduction.

M3  - Article
AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic has shaped public policies and government finances, it has also influenced the topics that public finance economists are researching. Because the 2020 International Institute of Public Finance Congress featured papers that were submitted prior to the start of the pandemic, the Congress allows us to reflect on the state of research prior to the pandemic's shock to both fiscal policies and our worldview. In this article, the Editors of International Tax and Public Finance reflect on interesting papers that were presented at this internationally representative conference in public economics. The exercise provides insight on where the field of public economics was heading prior to the pandemic and will provide a yardstick to see how the field evolves in the coming years afterward.

TI  - Terrestrial laser scanning: a new standard of forest measuring and modelling?
T2  - ANNALS OF BOTANY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Laser scanning technology has opened new horizons for the research of forest dynamics, because it provides a largely automated and non-destructive method to rapidly capture the structure of individual trees and entire forest stands at multiple spatial scales. The structural data themselves or in combination with additional remotely sensed data also provide information on the local physiological state of structures within trees. The capacity of new methods is facilitated by the ongoing development of automated processing tools that are designed to capture information from the point cloud data provided by the remote measurements.Scope Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), performed from the ground or from unmanned aerial vehicles, in particular, has potential to become a unifying measurement standard for forest research questions, because the equipment is flexible to use in the field and has the capacity to capture branch-level structural information at the forestplot or even forest scale. This issue of Annals of Botany includes selected papers that exemplify the current and potential uses of TLS, such as for examination of crown interactions between trees, growth dynamics of mixed stands, non-destructive characterization of urban trees, and enhancement of ecological and evolutionary models. The papers also present current challenges in the applicability of TLS methods and report recent developments in methods facilitating the use of TLS data for research purposes, including automatic processing chains and quantifying branch and above-ground biomass. In this article, we provide an overview of the current and anticipated future capacity of TLS and related methods in solving questions that utilize measurements and models of forests.Conclusions Due to its measurement speed, TLS provides a method to effortlessly capture large amounts of detailed structural forest information, and consequent proxy data for tree and forest processes, at a far wider spatial scale than is feasible with manual measurements. Issues with measurement precision and occlusion of laser beams before they reach their target structures continue to reduce the accuracy of TLS data, but the limitations are counterweighted by the measurement speed that enables large sample sizes. The currently high time-cost of analysing TLS data, in turn, is likely to decrease through progress in automated processing methods. The developments point towards TLS becoming a new and widely accessible standard tool in forest measurement and modelling.

TI  - Breast adenoid cystic carcinoma arising in microglandular adenosis: A case report and review of literature
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF CLINICAL CASES
M3  - Review
AB  - BACKGROUNDBreast adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC) is a rare invasive carcinoma composed of epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Microglandular adenosis (MGA) is a rare benign proliferative lesion consisting of small, uniform, and round glands formed by a single layer of epithelial cells and basement membrane without a myoepithelial cell layer. MGA may progress to atypical MGA and carcinoma arising in MGA. Among various invasive carcinomas from MGA, AdCC has been rarely reported. Here, we report a case of AdCC arising in MGA.CASE SUMMARYA 59-year-old woman was diagnosed with a newly developed density on a routine mammogram. The density was similar to or slightly lower than that of the breast parenchyma. Sonography showed an irregular mass with a slightly higher echo than that of fat. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an irregular mass with a similar T1 signal intensity and a slightly higher T2 signal intensity compared to muscles or the breast parenchyma. The lesion showed heterogeneous internal enhancement with an initially slow and delayed persistent enhancing pattern. Microscopically, the tumor was composed of invasive AdCC, in situ AdCC, and MGA. AdCC is composed of basaloid and ductal epithelial cells forming cribriform or solid sheets, or haphazardly scattered small cribriform or tubular glands. MGA showed small glands with a single epithelial lining and retained lumen. S-100 staining was strongly positive in MGA area. The patient underwent breast-conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy.CONCLUSIONBreast AdCC arising in MGA showed unique imaging findings that was different from usual invasive cancer.

TI  - Machine learning based soil maps for a wide range of soil properties for the forested area of Switzerland
T2  - GEODERMA REGIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial soil information in forests is crucial to assess ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water purification or biodiversity. However, spatially continuous information on soil properties at adequate resolution is rare in forested areas, especially in mountain regions. Therefore, we aimed to build high-resolution soil property maps for pH, soil organic carbon, clay, sand, gravel and soil density for six depth intervals as well as for soil thickness for the entire forested area of Switzerland. We used legacy data from 2071 soil profiles and evaluated six different modelling approaches of digital soil mapping, namely lasso, robust external-drift kriging, geoadditive modelling, quantile regression forest (QRF), cubist and support vector machines. Moreover, we combined the predictions of the individual models by applying a weighted model averaging approach. All models were built from a large set of potential covariates which included e.g. multi-scale terrain attributes and remote sensing data characterizing vegetation cover.Model performances, evaluated against an independent dataset were similar for all methods. However, QRF achieved the best prediction performance in most cases (18 out of 37 models), while model averaging outperformed the individual models in five cases. For the final soil property maps we therefore used the QRF predictions. Prediction performance showed large differences for the individual soil properties. While for fine earth density the R-2 of QRF varied between 0.51 and 0.64 across all depth intervals, soil organic carbon content was more difficult to predict (R-2 = 0.19-0.32). Since QRF was used for map prediction, we assessed the 90% prediction intervals from which we derived uncertainty maps. The latter are valuable to better interpret the predictions and provide guidance for future mapping campaigns to improve the soil maps.

TI  - Eurasian otter (<i>Lutra lutra</i>) as sentinel species for the long-term biomonitoring of the Guadiamar River after the Aznalcollar mine spill
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accidents at mines involving stored tailings have produced catastrophic environmental damage. In April 1998 the dam of the Aznalcollar mine tailings pond in the surroundings of the Doriana National Park (southwestern Spain) broke, discharging into the Guadiamar River more than 6 million m(3) of toxic mud and acidic water with high concentrations of heavy metals and arsenic. We used the Eurasian otter (Ultra lutra) as sentinel species to assess the potential impact of the toxic spill on the river ecosystems and their recovery with time by studying the spatial and temporal variation (1999-2003, 2006) of selected trace element (Cu, Zn. Cd, Pb and As) concentrations in feces. Throughout the sampling period, the highest heavy metal and As levels were found in the most spill-affected reaches of the Guadiamar River (i.e., the Middle and, to a lesser extent, the Lower reaches), pointing out the mining accident as the main origin of the contamination. Overall, levels of trace elements decreased with the time elapsed since the toxic spill, except for Cd (F-1,F-352 = 0.29, P = 0.59). However, rebounds for some elements (Pb, As, and Cu) were also observed, especially in the Middle and Lower reaches of the river, which might be attributed to the residual contamination in abiotic compartments andior new inputs from industrial and agricultural activities in the nearby areas. Concentrations were relatively high when compared to those reported for both our reference area (Guadalete River) and other metal-polluted zones. We found that the estimated amounts of Pb and As ingested during the first years after the spill in the Guadiamar Middle reach would be high enough to cause reproductive issues. This could affect the local population recovery, although evidence on distribution range and numbers suggests otherwise, with thriving populations at regional scale. Our results support the role of otters as sentinel species for biomonitoring contaminants and thus to evaluate fluvial ecosystem health. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Shoreline Changes Analysis and Forecast Using Digital Shoreline Assessment System 5.0: Evidences from Parts of East Coast of India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline change analysis is examined for around 140 km coastal belt between Paradip port in the southern and Dhamra port in the northeastern parts of Odisha using DSAS 5.0. The study area is reported of being through the severe landward movement of the sea. To examine this, multispectral satellite images obtained from 1973 to 2020 are taken into account. The vector data generated are fed into the DSAS application to figure out the rate of changes in the position of the shoreline. DSAS suggested statistical methods, i.e. Shoreline Change Envelope, Net Shoreline Movement, End Point Rate, Linear Regression Rate, and Weighted Linear Regression, are used for calculating the rate of change in shoreline positions. Also with the help of "beta forecasting", the future shoreline positions for the period between the years 2030 and 2040 are forecasted. The mean change rate, average seaward gain, and average landward gain are found to be 1.236, 10.10, and 12.42 m/year, respectively. The highest seaward movement is measured as 1843.06 m and the highest landward movement is at 1547.5 m in the study area. The shoreline position is shifted up in an average of 286.03 m in 2/3rd (67.3%) cases of transects, where the maximum shift is 1843.06 m and the minimum being 11.58 m. The beta forecasting result is validated by collating satellite image Landsat 8 (acquired on 25.12.2020) and forecasted shoreline 2020. The results indicated that the shoreline has shifted up to 2 km from 1971 to 2019 atleast 2/3rd positions. This is such a serious concern and alerts with a strong warning of rapid shoreline changes. It further emphasizes the need for conservation and management of this coastal belt to protect coastal biodiversity.

TI  - Convergent correlationism: analyzing teacher educators' reflection on professional practice
T2  - REFLECTIVE PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper uses an original analysis of epistemological presuppositions to develop conclusions about reflective practice in a higher education context. Drawing on interview data and philosopher Quentin Meillassoux's recent work on philosophical presuppositions, I discuss convergence in teachers' 'correlationist' presuppositions about the nature of knowledge and practice. These epistemological presuppositions, which converge around a subjectivist worldview, underpin reflections about pedagogy and can hinder understanding of the limitations and affordances of reflection itself. This analysis leads to three conclusions: first, forms of reflection on practice which seem diverse may converge on essentially similar reflective presuppositions; second, apparent incompatibility between individual examples of reflection about pedagogies can hinder practice where teachers and students fail to perceive this underlying similarity; and third, a scale of comparison (Meillassoux's spectrum) can enhance inclusiveness by identifying where correlationism limits or even forecloses teachers' reflection-on-action.

TI  - Finer-scale spatiotemporal coupling coordination model between socioeconomic activity and eco-environment: A case study of Beijing, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization demands finer coordinated development of the urban human-earth relationship with high quality. Although a large number of studies have explored the long-term and large-scale coupling effect of urbanization and eco-environment, there is a lack of finer spatiotemporal method and assessment. Therefore, this paper proposes a monthly-scale pixel-based coupling coordination degree (CCD) model, aiming to explore the relationship between urban socioeconomic activity intensity (SAI) and regional eco-environment (REE) in Beijing during the period of January 2018 to May 2020 based on nighttime light data and MODIS images. The results show that the SAI in Beijing has shown a trend of increasing, and the overall REE was relatively stable during the investigated period. The CCD between SAI and REE in Beijing has been improving both spatially and quantitatively. Until May 2020, more than 50% of the human activity areas were in a state of high-level coordinated, and the mean CCD reached a basic-coordinated level. A schematic model is further built to explain the characteristics and process of coupling coordinated interactions between socioeconomic activity and ecoenvironment. The inner-annual micro-scale analysis and assessment provide theoretical support for fine-scale monitoring and high-quality urban development planning and policies from decision-makers.

TI  - Entomological characterization of <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes and arbovirus detection in Ibague, a Colombian city with co-circulation of Zika, dengue and chikungunya viruses
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Dengue, Zika and chikungunya are arboviruses of significant public health importance that are transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. In Colombia, where dengue is hyperendemic, and where chikungunya and Zika were introduced in the last decade, more than half of the population lives in areas at risk. The objective of this study was to characterize Aedes spp. vectors and study their natural infection with dengue, Zika and chikungunya in Ibague, a Colombian city and capital of the department of Tolima, with case reports of simultaneous circulation of these three arboviruses.Methods: Mosquito collections were carried out monthly between June 2018 and May 2019 in neighborhoods with different levels of socioeconomic status. We used the non-parametric Friedman, Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests to compare mosquito density distributions. We applied logistic regression analyses to identify associations between mosquito density and absence/presence of breeding sites, and the Spearman correlation coefficient to analyze the possible relationship between climatic variables and mosquito density.Results: We collected Ae. aegypti in all sampled neighborhoods and found for the first time Ae. albopictus in the city of Ibague. A greater abundance of mosquitoes was collected in neighborhoods displaying low compared to high socioeconomic status as well as in the intradomicile compared to the peridomestic space. Female mosquitoes predominated over males, and most of the test females had fed on human blood. In total, four Ae. aegypti pools (3%) were positive for dengue virus (serotype 1) and one pool for chikungunya virus (0.8%). Interestingly, infected females were only collected in neighborhoods of low socioeconomic status, and mostly in the intradomicile space.Conclusions: We confirmed the co-circulation of dengue (serotype 1) and chikungunya viruses in the Ae. aegypti population in Ibague. However, Zika virus was not detected in any mosquito sample, 3 years after its introduction into the country. The positivity for dengue and chikungunya viruses, predominance of mosquitoes in the intradomicile space and the high proportion of females fed on humans highlight the high risk for arbovirus transmission in Ibague, but may also provide an opportunity for establishing effective control strategies.

T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) are a public health problem, especially for reproductive-age women. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and trend of STIs during 11 years in Tunisia (2007-17). Methods We conducted a descriptive study including all women with curable STIs (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis and trichomoniasis) diagnosed with the syndromic approach in all basic health care centers of the Governorate of Monastir (Tunisia) from 2007 to 2017. Syndromes included, Pelvic Pain (PP), Vaginal Discharge (VD) and Genital Ulceration (GU). Results We analyzed 40,388 episodes of curable STIs with a crude incidence rate and age standardized incidence rate of 1393 (95% Confidence Interval (CI); 1348-1438) / 100,000 Person Year (PY) and 1328 (95%CI; 1284-1372) /100,000 PY respectively. The incidence rate showed a positive trend over 11 years for all age groups and syndromes. VD was the most common syndrome with a crude incidence rate of 1170/100,000 PY. For all syndromes, women aged 20 to 39 were the most affected age group (p < 0.001). Conclusion In conclusion, the incidence rate of STIs episodes among women diagnosed with the syndromic approach was high, consistent with the global evidence. Focusing on reviewing STIs surveillance system in low and middle-income countries could allow the achievement of the ending of STIs epidemics by 2030.

TI  - Urban tree species classification using UAV-based multi-sensor data fusion and machine learning
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban tree species classification is a challenging task due to spectral and spatial diversity within an urban environment. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms and small-sensor technology are rapidly evolving, presenting the opportunity for a comprehensive multi-sensor remote sensing approach for urban tree classification. The objectives of this paper were to develop a multi-sensor data fusion technique for urban tree species classification with limited training samples. To that end, UAV-based multispectral, hyperspectral, LiDAR, and thermal infrared imagery was collected over an urban study area to test the classification of 96 individual trees from seven species using a data fusion approach. Two supervised machine learning classifiers, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM), were investigated for their capacity to incorporate highly dimensional and diverse datasets from multiple sensors. When using hyperspectral-derived spectral features with RF, the fusion of all features extracted from all sensor types (spectral, LiDAR, thermal) achieved the highest overall classification accuracy (OA) of 83.3% and kappa of 0.80. Despite multispectral reflectance bands alone producing significantly lower OA of 55.2% compared to 70.2% with minimum noise fraction (MNF) transformed hyperspectral reflectance bands, the full dataset combination (spectral, LiDAR, thermal) with multispectral-derived spectral features achieved an OA of 81.3% and kappa of 0.77 using RF. Comparison of the features extracted from individual sensors for each species highlight the ability for each sensor to identify distinguishable characteristics between species to aid classification. The results demonstrate the potential for a high-resolution multi-sensor data fusion approach for classifying individual trees by species in a complex urban environment under limited sampling requirements.

M3  - Article
AB  - CMs arising on the head and neck regions are a common health problem. Most CMs are highly preventable through sun protection behaviors. Most KCs are easily cured with surgical excision. High-risk BCC and CSCC may recur or cause local destruction, but rarely metastasize. MEL and MCC have a high propensity to metastasize early on through the skin (in-transits), to lymph nodes, and/or distant organs, resulting in high mortality. In the head and neck area, anatomic and cosmetic factors make wide surgical margins impractical and a multidisciplinary management is important to tailor medical decision-making for each individual. ICI therapy is being used increasingly for metastatic CMs, and it is approved for adjuvant use in MEL (Table 1). The role of ICI and other systemic immunotherapies is likely to expand in the management of advanced CMs in the years to come.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology and clinical risk factors for rifaximin-non-susceptible<i> Clostridioides</i><i> difficile</i> infection in South Korea: a prospective, multicentre, observational study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of Clostridioides difficile isolates in South Korea and to evaluate risk factors for rifaximin-non-susceptible C. difficile infection (CDI). Methods: A total of 413 patients with CDI from two sentinel hospitals in South Korea were enrolled in this study. Putative clinical risk factors for CDI were identified using digital medical records of the patients. Pathogen profiles, including antimicrobial susceptibility, toxin production and ribotype, were evaluated for each of the causative C. difficile isolates. Results: Of the 413 C. difficile isolates, 81 (19.6%) were shown to be rifaximin-non-susceptible, with the most common ribotypes being 018 (56.8%; 46/81), 017 (16.0%; 13/81) and 027 (6.2%; 5/81). Rifaximinnon-susceptible C. difficile isolates exhibited higher non-susceptibility rates to most of the other drugs tested in this study compared with rifaximin-susceptible isolates. Previous history of pulmonary tuberculosis and prior rifaximin treatment were shown to be associated with the occurrence of rifaximin-nonsusceptible CDI compared with susceptible CDI. Conclusion: Non-susceptibility rates to rifaximin for the C. difficile isolates identified in this study were reasonably high with most of the resistant strains belonging to either ribotype 018 or 017. Widespread dissemination of these clones may be the result of antimicrobial selection pressure introduced by the widespread use of rifaximin. These results suggest that a sustainable surveillance programme for CDI and C. difficile resistance is needed in order to better control CDIs and to improve therapeutic efficacy.

TI  - Derivation of spatially detailed lentic habitat map and inventory at a basin scale by integrating multispectral Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and USGS Digital Elevation Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquatic habitats are essential for aquaculture, agriculture, and municipal water supply. The geographical location and quantitative information about the aquatic habitats are critical for inventorying, monitoring, and managing these valuable resources. This paper presents a novel method that integrates the object-oriented image analysis and DEM-based stream network analysis to map and quantify lentic aquatic habitats, using freely available ESA Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and USGS DEMs. This integrated method has been applied to the entire Mobile River Basin, USA, and lentic habitats at the basin scale have been delineated and inventoried at the 10-m spatial resolution. The surface water pixels of aquatic habitats are extracted through the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) unsupervised classification of the Sentinel-2 multispectral images. An object-oriented image analysis approach is then used to group contiguous water pixels to form and map discrete aquatic habitat objects. The stream network in the basin has been hydrologically derived from the USGS DEMs at the 10-m spatial resolution. The combination of the geometric and shape information from the objectoriented image analysis and hydrological information from the DEM-based stream network analysis enables the separation of lotic and lentic habitats. A set of planimetric, geometric, and shape attributes has been numerically derived for each lentic habitat object. The abundance pattern, shape pattern, and spatial distribution pattern of the lentic habitats in the basin have been analyzed. The vast majority of the aquatic habitat objects identified in the Mobile River Basin are lentic habitats. The most striking spatial pattern of lentic habitats is that small, oblong lakes and fish ponds are densely distributed along the Black Prairie Belt in the basin, laying the foundation for the catfish aquacultural industry in the regions of mid-west Alabama and east Mississippi. This research demonstrates that the integration of the recently emerged Sentinel-2A/B satellite multispectral imagery with USGS DEMs represents an effective approach to the inventory and environmental investigation of lentic habitats at a basin scale.

TI  - Satellite products performance based on in-situ data to evaluate SST variability in a subtropical inner shelf in Brazil
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares in-situ, satellite (MODIS Terra and Aqua daytime and nighttime), and reanalysis (Operational Sea Surface Temperature and Sea Ice Analysis - OSTIA) sea surface temperature (SST) data of the inner shelf of Paran'a - Brazil at daily scales. There are match-up pairs for all products covering the whole range of in situ SST (19 degrees C-30 degrees C) and every month, consisting of an appropriate method to validate our satellite datasets in the study area. Although there is a good statistical agreement between MODIS retrievals and in-situ SST, cloud coverage over the study area results in a large number of gaps along with the time series. Thus, dominant features of the SST variability patterns were characterized based on 35 years (1985-2018) of OSTIA SST. There is a strong influence of the Brazil Coastal Current during late winter months contrasting with warmer waters from the Brazil Current during summer. Local high-frequency forcing dominates SST variability, mostly high-energy meteorological events, which act like pulses that intensify mixing processes, resulting in a stair-like variability pattern. At adequate temporal and spatial scales, the relatively cost-effective, spatially explicit, frequent, and continuous remote sensing data can provide the necessary information to support the reliance of our civilization on the ocean. As the SST regime in coastal waters differs from the open waters, the results presented here are unique. They can provide references to understanding the dominant scales of complex coastal dynamics, a key to predict impacts, draw scenarios and mitigate risks, supporting the sustainability of marine and coastal ecosystem services.

TI  - Complex relationships between surface topography, ground motion, and cover sediments in covered karst, west-central Florida, USA
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Sinkhole processes can be more complicated than vertical drainage or collapse of sediments into an underlying limestone void. To better understand the relationships between surface and underlying karst structures, geodetic and geophysical methods were applied to high-resolution mapping of active sinkhole features in covered karst, west-central Florida, USA. Cracks in a pool house at the Sandhill Scout Reservation prompted surface and subsurface investigations in a grassy open field with a distinct-60-m diameter topographic low west of the pool area. Beneath the smooth topographic low, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) with limited penetration (up to 6 m depth) shows incongruent smaller-scale (-5-20 m) variability in a horizon draping the limestone surface. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) profiles provide a broader overview of the underlying karst system (to depths-25-36 m) and show possible voids in the limestone bedrock beneath a local topographic high. Persistent Scatterer Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSInSAR) analysis of-2 yr of TerraSAR-X satellite data from two corner-reflectors installed in the topographic low reveals a 1 mm/yr subsidence rate on the flank of the topographic low but stability in its center. This suggests that subsidence has halted in the central topographic low and may be occurring on smaller scales elsewhere within the survey area. The data suggest that non-vertical fluxes of sediment significantly smooth surface topography relative to underlying heterogeneities and that activity migrates within complex systems. Our results also illustrate the benefits of corner reflector installations for resolving subsidence in vegetated environments. The 1-mm/yr rate of motion on the grassy field could not be resolved with InSAR before reflector installation. 0 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Aboveground Biomass Estimation in the Broadleaved Hyrcanian Forest of Iran
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, the capability of Landsat-8 (L8), Sentinel-2 (S2), Sentinel-1 (S1), and their combination was investigated for estimating aboveground biomass (AGB). A pure stand of Fagus Orientalis located in the Hyrcanian forest of Iran was selected as the study area. The performance of a parametric approach, i.e., Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model and non-parametric approaches, i.e., k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR), were also evaluated for AGB estimations. Our results indicated that among S2 metrics, the FAPAR canopy biophysical index and NDVI index based on the red-edge band (NIR-b8a) have the highest correlation coefficient (r) of 0.420 and 0.417, respectively. The results of AGB estimation showed that a combination of S2 and S1 datasets using the k-NN algorithm had the best accuracy (R-2 of 0.57 and rRMSE of 14.68%). The best rRMSE using L8, S2, and S1 datasets was 18.95, 16.99, and 19.17% using k-NN, k-NN, and MLR algorithms, respectively. The combination of L8 with S1 dataset also improved the rRMSE relative to L8 and S1 separately by 0.96 and 1.18%, respectively. We concluded that the combination of optical data (L8 or S2) with SAR data (S1) improves the broadleaved Hyrcanian AGB estimation.

TI  - Measuring the state and temporal evolution of glaciers in Alaska and Yukon using synthetic-aperture-radar-derived (SAR-derived) 3D time series of glacier surface flow
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has reduced global ice mass over the last 2 decades as enhanced warming has accelerated surface melt and runoff rates. Glaciers have undergone dynamic processes in response to a warming climate that impacts the surface geometry and mass distribution of glacial ice. Until recently no single technique could consistently measure the evolution of surface flow for an entire glaciated region in three dimensions with high temporal and spatial resolution. We have improved upon earlier methods by developing a technique for mapping, in unprecedented detail, the temporal evolution of glaciers. Our software computes north, east, and vertical flow velocity and/or displacement time series from the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ascending and descending range and azimuth speckle offsets. The software can handle large volumes of satellite data and is designed to work on high-performance computers (HPCs) as well as workstations by utilizing multiple parallelization methods. We then compute flow velocity-displacement time series for glaciers in southeastern Alaska during 2016-2021 and observe seasonal and interannual variations in flow velocities at Seward and Malaspina glaciers as well as culminating phases of surging at Klutlan, Walsh, and Kluane glaciers. On a broader scale, this technique can be used for reconstructing the response of worldwide glaciers to the warming climate using archived SAR data and for near-real-time monitoring of these glaciers using rapid revisit SAR data from satellites, such as Sentinel1 (6 or 12 d revisit period) and the forthcoming NISAR mission (12 d revisit period).

T2  - SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring land use and land cover (LULC) changes in protected areas (PAs) is critical for effective environmental management and sustainability. PAs are ecological regions which play a critical role in preserving natural, ecological, economic, and even cultural values of specific areas. This study monitored LULC changes in two PAs within Tehran province in Iran, namely Jajrud and Tangeh Vashi, using Landsat imagery for the years 1989-2019 and simulated a future LULC map for 2050 using the Markov chain-cellular automata model. The simulated map indicated that built-up areas will have the top increasing trend in Jajrud by 2050; however, high-density pasture will decrease because of the heavy dependency and immediate vicinity of Jajrud to Tehran, the largest city and the capital of Iran. In Tangeh Vashi, bare land expansion will have the top increasing trend, whereas the volume of high-density pasture will have the top decreasing trend. According to the results, the LULC changes in Jajrud and Tangeh Vashi are already greater than management plan standards and have led to the destruction of valuable biological habitats. Without proper planning and managerial strategies, the continuation of such changes will further destroy ecosystems and cause species extinction and unsustainability in the studied PAs.

TI  - Recent Advances and Concepts in SLNB (Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy) and Management of SLNB Positive Axilla in Carcinoma Breast
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Breast cancer is one of the three most common cancers occurring worldwide. In 2018, one in four newly detected cancer in women was breast cancer in India. Breast cancer treatment approaches have changed from "maximum tolerable" to "minimum effective" with the same cure rates and cosmesis but better quality of life (QoL). However, the management of the axilla has been a debatable topic since many decades. For the proper management of breast cancer, it is essential to differentiate clinically node-positive or clinically node-negative patients but having a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN). Axillary staging is one of the most important prognostic variables in breast cancer treatment. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) may spare many patients the need for axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) as well as the morbidities associated with ALND. In this review, we have discussed the observations from various trials and guidelines recommendations on the need or omission of ALND in patients with breast cancer undergoing SLNB. The various tracer used for identification of SLN and the best combination available for staging the axilla with high accuracy and low risk of false negativity has been assessed. The timing and accuracy of SLNB in patients who are receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) for breast cancer have also been discussed. The impact of ALND on locoregional recurrence (LR), overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) outcomes in SLNs positive patients has been evaluated. We have proposed a treatment algorithm to follow, in addition to the local/regional guideline recommendations, before planning the treatment strategy for breast cancer patients.

T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In our writing, we voice stories of two Australian rivers to convey Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Interweaving academic literature, nature writing and creativity, we craft a story of reconnection that is transformative, action-oriented and potentially political. An open mind, place-intuition and the process of attending can deepen our river relationships, creating a sense of love and communicative connectedness. Paying deep attention, we notice meanings embedded in plain sight, within hearing range of rivers and watery places. Our relationships may be "in our faces" such as the wind, or the air, water or bushes nearby. We communicate across binaries to experience the dissolution of imagined barriers. Feeling, hearing, writing and storytelling can support verbalising of experience, helping to bring to mind place-wisdom. It offers an everyday possibility for people now estranged from their riverine kin. The process uses a post-human-centred, common worlds frame to consider the Anthropocene in regenerative ways. It is creative and liberating, and rivers are dying for people to take action by speaking out for and with our greater selves. In this learning journey, we synthesise learnings, hoping to inspire people everywhere to hear the call of rivers, to respond, take action and learn to love their rivers again.

TI  - Remote sensing-based changes in the Ukhia Forest, Bangladesh
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover and its dynamic nature study are mandatory for the environmental, socio-economic as well as political actions. In the context of Bangladesh, the significance of forest-related research has been created new attention for the recent large amount of woodland degradation in the protected forest zone of Ukhia, Cox's Bazar. This study illustrates a document to interpret multi-temporal Landsat 8 OLI, Sentinel 2A, and 2B imageries for detecting the dynamic changes of forest cover of Ukhia using spectral signatures by image analysis and GIS approaches. These data have been collected from the USGS earth explorer site for the years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 respectively, and quantified the changes over 5 years. Image fusion technique i.e., NNDiffuse was applied based on the 15 m panchromatic bands of the same sensor to enhance the spatial resolution of Landsat 8. After that, the processed images were subject to supervised classification in ERDAS IMAGINE 2016 using the maximum likelihood technique to detect the forest cover change. By image interpretation, the land use and land covers of the study area were classified into four major classes i.e., Forest, Non-Forest, degraded land, and water bodies. The post-classification forest cover changes maps from 2014 to 2018 have been illustrated a distinguished decline of a large portion of about 82% of the forest in Ukhia. The total net loss of forest land has been calculated as 6.6 sq. miles over 5 years. The accuracy assessment also reported high classification accuracies of 84.00%, 83.81%, 88.99%, 93.20% and 91.00% with overall kappa statistics of 0.69, 0.67, 0.80, 0.85, and 0.85 respectively. Through the assessment of classified image and field data, it has been observed that these forest lands are destroyed for making shelters, roads, creating water sources, camp offices, schools, and other infrastructures for Rohingya refugees in Ukhia that is mapped as deforested land almost 8.02 sq. miles. This research aimed to assess the forest cover dynamics as well as provide an insight into land-use patterns, thus screening the hotspots of forest degradation in Ukhia, Bangladesh.

TI  - Defining speckle-based spectral metric from a linear array detector for characterizing the laser focusing spot
T2  - OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Speckle modulation in the laser beam projection scenarios such as adaptive optics, remote sensing, and active imaging has been a long-standing challenge that causes intensity fluctuation and further degrades the performance of the system. Speckle statistical characteristics coupled with the feature of the laser beam intensity distribution can be obtained by analyzing the speckle variation through a single point detector or an image sensor. A single point detector has the advantage in high sampling rate but may lose speckle spatial information, while the image sensor has a high spatial resolution but slow sampling rate. In this paper, we defined a dynamic speckle metric based on a linear array detector to estimate the encircled energy of the far field spot on the diffuse target, which well balanced the trade-off between sampling rate and spatial resolution. The potential of the metric is analyzed using a physics-based speckle simulation and experimental verification. Both results agree with each other, showing that the metrics based on the speckle-field spatiotemporal spectrum analysis are monotonically dependent on the target focused-spot size.

TI  - Study on direction dependence of the fully polarimetric wind-induced ocean emissivity at L-band using a semi-theoretical approach for Aquarius and SMAP observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The wind direction dependence of the fully polarimetric ocean emissivity at L-band is studied using a semitheoretical approach. The model, which is tuned and validated against Aquarius and Soil Moisture ActivePassive (SMAP) mission observations, incorporates the two-scale polarimetric ocean emission model, an improved directional wave spectrum, the Anguelova and Gaiser, 2013 (AG13) foam emissivity model and a novel foam coverage model. Wind speeds up to 35 m/s are considered. Comparisons of model simulations to satellite data show that the overall accuracy of model could reach 0.2 K, which is slightly worse than the Aquarius geophysical mode function (GMF) error of about 0.14 K. The negative and positive upwind-crosswind asymmetries of L-band ocean emission and the transition of the phase signatures versus wind speed are well reproduced for all polarizations by the proposed model. The average standard deviations of the differences of polarimetric brightness temperature (TB) between observations and model are less than about 0.16 K for wind speeds up to 15 m/s. Simulations also indicate the anisotropy of L-band ocean emissivities for V- and H- pol would be saturated at high wind speeds. The directional signals at the third Stokes component begin to converge at around the wind speed of 24 m/s. The L-band TB variations due to wind direction for the third Stokes parameter show less sensitivity to wind speed at larger observation angles, while the direction-induced TB variations for the fourth Stokes are more sensitive to wind speed with the increase of observation angle.

TI  - Estimates of the sensible heat of rainfall in the tropics from reanalysis and observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation cools the surface because the temperature of raindrops is typically lower than the temperature of the surface. This precipitation-induced sensible heat flux (Q(P)) due to the temperature difference between the surface and raindrops is thought to be small and is typically ignored in weather and climate models. However, there are many instances in which instantaneous values in Q(P) can be large, especially in extreme rainfall events. In this study, we provide a systematic estimate of Q(P) over the tropics based on in-situ buoy observations, satellite data, and reanalysis. The results show that the highest climatological Q(P) values (similar to 2 to 3 W m(-2)) are found over the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ), both associated with higher amount of precipitation. The Q(P) over land, however, is not well correlated with precipitation due to a more complex relationship between the raindrops temperature and surface temperature. Estimation of Q(P) based on in-situ buoy observations shows that Q(P) can be large at shorter time scales, and can be higher than surface sensible heat flux due to air-sea temperature difference (Q(SH)), and even surface latent heat flux (Q(LH)), for heavy precipitating events. Implications of these results and possible future research avenues related to Q(P) are discussed.

TI  - Evaluation of classification algorithms for land use land cover mapping in the snow-fed Alaknanda River Basin of the Northwest Himalayan Region
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps are crucial for assessing the status of environmental and natural resources management in any river basin or watershed. LULC is a cross-cutting environmental variable that also finds significant applications in hydrological modeling, watershed management, natural disaster management, climate change studies, and land management. This research study uses three different classification algorithms to investigate the LULC status of the Alaknanda river basin of the northwest Himalayan region in India. The entire area was classified into nine LULC classes using Landsat 8 satellite imagery, initially employing the Maximum Likelihood algorithm. This generated a reasonably good overall accuracy with a high Kappa coefficient of 0.79. However, the producer's accuracies for a few significant classes were not satisfactory. This research attempts to explain the anomaly in the producer's accuracy and improve them using machine learning-based classification algorithms. Furthermore, machine learning-based classification algorithms, namely Random Trees (RT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were employed. Both the algorithms generated good overall accuracy with high Kappa values of 0.83 and 0.82, respectively. Interestingly, the qualitative and quantitative comparisons for the classification results revealed that both RT and SVM algorithms resulted in improved and high producer's accuracies. Therefore, this study infers that for mountainous watersheds with high variations in elevation and steep topography, machine learning-based classification algorithms perform better than the conventional statistical classification algorithm.

TI  - On the land emissivity assumption and Landsat-derived surface urban heat islands: A global analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The prescription of surface emissivity (epsilon) strongly controls satellite-derived estimates of land surface temperature (LST). This is particularly important for studying surface urban heat islands (SUHI) since built-up and natural landscapes are known to have distinct epsilon values. Given the small signal associated with the SUHI compared to LST, accurately prescribing urban and rural epsilon would improve our satellite-derived SUHI estimates. Here we test the sensitivity of SUHI to the epsilon assumption made while deriving LST from Landsat measurements for almost 10,000 global urban clusters for summer and winter days. We find that adjusting the epsilon values from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) dataset based on pixel-level normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) increases the summer to winter contrast in daytime SUHI, a constrast that has been noted in previous studies. Overall, the difference between the two methods of prescribing epsilon, one from ASTER and one after NDVI-adjustment, is moderate; around 10% during summer and around 20% during winter, though this difference varies by climate zone, showing higher deviations in polar and temperate climate. We also combine five different methods of prescribing emissivity to provide the first global estimates of SUHI derived from Landsat. The global ensemble mean SUHI varies between 2.42 degrees C during summer to 0.46 degrees C in winter. Regardless of the surface emissivity model used, compared to Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra observations, Landsat data show higher SUHI daytime intensities during summer (by more than 1.5 degrees C), partly due to its ability to better resolve urban pixels. We also find that the epsilon values prescribed for urban land cover in global and regional weather models are lower than the satellite-derived broadband epsilon values. Computing sensitivities of urban and rural LST to epsilon, we demonstrate that this would lead to overestimation of SUHI by these models (by around 4 degrees C for both summer and winter), all else remaining constant. Our analysis provides a global perspective on the importance of better constraining urban epsilon for comparing satellite-derived and model-simulated SUHI intensities. Since both the structural and geometric heterogeneity of the surface controls the bulk epsilon, future studies should try to benchmark the suitability of existing LST-epsilon separation methods over urban areas.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Using a Single-Dye Technique in a Cancer Center of North-East India
T2  - SOUTH ASIAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) is the first node to receive the drainage directly from a tumor. SLN biopsy can be done in lieu of a formal lymphadenectomy in selected clinically node-negative cancers and minimizes morbidity compared with the latter.Methods This prospective study was done in patients with operable clinically node-negative breast cancer, penile cancer, and malignant melanoma of extremities in a cancer center of North-east India from January 2019 to December 2019. All the patients underwent formal lymph nodal dissection after the SLN biopsy. Besides intraoperative frozen section study of the sentinel node(s), all the specimens, including the sentinel node(s), were subjected to paraffin section histopathology.Results SLN was identified successfully in 96% of patients. Mean number of sentinel node(s) dissected was 2.3. Study of SLN biopsy with methylene blue dye for staging was done with 100% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity. The SLN procedure was able to negatively predict the drainage nodal basin in 100% with an overall accuracy of staging of 96.5%. The true-positive rate noted was 88.8%, and the false-positive rate was 4.6%.Conclusions SLN using a single-dye technique reliably identifies a sentinel node. This procedure can be safely adopted in patients with node-negative cancers as mentioned above to pathologically study the drainage basin.

TI  - On the integration of multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar interferometry products and historical surveys data for buildings structural monitoring
T2  - JOURNAL OF CIVIL STRUCTURAL HEALTH MONITORING
M3  - Article
AB  - The management and the safeguard of existing buildings and infrastructures are actual tasks for structural engineering. Non-invasive structural monitoring techniques can provide useful information for supporting the management process and the safety evaluation, reducing at once the impact of disturbances on the structure's functionality. This paper focuses on the exploitation of advanced multi-temporal differential synthetic aperture radar interferometry (DInSAR) products for the structural monitoring of buildings and infrastructures, subjected to different external actions. In this framework, a methodological approach is proposed, based on the integration of DInSAR measurements with historical sources, accurate 3D modelling and consistent positioning of the reflecting targets in the GIS environment. Documentary sources can prove particularly helpful in collecting technical information, to reconstruct an accurate 3D geometry of the building under monitoring, limiting in-situ surveys. The analysis of DInSAR-based displacements time series and mean deformation velocity values allows the identification of possible critical situations for buildings to be monitored. The paper presents different approaches, with increasing accuracy levels, to study the active deformative processes of the examined buildings and the related damage assessment. An insight into these interpretative approaches is given through the application of the proposed procedure to two case studies in the city of Rome (Italy), the residential building named Torri Stellari in Valco San Paolo (1951-1953) and the housing complex referred to as Corviale (1967-1983), by exploiting the whole COSMO-SkyMed data archive (both ascending and descending acquisitions), collected during the 2011-2019 time interval. Pros and cons of the various approaches are deeply discussed, together with an estimation of the required computational effort.

TI  - A new method for describing the inundation status of floodplain wetland
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The inundation state is one of the main factors affecting the development of river floodplain wetlands, and the water inundate frequency (WIF) is a commonly used characterisation tool. This study combines remote sensing data with ground hydrological observation data to propose the water inundate guarantee rate (WIGR) as a new tool to characterise the inundation probability in river floodplain areas. It further conducts a comparative study between WIGR and WIF in the Yimin River, located in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The results show that the inundation state maps of the study area are generally consistent using WIF and WIGR. However, there are observed differences in specific regions. In regions with very low assurance rates, it covers a larger area of 2.90 km(2) using WIGR relative to WIF. Meanwhile, The area of other low, medium, high and very high areas is relatively lower. The reason for the difference is that the selected 52 phase remote sensing data corresponds to a low flow guarantee rate, which is generally medium and high. Further, the flow guarantee rate introduced in the WIGR analysis process plays a corrective role in the final analysis results. Compared with WIF, the WIGR algorithm is systematic, continuous, and has certain statistical significance, which has higher scientific credibility and accuracy. Specifically, the simple operation of the WIGR algorithm shows great potential to be applied to other related studies. Nevertheless, further improvement of the WIGR algorithm should focus on the influence of the atmospheric environment on remote sensing data and the acquisition of hydrological data. The WIGR proposed in this study can provide technical support for the conservation of river floodplain wetlands and open new ideas for studying river floodplain wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Carbon sequestration and storage value of coffee forest in Southwestern Ethiopia
T2  - CARBON MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The purpose of this research is to determine the amount and value of carbon stock in Southwestern Ethiopia's coffee forest from 1978 to 2050, as well as carbon sequestration from 1988 to 2050. Different time-series satellite data were acquired and classified into land-use categories using ArcGIS and ENVI 5:0, followed by IDRISI forecasts up to 2050, and finally modeling with INVEST. Data were collected within the plot constructed in a systematic random sampling manner using quadrates 20 m X 20 m. The social cost of carbon (US$12/tCO(2)e) used to estimate the monetary worth of the services. Forest conversion anticipated to reduce the carbon stock by 1.86 Mt by the end of 2050, from 65.8 Mt in 1978 to 7.01 Mt in 2018. The rate of Carbon sequestration was 2.1Mt/year at the end of 1998, and it will be reduced to 1.49Mt/year by the end of 2050. Overall, 121.1Mt of CO2 is sequestered over 63 years, but there was also emission from deforestation and service loss (84.4Mt), resulting a net sequestered CO2 of 36.6Mt by the end of 2050. The total elemental carbon stock value in 1978 was $2. 896 billion, this will be reached $2.5billion ($9.175 billion CO(2)e) at the end of 2050. The value of sequestration will be estimated at $1.715 billion, but with a value loss of $1.153 billion, the net sink value from 1988 to 2050 will be $0.6 billion. In general, these findings show that the forest region will have a total storage and sequestration value (CO(2)e) of $9.775 billion by the end of 2050. The carbon worth in this forest area is thus a good indicator of the importance, and thus the value estimate here may well persuade policymakers to revise their forest-related policy and provide site-specific information to preserve this remnant forest.

TI  - Satellite-based phenology products and<i> in</i><i>-situ</i> pollen dynamics: A comparative assessment
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing climate variability and change is impacting pollen exposure dynamics among sensitive populations. However, pollen data that can provide beneficial information to allergy experts and patients alike remains elusive. The lack of high spatial resolution pollen data has resulted in a growing interest in using phenology information that is derived using satellite observations to infer key pollen events including start of pollen season (SPS), timing of peak pollen season (PPS), and length of pollen season (LPS). However, it remains unclear if the agreement between satellite-based phenology information (e.g. start of season: SOS) and the in-situ pollen dynamics vary based on the type of satellite product itself or the processing methods used. To address this, we investigated the relationship between vegetation phenology indicator (SOS) derived from two separate sensor/ satellite observations (MODIS, Landsat), and two different processing methods (double logistic regression (DLM) vs hybrid piecewise logistic regression (HPLM)) with in-situ pollen season dynamics (SPS, PPS, LPS) for three dominant allergenic tree pollen species (birch, oak, and poplar) that dominate the springtime allergy season in North America. Our results showed that irrespective of the data processing method (i.e. DLM vs HPLM), the MODIS-based SOS to be more closely aligned with the in-situ SPS, and PPS while upscaled Landsat based SOS had a better precision. The data products obtained using DLM processing methods tended to perform better than the HPLM based methods. We further showed that MODIS based phenology information along with temperature and latitude can be used to infer in-situ pollen dynamic for tree pollen during spring time. Our findings suggest that satellite-based phenology information may be useful in the development of early warning systems for allergic diseases.

TI  - A comparative study of land development patterns and regional thermal environments (RTEs) in typical urban agglomerations of China and America: A case study of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Boswash
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Currently, most regional thermal environment (RTE) studies in urban agglomerations focus on developing countries, especially China. However, there is still a lack of comparative studies on the RTEs of urban agglomerations between China and other developed countries, such as the United States. This paper used the Beijing-Tianjin Hebei (BTH) agglomeration in China and Boswash (the highly urbanized area extending from Boston to Washington) in the United States as examples to investigate the differences in land development patterns, RTEs and their relationship between the agglomerations of China and America. The results showed that the land development patterns of BTH and Boswash were different, as evidenced by the spatial pattern of land development intensity (LDI) and impervious surface configuration. In terms of the RTE, the sub-high land surface temperature (LST) zones were aggregated in a large and compact patch in central and northern BTH. However, the sub-high zones of the cities in Boswash were relatively separate. Moreover, the land development pattern of Boswash showed a stronger relationship with the RTE than that of BTH did. Global Moran's I between the LDI and LST in Boswash was higher than that in BTH. In addition, the correlation between impervious surface config-uration and LST in Boswash was stronger than that in BTH, and this correlation was more controlled by LDI in Boswash. This study also indicated that BTH should change the land development pattern to prevent the further expansion of aggregated sub-high LST zones and control the proximity of high LST zones in cities in central and southern BTH, however, Boswash should adopt some local heat management approaches (installing cool and green roofs and creating more green space) in the core areas to help reduce the very high temperatures in the already highly developed areas where the largest fraction of people live .

TI  - Monitoring water quality using proximal remote sensing technology
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate, high spatial and temporal resolution water quality monitoring in inland waters is vital for environmental management. However, water quality monitoring in inland waters by satellite remote sensing remains challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and instrumental resolution limitations. We propose the concept of proximal remote sensing for monitoring water quality. The proximal hyperspectral imager, developed by Nanjing Institute of Geography and Limnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Hikvision Digital Technology, Ltd., is a high spatial, temporal and spectral resolution (1 nm) sensor for continuous observation, allowing for effective and practical long-term monitoring of inland water quality. In this study, machine learning and empirical algorithms were developed and validated using in situ total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and spectral reflectance from Lake Taihu (N = 171), the Liangxi River (N = 94) and the Fuchunjiang Reservoir (N = 109) covering different water quality. Our dataset includes a large range for three key water quality parameters of TN from 0.93 to 6.46 mg/L, TP from 0.04 to 0.62 mg/L, and COD from 1.32 to 15.41 mg/L. Overall, the back-propagation (BP) neural network model had an accuracy of over 80% for TN (R-2 = 0.84, RMSE = 0.33 mg/L, and MRE = 11.4%) and over 90% for TP (R-2 = 0.93, RMSE = 0.02 mg/L, and MRE = 12.4%) and COD (R-2 = 0.91, RMSE = 0.66 mg/L, and MRE = 9.3%). Our results show that proximal remote sensing combined with machine learning algorithms has great potential for monitoring water quality in inland waters. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The noise-reduction potential of Radar Vegetation Index for crop management in the Czech Republic
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wheat and rapeseed are significant crops in Czech agriculture and remote sensing has huge potential for their management, given Sentinel-1 can overcome issues of cloudiness and monitor vegetation development via radar backscatter. This study compares radar and optical data characterizing the development of wheat and rapeseed in an agricultural cooperative in the Czech Republic. Radar Vegetation Index (RVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series of the main vegetation seasons between 2015 and 2018 are processed, analysed, and compared with each other. In 2018, the comparison of data with ground measurement by camera was also used. The temporal development of RVI is affected by noise, which is caused by the composition of imagery from different Relative orbits. The separation of imagery according to the Relative orbit used seemed to provide results more comparable to the phenological curve. Simple linear regression between NDVI and RVI illustrated that considering Relative orbit can slightly increase the Coefficient of determination. By selecting a suitable Relative orbit, the coefficient of determination between NDVI and RVI increased from 0.281 to 0.387 in the case of wheat and from 0.233 to 0.316 in the case of rape monitoring. The RVI for rapeseed and the height of canopy correlation was 0.392. The results for RVI presented in this article demonstrated that monitoring wheat and rapeseed development by Sentinel-1 has potential, however more research needs to be conducted in the areas of spatial and temporal noise removal.

TI  - Effect of elective neck dissection versus sentinel lymph node biopsy on shoulder morbidity and health-related quality of life in patients with oral cavity cancer: A longitudinal comparative cohort study
T2  - ORAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To research the difference in shoulder morbidity and health-related quality of life between patients with cT(1-2)N0 oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma that undergo either elective neck dissection (END) or a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) based approach of the neck.Materials and methods: A longitudinal study with measurements before surgery, 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. Shoulder morbidity were determined with measurements of active range of motion of the shoulder and patient-reported outcomes for shoulder morbidity (SDQ, SPADI) and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) (EQ5D, EORTC-QLQ-HN35). Linear mixed model analyses were used to analyze differences over time between patients that had END, SLNB or SLNB followed by complementing neck dissection.Results: We included 69 patients. Thirty-three patients were treated with END. Twenty-seven patients had SLNB without complementing neck dissection (SLNB), and nine were diagnosed lymph node positive followed by completion neck dissection (SLNB + ND). Ipsilateral shoulder abduction (P = .031) and forward flexion (P = .039) were significantly better for the SLNB group at 6 weeks post-intervention compared to the END and SLNB + ND group. No significant differences for shoulder morbidity, or health-related quality of life were found at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months between the three groups.Conclusion: With oncologic equivalence for the END and SLNB as strategies for the cN(0) neck already demonstrated, and the SLNB being more cost-effective, our demonstrated benefit in short-term shoulder function strengthens the choice for the SLNB as a preferred treatment strategy.

TI  - Predictors of subsequent injury for M aori in New Zealand
T2  - INJURY-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE CARE OF THE INJURED
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: This paper identifies predictors of subsequent injury (SI) in a cohort of injured M aori. Inter-ventions to reduce SI among indigenous populations would help overcome the disproportionate burden of subsequent injury experienced, thereby reducing inequities in injury outcomes and the overall burden of injury.Methods: Interview data from the Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study (POIS) were combined with Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC; New Zealand's universal no-fault injury insurer) and hospital discharge datasets. Any injury event resulting in an ACC claim and occurring within 24 months of the injury for which participants were recruited to POIS was considered an SI. This was regardless of whether it was the same type, region or cause as the original injury or not. Predictors of SI were identified using modified Poisson regression.Results: Of 566 participants, 62% (n = 349) experienced >= 1 SI in the 24 months following their sentinel injury. M aori whose sentinel injury was an intracranial injury were more likely to sustain an SI compared to those whose sentinel injury was another type. SI was less likely to occur for participants whose sen-tinel injury was a lower extremity fracture or classified as "Other" (e.g. crush, burn, poisoning). SI were more common among those aged 18-29 years compared to those aged 30-49 years, and less common among those living with family compared to those who were living alone.Conclusions: More research into the circumstances of intracranial injury and SI among M aori is war-ranted. This would help inform the nature of interventions to prevent SI and the points at which these should be implemented. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING

AB  - Soil moisture is an important parameter that directly impacts crop productivity. Microwave signals are highly sensitive to soil dielectric constant and so they are used to derive soil moisture. The potential of entropy and alpha (H/alpha) decomposition for moisture estimations at 0- to 5-cm soil depth was assessed. The H/alpha parameters were extracted from the dual-polarimetric Sentinel-1 dataset. Also, we used the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) texture parameters extracted from Sentinel-1 and tested them for soil moisture retrieval. The generalized regression neural network (GRNN), neural network (NN), and support vector regression (SVR) algorithms were trained and tested for soil moisture estimation. Multiple input features, including Sentinel-1 intensities, GLCM parameters, and H/a parameters, were used for training these algorithms. For NN, three activation functions of rectified linear unit (ReLU), tanh, and sigmoid and for SVR three kernel functions of radial basis function (RBF), polynomial, and linear kernel were tested. The ReLU outperformed the other two activation functions with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.042 m(3) m(-3) and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.72. For the SVR algorithm, the highest accuracies derived from the RBF kernel function with RMSE 0.053 m(3) m(-3) and R-2 of 0.51. Between all the three machine learning algorithms, the GRNN algorithm outperformed the other two algorithms with RMSE of 0.033 m(3) m(3) and R-2 of 0.82. These results demonstrated the high potential of using polarimetric synthetic aperture radar data in combination with the machine learning algorithms for surface soil moisture monitoring.

TI  - Mapping and quantifying land cover dynamics using dense remote sensing time series with the user-friendly pyNITA software
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study of land change within social-ecological systems (SES) is of great interest and increasingly makes use of remote sensing (RS) imagery to scale inferences up through space and time. However, spatial analysis using dense time series of RS data poses technical hurdles for non-expert users. To broaden the community of SES researchers using RS, we present a simple tool for mapping land change at local to regional scales. The Python implementation of the Noise Insensitive Trajectory Algorithm (pyNITA) is accessed through a streamlined graphical user interface and requires minimal user parameterization to generate long-term trends and identify key dates of significant change (i.e., disturbance events) based on time series of Landsat or Sentinel-2 data. In this paper, we introduce the pyNITA software, explain the underlying algorithm, analyze key parameter sensitivities, and summarize methods and results from three SES case studies of land change.

TI  - What's new in the management of endometrial cancer? Update on the new European recommendations for 2021
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The new European guidelines for the management of patients with endometrial cancer were published in early 2021. These recommendations are joint to the three European Learned Societies of Gynecologic Oncology (ESGO), Radiation Therapy and Oncology (ESTRO) and Anatomical Pathology (ESP). On behalf of the French Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SFOG), we wish to bring to the knowledge of the French-speaking readership the main measures for the management of patients which represent an advance compared to the 2016 recommendations. The new European recommendations for the management of patients with endometrial cancer emphasize the generalization of micro-satellite instability (MSI) or immunohistochemical analysis of MMR system proteins for all patients. Also, the classification into 4 prognostic risk groups integrates data from molecular analysis (p53, MSI, POLE) to guide initial surgical management as well as adjuvant treatment modalities. The indocyanine green sentinel node procedure has also become the reference technique for FIGO I and II lymph node staging regardless of histological type. It should be remembered that management should be provided in a specialized institution by a team specialized in the management of gynecological cancers, particularly for high-risk and/or advanced cancer patients.

TI  - A comparative analysis of different pixel and object-based classification algorithms using multi-source high spatial resolution satellite data for LULC mapping
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The preparation of accurate LULC is of great importance as it is used in various studies ranging from change detection to geospatial modelling. Literature offers studies comparing different classification algorithms/approaches to prepare LULC maps. However, still there is a lack of studies that can provide a comprehensive analysis on widely used classification algorithms. Hence, in the present study, nine different pixel- and object-based classification algorithms have been used to compare their relative effectiveness in generating remotely sensed LULC maps. The algorithms include maximum likelihood, neural network, support vector machine (linear, polynomial, RBF (radial basis function), sigmoid kernels), random forest (RF) and Naive Bayes for pixel-based classification and maximum likelihood algorithm for object-based classification (OBC) approach. Additionally, the study has analysed the impact of different types of satellite datasets (i.e., high resolution image and resolution merged images of same resolution) on relative effectiveness of the algorithms in classifying the satellite imageries accurately. High resolution (5 m) satellite image LISS 4 MX70, resolution merged satellite images (5 m) LISS 3 merged with LISS 4 mono and LISS 3 merged with IRS-1D are employed for classification. 27 LULC maps (9 classification algorithms * 3 images) are evaluated for comparing classification algorithms. The accuracy assessment of the images is carried out using confusion matrix and Mc Nemar's test. It has been observed that (1) the performance of all classification algorithms differs from each other and (2) resolution merged data impacts classification accuracy differently when compared to other satellite image of same spatial resolution. RF and OBC are identified as potential classifiers with majority of datasets. The results suggest that due to heterogeneity in urban land-use, it is difficult to achieve higher overall accuracy in classifying a large urban area using 5 m resolution satellite dataset. Moreover, visual examination of LULC should be considered for choosing better classification approach as pixel-based approach produces salt-pepper effect in LULC, whereas OBC produces visually smoothened LULC and identifies even smaller objects in urban landscape. The comparative evaluation of different image types reveal that RF performs better with all images, however, the performance of OBC was found to be improved with original high-resolution data.

TI  - A one - source model to estimate sensible heat flux in agricultural landscapes
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A one-source model type that combines surface renewal (SR) and similarity theories to estimate the sensible heat flux (H) involving the land surface temperature (LST) and low-frequency measurements, HSR-LST, was tested over agricultural surfaces with fractions of ground canopy cover that ranged from 39% up to 97% and canopy heights ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 m. The performance was tested under clear sky conditions and for stable and unstable cases during the day. The sensible heat flux was estimated using in situ LST measurements over a homogenous canopy (wheat) under stable conditions. Unstable conditions were met for two growing crops (rain-fed soybean and corn) where HSR- LST was tested using LST retrieved from Landsat 5 to 7. The sensible heat flux taken as a reference for soybean and corn was determined using the eddy covariance (EC) method and for wheat it was determined using the residual method (the evapotranspiration was measured using a large weighing lysimeter). For wheat HSR-LST performed slightly better than a calibrated one-source model. For soybean and corn, it performed similarly to one-source and two-source model types. The one-source models included two types, one requiring calibration and the other one self-calibrating, using 'hot' and 'cold' spots in the surroundings. Further testing for sparse canopies is suggested prior to the development of a two-source model in the framework of SRLST because HSR-LST performed similarly to the other models. For corn, HSR-LST had the closest performance to HEC and for soybean the two-source model (the best) was slightly closer to H-EC than HSR-LST. The root mean square differences (RMSD) comparing HSR-LST against the reference were in the range 26 (corn) - 46 (wheat) Wm(-2). Therefore, HSR-LST is an alternative to consider for estimating H because it was competitive and simpler to apply than other thermal remote sensing-based methods.

TI  - The tempo of greening in the European Alps: Spatial variations on a common theme
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term increase in satellite-based proxies of vegetation cover is a well-documented response of seasonally snow-covered ecosystems to climate warming. However, observed greening trends are far from uniform, and substantial uncertainty remains concerning the underlying causes of this spatial variability. Here, we processed surface reflectance of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) to investigate trends and drivers of changes in the annual peak values of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Our study focuses on above-treeline ecosystems in the European Alps. NDVI changes in these ecosystems are highly sensitive to land cover and biomass changes and are marginally affected by anthropogenic disturbances. We observed widespread greening for the 2000-2020 period, a pattern that is consistent with the overall increase in summer temperature. At the local scale, the spatial variability of greening was mainly due to the preferential response of north-facing slopes between 1900 and 2400 m. Using high-resolution imagery, we noticed that the presence of screes and outcrops locally magnified this response. At the regional scale, we identified hotspots of greening where vegetation cover is sparser than expected given the elevation and exposure. Most of these hotspots experienced delayed snow melt and green-up dates in recent years. We conclude that the ongoing greening in the Alps primarily reflects the high responsiveness of sparsely vegetated ecosystems that are able to benefit the most from temperature and water-related habitat amelioration above treeline.

TI  - Spatial patterns and driving factors of aboveground and belowground biomass over the eastern Eurasian steppe
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Eurasian steppe is the largest steppe region in the world and is an important part of the global grassland ecosystem. The eastern Eurasian steppe has favorable hydrothermal conditions and has the highest productivity and the richest biodiversity. Located in the arid and semi-arid region, the eastern Eurasian steppe has experienced large-scale grassland degradation due to dramatic climate change and intensive human activities during the past 20 years. Hence, accurate estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB, gC m(-2)) and belowground biomass (BGB, gC m(-2)) is necessary. In this study, plenty of AGB and BGB in-situ measurements were collected among dominated grassland types during summer in 2013 and 2016-2018 in the eastern Eurasian steppe. Vegetation indices from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and climate variables were chosen as independent variables to establish predictive models for AGB and BGB with random forest (RF). Both AGB (R-2 = 0.47, MAE = 21.06 gC m(-2), and RMSE = 27.52 gC m(-2)) and BGB (R-2 = 0.44, MAE = 173.02 gC m(-2), and RMSE = 244.20 gC m(-2)) models showed acceptable accuracy. Then the RF models were applied to generate spatially explicit AGB and BGB estimates for the study area over the last two decades (2000-2018). Both AGB and BGB showed higher values in the Greater Khingan Mountains and decreased gradually to the east and west sides. The mean values for AGB and BGB were 62.16 gC m(-2) and 531.35 gC m(-2), respectively. The climatic factors were much more important in controlling biomass than anthro-pogenic drivers, and shortage of water and raising temperature were the main limiting factor of AGB and BGB, respectively, in the peak growth season. These findings provide scientific data for the scientific management of animal husbandry and can contribute to the sustainable development of grassland ecology in the eastern Eurasian steppe.

TI  - Synergy of multi-temporal polarimetric SAR and optical image satellite for mapping of marsh vegetation using object-based random forest algorithm
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The accurate classification of marsh vegetation is an important prerequisite for wetland management and pro-tection. In this study, the Honghe National Nature Reserve was used as the research area. The VV and VH polarized backscattering coefficients of Sentinel-1B, the polarimetric decomposition parameters of Sentinel-1B, and Sentinel-2A multi-spectral images from June and September were selected to construct 18 multi-dimensional data sets. A highly correlated variable elimination algorithm, a recursive feature elimination vari-able selection algorithm (RFE-RF), and an optimized random forest algorithm (RF) were used to construct a marsh vegetation identification model. In this study, we searched for an RF model to achieve the accurate classification of marsh vegetation and find the best feature for identifying various types of vegetation. Addi-tionally, the applicability of different optimized RF models to the task of the identification of wetland vegetation and the stability of the identification of marsh vegetation using different classification models were quantita-tively analyzed. The results show the following: (1) RFE-RF variable selection and RF parameter optimization can reduce the data dimensionality, improve the accuracy and stability of the wetland vegetation classification model, and achieve a training accuracy of up to 85.39%. (2) The RF model integrating multi-spectral data, backscattering coefficients, and polarimetric decomposition parameters for June and September can obtain the highest overall accuracy (91.16%), and the model has the strongest applicability. (3) The importance of multi-spectral variables in wetland vegetation classification is higher than that of backscattering coefficients and polarimetric decomposition parameters. The visible bands and vegetation index are the most important vari-ables, while the cross-polarized backscattering coefficient (Mean_VH), polarimetric decomposition eigenvalue (Mean_l1, Mean_l2), and calculated eigenvalues of the matrix (Mean_lambda) are the backscattering coefficient features and polarimetric decomposition parameters with the highest contributions. (4) The modified normalized difference water index in June (MNDWI_ Jun), blue band in September (Mean_B_Sep), location feature pixel coordinates (Y_Max_Pxl), and ratio vegetation index in September (RVI_Sep) have the highest contribution to the identification and classification of deep-water marsh vegetation, shallow-water marsh vegetation, forest, and shrubs, respectively. (5) The identification of forest is the strongest, and the classification accuracy for shrubs and deep-water marsh vegetation is greatly affected by the combination of time phase and data sources.

TI  - Geological mapping of basalt using stream sediment geochemical data: Case study of covered areas in Jining, Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multidisciplinary exploration data have been widely and successfully applied when using machine learning methods to conduct geological mapping. However, in covered areas such as Jining, Inner Mongolia, China, where remote sensing and geophysical data are unavailable or difficult to obtain, geochemical data become more important. In addition, previous studies have often selected data labels based on geological maps, which are generally obtained by interpolation or extrapolation of field lithological points and so are inherently uncertain. This study collected seven types of 2341 field lithological points and evaluated the errors of each lithological unit, based on a confusion matrix. Using these field lithological points, we applied the random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) methods to delineate basalt in the Jining region by integrating 1:50,000 stream sediment geochemical data. The evaluation indexes of accuracy, precision, recall, and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) all indicated that RF outperformed SVM. Based on the predictions of RF, five types of target areas were generated, which were further verified using Sentinel-2 images. This research highlights that using lithological points as data labels and trace-element stream sediment data as a training dataset can provide encouraging results when conducting lithological mapping in covered areas.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy using a magnetic tracer versus standard technique: A multicentre comparative non-inferiority study (IMAGINE-II)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGERY OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Previous studies have shown that a magnetic tracer technique using superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) and a manual magnetometer (Sentimag, SM) is as effective as the standard technique using a radioisotope injection and a gamma probe (GP) for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in breast cancer (BC) patients. This study was designed to investigate the performance of SM for post-neoadjuvant (NAT) SLN biopsy in BC patients.Materials and methods: Post-NAT BC patients were recruited from five centres. Readings of SLNs were recorded in transcutaneous, intraoperative and ex vivo scenarios by both GP and SM techniques. SLNs were assessed by OSNA (One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification).Results: A total of 89 patients were included. At the patient level, the transcutaneous and intraoperative SLN detection rate was 97.8% by both techniques. At the node level, the GP detection rate intraoperatively was lower than that of SM (93.8% vs. 99.2%), with a concordance rate of 93% (90% CI 1.25; 9.44). The ex vivo detection rate was lower for GP compared to SM both per patient 96.6% vs. 97.8%, and per node 90.6% vs. 98.4% (90% CI-2.03; 4.22 and 1.82; 13.68, respectively). Furthermore, the detection rate of pathologically positive SLNs per patient and per node was lower for GP than SM both intraoperatively and ex vivo. These results showed the non-inferiority of SM intraoperatively per node (90% CI-4.89; 20.89) and ex vivo per patient (90% CI-2.38; 29.66).Conclusion: Our study showed the non-inferiority of SM compared to GP for detecting SLNs in post-NAT BC patients.

TI  - Indeterminism in physics and intuitionistic mathematics
T2  - SYNTHESE
M3  - Article
AB  - Most physics theories are deterministic, with the notable exception of quantum mechanics which, however, comes plagued by the so-called measurement problem. This state of affairs might well be due to the inability of standard mathematics to "speak" of indeterminism, its inability to present us a worldview in which new information is created as time passes. In such a case, scientific determinism would only be an illusion due to the timeless mathematical language scientists use. To investigate this possibility it is necessary to develop an alternative mathematical language that is both powerful enough to allow scientists to compute predictions and compatible with indeterminism and the passage of time. We suggest that intuitionistic mathematics provides such a language and we illustrate it in simple terms.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the data provided from the new satellite constellation, the crop phonology can be mapped accurately with a high spatial and temporal resolution. The potential of Sentinel-2 (high spatial and temporal resolution, 10 m and 5 days) is investigated in order to monitor and forecast the crop growth over different olive groves located in Sfax, Tunisia, from the beginning of 2016 to the end of 2020. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is used as an indicator of vegetation health due to its high correlation with crop growth health and productivity, and it is particularly forecasted to predict the trends. The prediction is done using two different statistical methods, autoregressive (AR) and Markov chain (MC), based on historical data derived from Sentinel-2 data. The prediction is applied for three different areas having various vegetation types and density. Moreover, for an accurate and precise prediction, our study areas are divided into different homogeneous clusters using the well-known Gaussian mixture model. Furthermore, the performances of our approach are assessed by means of the root mean squared error ( RMSE) between the predicted results and the actual data. Globally, the obtained results for all the clusters of each area show that the forecast, using both methods, is accurate where the error is less than 5%. Nevertheless, the MC model displays the highest performance where the predicted NDVI curves of the different study areas are the closest to the actual observation. MC (resp. AR) precision is of 97% with RMSE = 0.025 (resp. 95% and RMSE = 0.041) for all the clusters of Jbeniana and Limaya, and 99% with RMSE = 0.0073 (resp. 98% and RMSE = 0.0127) for the four clusters of Chaal.

Yet, developing these models remains challenging, as they require linking broadscale population data with habitat characteristics that influence species abundance. Advances in remote sensing technology have resulted in increased availability of spatially continuous, high-resolution data that relate to ecologically important habitat characteristics. In forested systems, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Digital Arial Photogrammetry (DAP) are of particular interest owing to their ability to estimate vegetative structure that drives variability in abundance or density of some forest-dependent species. We used an extensive dataset on the density of a keystone boreal forest species, the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) in northcentral Washington, USA, to examine which LiDAR- and DAP-derived habitat variables most strongly influence snowshoe hare density, and projected these relationships across the landscape to derive a hare density surface for our 53 km(2) study area. We found snowshoe hare density is most influenced by habitat variables related to tree height (a proxy for stand age), horizontal cover, and vertical cover, and our model had high predictive performance on a spatially-independent validation dataset. Hare densities increased as horizontal cover and canopy cover increased, with our highest hare densities occurring in areas with >9% horizontal cover (% of LiDAR returns in 1-4 m height stratum), >65% canopy cover and tree height (a proxy for stand age) of similar to 5-10 m. To demonstrate the management implications of this work, we show that our landscape-scale model of predicted hare density helps understand habitat use by threatened Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis), a primary predator of hare. Our results show how coupling population data with remotely sensed forest structure metrics allows for continuous, large-scale population estimates. Such integration provides an important management tool for examining spatiotemporal changes in populations as boreal ecosystems come under increasing stress from climate and land use change.

TI  - Hybrid Artificial Neural Networks for Modeling Shallow-Water Bathymetry via Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate bathymetric mapping for shallow-water areas is essential for coastal and maritime engineering applications. However, traditional multibeam or light detection and ranging (LiDAR) survey techniques used to produce high-quality bathymetric maps are expensive. Satellite-derived bathymetry provides a fast and inexpensive method for the large-scale mapping of shallow-water areas and can overcome the complexities of traditional bathymetric mapping methods in these areas. Traditionally, linear regression models, most commonly the Stumpf model, are used for satellite-based bathymetric modeling. However, nonlinear artificial neural network (ANN) models have been recently developed and implemented for satellite-based bathymetric modeling and are under significant investigation to develop the most accurate and optimal model. This article proposes two new hybrid ANN-based models for bathymetric modeling and investigates their performance using satellite imagery data and ``truth'' depth data for a coastal shallow-water study area. Two-hybrid ANN algorithms are developed, namely, particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ANN and optimally pruned extreme learning machine (OPELM), and their results are compared with the traditional Stumpf method and current state-of-the-art ANN model. The study area dataset comprises the ``truth'' depth data from a nautical chart of the Alqumriyah Island study area in Saudi Arabia and the corresponding spectral reflection values of green, blue, and near-infrared bands from the free-of-charge Level-1C product of Sentinel-2A images used to train and validate the two newly developed models and the traditional models. The results show that the developed OPELM method can accurately derive the bathymetry and is superior to the developed PSO-ANN model, the current state-of-the-art ANN model, and the traditional Stumpf model by 12.10%, 18.76%, and 32.46%, respectively. The OPELM model can also be used for bathymetric modeling of shallow-water areas with depths up to 30 m with a high level of accuracy compared with the current state-of-the-art ANN and traditional methods. The significant contribution of this research is that it is the first investigation of the artificial intelligence-based hybrid OPELM method for accurate bathymetric modeling and will certainly encourage further investigations of hybrid models. Moreover, this research explores whether these developed hybrid models can meet the International Hydrographic Organization standards for hydrographic survey applications.

TI  - CONFLICT-INDUCED DEFORESTATION DETECTION IN AFRICAN COTE D'IVOIRE USING LANDSAT IMAGES AND RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM: A CASE IN MOUNT PEKO NATIONAL PARK
T2  - APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - African forests, especially in Cote d'Ivoire, have been lost during the past three decades. Worldwide, forests are being destroyed to make room for farmland. Deforestation depletes floral resources and fragments habitat. Cocoa growth threatens critical ecological zones, particularly in Cote d'Ivoire. The 2002-2007 conflict impacted Mount Peko National Park (PNMP). This issue has hastened the decline of endangered animal habitats (Colobus and Elephants). The classification approach based on Random Forest (RF) algorithm using the Mean Accuracy Decrease (MDA) has been applied for choosing a variable to select the best predictor variables in the model. A Spectral Index map and time series satellite images of the PNMP from 1985 to 2020 were used to identify land cover changes. RStudio and QGIS 3.4 software have been used to create training data. Among thirteen (13) variables studied, NIR (Near Infrared), Short-Wave Infrared 1 (SWIR 1) and SWIR bands had the increased importance of the variable for the performance of the classification prediction model. The NIR band was the greatest predictor. MDA predicted 75%. User accuracy (UA), Producer accuracy (PA), and Overall accuracy (OA) classifications were 98.75% +/- 1.94, 99% +/- 1.95, 97% +/- 1.93. The park's dense forest remained unchanged, but nonforest was reforested and 12.22% was turned to forest. During the study period, extensive cocoa plantations were established in formerly forested regions.

TI  - Monitoring high spatiotemporal water dynamics by fusing MODIS, Landsat, water occurrence data and DEM
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the spatiotemporal dynamics of surface water from remote sensing imagery is essential for understanding water's impact on the global ecosystem and climate change. There is often a tradeoff between the spatial and temporal resolutions of imagery acquired from current satellite sensors and as such various spatiotemporal image fusion methods have been explored to circumvent the challenges this situation presents (e.g., STARFM). However, some challenges persist in mapping surface water at the desired fine spatial and temporal resolution. Principally, the spatiotemporal changes of water bodies are often abrupt and controlled by topographic conditions, which are usually unaddressed in current spatiotemporal image fusion methods. This paper proposes the SpatioTemporal Surface Water Mapping (STSWM) method, which aims to predict Landsat-like, 30 m, surface water maps at an 8-day time step (same as the MODIS 8-day composite product) by integrating topographic information into the analysis. In addition to MODIS imagery acquired on the date of map prediction and a pair of MODIS and Landsat images acquired temporally close to the date of prediction, STSWM also uses the surface water occurrence (SWO, which represents the frequency with which water is present in a pixel) and DEM data to provide, respectively, topographic information below and above the water surface. These data are used to translate the coarse spatial resolution water distribution representation observed by MODIS into a 30 m spatial resolution water distribution map. The STSWM was used to generate an 8-day time series surface water maps of 30 m resolution in six inundation regions globally, and was compared with several other state-of-the-art spatiotemporal methods. The stratified random sampling design was used, and unbiased estimators of the accuracies were provided. The results show that STSWM generated the most accurate surface water map in which the spatial details of surface water were well-represented.

TI  - Impacts of forest loss on local climate across the conterminous United States: Evidence from satellite time-series observations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbances alter land biophysics. Their impacts on local climate and land surface temperature (LST) cannot be directly measured by comparing pre-and post-disturbance observations of the same site over time (e.g., due to confounding such as background climate fluctuations); a common remedy is to compare spatially adjacent undisturbed sites instead. This space-for-time substitution ignores the inherent biases in vegetation between two paired sites, interannual variations, and temporal dynamics of forest recovery. Besides, there is a lack of observation-based analyses at fine spatial resolutions capable of capturing spatial heterogeneity of small-scale forest disturbances. To address these limitations, here we report new satellite analyses on local climate impacts of forest loss at 30 m resolution. Our analyses combined multiple long-term satellite products (e.g., albedo and evapotranspiration [ET]) at 700 sites across major climate zones in the conterminous United States, using time-series trend and changepoint detection methods. Our method helped isolate the biophysical changes attributed to disturbances from those attributed to climate backgrounds and natural growth. On average, forest loss increased surface albedo, decreased ET, and reduced leaf area index (LAI). Net annual warming-an increase in LST-was observed after forest loss in the arid/semiarid, northern, tropical, and temperate regions, dominated by the warming from decreased ET and attenuated by the cooling from increased albedo. The magnitude of post-disturbance warming was related to precipitation; climate zones with greater precipitation showed stronger and longer warming. Reduction in leaf or LAI was larger in evergreen than deciduous forests, but the recovery in LAI did not always synchronize with those of albedo and ET. Overall, this study presents new evidence of biophysical effects of forest loss on LST at finer spatial resolutions; our time-series method can be further leveraged to derive local policy-relevant ecosystem climate regulation metrics or support model-based climate biosphere studies.

TI  - Advanced nuclear radiation shielding studies of some mafic and ultramafic complexes with lithological mapping
T2  - RADIATION PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rocks are comparatively high-density materials, which can be developed as a protecting wall to reduce the radiation contact at buildings where gamma radiation is utilized. The Visible Near Infrared (VNIR) and Short-wave near Infrared (SWIR) bands of Landsat 8 remote sensing data are utilized to discriminate the mafic and ultramafic rocks' lithology. The different Band combinations, band ratioed composites, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Minimum Noise fraction (MNF) have been done and interpreted. The PCA 415, MNF 253, and bandratios 3/6, 7/4, 5/2 have been used to discriminate the mafic-ultramafic complexes in a good manner. The significant oxides values were retrieved through the X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) method, and density is calculated. In order to assess the three investigated rocks' radiation shielding features, the linear attenuation coefficient (LAC) and mass attenuation coefficient (mu/rho) were simulated using Monte Carlo simulation. Simul-taneously, the mu/rho and the effective atomic number (Z(eff)) were estimated using Phy-X software between 0.015 and 15 MeV. The results revealed that the mu/rho and Z(eff) follow the order of Gabbro > Peridotite > Pyroxenite. At low energies, the maximum mu/rho is reported for all investigated rocks. A steep decrease in mu/rho values is found, which demonstrates that the rocks have much better attenuation at low energies while being the least effective at high energies. The mu/rho of Peridotite decreases from 11.540 cm(2)/g at 0.015 MeV to 5.122 cm(2)/g at 0.02 MeV, 1.681 at 0.03 cm(2)/g MeV, and 0.814 cm(2)/g at 0.04 MeV. At 0.015 MeV, Peridotite has a Zeff of 17.34, Pyroxenite has a Zeff of 17.27, and Gabbro has a Zeff of 18.12. The half-value layer (HVL) for Peridotite decreases from 0.02 cm at 0.015 MeV, to 0.31 cm at 0.04 MeV, 1.95 cm at 0.20 MeV, 3.94 cm at 1.00 MeV, and 11.28 cm at 15.00 MeV. At all energies, however, Gabbro has the least HVL, followed by Pyroxenite and Peridotite.

TI  - Fuzzy-based vulnerability assessment of coupled social-ecological systems to multiple environmental hazards and climate change
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and combining related parameters of environmental hazards have left a considerable challenge in assessing social-ecological vulnerability. Here we integrated a fuzzy-based approach in the vulnerability assessment of mangrove social-ecological systems combining environmental parameters, socio-economic, and vegetative components from exposure dimensions, sensitivity and adaptive capacity along the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman for the first time. This study aims to provide critical information for habitat-scale management strategies and adaptation plans by assessing the vulnerability of mangrove social-ecological systems. This study provides a methodology framework that consists of five steps. Step 1: We com-bined the fuzzy weighted maps of seven environmental hazards, including tidal range, maximum wind speeds, drought magnitude, maximum temperatures, extreme storm surge, sea-level rise, significant wave height, and social vulnerability. This map combination determined that the computed exposure index is from 1.07 to 4.32 across the study areas, with an increasing trend from the coasts of the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman. Step 2: We integrated the fuzzy weighted maps of four sensitivity variables, including area change, health change, seaward edge retreat, and production potential change. The findings show that the sensitivity index is from 1.40 to 2.64 across the study areas, increasing the trend from the Persian Gulf coast to the Gulf of Oman. Step 3: Besides, we combined the fuzzy weighted maps of three adaptive capacity variables, including the availability of migration areas, recruitment, and local communities' participation in restoration projects and education pro-grams. The result showed that the index value across the study areas varies between 0.087 and 2.38, decreasing the trend from the Persian Gulf coast to the Gulf of Oman. Step 4: Implementing fuzzy hierarchical analysis process to determine the relative weight of variables corresponding to exposure, sensitivity and adaptive ca-pacity. Step 5: The integration of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity and the vulnerability index maps in the study areas showed variation from 0.25 to 5.92, with the vulnerability of mangroves from the west coast of the Persian Gulf (Nayband) decreasing towards Khamir, then increasing to the eastern coasts of the Gulf of Oman (Jask and Gwadar). Overall, the results indicate the importance of the proposed approach to the vulnerability of mangroves at the habitat scale along a coastal area and across environmental gradients of climatic, maritime and socio-economic variables. This study validated the findings based on the ground truth measurements, and high -resolution satellite data incorporated the Consistency Rate (CR) in the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). The overall accuracy of all classified remote sensing images and maps consistently exceeded 90%, and the CR of the 25 completed questionnaires was <0.1. Finally, this study indicates differences in vulnerability of various habitats, leading to focus conservation completion and rehabilitation and climate change adaptation planning to support the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)-13 implementation.

TI  - European Copernicus Services to Inform on Sea-Level Rise Adaptation: Current Status and Perspectives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Sea-level rise is a direct consequence of climate change. Primarily due to ocean thermal expansion and transfer from land ice (glaciers, ice sheets) to the ocean, sea-level rise is therefore an integrated indicator of climate change. Coastal zones and communities are expected to be increasingly threatened by sea level changes, with various adverse and widespread impacts. The European Union's Earth Observation Programmed, Copernicus, monitors our planet and its environment, for the ultimate benefit of society. This includes the monitoring of sea level changes and the provision of ancillary fields needed to assess sea-level rise coastal risks, to guide adaptation and to support related policies and directives. Copernicus is organized with a space component, including dedicated Earth Observation satellites (Sentinel missions), and services, which transform the wealth of satellite, in situ and integrated numerical model information into added-value datasets and information usable by scientists, managers and decision-makers, and the wider public. Here, an overview of the Copernicus products and services to inform on sea level rise adaptation is provided. Perspectives from Copernicus services on future evolutions to better inform on coastal sea level rise, associated risks, and support adaptation are also discussed.

TI  - High real-time reporting of domestic and wild animal diseases following rollout of mobile phone reporting system in Kenya
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background To improve early detection of emerging infectious diseases in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), many of them zoonotic, numerous electronic animal disease-reporting systems have been piloted but not implemented because of cost, lack of user friendliness, and data insecurity. In Kenya, we developed and rolled out an open-source mobile phone-based domestic and wild animal disease reporting system and collected data over two years to investigate its robustness and ability to track disease trends.Methods The Kenya Animal Biosurveillance System (KABS) application was built on the Java (R) platform, freely downloadable for android compatible mobile phones, and supported by web-based account management, form editing and data monitoring. The application was integrated into the surveillance systems of Kenya's domestic and wild animal sectors by adopting their existing data collection tools, and targeting disease syndromes prioritized by national, regional and international animal and human health agencies. Smartphone-owning government and private domestic and wild animal health officers were recruited and trained on the application, and reports received and analyzed by Kenya Directorate of Veterinary Services. The KABS application performed automatic basic analyses (frequencies, spatial distribution), which were immediately relayed to reporting officers as feedback.Results Of 697 trained domestic animal officers, 662 (95%) downloaded the application, and >72% of them started reporting using the application within three months. Introduction of the application resulted in 2- to 14-fold increase in number of disease reports when compared to the previous year (relative risk = 14, CI 13.8-14.2, p<0.001), and reports were more widely distributed. Among domestic animals, food animals (cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and chicken) accounted for >90% of the reports, with respiratory, gastrointestinal and skin diseases constituting >85% of the reports. Herbivore wildlife (zebra, buffalo, elephant, giraffe, antelopes) accounted for >60% of the wildlife disease reports, followed by carnivores (lions, cheetah, hyenas, jackals, and wild dogs). Deaths, traumatic injuries, and skin diseases were most reported in wildlife.Conclusions This open-source system was user friendly and secure, ideal for rolling out in other countries in SSA to improve disease reporting and enhance preparedness for epidemics of zoonotic diseases.

TI  - Engagements with uncertain futures-Analysing survivalist preparedness
T2  - FUTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - Much like any grand-scale social disturbance, COVID-19 has brought increasing attention to emergency preparedness on global, national, and individual levels. Although independent preparedness is considered to play an important role in disturbance and emergency-related survival, little attention has been paid to the ways in which individuals conduct their preparations or the social aspects of these preparatory activities. This article investigates the ways in which survivalists engage with uncertain futures by preparing. Survivalism is a cultural movement that anticipates and prepares for different kinds and scales of disasters and disturbances. The analysis seeks to clarify for what, how, and why Finnish survivalists prepare for. This study employs an experimental setup that combines two different types of media material; media representations about survivalists made by journalists, and online discussions written by survivalists themselves on a Finnish survivalist web forum page. The data was subjected to qualitative thematic text analysis. The factors that motivate preparedness vary from ordinary and personal inconveniences to general and global disaster scenarios, which co-exist despite their different scales. In practice, the survivalist approach continuously moves between speculative futures and the material present. The survivalist worldview balances between different, seemingly opposite poles: norm-criticality, self-sufficiency, privacy, and collectivism.

TI  - Python parallel processing for hyperspectral image simulation: based on distance functions
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The hyperspectral image consists of a high number of bands with low bandwidth which gives the advantage in the identification and detection of the features in the level of mineral and chemical composition. But the availability of hyperspectral data is very less and is highly expensive when compared to multispectral data. Simulation of hyperspectral data with the existing hyperspectral and multispectral data can be used as an alternative if data availability is less and is cost-effective. A new method is proposed for hyperspectral image simulation with Chebyshev and Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) distance functions using python programming and its libraries. The process is selecting similar spectra of each pixel. Using normal processing, the data simulation is very time-consuming. By increasing the cores employed with parallel processing in python programming, the hyperspectral data simulation time is decreased exponentially from 19 to 1 h 21 min. The study clearly explains the logic and open source python code for the simulation of hyperspectral data. Data can be simulated with python code by just giving the paths of test Sentinel-2 and reference Sentinel-2, AVIRIS data. The simulated image gave better normalized cross-correlation values when compared with the original Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) data.

TI  - The Phenomenon of Consciousness in the Works of Lev Tolstoy and Jiddu Krishnamurti
T2  - RUSSIAN STUDIES IN PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is devoted to the study and comparative analysis of the metaphysical foundations of the worldview of Lev N. Tolstoy (1828-1910) and Jiddu Krishnamurti (1895-1986). The author considers the interpretation of the phenomenon of consciousness given by these thinkers as the key to understanding the unity of the world and man, true spiritual values, and criticism of traditional social institutions. The author outlines three aspects of Tolstoy and Krishnamurti's perception of the phenomenon of consciousness (religious-metaphysical, psychological, and social) that help us understand a wide range of problems related to the worldview of the Russian and Indian thinkers. Based on analysis of sources (Tolstoy's artistic and philosophical works, texts of Krishnamurti's talks, etc.), the author concludes that the two outstanding representatives of world culture and philosophy are close to each other in many important aspects.

TI  - Creating doorways: finding meaning and growth through art therapy in the face of life-threatening illness
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: This article presents the findings of a pilot study situated in a tertiary care cancer centre and examines the impact of an art therapy group on the experiences of women living through breast cancer. Study design: The study design used in this study is a qualitative cross-case comparative case.Methods: Ten women were interviewed about their experiences making art, many for the first time. Interviews were transcribed and analysed, along with the participants' artist statements.Results: Categories include the following: the significant benefits of art therapy on their sense of self-efficacy; the emotionally enhancing nature of making art for the first time; the power of their artwork to trigger insights about themselves (including subcategories of self-actualization, existential growth, and post-traumatic growth) or in communicating their experiences to loved ones; and how making art changed their worldview and life philosophies, creating doorways of possibilities.Conclusion: This study suggests that art therapy provides a safe context to reflect on profound personal changes and to re-story losses following adversity through creative practices as a dimension of care.

TI  - The Influence of Climate Change on River Corridors in Drylands: The Case of the Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tehuacan-Cuicatlan Biosphere Reserve, Mexico (TCBR) is the southernmost arid or semi-arid zone with the highest biodiversity in North America and is a UNESCO World Heritage site. Two main hydrographic streams cross the TCBR, the Salado River (an endogenous river) and the Grande River (an exogenous river). This study investigated temperature anomalies over the past 40 years. We analyzed potential differences between sub-basins and riparian areas on both streams using various indices, namely the Global Warming Index (GWI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), and Normalized Difference Drought Index (NDDI), and analyzed the potential relationship of these indices with climate change. Time series of satellite-based precipitation (June 2000-December 2020) and air temperature (January 1980-December 2020) were analyzed. A set of Landsat 8 OLI TIRS imagery from the driest and wettest months (2013-2020) was used to estimate NDVI, NDWI, and NDDI. These indices were evaluated separately for the sub-basins and river corridors in the dry and rainy seasons. The precipitation records indicate that in the Grande river sub-basin, precipitation is higher than in the Salado river sub basin. Normalized temperature anomalies and the GWI suggest a warming trend from 1994 to 2020, increasing up to 0.86 degrees C in the Salado River and 0.52 degrees C in the Grande River. The Grande and Salado sub basins showed significant differences between dry and wet seasons for each index (NDVI, NDWI, and NDDI). A Discriminant Analysis showed that the Salado sub-basin and the Salado River corridor are associated with severe drying conditions in the dry season (highest NDDI values). In the wet season, the Grande River corridor showed intermediate values of NDVI and NDWI but low values of NDDI. The Grande River corridor in the dry season was characterized by intermediate values of NDVI, NDWI, and NDDI. These river corridors provide environmental services in a trade-off with the stream and should be considered biodiversity hotspots. Due to the accentuated warming trend and the lowest precipitation, the Salado River sub-basin showed desertification signs associated with climate change. Both the Salado and the Grande River corridors showed resilience strategies to face climatic conditions.</p>

TI  - Estimating heterogeneous wildfire effects using synthetic controls and satellite remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires have become one of the biggest natural hazards for environments worldwide. The effects of wildfires are heterogeneous, meaning that the magnitude of their effects depends on many factors such as geographical region, climate and land cover/vegetation type. Yet, which areas are more affected by these events remains unclear. Here we present a novel application of the Generalized Synthetic Control (GSC) method that enables quantification and prediction of vegetation changes due to wildfires through a time-series analysis of in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We apply this method to medium to large wildfires (> 1000 acres) in California throughout a time-span of two decades (1996-2016). The method's ability for estimating counterfactual vegetation characteristics for burned regions is explored in order to quantify abrupt system changes. We find that the GSC method is better at predicting vegetation changes than the more traditional approach of using nearby regions to assess wildfire impacts. We evaluate the GSC method by comparing its predictions of spectral vegetation indices to observations during pre-wildfire periods and find improvements in correlation coefficient from R2 = 0.66 to R2 = 0.93 in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from R2 = 0.48 to R2 = 0.81 for Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and from R2 = 0.49 to R2 = 0.85 for Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Results show greater changes in NDVI, NBR, and NDMI post-fire on regions classified as having a lower Burning Index. We find that on average, wildfires cause a 25% initial decrease in the vegetation index (NDVI) and a larger than 80% drop in wetness indices (NBR and NDMI) after they occur. The GSC method also reveals that wildfire effects on vegetation can last for more than a decade post-wildfire, and in some cases never return to their previous vegetation cycles within our study period. We also find that the dynamical effects vary across regions and have an impact on seasonal cycles of vegetation in later years. Lastly, we discuss the usefulness of using GSC in remote sensing analyses.

TI  - Landscape-scale hydrologic response of plant invasion relative to native vegetation in urban forests
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Large-scale invasion modifies watershed hydrology by changing surface runoff and lowering the seasonal availability of water to native plants. Due to costly field-based evapotranspiration (ET) measurements, which are highly localized and occasionally subject to instrument failure, landscape-scale water use assessments of invasive plants are infrequent. Therefore, the extent to which plant invaders alter water allocation between native and non-native vegetation in a given landscape is rarely assessed. We used a remote sensing-based ET modeling approach to measure the hydrologic response of an invasive shrub, Ligustrum sinense, across forests of the Charlotte Metropolitan Area, North Carolina. We hypothesized that this invader's widespread occurrence and dominant plant physiology significantly competes with native forests for water resources. We tested this hypothesis by comparing inter-and intra-annual variations in ET from invaded and uninvaded sites estimated using the surface-energy-balance system (SEBS) model and cloud-free Landsat images for the wettest (2003), driest (2007), and normal (2005 and 2011) water years. Our findings suggest that the water demand of L. sinense is higher than native forests (deciduous and evergreen) for most of the year except during the early spring and after high precipitation events. The daily ET flux of L. sinense was significantly different than evergreen vegetation during the driest year (2007) that, five years later (2011 normal water year), was significantly different than both deciduous and evergreen vegetation types. This suggests that L. sinense consumes more water than native forest types, particularly during dry and normal precipitation years with increasing canopy cover over time making it a strong competitor with native vegetation for water resources in urban forests. Therefore, accounting for the hydrologic response of invasive plants and potential water savings from their removal from forests, particularly in water-scarce regions, may enable land managers and decision-makers to prioritize areas for monitoring and control efforts.

TI  - Apportioning deformation among depth intervals in an aquifer system using InSAR and head data
T2  - HYDROGEOLOGY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface subsidence due to excessive groundwater pumping is an increasing concern in California, USA. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing technique for measuring centimeter-to-millimeter surface deformation at 10-100 m spatial resolution. Here, a data-driven approach that attributes deformation to individual depth intervals within an aquifer system by integrating head data acquired from each of three screened intervals in a monitoring well with InSAR surface deformation measurements was developed. The study area was the Colusa Basin in northern Central Valley. To reconstruct the surface deformation history over the study area, 13 ALOS-PALSAR scenes acquired between 2006 and 2010 were processed. Up to similar to 3-cm year(-1) long-term subsidence and up to similar to 6 cm seasonal subsidence were observed using the InSAR technique. The technique developed in this paper integrates the InSAR-observed seasonal deformation rate and the co-located head measurements in multiple depth intervals to estimate the elastic skeletal storage coefficient, the time delay between the head change and the observed deformation, and subsequently the deformation of each depth interval. This technique can be implemented when hydraulic head measurements within each depth interval are not correlated with each other. Using this approach, the depth interval that contributed the most to the total subsidence, as well as storage parameters for all intervals, are estimated. The technique can be used for identification of the depth interval within the aquifer system responsible for deformation.

TI  - A legacy of silence: the intersections of medical sociology and disability studies
T2  - MEDICAL HUMANITIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Disability remains on the margins of the social sciences. Even where disability is foregrounded as a category of analysis, accounts regularly emerge in silos, with little interdisciplinary dialogue acknowledging the potential intersections and points of convergence. This discord is particularly acute within medical sociology and disability studies, yet there is mostly a legacy of silence about the relationship between the two disciplines. Drawing upon data from a qualitative study with parents of disabled children in the UK, I show the value of meshing ideas and tropes from medical sociology and disability studies to make sense of parents' lived experiences. They described the challenges of living with 'impairment' and a need to readjust expectations. At the same time, parents were keen to not align with a deficit framing of their lives. They talked in affirmative terms about their children as sources of joy and vitality, perceived themselves as 'normal', and described convivial even unremarkable, interactions in public spaces. Yet, parents encountered difficulties when navigating institutional settings and bureaucratic arrangements, or what was commonly referred to as 'the system'. Their troubles were not located in their children's bodies, but in-as per a disability studies sensibility-cultural and structural systems preventing their capacity to live well. I argue that both disability studies and medical sociology offer something to the analysis, thereby recognising the gains of not simply buying into the tradition of one worldview. I conclude by imploring for more concrete conversations between both disciplines.

TI  - Genre Experiments: Thylias Moss's Slave Moth and the Poetic Neo-Slave Narrative
T2  - MELUS
M3  - Article
AB  - As histories of experimentation on the enslaved receive scholarly attention, so too are neo-slave narratives representing and commenting on this aspect of enslavement, in both their content and their form. This article examines Thylias Moss's genre-troubling Slave Moth: A Narrative in Verse (2004), a neo-slave text that depicts an enslaved woman named Varl treated as an object of psychological experimentation. Varl develops a strong subjectivity through becoming a subject performing experiments: aesthetic experiments in how she chooses to represent her narrative in stitched cloths. The subtly experimental poetic devices through which Moss crafts this representation highlight that this protagonist possesses an alternate, generative epistemology that differs meaningfully from her master's scientific worldview and thereby enables fugitive, temporary agency and freedom. By analyzing Slave Moth, I argue that the ethically problematic epistemology that generated experiments on the enslaved has certainly not dissipated and that it indirectly undergirds lyric theory's failure to engage form in texts by nonwhite poets. Through contrasting close attention to formal devices by which Moss undermines teleological narrative, this essay postulates that "lyric time" enables fleeting, yet nevertheless generative, subversions of the formal expectations readers impose on texts representing enslavement. Reading Slave Moth through such a lens suggests potential middle-ground formal alternatives to wholly rejecting either narrative or lyric as genres and to thereby asymptotically approaching adequate representation of enslavement.

TI  - Characterizing past fire occurrence in longleaf pine ecosystems with the Mid-Infrared Burn Index and a Random Forest classifier
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Prior to European settlement the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem covered over 92 million hectares in the southeastern United States. Historically, fire was an important driver of species composition in the longleaf pine ecosystem, but fire exclusion since the early 20th century has led to the degradation of longleaf pine communities and has had a detrimental effect on the large number of rare and endemic species found within this system. Thus, accurate estimates of fire history are important for better informed management of longleaf pine communities. Recently, satellite imagery has been used to identify burned areas. However, results have been inconsistent across physiographic regions and vegetation types (e.g. wetlands under high canopy). We developed a model using Landsat satellite imagery, coupled with a Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm, to identify burned areas and estimate the fire history from 1991 to 2019 for Fort Bragg, NC, one of the largest contiguous areas of longleaf pine ecosystem remaining. We calculated six spectral indices from the Landsat band values, including the Mid-Infrared Burn Index (MIRBI) and the change in MIRBI through time (Delta MIRBI), and used them as predictors in our RF model. We used the developed RF model to estimate the fire history for all known populations of 24 rare upland and wetland plant species found on Fort Bragg. We compared our results to a recent continental U.S. fire occurrence dataset, as well as the prescribed fire records from Fort Bragg. The overall AUC (area under the curve) for our RF model (0.74) compared favorably to the continental U.S. dataset results for Fort Bragg (0.69), and was able to capture the reduced fire frequency in wetlands. The most important predictor in our RF model was Delta MIRBI. Depending on the model, individual plant species were estimated to have experienced significant differences in fire frequency relative to the prescribed fire records. For our RF model, we estimated that 50% of wetland and 25% of upland species experienced a lower fire frequency relative to that represented in the prescribed fire records. The burn probability and classification tool generated in this paper provides land managers in the southeastern U.S. with a novel approach for accurately identifying burned areas and estimating local fire frequency across landscapes.

TI  - Detecting ecological spatial-temporal changes by Remote Sensing Ecological Index with local adaptability
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological environmental assessment is an indispensable part of the eco-environment protection system. As researchers have increasingly focused on ecological environment protection, the ecological environment evaluation system has been gradually improved. The enhancement of the ecological environment evaluation system provides more scientific and effective data support for ecological environment monitoring and governance. This article examines the Wuhan Urban Development Zone as an example, selects Landsat 8 (Operational Land Imager/Thermal Infrared Sensor (OLI/TIRS)) images of the study area from 2013 to 2019 at two-year intervals, and applies a new type of ecological environment evaluation index named the remote sensing ecological index with local adaptability (RSEILA) to assess the eco-environment. The RSEILA represents an improvement of the remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) proposed in 2013. The RSEILA enhancement is mainly reflected in the correlation and spatial distribution characteristics between geographical elements. The results reveal that 1) the overall urban ecological environment in the Wuhan Urban Development Zone demonstrates a downward trend from 2013 to 2019, and the rate of decline during the period varies. 2) RSEILA decline is mainly found in the far suburbs, and ecological environment degradation mainly occurs due to the change in land-use type caused by the suburbanization process of urban expansion. 3) Because of the implementation of urban greening projects, the phenomenon of ecological environment optimization (green recovery) is observed in the central urban area of Wuhan. 4) Land use exhibits a notable correlation with the ecological environment, and different land-use types exhibit distinct degrees of ecological environment deterioration. The order of deterioration is: bare soil/sand > building > cropland > forests.

TI  - Mission as conversion
T2  - MISSIOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This is a reflection on my experience of being an expatriate Jesuit missionary to Zambia from 1972 to 2005. It traces the development of the notion of mission as it shifts from a narrow denominational conception of conversion to being more ecumenical and inclusive of other religious viewpoints. In reviewing this, the ideal of conversion was seen to mean colonization of the other. To counteract this, another understanding of conversion is proposed where the integrity and distinctiveness of those converted are acknowledged, as is the impartiality of the missionary. This places mission as conversion in a new key and enables the missionary to face today's multifaith world, rooted in his/her worldview, yet open to the other.

TI  - Decadal gross level assessment of green and blue consumptive water use over Indian agro-ecosystems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of consumptive water use (CWU) and water productivity at the regional scale is important to diagnose vulnerable zones to improve water use efficiencies in cropland to achieve the sustainable development goal 6.0 prescribed by the United Nations. The present study was carried out to segregate and quantify CWU into agricultural green (CWUg) and blue (CWUb) water use and water productivity (AWP) on seasonal, annual, and decadal (2009-2018) scales over the Indian region using satellite remote-sensing data from geostationary and polar-orbiting platforms. A logical algorithm was used to determine partitioned water use from a combination of satellite-based estimates of key variables such as agricultural water demand (AWD), actual evapotranspiration (ETa), and effective rainfall (ER). Satellite-based estimates of CWU were evaluated with respect to ground reference that showed underestimation of the order of 15-32% but with a strong Pearson's correlation coefficient (r = 0.80-0.99) and coefficient of determination (R (2) = 0.64-0.98). The reasons for this difference and uncertainties in satellite-based inputs have been explained. The decadal mean of CWU at annual scale showed wide spatial variation over India with 84% and 16% share of CWUg and CWUb, respectively, in kharif season and 27% and 73%, respectively, in rabi season. A non-significant increasing trend in CWUg,kharif (0.57%) and a decreasing trend in CWUb,kharif (-5.18%), CWUg,rabi (-2.81%), and CWUb,rabi (-1.77%) were observed over 10 years. A decreasing trend in green AWP (AWP(g)) (-0.18%) in kharif season reveals a lack of sustainable adoption of green water management practices while a significantly increasing trend in AWP(b) (2.65%) in rabi season reveals sustainable adoption of efficient irrigation management practices over 10 years. These long-term estimates would help in smoothing out trade-offs of water use versus water productivity, reducing the vulnerability and aiding in decision-making for water savings, controlled water allocation, strategic policy formulations for water, and food security especially through sustainable management practices in rainfed agriculture.

TI  - Altered regulation of DPF3, a member of the SWI/SNF complexes, underlies the 14q24 renal cancer susceptibility locus
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Our study investigated the underlying mechanism for the 14q24 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) susceptibility risk locus identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS). The sentinel single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4903064, at 14q24 confers an allele-specific effect on expression of the double PHD fingers 3 (DPF3) of the BAF SWI/SNF complex as assessed by massively parallel reporter assay, confirmatory luciferase assays, and eQTL analyses. Overexpression of DPF3 in renal cell lines increases growth rates and alters chromatin accessibility and gene expression, leading to inhibition of apoptosis and activation of oncogenic pathways. siRNA interference of multiple DPF3-deregulated genes reduces growth. Our results indicate that germline variation in DPF3, a component of the BAF complex, part of the SWI/SNF complexes, can lead to reduced apoptosis and activation of the STAT3 pathway, both critical in RCC carcinogenesis. In addition, we show that altered DPF3 expression in the 14q24 RCC locus could influence the effectiveness of immunotherapy treatment for RCC by regulating tumor cytokine secretion and immune cell activation.

TI  - Mapping soil organic carbon in Tuscany through the statistical combination of ground observations with ancillary and remote sensing data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - The organic carbon stored in the topsoil is an essential component of the global carbon cycle which should be quantified for a variety of purposes. The current paper proposes a new approach to map the amount of organic carbon stored in the 0.3 m topsoil (SOC), based on the statistical combination of a large number of ground observations with ancillary and remote sensing data. This approach is applied and tested in Tuscany, a region of Central Italy that is characterised by extremely diversified and heterogeneous environmental features. More than 3500 soil samples were collected and made available for the purpose, together with a soil map, meteorological data, a land use map and MODIS Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) imagery. This information was processed by advanced statistical methods to yield a final map which describes the SOC spatial distribution in the region with a spatial resolution of 250 m. The map well reproduces the SOC variability in the region, showing higher SOC values for forests with respect to grasslands and croplands and SOC peaks related to peats and acidic soils. The accuracy assessment, carried out both versus all ground observations and by a leave-one-out cross validation strategy, testifies to the high quality of the SOC map, which has a global RMSE comprised between 17.5 and 32.3 t ha(-1). The map is also accompanied by per-pixel estimates of error variance which are informative on the uncertainty of SOC prediction.

TI  - Profile, treatment patterns, and influencing factors of anthracycline use in breast cancer patients in China: A nation-wide multicenter study
T2  - CANCER MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Anthracycline-based chemotherapy (ABC) is one of the standard therapies against breast cancer. However, few guidelines are currently available to optimize the use of ABC. Therefore, the present analysis aimed at determining the profile and treatment patterns of ABC and the association of clinicopathological characteristics with ABC selection. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the data of a nation-wide multicenter epidemiological study, which collected the medical records of breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in different settings from seven geographic regions in China (NCT03047889). Results In total, 3393 patients were included, with 2917 treated with ABC. Among them, 553 (89.8%), 2165 (81.7%), and 814 (25.7%) were subjected to ABC as neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and advanced chemotherapy, respectively. The most frequently used regimens were anthracycline-taxane-based combinations for neo- and adjuvant chemotherapy, along with taxanes and oral fluorouracils for the palliative stages. In the overall cohort, patients aged < 40 or 40-65 (p < 0.001), in premenopause (p < 0.001), without comorbidities (p = 0.016), with invasive ductal carcinoma (p= 0.001), high lymph node involvement (p < 0.001), in the pTNM stage II, III, or IV versus stage I (p < 0.001), subjected to mastectomy (p < 0.001) or subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy combined with axillary lymph node dissection (p = 0.044), or with a decreased disease-free survival (p < 0.001) were more likely to be recommended to ABC. Conclusion Taken together, ABC remained the mainstay of breast cancer treatment, especially in neo and adjuvant therapy. ABC was mainly used as a combination therapy, and the correlation between influencing factors and ABC choice varied during different settings, indicating the preference and different perspectives of medication considered by medical oncologists regarding the use ABC in China.

TI  - Quantitative prioritization of potentially critical glacial Lakes in the Indus River basin using satellite derived parameters
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) in a deglaciating environment, representing significant threat to downstream people and infrastructure, increasing the necessity of prioritization and assessment of potentially critical glacial lakes (PCGLs). In this current study, a comprehensive updated inventory of glacial lakes for the Indus River basin has been prepared, resulting in 5335 lakes (>= 0.0025 +/- 0.0006 km(2)), covering a total area of 173.95 +/- 10.13 km(2). Parameters have been derived using satellite data for two purposes, 'preliminary screening' and 'quantitative assessment'. Using 4 parameters, 367 lakes were preliminary screened-in for further analysis, and 6 quantitative parameters were analysed using Equal Weights (EW) and Unequal Weights methods (UEW). These both methods were applied for two scenarios, scenario-1 which considers 73 lakes (>= 0.1 km(2)), and scenario-2 which considers all 367 preliminary screened-in lakes (>= 0.02 km(2)). UEW outperformed EW analysis and identified 20 and 48 high potential lakes for scenario-1 and scenario-2 respectively, where all 20 lakes of scenario-1 have been found in common with those of scenario-2, with a difference in their rank. But only 10 of them have storage volume >= 10 MCM and has been flagged as high-risk lakes, of which 6 are end-moraine dammed lakes and have been considered as PCGLs, due to their high bursting potential and self-destructive nature. Rest 4 high risk lakes along with remaining 38 lakes with volume < 10 MCM, are considered as critical lakes in case of dynamic mode of failure, caused due to mass movement of avalanche, landslide, heavy precipitation, etc.

TI  - Statistical Comparison of Melting Iceberg Backscatter Embedded in Sea Ice and Open Water Using RADARSAT-2 Images of the Newfoundland Sea
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates and compares polarimetric signatures of icebergs embedded in sea ice and icebergs in open water. The main objective is to study on the backscatter properties of melting iceberg and to check on whether there is any distinguishable property in them in the case of different background clutter conditions (i.e. sea ice and open water). This study results will improve the potential of iceberg detection using radar polarimetry. RADARSAT-2 images have been used for the analysis acquired over locations near the coastline (approximately 3-35 km) of the island of Newfoundland. For analysis, polarimetry parameters, such as co-(HH) and cross-(HV) polarization and several popular decomposition techniques, specifically Pauli, Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi, Cloud-Pottier, and van Zyl, have been used to determine the polarimetric signatures of icebergs and sea ice. The statistical hypothesis T-test has been applied to achieve a precise comparison among backscatters from different icebergs groups. Statistical results tend to show a dominant surface scattering mechanism for icebergs in all types of clutter conditions. Moreover, icebergs in open water produce larger volume scatter than icebergs in sea ice, whereas icebergs in sea ice produce larger surface scatter than icebergs in open water.

TI  - Coastline extraction from ALOS-2 satellite SAR images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous monitoring of a shore plays an essential role in designing strategies for shore protection against erosion. To avoid the effect of clouds and sunlight, satellite-based imagery with synthetic aperture radar is used to provide the required data. In contrast to standard model-driven methods, we present a deep-learning-based approach to detect coastlines in such data. We split the process into data preprocessing, model training, inference, ensembling, and postprocessing and describe the best techniques for each of the parts. To deal with a small training dataset, we propose a novel multi-sample mosaicing augmentation that helps the deep neural network models to reduce overfitting during training. Our solution has been validated against the real Global Positioning System location of coastlines during a worldwide competition organized by Signate and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, where it was runner-up among 109 teams from the whole world.

TI  - A standardized dataset of built-up areas of China's cities with populations over 300,000 for the period 1990-2015
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - China's urbanization has attracted a lot of attention due to its unprecedented pace and intensity in terms of land, population, and economic impact. However, due to the lack of consistent and harmonized data, little is known about the patterns and dynamics of the interaction between these different aspects over the past few decades. Along with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, a standardized dataset for assessing the sustainability of urbanization in China is needed. In this paper, we used remote sensing data from multiple sources (time-series of Landsat and Sentinel images) to map the impervious surface area (ISA) at five-year intervals from 1990 to 2015 and then converted the results into a standardized dataset of the built-up area for 433 Chinese cities with 300,000 inhabitants or more. This dataset was produced following the well-established rules adopted by the United Nations (UN). Validation of the ISA maps in urban areas based on the visual interpretation of Google Earth images showed that the average overall accuracy (OA), producer's accuracy (PA) and user's accuracy (UA) were 91.24%, 92.58% and 89.65%, respectively. Comparisons with other existing urban built-up area datasets derived from the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the World Bank and UN-habitat indicated that our dataset, namely the standardized urban built-up area dataset for China (SUBAD-China), provides an improved description of the spatiotemporal characteristics of the urbanization process and is especially applicable to a combined analysis of the spatial and socio-economic domains in urban areas. Potential applications of this dataset include combining the spatial expansion and demographic information provided by UN to calculate sustainable development indicators such as SDG 11.3.1. The dataset could also be used in other multidimensional syntheses related to the study of urbanization in China. The published dataset is available at http://www.doi.org/10.11922/sciencedb.j00076.00004.

TI  - Applicability of Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor for identifying submarine groundwater discharge springs in the Mediterranean Sea basin
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has received increasing attention over the past 2 decades as a source of nutrients, trace elements and ocean pollutants that may alter coastal biogeochemical cycles. Assessing SGD flows and their impact on coastal marine environments is a difficult task, since it is not easy to identify and measure these water flows discharging into the sea. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the significant usefulness of the freely available thermal infrared (TIR) imagery of the Landsat 8 thermal infrared sensor (TIRS) as an exploratory tool for identifying SGD springs worldwide, from local to regional scales, for long-term analysis. The use of satellite thermal data as a technique for identifying SGD springs in seawater is based on the identification of thermally anomalous plumes obtained from the thermal contrasts between groundwater and sea surface water. In this study, we use the TIR remote sensing (TIRRS) imagery provided by Landsat 8 at a regional scale and discuss the principle limiting factors of using this technique in SGD studies. The study was developed in karstic coastal aquifers in the Mediterranean Sea basin during different seasons and under diverse meteorological conditions. Although this study demonstrates that freely available satellite TIR remote sensing is a useful method for identifying coastal springs in karst aquifers both locally and regionally, the limiting factors include technical limitations, geological and hydrogeological characteristics, environmental and marine conditions and coastal geomorphology.

TI  - JEWISH ORTHODOXY'S FIRST RABBINICAL CONFERENCE
T2  - MODERN JUDAISM
M3  - Article
AB  - The early stages in the formation of the movement that would subsequently become known as Jewish Orthodoxy have been well researched. This article, however, reviews the circumstances around a specific episode, a rabbinical conference held in Paks, Hungary, in 1844. The review of this failed conference opens the door for a discussion on three key questions related to the understanding of Jewish Orthodoxy: (a) Why were the Hungarian rabbis the first to react to religious reforms? (b) Why did they become so instrumental in the establishment of Jewish Orthodoxy? and (c) Why, despite this, Orthodoxy practically lost the war against modernism, religious reforms, and secularism. Analyzing the reasons for the conference's failure suggests that Jewish Orthodoxy, which is committed to a traditionalist worldview, contains a major intrinsic flaw. Hailing conservatism also implies rejecting initiatives based on modern modes of operation. This, however, undermined Jewish Orthodoxy's capability to swiftly and decisively confront the numerous social and religious challenges it has faced since the early nineteenth century. The Paks conference was convened in response to several conferences of modernized rabbis that led to the establishment of the Reform Movement; its failure allowed the Reform movement to expand without any significant resistance on behalf of the more conservative rabbis, who remained unorganized for many years.

TI  - Using sentinel-2 observations to assess the consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown on winter cropping in Bothaville and Harrismith, South Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The novel coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related lockdown regulations have impacted socio-economic activities, the environment, and human health. Generally, the decision to plant is mostly affected by meteorological conditions, such as rainfall. In contrast, the crop condition depends on management practices such as fertilizer applications and irrigation, in addition to meteorological conditions. However, COVID-19 lockdown regulations restricted the mobility and operation of certain sectors. Consequently, COVID-19 implications on food security are related to trade, transportation and export, farm employment, and incomes. However, its implications on winter cropping are yet unknown. We assessed the effect of COVID-19 on the 2020 winter cropping season, using Sentinel-2 data and Google Earth Engine (GEE) in semi-arid agricultural areas of South Africa. The results indicate lower planted areas at both sites during the COVID-19 year relative to the reference year (2019), i.e., a Decrease Ratio of 0.71 (Bothaville) and 0.30 (Harrismith), respectively. An analysis of winter meteorological conditions showed no significant difference in precipitation between 2020 and 2019, indicating that strict COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, introduced before the start-of-the-season, influenced farmers' planting decisions.

Evidence drawn from over 25 interviews with yeshivish and hasidic lay leaders, school administrators, magazine publishers, and community members presents a nuanced portrait of attitudes toward, and ideologies regarding, the State of Israel. Although historically and sociologically Zionism has been seen as a key issue distinguishing modern and haredi Jewish communities, this distinction may lie more at the level of ideological affirmation, rather than actual behavior, knowledge, or belief.

M3  - Article
AB  - A novel artificial intelligence (AI) technique that uses machine learning (ML) methodologies combines several algorithms, which were developed by ThetaRay, Inc., is applied to NASA's Transiting Exoplanets Survey Satellite (TESS) dataset to identify exoplanetary candidates. The AI/ML ThetaRay system is trained initially with Kepler exoplanetary data and validated with confirmed exoplanets before its application to TESS data. Existing and new features of the data, based on various observational parameters, are constructed and used in the AI/ML analysis by employing semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques. By the application of ThetaRay system to 10,803 light curves of threshold crossing events (TCEs) produced by the TESS mission, obtained from the Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes, the algorithm yields about 50 targets for further analysis, and we uncover three new exoplanetary candidates by further manual vetting. This study demonstrates for the first time the successful application of the particular combined multiple AI/ML-based methodologies to a large astrophysical dataset for rapid automated classification of TCEs.

TI  - An enhanced approach for informal settlement extraction from optical data using morphological profile-guided filters: A case study of madurai city
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Informal settlements are now becoming an unavoidable and growing phenomenon in the global south, whose locations are inappropriate in official statistics and maps. The distinctive spectral signature of informal settlements in high-resolution optical images causes difficulties in finding automatic approaches. This paper investigates the Multi-Shape Multi-Size Morphological Profile-Guided filter (MShMSiMP-GF) approach for detecting the informal settlements from high-resolution optical images. The development of the proposed approach was inspired by the Superpixel-based Guided Filter (SGF) approach, which uses superpixels to construct the guidance image. Though the superpixel based guidance image extracts detailed contextual information (scale, size), it fails to model geometrical information (shapes, structures) in an image. In order to incorporate the geometrical information, the MShMSiMP-GF approach generates multi-shape multi-size morphological profiles with increasing radius of guided filters. Quantitative and qualitative results of the proposed approach are investigated by four different images of Madurai city, India acquired by Kompsat-2 and WorldView-2 sensors. From the classified maps, it is observed that the proposed MShMSiMP-GF approach achieves an overall accuracy of 91.37%, 90.19%, 93.46% and 99.36% for the subsets 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

TI  - Children's Disaster Trauma in Haiti: Configurations of Similarities and Dissimilarities in Experiences
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2010 earthquake in Haiti, an urgent crisis, occurred in the context of persistent social dysfunctions, amplifying both the chronic poor living conditions and adversities for children and families. The present study sought to gain better understanding of the ways Haitian children respond during times of adversity. The House-Tree-Person (HTP) drawing test, culturally adapted for Haitians (Roysircar et al., 2017, 2019a, 2019b), was used to assess Resilience and Vulnerability in 75 Haitian children's 225 drawings to map the spatial configurations of their trauma experiences in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake and continuous trauma. Assessment data also included interviews with child self-report measures of self-esteem perceived by self, peers, and family; posttraumatic symptoms; and self-concept. Data analyses involved standardization of sample scores and reliability tests. Classical multidimensional scaling (MDS) examined relationships among variables of resilience, vulnerability, self-esteem, posttraumatic symptoms, and self-concept. MDS stress was reduced considerably with two dimensions, and there was minimal further reduction in stress with three or more dimensions. Furthermore, the two latent dimensions in Haitian children's mental health, called Feeling Unloved and Balance of Good and Evil, were interpretable within the conceptualization of the study and the literature on Haitians' and other disaster survivors' adaptive worldview. The authors' long-term investment in the people of Haiti increased trust, participation, research rigor, and cultural alignment of interventions, including the adaption of the HTP as a culturally sensitive and clinically useful instrument.

TI  - The contribution of insects to global forest deadwood decomposition
T2  - NATURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The amount of carbon stored in deadwood is equivalent to about 8 per cent of the global forest carbon stocks(1). The decomposition of deadwood is largely governed by climate(2-5) with decomposer groups-such as microorganisms and insects-contributing to variations in the decomposition rates(2,6,7). At the global scale, the contribution of insects to the decomposition of deadwood and carbon release remains poorly understood(7). Here we present a field experiment of wood decomposition across 55 forest sites and 6 continents. We find that the deadwood decomposition rates increase with temperature, and the strongest temperature effect is found at high precipitation levels. Precipitation affects the decomposition rates negatively at low temperatures and positively at high temperatures. As a net effect-including the direct consumption by insects and indirect effects through interactions with microorganisms-insects accelerate the decomposition in tropical forests (3.9% median mass loss per year). In temperate and boreal forests, we find weak positive and negative effects with a median mass loss of 0.9 per cent and -0.1 per cent per year, respectively. Furthermore, we apply the experimentally derived decomposition function to a global map of deadwood carbon synthesized from empirical and remote-sensing data, obtaining an estimate of 10.9 +/- 3.2 petagram of carbon per year released from deadwood globally, with 93 per cent originating from tropical forests. Globally, the net effect of insects may account for 29 per cent of the carbon flux from deadwood, which suggests a functional importance of insects in the decomposition of deadwood and the carbon cycle.Multi-year field experiments across six continents suggest that insects have an important contribution to decomposition and carbon release from forest deadwood.

TI  - Anatomy of the Dorsomedial Cutaneous Nerve to Hallux and Surgical Implications According to the Severity of Hallux Valgus Deformity: A Cadaveric Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF FOOT & ANKLE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dorsomedial cutaneous nerve to hallux provides sensation to the dorsomedial aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint and hallux. Postoperative damage to the dorsomedial cutaneous nerve to hallux have been reported with the dorsomedial approach and symptoms can be very debilitating. The present study aims to understand how the distance between this nerve and the extensor hallucis longus tendon are affected by the severity of the hallux valgus deformity, at the level of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. We performed a cadaveric study using 35 cadaveric lower extremities (N = 35). Each specimen was classified according to the hallux valgus severity through a 30 kg partial weight-bearing antero-posterior radiograph. Before dissection, the lower extremities' greater saphenous vein was injected with black latex to simplify the distinction between anatomical structures. We concluded that as the hallux valgus angle and the first intermetatarsal angle increase, the distance between the dorsomedial cutaneous nerve to hallux and the extensor hallucis longus tendon also increases, ranging from 12 mm in normal feet to 19 mm in severely deformed feet. Hallux valgus is a three-dimensional deformity that changes traditional surgical landmarks. To avoid harming this nerve, we established a danger zone ranging from 12 mm to 19 mm medial from the extensor hallucis longus tendon, at the level of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The mid-medial approach to MTP should be preferred as it is out of the danger zone. (c) 2021 by the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. All rights reserved.

TI  - Deep machine learning with Sentinel satellite data to map paddy rice production stages across West Java, Indonesia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Indonesia recently implemented a novel, technology-driven approach for conducting agricultural production surveys, which involves monthly observations at many thousands of strategic locations and automated data logging via a cellular phone application. Data from these comprehensive field surveys offer immense value for advancing remote sensing technology to map crop production across Indonesia, particularly through the development of machine learning approaches to relate survey data with satellite imagery. The objective of this study was to compare different machine learning scenarios for classifying and mapping the temporal progression of paddy rice production stages across West Java, Indonesia using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical remote sensing data from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. Monthly paddy rice survey data at 21,696 locations across West Java from November 2018 through April 2019 were used for model training and testing. Five classes related to rice production stage or other field conditions were defined, including rice at tillering, heading, and harvest stages, rice fields with little to no vegetation present, and non-rice areas. A recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short term memory (LSTM) nodes provided optimal performance with classification accuracies of 79.6% and 75.9% for model training and testing, respectively, and reduced computational effort. Other approaches that incorporated a convolutional neural network (CNN) either reduced classification accuracy or increased computational effort. Deep machine learning methods (RNN and CNN) generally outperformed other non-deep classifiers, which achieved up to 63.3% accuracy for model testing. Classification accuracies were optimized by inputting two Sentinel-1 channels (VH and VV polarizations) and ten Sentinel-2 channels. Temporal patterns of paddy rice production stages were consistent between the monthly ground-based agricultural survey data and 10-m, satellite-based rice classification maps obtained by applying the LSTM-based RNN across West Java. The results demonstrated the value of combining modern agricultural survey data, satellite remote sensing, and a recurrent neural network to develop multitemporal maps of paddy rice production stages.

TI  - Radiation scattering effects in the processing of optical quantitative remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerospace optical remote sensing is an effective information technology that retrieves physical characteristics of ground objects. With the development of multi-mode payloads and the fusion of multi-source information in spaceborne remote sensing technology, the demand for quantitative and accurate information has raised a series of new issues on information chain technology, and it has also shown great prospects for remote sensing applications. Optical remote sensing image is the basic carrier of feature information. The effect of remote sensing applications largely depends on the image quality. Therefore, improving the imaging quality is of great significance for remote sensing applications. In this letter, the scatter radiation transfer process of the imaging system has been analysed; working principle of scattering imaging in the earth observation process has been introduced, the influence of scatter radiation transfer on remote sensing image quality has been discussed, and the factors of image radiation accuracy has been specified.

TI  - The effect of national protest in Ecuador on PM pollution
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter (PM) accounts for millions of premature deaths in the human population every year. Due to social and economic inequality, growing human dissatisfaction manifests in waves of strikes and protests all over the world, causing paralysis of institutions, services and circulation of transport. In this study, we aim to investigate air quality in Ecuador during the national protest of 2019, by studying the evolution of PM2.5 (PM <= 2.5 mu m) concentrations in Ecuador and its capital city Quito using ground based and satellite data. Apart from analyzing the PM2.5 evolution over time to trace the pollution changes, we employ machine learning techniques to estimate these changes relative to the business-as-usual pollution scenario. In addition, we present a chemical analysis of plant samples from an urban park housing the strike. Positive impact on regional air quality was detected for Ecuador, and an overall-10.75 +/- 17.74% reduction of particulate pollution in the capital during the protest. However, barricade burning PM peaks may contribute to a release of harmful heavy metals (tire manufacture components such as Co, Cr, Zn, Al, Fe, Pb, Mg, Ba and Cu), which might be of short- and long-term health concerns.

TI  - Multi-Object Segmentation in Complex Urban Scenes from High-Resolution Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial features extraction, such as roads and buildings from aerial images using an automatic system, has many usages in an extensive range of fields, including disaster management, change detection, land cover assessment, and urban planning. This task is commonly tough because of complex scenes, such as urban scenes, where buildings and road objects are surrounded by shadows, vehicles, trees, etc., which appear in heterogeneous forms with lower inter-class and higher intra-class contrasts. Moreover, such extraction is time-consuming and expensive to perform by human specialists manually. Deep convolutional models have displayed considerable performance for feature segmentation from remote sensing data in the recent years. However, for the large and continuous area of obstructions, most of these techniques still cannot detect road and building well. Hence, this work's principal goal is to introduce two novel deep convolutional models based on UNet family for multi-object segmentation, such as roads and buildings from aerial imagery. We focused on buildings and road networks because these objects constitute a huge part of the urban areas. The presented models are called multi-level context gating UNet (MCG-UNet) and bi-directional ConvLSTM UNet model (BCL-UNet). The proposed methods have the same advantages as the UNet model, the mechanism of densely connected convolutions, bi-directional ConvLSTM, and squeeze and excitation module to produce the segmentation maps with a high resolution and maintain the boundary information even under complicated backgrounds. Additionally, we implemented a basic efficient loss function called boundary-aware loss (BAL) that allowed a network to concentrate on hard semantic segmentation regions, such as overlapping areas, small objects, sophisticated objects, and boundaries of objects, and produce high-quality segmentation maps. The presented networks were tested on the Massachusetts building and road datasets. The MCG-UNet improved the average F1 accuracy by 1.85%, and 1.19% and 6.67% and 5.11% compared with UNet and BCL-UNet for road and building extraction, respectively. Additionally, the presented MCG-UNet and BCL-UNet networks were compared with other state-of-the-art deep learning-based networks, and the results proved the superiority of the networks in multi-object segmentation tasks.

TI  - Comprehensive Analysis of Coastal Dynamics in Cirebon Coastal Area (CCA), Indonesia
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cirebon Coastal Area (CCA), which covers Cirebon City and Cirebon District, is an area located on the north coast of Java Island, Indonesia. The area was among the coastal areas with a high-density population in Indonesia. Human activities in this area, which are dominated by industries, fisheries, and agriculture, strongly influenced the coastal environmental conditions. One of the effective and accurate ways to monitor the coastal environmental conditions is to utilize remote sensing technology which has grown significantly in recent years. Although various studies have been conducted, different results were shown and indicated that the coastal dynamics in CCA were not fully understood yet. This research provides comprehensive analysis with the aim to comprehend the complete pattern of coastal dynamics in CCA. Analysis of coastal dynamics has been carried out by using a combination of Landsat and Google Earth data. This robust combination allowed to cover a longtime span (1996-2020), periodic, and high-resolution data analysis Results indicated that along the CCA shoreline the accretion was dominated rather than the erosion. While on the eastern area showed more dynamic changes rather than the western area, especially at Losari, Pangenan, and Lemahwungkuk sub-districts.

TI  - Using the California Waterfowl Tracker to Assess Proximity of Waterfowl to Commercial Poultry in the Central Valley of California
T2  - AVIAN DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Migratory waterfowl are the primary reservoir of avian influenza viruses (AIV), which can be spread to commercial poultry. Surveillance efforts that track the location and abundance of wild waterfowl and link those data to inform assessments of risk and sampling for AIV currently do not exist. To assist surveillance and minimize poultry exposure to AIV, here we explored the utility of Remotely Sensed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite imagery in combination with landbased climate measurements (e.g., temperature and precipitation) to predict waterfowl location and abundance in near real-time in the California Central Valley (CCV), where both wild waterfowl and domestic poultry are densely located. Specifically, remotely collected MODIS and climate data were integrated into a previously developed boosted regression tree (BRT) model to predict and visualize waterfowl distributions across the CCV. Daily model-based predictions are publicly available during the winter as part of the dynamic California Waterfowl Tracker (CWT) web app hosted on the University of California's Cooperative Extension webpage. In this study, we analyzed 52 days of model predictions and produced daily spatiotemporal maps of waterfowl concentrations near the 605 commercial poultry farms in the CCV during January and February of 2019. Exposure of each poultry farm to waterfowl during each day was classified as high, medium, low, or none, depending on the density of waterfowl within 4 km of a farm. Results indicated that farms were at substantially greater risk of exposure in January, when CCV waterfowl populations peak, than in February. For example, during January, 33% (199/605) of the farms were exposed for >= 1 day to high waterfowl density vs. 19% (115/605) of the farms in February. In addition to demonstrating the overall variability of waterfowl location and density, these data demonstrate how remote sensing can be used to better triage AIV surveillance and biosecurity efforts via the utilization of a functional web app-based tool. The ability to leverage remote sensing is an integral advancement toward improving AIV surveillance in waterfowl in close proximity to commercial poultry. Expansion of these types of remote sensing methods, linked to a user-friendly web tool, could be further developed across the continental United States. The BRT model incorporated into the CWT reflects a first attempt to give an accurate representation of waterfowl distribution and density relative to commercial poultry.

TI  - An Improved Version of the Generalized Laplacian Pyramid Algorithm for Pansharpening
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial resolution of multispectral data can be synthetically improved by exploiting the spatial content of a companion panchromatic image. This process, named pansharpening, is widely employed by data providers to augment the quality of images made available for many applications. The huge demand requires the utilization of efficient fusion algorithms that do not require specific training phases, but rather exploit physical considerations to combine the available data. For this reason, classical model-based approaches are still widely used in practice. We created and assessed a method for improving a widespread approach, based on the generalized Laplacian pyramid decomposition, by combining two different cost-effective upgrades: the estimation of the detail-extraction filter from data and the utilization of an improved injection scheme based on multilinear regression. The proposed method was compared with several existing efficient pansharpening algorithms, employing the most credited performance evaluation protocols. The capability of achieving optimal results in very different scenarios was demonstrated by employing data acquired by the IKONOS and WorldView-3 satellites.

TI  - Assessing the Impacts of Rising Sea Level on Coastal Morpho-Dynamics with Automated High-Frequency Shoreline Mapping Using Multi-Sensor Optical Satellites
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising sea level is generally assumed and widely reported to be the significant driver of coastal erosion of most low-lying sandy beaches globally. However, there is limited data-driven evidence of this relationship due to the challenges in quantifying shoreline dynamics at the same temporal scale as sea-level records. Using a Google Earth Engine (GEE)-enabled Python toolkit, this study conducted shoreline dynamic analysis using high-frequency data sampling to analyze the impact of sea-level rise on the Malaysian coastline between 1993 and 2019. Instantaneous shorelines were extracted from a test site on Teluk Nipah Island and 21 tide gauge sites from the combined Landsat 5-8 and Sentinel 2 images using an automated shoreline-detection method, which was based on supervised image classification and sub-pixel border segmentation. The results indicated that rising sea level is contributing to shoreline erosion in the study area, but is not the only driver of shoreline displacement. The impacts of high population density, anthropogenic activities, and longshore sediment transportation on shoreline displacement were observed in some of the beaches. The conclusions of this study highlight that the synergistic use of multi-sensor remotesensing data improves temporal resolution of shoreline detection, removes short-term variability, and reduces uncertainties in satellite-derived shoreline analysis compared to the low-frequency sampling approach.

TI  - Classification of Plant Ecological Units in Heterogeneous Semi-Steppe Rangelands: Performance Assessment of Four Classification Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant Ecological Unit's (PEUs) are the abstraction of vegetation communities that occur on a site which similarly respond to management actions and natural disturbances. Identification and monitoring of PEUs in a heterogeneous landscape is the most difficult task in medium resolution satellite images datasets. The main objective of this study is to compare pixel-based classification versus object-based classification for accurately classifying PEUs with four selected different algorithms across heterogeneous rangelands in Central Zagros, Iran. We used images of Landsat-8 OLI that were pan-sharpened to 15 m to classify four PEU classes based on a random dataset collected in the field (40%). In the first stage, we applied the following classification algorithms to distinguish PEUs: Minimum Distance (MD), Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC), Neural Network-Multi Layer Perceptron (NN-MLP) and Classification Tree Analysis (CTA) for pixel based method and object based method. Then, by using the most accurate classification approach, in the second stage auxiliary data (Principal Component Analysis (PCA)) was incorporated to improve the accuracy of the PEUs classification process. At the end, test data (60%) were used for accuracy assessment of the resulting maps. Object-based maps clearly outperformed pixel-based maps, especially with CTA, NN-MLP and MD algorithms with overall accuracies of 86%, 72% and 59%, respectively. The MLC algorithm did not reveal any significant difference between the object-based and pixel-based analyses. Finally, complementing PCA auxiliary bands to the CTA algorithms offered the most successful PEUs classification strategy, with the highest overall accuracy (89%). The results clearly underpin the importance of object-based classification with the CTA classifier together with PCA auxiliary data to optimize identification of PEU classes.

TI  - Repeat injection following sentinel node nonvisualization on lymphoscintigraphy images can decrease axillary dissection rate in breast cancer patients
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Sentinel node biopsy is considered the standard of care in early-stage breast cancer patients. In the current study, we evaluated the effect of radiotracer reinjection in the case of sentinel node nonvisualization on preoperative lymphoscintigraphy. Materials and methods Between March 2017 and March 2020, 1850 early-stage breast cancer patients were referred for sentinel node mapping. All patients received a single injected activity of Tc-99m Phytate intradermally in the periareolar area of the index lesion using an insulin syringe. Lymphoscintigraphy images of the patients were done 1-2 h postinjection. Between March 2017 and September 2017, sentinel node nonvisualization was reported to the surgeon, and for the rest of the study period, the patients received another injected activity of the radiotracer, and immediately, other lymphoscintigraphy images were taken (with the same parameters). Results A total of 255 patients entered our study. Fifty-five patients were in group I without any reinjection. The remainder of the patients were in group II. In 155 out of 200 patients of group II, a sentinel node could be visualized following reinjection of the radiotracer. The detection rate was 15 out of 45 and 15 out of 55 in group I and patients without sentinel node visualization even after reinjection, respectively. Axilla was involved in 5 out of 40 (12.5%) patients in group I with intraoperative sentinel node mapping failure. On the other hand, axilla was involved in 27 out of 30 (90%) group II patients with sentinel node nonvisualization. Conclusion Reinjection of the tracer in cases of no sentinel node visualization in lymphoscintigraphy for breast cancer increases the detection rate of sentinel nodes, and therefore a high number of unnecessary axillary lymph node dissections can be avoided.

TI  - A Synthesis of Spatial Forest Assessment Studies Using Remote Sensing Data and Techniques in Pakistan
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Review
AB  - This paper synthesizes research studies on spatial forest assessment and mapping using remote sensing data and techniques in Pakistan. The synthesis states that 73 peer-reviewed research articles were published in the past 28 years (1993-2021). Out of all studies, three were conducted in Azad Jammu & Kashmir, one in Balochistan, three in Gilgit-Baltistan, twelve in Islamabad Capital Territory, thirty-one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, six in Punjab, ten in Sindh, and the remaining seven studies were conducted on national/regional scales. This review discusses the remote sensing classification methods, algorithms, published papers' citations, limitations, and challenges of forest mapping in Pakistan. The literature review suggested that the supervised image classification method and maximum likelihood classifier were among the most frequently used image classification and classification algorithms. The review also compared studies before and after the 18th constitutional amendment in Pakistan. Very few studies were conducted before this constitutional amendment, while a steep increase was observed afterward. The image classification accuracies of published papers were also assessed on local, regional, and national scales. The spatial forest assessment and mapping in Pakistan were evaluated only once using active remote sensing data (i.e., SAR). Advanced satellite imageries, the latest tools, and techniques need to be incorporated for forest mapping in Pakistan to facilitate forest stakeholders in managing the forests and undertaking national projects like UN's REDD+ effectively.

TI  - Retrieval of Daily Mean Top-of-Atmosphere Reflected Solar Flux Using the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Instruments
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The records of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instrument observations can resolve the current lack of a long global climate data record of Reflected Solar Flux (RSF), by transforming these measurements into broadband flux at the top-of-atmosphere. This paper presents a methodology for obtaining daily mean RSF (Wm-2) from AVHRR. First, the narrowband reflectances are converted to broadband reflectance using empirical regressions with the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) observations. Second, the anisotropy is corrected by applying Angular Distribution Models (ADMs), which convert directional reflectance into a hemispherical albedo. Third, the instantaneous albedos are temporally interpolated by a flexible diurnal cycle model, capable of ingesting any number of observations at any time of day, making it suitable for any orbital configuration of NOAA and MetOp satellites. Finally, the twilight conditions prevailing near sunrise and sunset are simulated with an empirical model. The entire day is then integrated into a single daily mean RSF. This paper furthermore demonstrates the methodology by validating a full year (2008) of RSF daily means with the CERES SYN1deg data record, both on daily and subdaily scale. Several configurations are tested, each excluding particular satellites from the constellation in order to mimic orbital changes (e.g., orbital drift), and to assess their relative importance to the daily mean RSF. The best performance is obtained by the combination of at least one mid-morning (NOAA-17 or MetOp-A) and one early afternoon (NOAA-18) orbit. In this case, the RMS difference with CERES is about 7 Wm-2. Removing NOAA-18 degrades the performance to an RMS difference of 12 Wm-2, thereby providing an estimate of the impact of NOAA-19's orbital drift between 2016 and 2020. Very early or late observations (NOAA-15, NOAA-16) provide little added value, and both mid-morning orbits turn out to be almost interchangeable given their close temporal proximity.

TI  - Recognition and Prediction of Land Dynamics and Its Associated Impacts in Al-Qurayyat City and along Al-Shamal Train Pathway in Saudi Arabia
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Saudi Arabia has experienced substantial urban growth over the last few decades, transforming from rural to urban communities due to rapid economic growth. Saudi Arabia is ranked as one of the most urbanized countries, with more than 80% of its population existing in urban centers. Four Landsat imagery datasets acquired in 1989, 2002, 2013, and 2021 were used to estimate the dynamics of land cover and urban growth in Al-Qurayyat City and investigate the relationship between the construction of Al-Shamal train in 2011 and the land dynamics. The results emphasize a strong intercorrelation between the construction of the Al-Shamal train pathway and the land development and the rapid urbanization in Al-Qurayyat City. The results show that the urban and built-up area expanded from 1.96% to 7.25% between 1989 and 2021. Future prediction of land cover dynamics and urban growth in 2030 were estimated using the Markov chain and CA-Markov models. The findings of future prediction show that more than 60% of the total area of Al-Qurayyat City will transform into urban and built-up areas by 2030. The dramatic increase in urban and built-up areas and the subsequent reduction in other land cover types will impact the environmental sustainability of Al-Qurayyat City. The findings in this paper recommend smart growth, which guarantees environmentally friendly development for future land use/land cover planning in Al-Qurayyat City. This study will be beneficial to the urban planner and policymakers for proper sustainable development decisions by exploring the land cover changing pattern and the trends of urban expansion.

TI  - Inland Water Body Mapping Using CYGNSS Coherence Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work demonstrates the creation of dynamic inland water body masks at spatial resolutions ranging from 1 to 3 km through the use of a recently developed coherence detector for the delay-Doppler maps produced by the cyclone global navigation satellite system (CYGNSS) constellation. The use of the coherence of the observed measurements reduces many of the uncertainties associated with previous signal-to-noise ratio-based water body detection approaches for CYGNSS. Using data from January 2018 to February 2020 and producing maps representing time intervals ranging from 3 months to 2 years, the water body masks created are found to be associated with a probability of detection that exceeds 80% as compared to the Pekel water mask developed from Landsat observations. The analysis presented in this work highlights the potential of using spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite Systems Reflectometry (GNSS-R) systems for dynamic inland water body mapping.

TI  - SPECTRAL CHARACTERIZATION AND MONITORING OF MANGROVE FORESTS WITH REMOTE SENSING IN THE COLOMBIAN PACIFIC COAST: BAJO BAUDO, CHOCO
T2  - GRANJA-REVISTA DE CIENCIAS DE LA VIDA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Colombian Pacific has extensive areas in mangrove forests (MF), which is a strategic ecosystem of great environmental and socioeconomic for climate change mitigation. This work aimed to perform spectral characterization and monitoring of 66.59 km2 for four MF densities in Bajo Baudo (Colombia), using three Landsat images (1998, 2014 and 2017), combinations of spectral bands and three vegetation indices (VI) (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index-NDVI, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index-SAVI and the Combined Mangrove Recognition Index-CMRI). The results showed that the best combination of spectral bands for visual identification of MF corresponded to infrared color (NIR, Red, Green) and false-color composite 1 (NIR, SWIR, Red). The spectral sign of MFs had different behaviors in four densities under the conditions of high tide and low tide. During the 19 years analyzed, there was a difference of up to 17.9% in the average reflectance value in MF. Similarly, the values of VI were proportional to the densities of MF, but their value was reduced by tidal effects at the time of capturing the images; the largest increases in VI were recorded over the coastal area of land-water transition, where there is a strong interaction with the tidal condition. This research contributes to the spatial characterization and monitoring of MF with remote sensors and the spectral study of this important ecosystem in Colombia.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Dune Velocities and Corresponding Uncertainties, Detected from Optical Image Matching in the North Sinai Sand Sea, Egypt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the relationship between climatic conditions and dune ecosystems requires the large-scale monitoring of spatiotemporal patterns of dune velocities. Due to their large extent and remoteness, dune fields are ideal for remote sensing techniques. Dune velocities in the Sand Sea North Sinai are characterized by large spatial and temporal variability. To this end, a total of 265 pairs from four Landsat-8 images from April 2013 to April 2018 were automatically matched with the COSI Corr engine to determine the dune velocities. These pairs were selected so that differences in the solar angles were small and spanned at least one year. This helps to reduce shadowing in the deformation fields and the error budget in converting displacements to annual velocities. To improve spatial coverage and reduce measurement uncertainty, the fusion of individual offset maps is considered feasible. We compared the performance of two methods (i.e., inversion and temporal median fusion) in performing the fusion of individual velocities, and the two methods showed good agreement. The fusion of individual velocities allowed us to estimate the final velocities for about 98.8% of the dune areas. Our results suggest that the magnitudes and directions of dune migration at Sand Sea are spatially and temporally variable. The geometric mean of the active features associated with 12 regions in the Sand Sea ranged from 1.65 m/y to 3.52 m/y, with median directions from 56.19 degrees to 173.11 degrees. The stable regions allowed us to estimate the 95% confidence intervals of the final velocities and extend these calculations to the dune targets. The median uncertainties were 0.10 m/y and 0.25 m/y for the stable and moving targets, respectively. We estimated the coherence of the final velocity vector, which can be considered as an indicator of the homogeneity of migration directions between the offset maps. We compared the final Landsat-8 velocities with those from Sentinel-2 to validate the results and found a good agreement in the magnitudes and directions. The process of selecting high-quality pairs and then fusing the individual maps showed a high performance in terms of spatial coverage and reliability of the extracted velocities.

M3  - Review
AB  - Lymph node metastasis both increases disease stage and alters adjuvant treatment plans in gynecologic cancers. Since a minority of the patients have nodal metastasis, many patients unnecessarily undergo complete lymphadenectomy and are exposed to the subsequent morbidities. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping is an alternative for evaluation of lymph nodes with lesser side effects. Although it is yet an experimental approach in ovarian cancer, it has been incorporated into guidelines for endometrial, cervical and vulvar cancers. We aimed to summarize the current situation of SLN mapping in gynecologic cancers.

TI  - Estimating Organic and Inorganic Part of Suspended Solids from Sentinel 2 in Different Inland Waters
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Inland waters are very sensitive ecosystems that are mainly affected by pressures and impacts within their watersheds. One of water's dominant constituents is the suspended particulate matter that affects the optical properties of water bodies and can be detected from remote sensors. It is important to know their composition since the ecological role they play in water bodies depends on whether they are mostly organic compounds (phytoplankton, decomposition of plant matter, etc.) or inorganic compounds (silt, clay, etc.). Nowadays, the European Space Agency Sentinel-2 mission has outstanding characteristics for measuring inland waters' biophysical variables. This work developed algorithms that can estimate the total concentration of suspended matter (TSM), differentiating organic from inorganic fractions, through the combined use of Sentinel-2 images with an extensive database obtained from reservoirs, lakes and marshes within eastern zones of the Iberian Peninsula. For this, information from 121 georeferenced samples collected throughout 40 field campaigns over a 4-year period was used. All possible two-band combinations were obtained and correlated with the biophysical variables by fitting linear regression between the field data and bands combination. The results determined that only using bands 705 or 783 lead to the obtaining the amount of total suspended matter and their organic and inorganic fractions, with errors of 10.3%, 14.8% and 12.2%, respectively. Therefore, remote sensing provides information about total suspended matter dynamics and characteristics as well as its spatial and temporal variation, which would help to study its causes.

TI  - A Framework for Weather-Driven Dengue Virus Transmission Dynamics in Different Brazilian Regions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated a model to assess the role of climate fluctuations on dengue (DENV) dynamics from 2010 to 2019 in four Brazilian municipalities. The proposed transmission model was based on a preexisting SEI-SIR model, but also incorporates the vector vertical transmission and the vector's egg compartment, thus allowing rainfall to be introduced to modulate egg-hatching. Temperature and rainfall satellite data throughout the decade were used as climatic model inputs. A sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the role of each parameter. The model-simulated scenario was compared to the observed dengue incidence and the findings indicate that the model was able to capture the observed seasonal dengue incidence pattern with good accuracy until 2016, although higher deviations were observed from 2016 to 2019. The results further demonstrate that vertical transmission fluctuations can affect attack transmission rates and patterns, suggesting the need to investigate the contribution of vertical transmission to dengue transmission dynamics in future assessments. The improved understanding of the relationship between different environment variables and dengue transmission achieved by the proposed model can contribute to public health policies regarding mosquito-borne diseases.

TI  - [What factors contributed to the higher incidence rate of in-hospital falls at the time of Covid 19? A paradigm shift?]
T2  - Igiene e sanita pubblica
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on all health systems as there has been a growing rapidity in the demand for health care from COVID 19 positive patients in hospitals around the world. With the intensification of the pandemic, determining in real time the consequent needs for health resources (beds, personnel, equipment) has in fact become the fundamental priority for many countries to ensure health services consistent with the health needs expressed by the population. In Italy, the demand has often been satisfied with the conversion of existing beds and the remodeling of the healthcare offer or where the available resources allow it also with the opening of new beds dedicated to pandemic assistance. This work analyzes the falls detected at the time of COVID in patients and hospitalized in direct hospital beds (600 beds) of a Local Health Authority of Lazio (ASL ROMA 2). Although the data on the incidence of falls recorded in the three centers were equal to 2.21 every 1000 days of beds occupied and that the data recorded are lower than those reported in the literature, it is also true that the increase in average hospital stay and the reduction in the rotation rate of beds had an impact on the still low occupancy rates compared to the literature data.The COVID-19 pandemic has put a strain on all health systems as there has been a growing rapidity in the demand for health care from COVID 19 positive patients in hospitals around the world.

Although the data on the incidence of falls recorded in the three centers were equal to 2.21 every 1000 days of beds occupied and that the data recorded are lower than those reported in the literature, it is also true that the increase in average hospital stay and the reduction in the rotation rate of beds had an impact on the still low occupancy rates compared to the literature data. In fact, the scientific literature shows that in England and Wales, whose national health service is very similar to the Italian one, the falls of patients in hospitals with optimal bed occupancy rates and optimal average hospitalization rates (equal to 4.5 days in general medicine, 3.5 days in general surgery, 3 days in orthopedics) represent the first sentinel event in terms of incidence and frequency, albeit with a very variable damage detection. The average falls is 6.63 falls per 1,000 bed-occupied days, which equates to approximately 1,700 falls per year in an 800-bed hospital with an optimal occupancy rate. Regarding damage, the literature documents that physical injuries and fractures occur in 30-50% of events and fractures occur in 1-3% of cases. The data collected in ASL ROMA 2 have documented that despite the increase in staff dedicated to assistance by 15 - 30%, an increase due to the application of COVID pathways and to the activities of compression of the risk of circulation of the virus among hospitalized patients , the rate of falls has nevertheless increased by 13.5% despite the persistence of standards of quality and safety of patients in care activities, debunking the paradigm that falls can be caused by an undersizing of the care staff and by the possible overcrowding of the emergency departments - urgency.

TI  - Significant Seismic Risk Potential From Buried Faults Beneath Almaty City, Kazakhstan, Revealed From High-Resolution Satellite DEMs
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Major faults of the Tien Shan, Central Asia, have long repeat times, but fail in large (Mw 7+) earthquakes. In addition, there may be smaller, buried faults off the major faults which are not properly characterized or even recognized as active. These all pose hazard to cities along the mountain range front such as Almaty, Kazakhstan. Here, we explore the seismic hazard and risk for Almaty from specific earthquake scenarios. We run three historical-based earthquake scenarios (1887 Verny Mw 7.3, 1889 Chilik Mw 8.0 and 1911 Chon-Kemin Mw 8.0) on the current population and four hypothetical scenarios for near-field faulting. By making high-resolution Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from SPOT and Pleiades stereo optical satellite imagery, we identify fault splays near and under Almaty. We assess the feasibility of using DEMs to estimate city building heights, aiming to better constrain future exposure datasets. Both Pleiades and SPOT-derived DEMs find accurate building heights of the majority of sampled buildings within error; Pleiades tri-stereo estimates 80% of 15 building heights within one sigma and has the smallest average percentage difference to field-measured heights (14%). A moderately sized Mw 6.5 earthquake rupture occurring on a blind thrust fault, under folding north of Almaty is the most damaging scenario explored here due to the modeled fault stretching under Almaty, with estimated 12,300 +/- 5,000 completely damaged buildings, 4,100 +/- 3,500 fatalities and an economic cost of 4,700 +/- 2,700 Million US dollars (one sigma uncertainty). This highlights the importance of characterizing location, extent, geometry, and activity of small faults beneath cities.Plain Language Summary Many cities around the world are potentially at risk from earthquakes, due to buried faults that have been hidden by the expansion of the city. Whilst the earthquake hazard and risk due to larger faults is often more widely appreciated, these smaller, subtle faults may potentially be more damaging due to their proximity to the cities, even if the earthquakes that occur on them are much smaller. In this study, we use high-resolution satellite data to make elevation models across Almaty, Kazakhstan, and identify faults from small changes in the height of the surface. We then simulate the risk to Almaty for a number of specific, defined earthquakes and show the damage (number of buildings with damage) and losses (fatalities and economic cost) for each of these scenarios. We find that a fault to the north of Almaty city could be the most damaging and cause the most losses, because it is close to Almaty and much of the city's building and population is situated directly above the fault at depth. This work shows that knowing the location and shape of faults close to cities is key to understanding seismic hazard and risk.

TI  - Generation and Mapping of Fuel Types for Fire Risk Assessment
T2  - FIRE-SWITZERLAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Fuel mapping is key to fire propagation risk assessment and regeneration potential. Previous studies have mapped fuel types using remote sensing data, mainly at local-regional scales, while at smaller scales fuel mapping has been based on general-purpose global databases. This work aims to develop a methodology for producing fuel maps across European regions to improve wildland fire risk assessment. A methodology to map fuel types on a regional-continental scale is proposed, based on Sentinel-3 images, horizontal vegetation continuity, biogeographic regions, and biomass data. A vegetation map for the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands was generated with 85% overall accuracy (category errors between 3% and 28%). Two fuel maps were generated: (1) with 45 customized fuel types, and (2) with 19 fuel types adapted to the Fire Behaviour Fuel Types (FBFT) system. The mean biomass values of the final parameterized fuels show similarities with other fuel products, but the biomass values do not present a strong correlation with them (maximum Spearman's rank correlation: 0.45) because of the divergences in the existing products in terms of considering the forest overstory biomass or not.

TI  - Comparison of land use/land cover change of fused image and multispectral image of landsat mission: a case study of Rajshahi, Bangladesh
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - To monitor the impacts on environment due to climate change and anthropogenic influences, it is important to have precise and accurate information regarding the land use/land cover (LULC) change. The current study has been carried out to understand the LULC pattern and changing scenario using remote sensing and GIS techniques. The data were used in two ways, i.e. first the multispectral image was used to classify by maximum likelihood (ML) classification system on both 1999 and 2016 images separately, and then compare the change history, and second, the multispectral image and panchromatic band was fused using Gram-Schmidt (GM) fusion technique to enhance the image quality. Then, the fused image of 1999 and 2016 was classified separately using the ML process. Several statistical analyses on fused image were carried to quantify the image quality. The classified images were compared to get the most accurate result. Four land use classes were detected, namely cultivated land, vegetation, built up area, and water body. During the classification, the vegetation, built up and cultivated land classes were biased and slightly deviated from the accuracy. The maximum difference between the classified panchromatic and multispectral images in 1999 for cultivated land was 12.2 km(2), and the minimum difference was found for the water body, i.e. 0.8 km(2). The similarly in 2016 presented the maximum difference for vegetation equal to 7.3 km(2) and minimum equal to 4.4 km(2) for the water body. Accuracy result shows that the fused image is better for classified proposes for analysis and decision making.

TI  - "Humane Criminology": An Inclusive Victimology Protecting Animals and People
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - To those who primarily associate the word "humane" with "humane society", its connection to criminology might appear to be unrelated. The origins of "humane" and "humane society" are complex and primarily reflect an abiding interest in human and societal welfare rather than animal welfare. Consequently, the origins and evolution of the current American association of humane societies with animal protection-as contrasted to its British association with rescuing victims of drowning-remain shrouded in mystery. A new focus that returns to the original roots of "humane" describing the implications of animal cruelty, abuse, and neglect as cause for human and societal concern due to their potential as sentinel indicators and predictors of interpersonal violence, rather than a strict focus on animals' welfare or their alleged "rights", holds great promise for advancing legislation and community programming that improves the well-being of human and non-human animal species and the prevention of crime.

TI  - Evaluating the Atmospheric Correction Impact on Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Data for Soil Salinity Determination
T2  - GEODETSKI LIST
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing technology effectively determines and evaluates salinity-affected areas' spatial and temporal distribution. Soil salinity maps for large areas can be obtained with low cost and low effort using remote sensing methods and techniques. Remote sensing data are delivered raw as Level-1 data, and they can be further atmospherically corrected to surface reflectance values, Level-2 data. This study evaluates the atmospheric correction impact on Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 data for soil salinity determination. The study has been supported with in-situ measurements in Alpu, Eskisehir, Turkey, where samples were collected from various agricultural fields simultaneously with the overpass of the satellites. 71 to different analysis cases have been used to determine the effect of atmospheric correction. The first is to examine the relationship between the measurements taken front the areas with mixed product groups and the salinity indices for both data types. The other is to investigate the relationship between the measurement values taken only from the wheat and beet groups and the salinity index values. The results show that atmospheric correction has a high effect on the relationship between spectral indices and in situ salinity measurement values. Especially in all cases examined in Landsat, it was observed that atmospheric correction led to an improvement of over 140%, while nearly 50% was observed in Sentinel on a product basis.

TI  - Multi-Class Strategies for Joint Building Footprint and Road Detection in Remote Sensing
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Building footprints and road networks are important inputs for a great deal of services. For instance, building maps are useful for urban planning, whereas road maps are essential for disaster response services. Traditionally, building and road maps are manually generated by remote sensing experts or land surveying, occasionally assisted by semi-automatic tools. In the last decade, deep learning-based approaches have demonstrated their capabilities to extract these elements automatically and accurately from remote sensing imagery. The building footprint and road network detection problem can be considered a multi-class semantic segmentation task, that is, a single model performs a pixel-wise classification on multiple classes, optimizing the overall performance. However, depending on the spatial resolution of the imagery used, both classes may coexist within the same pixel, drastically reducing their separability. In this regard, binary decomposition techniques, which have been widely studied in the machine learning literature, are proved useful for addressing multi-class problems. Accordingly, the multi-class problem can be split into multiple binary semantic segmentation sub-problems, specializing different models for each class. Nevertheless, in these cases, an aggregation step is required to obtain the final output labels. Additionally, other novel approaches, such as multi-task learning, may come in handy to further increase the performance of the binary semantic segmentation models. Since there is no certainty as to which strategy should be carried out to accurately tackle a multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation problem, this paper performs an in-depth study to shed light on the issue. For this purpose, open-access Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery (at 10 m) are considered for extracting buildings and roads, making use of the well-known U-Net convolutional neural network. It is worth stressing that building and road classes may coexist within the same pixel when working at such a low spatial resolution, setting a challenging problem scheme. Accordingly, a robust experimental study is developed to assess the benefits of the decomposition strategies and their combination with a multi-task learning scheme. The obtained results demonstrate that decomposing the considered multi-class remote sensing semantic segmentation problem into multiple binary ones using a One-vs.-All binary decomposition technique leads to better results than the standard direct multi-class approach. Additionally, the benefits of using a multi-task learning scheme for pushing the performance of binary segmentation models are also shown.

TI  - Multi-Data Ensemble Estimation of Wave Energy Potential in Indonesian Seas
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wave as blue energy is promising in Indonesia since it propagates directly from both the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Thus, preliminary study is necessary as a gate of initial development for wave energy conversion. Many wind-wave model results, reanalysis datasets, and satellite data are currently available and help researchers comprehend wave behavior and its energy produced. Multi-data ensemble estimation of wave energy with various methods, set-ups, and resolutions from those available resources would provide better accuracy, consistency, and insight for potential wave energy. This estimation is crucial because direct wave measurements are still not enough in Indonesian seas. The significant wave height and period are obtained from multi-data resources over seven years from 2011 to 2017. Each data is spatially interpolated onto a consistent grid of adequate data resolution and temporally daily averaged based on the spatial and temporal resolution of data used. Seasonal and monthly wave energy is considered since the monsoonal pattern plays a significant role in the Indonesian seas. For further possibility, wave energy potential is analyzed near coastal zones with less than 100 m depth. High wave energy potential is found promising off the coast of southern Java and western Sumatra.

TI  - Risk Factors for Extended-Spectrum-β-Lactamase-Producing <i>Escherichia coli</i> in Community-Onset Bloodstream Infection: Impact on Long-Term Care Hospitals in Korea
T2  - ANNALS OF LABORATORY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) in the community has increased worldwide due to multifactorial reasons. ESBL-EC bloodstream infection (BSI) complicates the decision for proper antimicrobial administration. In this multicenter study, we investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and molecular background of community-onset (CO) ESBL-EC BSI.Methods: We included data for all episodes of ESBL-EC BSI of community origin from May 2016 to April 2017 obtained from the Korean national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system, which comprises six sentinel hospitals. Data, including previous history of admission and use of antimicrobials and medical devices before BSI, were collected, along with microbiological analysis results.Results: Among 1,189 patients with CO BSI caused by E. coli, 316 (27%) were identified as ESBL producers. History of admission, especially to a long-term care hospital (LTCH), and previous use of beta-lactams/beta-lactamase inhibitors, carbapenem, lincosamide, aminoglycoside, and extended-spectrum cephalosporin were independent risk factors for CO ESBL-EC BSI; admission to an LTCH showed the highest odds ratio (3.8, 95% confidence interval 2.3-6.1). The most common genotype was CTX-M-15 (N = 131, 41%), followed by CTX-M-14 (N = 86, 27%). ST131 was the most common sequence type among ESBL-EC groups (57%).Conclusions: In Korea, 27% of CO E. coli BSI were caused by ESBL producers. From perspectives of empirical treatment and infection control, history of admission to an LTCH and antimicrobial use should be noted.

TI  - The Analysis of long term shoreline changes due to erosion and accretion using multi-resolution Landsat satellite data along the coast between Chennai to Kovalam, Tamilnadu, India
T2  - JOURNAL OF INDIAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION
M3  - Article
AB  - The shoreline is very vulnerable since it keeps on changing due to the surrounding environment and anthropogenic activities. Recognizing and quantifying areas prone to erosion are essential in coastal zone management. Shoreline erosion is a serious issue worldwide, especially in the countries having more population along the coast. Wave characteristics, sediment characteristics, and beach shape are the significant factors that influence coastal changes. This paper aims to analyse shoreline erosion and accretion changes using multi-resolution Landsat satellite data and GIS technology along the east coast between Chennai to Kovalam. The satellite data sets were collected from USGS websites (1980, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020) to extract shorelines using ArcGIS and Erdas software. The accretion and erosion are calculated every ten years from 1980 to 2020. The study suggests that the erosion was extreme from 2000 to 2011 (3.45 km(2)), while 2.91 km(2) was accreted between 2010 and 2020. After 1980 - 1990, this offshore area experienced an erosion of 2.23 km(2). On the other hand, there was an increase of 7.59 km(2) from 1980 to 2020. Continuous monitoring and understanding of long-term shoreline changes are needed for a sustainable coastal environment.

TI  - Snow Property Inversion From Remote Sensing (SPIReS): A Generalized Multispectral Unmixing Approach With Examples From MODIS and Landsat 8 OLI
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral mixture analysis has a history in mapping snow, especially where mixed pixels prevail. Using multiple spectral bands rather than band ratios or band indices, retrievals of snow properties that affect its albedo lead to more accurate estimates than widely used age-based models of albedo evolution. Nevertheless, there is substantial room for improvement. We present the Snow Property Inversion from Remote Sensing (SPIReS) approach, offering the following improvements: 1) Solutions for grain size and concentrations of light absorbing particles are computed simultaneously; 2) Only snow and snow-free endmembers are employed; 3) Cloud-masking and smoothing are integrated; 4) Similar spectra are grouped together and interpolants are used to reduce computation time. The source codes are available in an open repository. Computation is fast enough that users can process imagery on demand. Validation of retrievals from Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) against WorldView-2/3 and the Airborne Snow Observatory shows accurate detection of snow and estimates of fractional snow cover. Validation of albedo shows low errors using terrain-corrected <italic>in situ</italic> measurements. We conclude by discussing the applicability of this approach to any airborne or spaceborne multispectral sensor and options to further improve retrievals.

TI  - Persistent Scatterer Interferometry and Statistical Analysis of Time-Series for Landslide Monitoring: Application to Santo Stefano d'Aveto (Liguria, NW Italy)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are a major threat for population and urban areas. Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) is a powerful tool for identifying landslides and monitoring their evolution over long periods and has proven to be very useful especially in urban areas, where a sufficient number of PS can be generated. In this study, we applied PS interferometry to investigate the landslide affecting Santo Stefano d'Aveto (Liguria, NW Italy) by integrating classic interferometric techniques with cross-correlation analysis of PS time-series and with geological and geotechnical field information. We used open-source software and packages to process Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images from the Copernicus Sentinel-1A satellite for both ascending and descending orbits over the period 2015-2021 and calculate both the vertical motion and the E-W horizontal displacement. By computing the cross-correlation of the PS time-series, we identified three families of PS with a similarity greater than 0.70. The cross-correlation analysis allowed subdividing the landslide in different sectors, each of which is characterized by a specific type of movement. The geological meaning of this subdivision is still a matter of discussion but it is presumably driven by the geomorphological setting of the area and by the regional tectonics.

T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Dust storms are common in northern China and can adversely affect the environment and human health. The Xilingol grassland is the main source of dust storms in China. However, the impacts of different surface features on dusty weather in the Xilingol League remain unclear. This study analyzed the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of surface features and the corresponding effects on dusty weather using data from 13 meteorological stations, MODIS normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data, and soil moisture data collected in Xilingol League from 2005 to 2018. Spatially, the dust outbreak frequency (DOF) of Xilingol League decreased gradually from the western desert steppe to the eastern typical steppe. Temporally, the dust outbreak ratio (DOR) and DOF were highest in spring (March-May), with the highest in April. Dusty weather mostly occur in spring but gradually decreased in this season over the 14-year period. On the contrary, NDVI and soil moisture increased gradually from the west with less precipitation to the east with more precipitation. And showed fluctuating increasing trends over time. The DOR in Xilingol League was negatively correlated with the NDVI and soil moisture, and with the increase of NDVI and soil moisture from the western desert steppe to the eastern typical steppe and the southern cultivated land, the dust emission threshold also increased. The DOR predicted by Xilingol league in spring was significantly correlated with the actual DOR. Our research can provide specific suggestions for different regions of Xilingol League.

TI  - Wind Speed Profile Statistics from Acoustic Soundings at a Black Sea Coastal Site
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - More than seven years of remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolution were investigated in this study. The 20-min moving averaged wind profiles form the acoustic sounding with Scintec MFAS sodar were derived every 10 min. The profiles covered from 30 to 600 m height with vertical resolution of 10 m. The wind speed probability and the Weibull distribution parameters were calculated by the maximum likelihood method at each level and then the profiles of the Weibull scale and shape parameters were analyzed. Diurnal wind speed at heights above 200 m has shown a well-expressed increase in the averaged values during the night hours, while during the day lower wind speeds were observed. The reversal height was explored from spatially and temporally homogenized diurnal wind speed data with applied quadratic functions for better interpretation of the results. In addition, analyses by type of air masses (land or sea air mass) were performed. One of the outcomes of the study was assessment of the internal boundary layer height, which was estimated to 50-80 m at the location of the sodar. The obtained information forms the basis for climatological insights on the vertical structure of the coastal boundary layer and is unique long-term data set important not only for Bulgaria but for coastal meteorology in general.

TI  - Quantifying Global and Random Uncertainties in High Resolution Global Geomagnetic Field Models Used for Directional Drilling
T2  - SPE DRILLING & COMPLETION
M3  - Article
AB  - Total field strength, declination, and dip angle of the Earth's magnetic field, in conjunction with gravity, are used by magnetic-survey tools to determine a wellbore's location. Magnetic field values may be obtained from global models that, depending on the model, have a wide range of spatial resolution at the Earth's surface from large scale (3000 km) to small scale (28 km). The magnetic field varies continuously in both time and space, so no model can fully capture the complexity of all sources; hence, there are uncertainties associated with the values provided. The SPE Wellbore Positioning Technical Section/Industry Steering Committee on Wellbore Surveying Accuracy (ISCWSA) published their original measurement-while-drilling (MWD) error model in 2000. Such models and uncertainties define positional error ellipsoids along the wellbore, which assist the driller in achieving their geological target, in addition to aiding collision avoidance. With the recent update to Revision 5 of the ISCWSA error model, we have reassessed the uncertainties associated with our latest high-resolution global magnetic field model.We describe the derivation of location-specific global and random uncertainties for use with predicted geomagnetic values from high-resolution models within magnetic MWD survey-tool-error models. We propose a sophisticated approach to provide realistic values at different locations around the globe; for example, we determine separate errors for regions where the models have high spatial resolution from aeromagnetic data compared to regions where only satellite data are available.The combined uncertainties are freely available via a web service with which the user can also see how they vary with time. The use of the revised uncertainty values in the MWD-error model, in most cases, reduces the positional error ellipsoids and allows better use of the increased accuracy from recent improvements in geomagnetic modeling. This is demonstrated using the new uncertainty values in the MWD-error model for three standard ISCWSA well profiles. A fourth theoretical well offshore Brazil where the vertical magnetic field is weak shows that with drillstring interference correction relying on the more uncertain magnetic dip, the positional error ellipsoids can increase. This is clearly of concern for attaining geological targets and collision avoidance.

TI  - Education as a Way of Human Existence in a Postmodern Society
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Without exaggeration, learning problems are among the most complex and most controversial not only in pedagogical and philosophical science but also in other scientific areas. We are talking about the philosophy of education as a general paradigm of the organization and content of all that knowledge scientific and non-scientific that we pass on to pupils and students through education, about worldview values that are brought up, merged in the process of educational and educational activities, the certainty of the spiritual world of the individual which is formed at school and university and determines her personal position, role and ways of behavior in postmodern society.Education is an important stage in the formation of the human soul, his spiritual world. Consciousness, like other qualities of the human psyche, results from education and acquisition of social experience. An important means of forming a person's consciousness is the educational system, which contributes to the spiritual development of a person. Since it is education that is that social institution, it performs the functions of preparing and including the individual in various spheres of the life of postmodern society and attracting him to culture. Human consciousness is the ideological foundation of aim and reliable knowledge. In this context, consciousness is the possibility and condition of the world, the individual can perceive and develop his spirituality. Education in this case is the most effective way to form a person's spirituality. Since, besides a certain profession, education gives a person the opportunity to spiritually improve himself.

TI  - Enhanced Sentinel Surveillance System for COVID-19 Outbreak Prediction in a Large European Dialysis Clinics Network
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate predictions of COVID-19 epidemic dynamics may enable timely organizational interventions in high-risk regions. We exploited the interconnection of the Fresenius Medical Care (FMC) European dialysis clinic network to develop a sentinel surveillance system for outbreak prediction. We developed an artificial intelligence-based model considering the information related to all clinics belonging to the European Nephrocare Network. The prediction tool provides risk scores of the occurrence of a COVID-19 outbreak in each dialysis center within a 2-week forecasting horizon. The model input variables include information related to the epidemic status and trends in clinical practice patterns of the target clinic, regional epidemic metrics, and the distance-weighted risk estimates of adjacent dialysis units. On the validation dates, there were 30 (5.09%), 39 (6.52%), and 218 (36.03%) clinics with two or more patients with COVID-19 infection during the 2-week prediction window. The performance of the model was suitable in all testing windows: AUC = 0.77, 0.80, and 0.81, respectively. The occurrence of new cases in a clinic propagates distance-weighted risk estimates to proximal dialysis units. Our machine learning sentinel surveillance system may allow for a prompt risk assessment and timely response to COVID-19 surges throughout networked European clinics.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Activity Patterns of the Mexican Plateau Horned Lizard in a Natural Protected Area
T2  - JOURNAL OF HERPETOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lizard activity patterns are restricted by both intrinsic and extrinsic variables. The Mexican Plateau Horned Lizard (Phrynosoma orbiculare) is endemic to Mexico and an ambush forager and viviparous species that becomes dormant during the cooler months. The objective of this study was to determine the spatiotemporal activity patterns of P. orbiculare and the environmental conditions related to its occurrence in the natural protected area Statal Park Sierra Morelos, State of Mexico, Mexico. We conducted samplings during 2018 and 2019. We assessed temporal activity patterns with Watson's U-2 test to determine differences in activity hours between age classes, sexes, and seasons, and we evaluated spatial activity patterns through a hotspot analysis. We conducted a logistic regression model by using landsat 8 bands and indices as independent variables. Differences in temporal activity patterns (activity timing) were detected between age classes and seasons (in the juvenile group) but not between sexes. Within the natural protected area, P. orbiculare aggregated in solar glades. There is an important contribution of ultrablue and blue landsat bands to P. orbiculare occurrence. Differences in activity between age classes could be related to the heat acquisition rate of smaller individuals; meanwhile, no differences between sexes suggests that the thermal optima of females are similar to male optima. Hotspot analysis and the distribution model reveal that P. orbiculare appears on the windward slope where sunrise occurs. Solar glades are important for the species occurrence and should be protected in the studied area. These data allow future monitoring studies to help prevent population declines and illegal extraction.

TI  - Integration of GIS and multi-criteria analysis for the assessment of the sensitivity to urbanization in Biskra and its neighboring oases, Algeria
T2  - GEOJOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to establish a perspective orientation of urban growth in an arid region (Biskra and its neighboring oases) in south east Algeria by mobilizing the capacities of attractiveness. Taking into account climatic parameters (wind speed and temperatures) and physical parameters (land cover, slopes, and distance from roads), our approach is based on remote sensing techniques of satellite data classification and Geographic Information Systems for spatial analysis. By means of a multi-criteria analysis a decision support map of sites suitable for future urban dynamics was carried out. The results obtained show that 48% (or 71,782.25 ha) of the study area is located on land with very low sensitivity to urbanization. 9.45% at high sensitivity, 29.13% at medium sensitivity, while 13.41% at low sensitivity. The medium sensitivity zone occupies a considerable area estimated at 29.13% (a total of 43,577.58 ha). Spatially, this is reflected in uncontrolled urban sprawl to the detriment of oases and agricultural land, or land not suited to the requirements of climatic comfort in arid regions. This urbanization sensitivity map forms the basis of the prospective design of an urban model adapted and appropriate to the conditions of the oasis ecosystem through the integration of other climatic parameters.

TI  - Logistics Workers Are a Key Factor for SARS-CoV-2 Spread in Brazilian Small Towns: Case-Control Study
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Data on how SARS-CoV-2 enters and spreads in a population are essential for guiding public policies. Objective: This study seeks to understand the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in small Brazilian towns during the early phase of the epidemic and to identify core groups that can serve as the initial source of infection as well as factors associated with a higher risk of COVID-19. Methods: Two population-based seroprevalence studies, one household survey, and a case-control study were conducted in two small towns in southeastern Brazil between May and June 2020. In the population-based studies, 400 people were evaluated in each town; there were 40 homes in the household survey, and 95 cases and 393 controls in the case-control study. SARS-CoV-2 serology testing was performed on participants, and a questionnaire was applied. Prevalence, household secondary infection rate, and factors associated with infection were assessed. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by logistic regression. Logistics worker was defined as an individual with an occupation focused on the transportation of people or goods and whose job involves traveling outside the town of residence at least once a week. Results: Higher seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 was observed in the town with a greater proportion of logistics workers. The secondary household infection rate was 49.1% (55/112), and it was observed that in most households (28/40, 70%) the index case was a logistics worker. The case-control study revealed that being a logistics worker (OR 18.0, 95% CI 8.4-38.7) or living with one (OR 6.9, 95% CI 3.3-14.5) increases the risk of infection. In addition, having close contact with a confirmed case (OR 13.4, 95% CI 6.6-27.3) and living with more than four people (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1-7.1) were also risk factors. Conclusions: Our study shows a strong association between logistics workers and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and highlights the key role of these workers in the viral spread in small towns. These findings indicate the need to focus on this population to determine COVID-19 prevention and control strategies, including vaccination and sentinel genomic surveillance.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The magnitude and frequency of storm events, relative sea-level rise (RSLR), sediment supply, and anthropogenic alterations drive the morphologic evolution of barrier island systems, although the relative importance of any one driver will vary with the spatial and temporal scales considered. To explore the relative contributions of storms and human alterations to sediment supply on decadal changes in barrier landscapes, we applied Otsu's thresholding method to multiple satellite-derived spectral indices for coastal land-cover classification and analyzed Landsat satellite imagery to quantify changes to the northern Chandeleur Islands barrier system since 1984. This high temporal-resolution dataset shows decadal-scale land-cover oscillations related to storm-recovery cycles, suggesting that shorter and (or) less resolved time series are biased toward storm impacts and may significantly overpredict land-loss rates and the timing of barrier morphologic state changes. We demonstrate that, historically, vegetation extent and persistence were the dominant controls on alongshore-variable landscape response and recovery following storms, and are even more important than human-mediated sediment input. As a result of extensive vegetation losses over the past few decades, however, the northern Chandeleur Islands are transitioning to a new morphologic state in which the landscape is dominated by intertidal environments, indicating reduced resilience to future storms and possibly rapid transitions in morphologic state with increasing rates of RSLR.

TI  - Implementation of radioguided surgery in prostate cancer
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - With the development of new imaging technologies and tracers, the applications of radioguided surgery for prostate cancer are growing rapidly. The current paper aims to give an overview of the recent advances of radioguided surgery in the management of prostate cancer. We performed a literature search to give an overview of the current status of radioguided surgery for prostate cancer. Three modalities of radioguided surgery, the sentinel node procedure, Cerenkov Luminescence / beta-radio-guided surgery and radio-guided salvage surgery in recurrent prostate cancer, were reviewed in detail. Radioguided surgery for prostate cancer has shown promising value in the treatment of primary diagnosed prostate cancer and recurrent loco-regional lymph node positive prostate cancer. Advances have been made into minimal invasive (robot-assisted) lapa-roscopic surgery. The sentinel node procedure for prostate cancer has been further developed and is currently performed with high diagnostic sensitivity. Cerenkov luminescence imaging is a feasible and encouraging technique for intraoperative margin assessment in prostate cancer. Radioguided surgery in recurrent prostate cancer has shown to he feasible. yielding high sensitivity and specificity for detecting small local recurrences and metastases. With the availability of different new tracers. the road has been paved towards clinically feasible radioguided surgery for prostate cancer. Novel technologies now being developed for minimal invasive surgery are speeding up clinical research. Currently, none of the radioguided surgery techniques mentioned have been accepted as standard of care.

TI  - Investigation of Groundwater Depletion in the State of Qatar and Its Implication to Energy Water and Food Nexus
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is a precious freshwater resource heavily relied upon by agricultural activities in many parts of the world, and especially by countries with limited water resources located in arid regions. Groundwater resources are under severe pressures due to population increase, urbanisation and socio-economic development, with potential for causing long-term threats to human life and natural ecosystems. This study attempts to investigate the impacts of local and regional climatic trends, and establish key forcing functions that have changed local groundwater resources. The main questions answered through this study include: Are these changes beneficial or detrimental? If they are detrimental, what is the future outlook for impacts on the ecosystem? What are the corrective actions needed to avert the long-term risks in arid environments? In view of this, the methodology developed in this study focuses on a joint time-series statistical analysis using ground data as well as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite data. Results show a substantial depletion in the groundwater thickness (0.24 +/- 0.20 cm/year) during the period of observation (2002-2020). Long-term temperature data indicates that the annual mean temperature increased significantly by 1.02 degrees C between 1987 and 2016, while total rainfall exhibited a slight decreasing trend. In addition to groundwater extraction, fluctuations in monthly rainfall, soil moisture, evapotranspiration and relative humidity support the groundwater thickness reduction of GRACE datasets. The use of desalinated water and wastewater reuse in the agriculture sector may reduce the pressure on groundwater resources. Optimization, adaptation and mitigation in the EWF nexus will further improve the sustainability of the EWF resources.

TI  - Performance of Singular Spectrum Analysis in Separating Seasonal and Fast Physiological Dynamics of Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence and PRI Optical Signals
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - High temporal resolution measurements of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (F) and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) encode vegetation functioning. However, these signals are modulated by time-dependent processes. We tested the applicability of the Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) for disentangling fast components (physiology-driven) and slow components (controlled by structural and biochemical properties) from PRI, far-red F (F-760), and far-red apparent fluorescence yield (Fy*(760)). The proof of concept was developed on spectral and flux time series simulated with the Soil Canopy Observation of Photochemistry and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. This allowed the evaluation of SSA decomposition against variables that are independent of physiology or are modified by it. Slow SSA-decomposed components of PRI and Fy*(760) showed high correlations with the reference variables (R-2 = 0.97 and 0.96, respectively). Fast SSA-decomposed components of PRI and Fy*(760) were better related to the physiological reference variables than the original signals during periods when leaf area index (LAI) was above 1 m(2) m(-2). The method was also successfully applied to predict light-use efficiency (LUE) from the fast SSA-decomposed components of PRI (R-2 = 0.70) and Fy*(760) (R-2 = 0.68) when discarding data modeled with LAI R-in < 250 W m(-2). The method was then tested on data acquired in a Mediterranean grassland. In this case, the fast SSA-decomposed component of apparent LUE* showed a stronger correlation with the fast SSA-decomposed component of Fy*(760) (R-2 = 0.42) than with original Fy*(760) (R-2 = 0.01). SSA-based approach is a promising tool for decoupling physiological information from measurements acquired with automated proximal sensing systems.

TI  - PET- and SPECT-based navigation strategies to advance procedural accuracy in interventional radiology and image-guided surgery
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nuclear medicine has a crucial role in interventional strategies where a combination between the increasing use of targeted radiotracers and intraprocedural detection modalities enable novel, but often complex, targeted procedures in both the fields of interventional radiology and surgery. 3D navigation approaches could assist the interventional radiologist or surgeon in such complex procedures.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the current application of computer-assisted navigation strategies based on nuclear imaging to assist in interventional radiology and image-guided surgery. This work starts with a brief overview of the typical navigation workflow from a technical perspective, which is followed by the different clinical applications organized based on their anatomical organ of interest.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Although many studies have proven the feasibility of PET- and SPECT-based navigation strategies for various clinical applications in both interventional radiology and surgery, the strategies are spread widely in both navigation workflows and clinical indications, evaluated in small patient groups. Hence, no golden standard has yet been established.CONCLUSIONS: Despite that the clinical outcome is yet to be determined in large patient cohorts, navigation seems to be a promising technology to translate nuclear medicine findings, provided by PET- and SPECT-based molecular imaging, to the intervention and operating room. Interventional Nuclear Medicine (iNM) has an exciting future to come using both PET- and SPECT-based navigation.

TI  - Permanent Gas Emission from the Seyakha Crater of Gas Blowout, Yamal Peninsula, Russian Arctic
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to the four-year (2017-2020) monitoring of gas emissions from the bottom of the Seyakha Crater, located in the central part of the Yamal Peninsula (north of Western Siberia). The crater was formed on 28 June 2017 due to a powerful blowout, self-ignition and explosion of gas (mainly methane) at the site of a heaving mound in the river channel. On the basis of a comprehensive analysis of expeditionary geological and geophysical data (a set of geophysical equipment, including echo sounders and GPR was used) and remote sensing data (from space and with the use of UAVs), the continuing nature of the gas emissions from the bottom of the crater was proven. It was revealed that the area of gas seeps in 2019 and 2020 increased by about 10 times compared to 2017 and 2018. Gas in the cryolithosphere of the Arctic exists in free and hydrated states, has a predominantly methane composition, whereas this methane is of a biochemical, thermogenic and/or mixed type. It was concluded that the cryolithosphere of Yamal has a high level of gas saturation and is an almost inexhaustible unconventional source of energy resources for the serving of local needs.

TI  - A Hyperspectral Library of Foliar Diseases of Wheat
T2  - PHYTOPATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This work established a hyperspectral library of important foliar diseases of wheat induced by different fungal pathogens, representing a time series from infection to symptom appearance for the purpose of detecting spectral changes. The data were generated under controlled conditions at the leaf scale. The transition from healthy to diseased leaf tissue was assessed, and spectral shifts were identified and used in combination with histological investigations to define developmental stages in pathogenesis for each disease. The spectral signatures of each plant disease that indicate a specific developmental stage during pathogenesis, defined as turning points, were combined into a spectral library. Machine learning analysis methods were applied and compared to test the potential of this library to detect and quantify foliar diseases in hyperspectral images. All evaluated classifiers had high accuracy (<= 99%) for the detection and identification of both biotrophic and necrotrophic fungi. The potential of applying spectral analysis methods in combination with a spectral library for the detection and identification of plant diseases is demonstrated. Further evaluation and development of these algorithms should contribute to a robust detection and identification system for plant diseases at different developmental stages and the promotion and development of site-specific management techniques for plant diseases under field conditions.

TI  - Criteria for recommendations after perioperative sentinel events
T2  - BMJ OPEN QUALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The recurrence of sentinel events (SEs) is a persistent problem worldwide, despite repeated analyses and recommendations formulated to prevent recurrence. Research suggests this is partly attributable to the quality of the recommendations, and determining if a recommendation will be effective is not yet covered by an adequate guideline. Our objectives were to (1) develop and validate criteria for high-quality recommendations, and (2) evaluate recommendations using the criteria developed. Methods (1) Criteria were developed by experts using the bowtie method. Medical doctors then determined if the recommendations of Dutch in-hospital SE analysis reports met the criteria, after which interobserver variability was tested. (2) Researchers determined which recommendations of Dutch perioperative SE analysis reports produced from 2017 to 2018 met the criteria. Results The criteria were: (1) a recommendation needs to be well defined and clear, (2) it needs to specifically describe the intended changes, and (3) it needs to describe how it will reduce the risk or limit the consequences of a similar SE. Validation of criteria showed substantial interobserver agreement. The SE analysis reports (n=115) contained 442 recommendations, of which 64% failed to meet all criteria, and 28% of reports did not contain a single recommendation that met the criteria. Conclusion We developed and validated criteria for high-quality recommendations. The majority of recommendations did not meet our criteria. It was disconcerting to find that over a quarter of the investigations did not produce a single recommendation that met the criteria, not even in SEs with a fatal outcome. Healthcare providers have an obligation to prevent SEs, and certainly their recurrence. We anticipate that using these criteria to determine the potential of recommendations will aid in this endeavour.

TI  - The Earth-Observing Satellite Constellation: A review from a meteorological perspective of a complex, interconnected global system with extensive applications
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The global Earth-observing satellite constellation (EOSC) is a major international asset that has developed since 1960 with a dramatic growth in size and complexity in the recent past. This high-level review article takes stock and summarizes, from a meteorological perspective, the current constellation's capabilities, in order to increase awareness, document the value chain of satellite data from measurements to decision making, and illustrate the interconnected and evolving nature of those processes. When assessed in terms of application areas, the constellation is highly interdependent, and the observations it provides complement each other.

TI  - Sea water quality monitoring using remote sensing techniques: a case study in Tangier-Ksar Sghir coastline
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water quality is an extremely important factor as it affects the ecological balance of ecosystems and the development of the social and economic wellbeing of the countries bordering it. Remote sensing multiconcept helps to understand the natural environment, managing water resources and assessing water pollution on local and regional levels. Landsat 8 data were used to monitor coastal water quality in the region of Tangier-Ksar Sghir. The main purpose of the current study is to establish a mathematical relationship between the amount of light emitted from the water bodies and the measured water parameters. The results permit to create a spatial distribution maps for the water quality parameters. The present work study three water parameters: total suspended solids (TSS), dissolved oxygen (DO), and total dissolved sediments (TDS). Thirty-four sampling points were used to represent water parameters measurements along the coastline. The 75% of the in situ measurements were used to build the statistical models by using the spectral characteristics obtained from the sensors, while the remaining 25% were used for testing the accuracy of the developed equations. For the correlation analysis and the regression development, the Statistical Package of the Social Sciences (SPSS) software was used. The final results of the statistical analysis showed a high correlation between the calculated data and the observed ones with R-2 > 0.713 and p value < 0.001. The obtained values showed a high accuracy as well (RMSE ranging between 0.23 and 0.69 and SEE ranging between 0.01 and 0.47). SNAP software and Qgis were used to do the image processing and to create the spatial distribution maps for the water parameters in the coastline of Tangier-Ksar Sghir region.

TI  - First Detection of the Adventive Egg Parasitoid of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Stal) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) <i>Trissolcus mitsukurii</i> (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) in France
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary The invasive brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys, is a polyphagous species and a serious pest worldwide. Classical biological control (CBC), i.e., the introduction of a natural enemy from the native area of the pest, is considered as the preferential solution for BMSB regulation. Adventive populations of exotic egg parasitoids of BSMB, Trissolcus japonicus and T. mitsukurii, have been reported worldwide. With the aim to characterize the French diversity of egg parasitoids associated to various stink bugs including BMSB, field surveys were conducted between 2018 and 2020. Surprisingly, morphological and molecular analyses unambiguously revealed 12 specimens of T. mitsukurii, an Asian egg parasitoid of BSMB. Although its permanent establishment has to be confirmed, this first record in France could actually facilitate CBC initiatives, T. mitsukurii being considered with T. japonicus as the two most promising biological control agents against BMSB. We report the first detection of Trissolcus mitsukurii in France. More than 1860 sentinel egg masses of Halyomorpha halys (BMSB) were exposed in the field during the 2018-2020 period, and 12 specimens of T. mitsukurii emerged from one egg mass. Their taxonomic identification was confirmed both by morphological and molecular analysis. Trissolcus mitsukurii, similar to T. japonicus, is an egg parasitoid of BMSB in its area of origin in Asia, and both species are considered to be candidates for a classical biological control strategy against BMSB. Trissolcus mitsukurii was previously recorded in Italy where it is well established and widespread, and this may be the source of the French population. Possible permanent establishment and dispersion of T. mitsukurii in France should be monitored with emphasis on its potential effect on BMSB populations.

TI  - Advanced data handling architecture for earth observation satellites
T2  - IT-INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper we describe how commercial open standards for embedded systems could affect the architecture of future satellite data handling systems. Traditionally, satellite data handling systems are based on the principles of a federated architecture, i. e. one function is implemented as one box. Each box has its own housing and power supply. In the paper we describe the transition path from the traditional federated architecture to a centralized but modular architecture based on adapted industrial standards. In the presented approach functional modules like on-board computer, Global Navigation Satellite System receiver, interface boards, etc. are combined in a rack communicating via a standard backplane using standardized communication links. The analysis performed during the Advanced Data Handling Architecture study showed that this approach contributes significantly to mass and power reduction (approx. 20 %) of a typical satellite data handling system. Another major point highlighted in the Advanced Data Handling Architecture study is the simplification of Assembly, Integration and Test activities. All this will help space industry to handle increasing system complexity while keeping costs at an acceptable level.

M3  - Case Reports
AB  - Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from a traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF) is a rare occurrence with few cases reported in the literature. Patients classically present shortly after the inciting trauma with symptoms of ocular venous hypertension. We report a case of an ICH due to delayed rupture of a venous aneurysm from a CCF in a patient with decades-old history of enucleation of the left globe secondary to trauma with no sentinel symptoms. Our patient represents a unique presentation of a rare pathology. This case highlights the need for ongoing surveillance in patients with a history of severe craniofacial trauma, as ICH from ruptured CCF(s) demands emergent treatment due to the potential for rapid neurological deterioration.

TI  - Application of Copernicus Data for Climate-Relevant Urban Planning Using the Example of Water, Heat, and Vegetation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Specific climate adaptation and resilience measures can be efficiently designed and implemented at regional and local levels. Climate and environmental databases are critical for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and for efficiently planning and implementing appropriate adaptation measures. Available federated and distributed databases can serve as necessary starting points for municipalities to identify needs, prioritize resources, and allocate investments, taking into account often tight budget constraints. High-quality geospatial, climate, and environmental data are now broadly available and remote sensing data, e.g., Copernicus services, will be critical. There are forward-looking approaches to use these datasets to derive forecasts for optimizing urban planning processes for local governments. On the municipal level, however, the existing data have only been used to a limited extent. There are no adequate tools for urban planning with which remote sensing data can be merged and meaningfully combined with local data and further processed and applied in municipal planning and decision-making. Therefore, our project CoKLIMAx aims at the development of new digital products, advanced urban services, and procedures, such as the development of practical technical tools that capture different remote sensing and in-situ data sets for validation and further processing. CoKLIMAx will be used to develop a scalable toolbox for urban planning to increase climate resilience. Focus areas of the project will be water (e.g., soil sealing, stormwater drainage, retention, and flood protection), urban (micro)climate (e.g., heat islands and air flows), and vegetation (e.g., greening strategy, vegetation monitoring/vitality). To this end, new digital process structures will be embedded in local government to enable better policy decisions for the future.

TI  - Slavery, the Hebrew Bible and the Development of Racial Theories in the Nineteenth Century
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Racial ideas which developed in the modern west were forged with reference to a Christian worldview and informed by the Bible, particularly the Old Testament. Up until Darwin's scientific reframing of the origins debate, European and American race scientists were fundamentally Christian in their orientation. This paper outlines how interpretations of the Hebrew Bible within this Christian Weltanschauung facilitated the development and articulation of racial theories which burgeoned in western intellectual discourse up to and during the 19th century. The book of Genesis was a particular seedbed for identity politics as the origin stories of the Hebrew Bible were plundered in service of articulating a racial hierarchy which justified both the place of Europeans at the pinnacle of divine creation and the denigration, bestialization, and enslavement of Africans as the worst of human filiation. That the racial ethos of the period dictated both the questions exegetes posed and the conclusions they derived from the text demonstrates that biblical interpretation within this climate was never an innocuous pursuit, but rather reflected the values and beliefs current in the social context of the exegete.

TI  - Object-based change detection of very high-resolution remote sensing images incorporating multiscale uncertainty analysis by fusing pixel-based change detection
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pixel-based change detection (PBCD) is imperfect because it lacks spatial correlation and can cause misdetection and salt and pepper noise. Comparatively, object-based change detection (OBCD) is dependent on the accuracy of the segmentation scale, where oversegmentation or under-segmentation of the image objects reduce accuracy. The fusion of PBCD and OBCD maps has great potential in dealing with spectral variability and texture complexity in very high-resolution (VHR) remote sensing images. It is difficult to solve the problem of uncertainty, which is caused by the inaccuracy of the multiple-change maps. Evidence theory based on Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory is an effective method for modeling uncertainty and taking advantage of multiple pieces of evidence. In this study, we proposed a scale-driven CD method incorporating DS evidence theory and majority voting rule to generate CD by combining multiscale OBCD results and PBCD results. Experiments carried out in four different regions using the Gaofen-2 imagery were used to test the proposed approach. We conducted numerous experiments to compare the proposed approach with prevalent CD approaches. Based on the results, the proposed approach achieves the best performance because it combines the benefits of pixel-based and object-based methods. (C) 2021 SPIE and IS&T

TI  - Spatio-temporal evolution and driving mechanism of green economic efficiency at county level in the Yellow River Delta, China
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - A comprehensive measurement of green economic efficiency in the Yellow River Delta region can provide a reference basis for achieving ecological protection and high -quality development. We constructed an evaluation system of green economic efficiency in counties based on multi source remote sensing data. We adopted the Super-EBM model that considered non -expected output to make a comprehensive measurement of green economic efficiency in Yellow River Delta counties, used the kernel density function estimation method to portray the characteristics of spatial and temporal evolution, and finally used the system generalized moment estimation method to identify influencing factors. The results showed that the comprehensive efficiency and pure technical efficiency of the green economy in the Yellow River Delta counties showed a fluctuating upward trend from 2000 to 2015. The scale efficiency showed a rapid increase and then stayed stable in a F ' type trend, while the increase in comprehensive efficiency transformed from being driven by scale -technology to being led by technology. The comprehensive efficiency and pure technical efficiency of the green economy in the Yellow River Delta counties showed an evolutionary trend from club convergence' to overall convergence', with the low efficiency counties formed a catch-up effect' on the high efficiency counties and the scale efficiency toward a balanced and smooth development. The comprehensive efficiency of green economy and its decomposition efficiency spatially formed a mountain pattern, which was high in the middle, low in the two wings, and the high value area concentrated in the headland of the Yellow River Delta and along the coast of Laizhou Bay. The high -value area showed the characteristics of a northwest -southeast shift, and the east and west wings of the Yellow River Delta formed low -value subsidence areas. Industrial structure, population concentration level, and fixed asset investment intensity had positive effects on green economic efficiency, while population urbanization rate had negative effects on green economic efficiency. There was an obvious environmental Kuznets' effect between green economic efficiency and economic development level.

TI  - Interpretation of the Reflectance Spectra of Lithium (Li) Minerals and Pegmatites: A Case Study for Mineralogical and Lithological Identification in the Fregeneda-Almendra Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reflectance spectroscopy has been used to identify several deposit types. However, applications concerning lithium (Li)-pegmatites are still scarce. Reflectance spectroscopic studies complemented by microscopic and geochemical studies were employed in the Fregeneda-Almendra (Spain-Portugal) pegmatite field to analyze the spectral behavior of Li-minerals and field lithologies. The spectral similarity of the target class (Li-pegmatites) with other elements was also evaluated. Lepidolite was discriminated from other white micas and the remaining Li-minerals. No diagnostic feature of petalite and spodumene was identified, since their spectral curves are dominated by clays. Their presence was corroborated (by complementary techniques) in petalite relics and completely replaced crystals, although the clay-related absorption depths decrease with Li content. This implies that clays can be used as pathfinders only in areas where argillic alteration is not prevalent. All sampled lithologies present similar water and/or hydroxide features. The overall mineral assemblage is very distinct, with lepidolite, cookeite, and orthoclase exclusively identified in Li-pegmatite (being these minerals crucial targets for Li-pegmatite discrimination in real-life applications), while chlorite and biotite can occur in the remaining lithologies. Satellite data can be used to discriminate Li-pegmatites due to distinct reflectance magnitude and mineral assemblages, higher absorptions depths, and distinct Al-OH wavelength position. The potential use of multi- and hyperspectral data was evaluated; the main limitations and advantages were discussed. These new insights on the spectral behavior of Li-minerals and pegmatites may aid in new Li-pegmatite discoveries around the world.

TI  - Estimating Evapotranspiration of Mediterranean Oak Savanna at Multiple Temporal and Spatial Resolutions. Implications for Water Resources Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mediterranean oak savanna is composed of a mixture of scattered oak trees, crops, pasture, and shrubs. It is the most widespread agroforestry landscape in Europe, and its conservation faces multiple threats including water scarcity, which has been exacerbated by global warming and greater climate variability. Evapotranspiration (ET) can be used as a proxy of the vegetation water status and response to water shortage conditions, providing relevant information about the ecosystem stability and its hydrological dynamics. This study evaluates a framework to estimate ET at multiple spatial and temporal scales and applies it to the monitoring of the oak savanna vegetation water consumption for the years 2013-2015. We used a remote sensing-based energy balance model (ALEXI/DisALEXI approach), and the STARFM data fusion technique to provide daily ET estimates at 30 m resolution. The results showed that modeled energy balance components compared well to ground measurements collected by an eddy covariance system, with root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging between 0.60 and 2.18 MJ m(-2) d(-1), depending on the sensor dataset (MODIS or Landsat) and the flux. The daily 30 m ET series generated by STARFM presented an RMSE value of 0.67 mm d(-1), which yielded a slight improvement compared to using MODIS resolution or more simple interpolation approaches with Landsat. However, the major advantage of the high spatio-temporal resolution was found in the analysis of ET dynamics over different vegetation patches that shape the landscape structure and create different microclimates. Fine-scale ET maps (30 m, daily) provide key information difficult to detect at a coarser spatial resolution over heterogeneous landscapes and may assist management decisions at the field and farm scale.

TI  - Identifying Metocean Drivers of Turbidity Using 18 Years of MODIS Satellite Data: Implications for Marine Ecosystems under Climate Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Turbidity impacts the growth and productivity of marine benthic habitats due to light limitation. Daily/monthly synoptic and tidal influences often drive turbidity fluctuations, however, our understanding of what drives turbidity across seasonal/interannual timescales is often limited, thus impeding our ability to forecast climate change impacts to ecologically significant habitats. Here, we analysed long term (18-year) MODIS-aqua data to derive turbidity and the associated meteorological and oceanographic (metocean) processes in an arid tropical embayment (Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia) within the eastern Indian Ocean. We found turbidity was associated with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycles as well as Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) events. Winds from the adjacent terrestrial region were also associated with turbidity and an upward trend in turbidity was evident in the body of the gulf over the 18 years. Our results identify hydrological processes that could be affected by global climate cycles undergoing change and reveal opportunities for managers to reduce impacts to ecologically important ecosystems.

AB  - Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a mathematically robust multivariate data analysis approach that is sometimes used for surface oil slick signature classification. Our goal is to rank the effectiveness of LDAs to differentiate oil spills from look-alike slicks. We explored multiple combinations of (i) variables (size information, Meteorological-Oceanographic (metoc), geo-location parameters) and (ii) data transformations (non-transformed, cube root, log(10)). Active and passive satellite-based measurements of RADARSAT, QuikSCAT, AVHRR, SeaWiFS, and MODIS were used. Results from two experiments are reported and discussed: (i) an investigation of 60 combinations of several attributes subjected to the same data transformation and (ii) a survey of 54 other data combinations of three selected variables subjected to different data transformations. In Experiment 1, the best discrimination was reached using ten cube-transformed attributes: similar to 85% overall accuracy using six pieces of size information, three metoc variables, and one geo-location parameter. In Experiment 2, two combinations of three variables tied as the most effective: similar to 81% of overall accuracy using area (log transformed), length-to-width ratio (log- or cube-transformed), and number of feature parts (non-transformed). After verifying the classification accuracy of 114 algorithms by comparing with expert interpretations, we concluded that applying different data transformations and accounting for metoc and geo-location attributes optimizes the accuracies of binary classifiers (oil spill vs. look-alike slicks) using the simple LDA technique.

TI  - Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 Multi-Temporal Series to Estimate Topsoil Properties on Croplands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial and temporal monitoring of soil organic carbon (SOC), and other soil properties related to soil erosion, is extremely important, both from the environmental and economic perspectives. Sentinel-2 (S2) and Landsat-8 (L8) time series increase the probability to observe bare soil fields in croplands, and thus, monitor soil properties over large regions. In this regard, this work suggests an automated pixel-based approach to select only pure soil pixels in S2 and L8 time series, and to make a synthetic bare soil image (SBSI). The SBSIs and the soil properties measured in the framework of the European LUCAS survey were used to calibrate SOC, clay, and CaCO3 prediction models. The results highlight a high correlation between laboratory soil spectra and the SBSIs median spectra, especially for the SBSI obtained by a three-year S2 collection, which provides satisfactory results in terms of SOC prediction accuracy (RPD: 1.74). The comparison between S2 and L8 results demonstrated the higher capability of the S2 sensor in terms of SOC prediction accuracy, mainly due to the greater spatial resolution of the bands in the visible region. Whereas, neither S2 nor L8 could accurately predict the clay and CaCO3 content. This is because of the low spectral and spatial resolution of their SWIR bands that prevent the exploitation of the narrow spectral features related to these two soil attributes. The results of this study prove that large S2 time series can estimate and monitor SOC in croplands using an automated pixel-based approach that selects pure soil pixels and retrieves reliable synthetic soil spectra.

TI  - Continuous Monitoring of the Flooding Dynamics in the Albufera Wetland (Spain) by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite data are very useful for the continuous monitoring of ever-changing environments, such as wetlands. In this study, we investigated the use of multispectral imagery to monitor the winter evolution of land cover in the Albufera wetland (Spain), using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 datasets. With multispectral data, the frequency of observation is limited by the possible presence of clouds. To overcome this problem, the data acquired by the two missions, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, were jointly used, thus roughly halving the revisit time. The varied types of land cover were grouped into four classes: (1) open water, (2) mosaic of water, mud and vegetation, (3) bare soil and (4) vegetated soil. The automatic classification of the four classes was obtained through a rule-based method that combined the NDWI, MNDWI and NDVI indices. Point information, provided by geo-located ground pictures, was spatially extended with the help of a very high-resolution image (GeoEye-1). In this way, surfaces with known land cover were obtained and used for the validation of the classification method. The overall accuracy was found to be 0.96 and 0.98 for Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, respectively. The consistency evaluation between Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 was performed in six days, in which acquisitions by both missions were available. The observed dynamics of the land cover were highly variable in space. For example, the presence of the open water condition lasted for around 60-80 days in the areas closest to the Albufera lake and progressively decreased towards the boundaries of the park. The study demonstrates the feasibility of using moderate-resolution multispectral images to monitor land cover changes in wetland environments.

TI  - Mapping Boreal Forest Spruce Beetle Health Status at the Individual Crown Scale Using Fused Spectral and Structural Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The frequency and severity of spruce bark beetle outbreaks are increasing in boreal forests leading to widespread tree mortality and fuel conditions promoting extreme wildfire. Detection of beetle infestation is a forest health monitoring (FHM) priority but is hampered by the challenges of detecting early stage ("green") attack from the air. There is indication that green stage might be detected from vertical gradients of spectral data or from shortwave infrared information distributed within a single crown. To evaluate the efficacy of discriminating "non-infested", "green", and "dead" health statuses at the landscape scale in Alaska, USA, this study conducted spectral and structural fusion of data from: (1) Unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral (6 cm) + structure from motion point clouds (similar to 700 pts m(-2)); and (2) Goddard Lidar Hyperspectral Thermal (G-LiHT) hyperspectral (400 to 1000 nm, 0.5 m) + SWIR-band lidar (similar to 32 pts m(-2)). We achieved 78% accuracy for all three health statuses using spectral + structural fusion from either UAV or G-LiHT and 97% accuracy for non-infested/dead using G-LiHT. We confirm that UAV 3D spectral (e.g., greenness above versus below median height in crown) and lidar apparent reflectance metrics (e.g., mean reflectance at 99th percentile height in crown), are of high value, perhaps capturing the vertical gradient of needle degradation. In most classification exercises, UAV accuracy was lower than G-LiHT indicating that collecting ultra-high spatial resolution data might be less important than high spectral resolution information. While the value of passive optical spectral information was largely confined to the discrimination of non-infested versus dead crowns, G-LiHT hyperspectral band selection (similar to 400, 675, 755, and 940 nm) could inform future FHM mission planning regarding optimal wavelengths for this task. Interestingly, the selected regions mostly did not align with the band designations for our UAV multispectral data but do correspond to, e.g., Sentinel-2 red edge bands, suggesting a path forward for moderate scale bark beetle detection when paired with suitable structural data.

TI  - A New Individual Tree Species Classification Method Based on the ResU-Net Model
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Individual tree species (ITS) classification is one of the key issues in forest resource management. Compared with traditional classification methods, deep learning networks may yield ITS classification results with higher accuracy. In this research, the U-Net and ResNet networks were combined to form a Res-UNet network by changing the structure of the convolutional layer to the residual structure in ResNet based on the framework of the U-Net model. In addition, a second Res-UNet network named Res-UNet2 was further constructed to explore the effect of the stacking of residual structures on network performance. The Res-UNet2 model structure is similar to that of the Res-UNet model, but the convolutional layer in the U-Net model is created with a double-layer residual structure. The two networks proposed in this work were used to classify ITSs in WorldView-3 images of the Huangshan Mountains, Anhui Province, China, acquired in March 2019. The resulting ITS map was compared with the classification results obtained with U-Net and ResNet. The total classification accuracy of the ResU-Net network reached 94.29% and was higher than that generated by the U-Net and ResNet models, verifying that the ResU-Net model can more accurately classify ITSs. The Res-UNet2 model performed poorly compared to Res-UNet, indicating that stacking the residual modules in ResNet does not achieve an accuracy improvement.

TI  - Soil salinity inversion based on differentiated fusion of satellite image and ground spectra
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the wide availability of remote sensing data from different sensors and platforms, soil salinity inversion based on the fusion of multisource remote sensing data is becoming a reality. However, existing fusion methods mainly use the average relationship from samples, which does not consider the differences in the relationships among samples. In this paper, a differentiated fusion method for determining satellite and ground spectral variables of soil salinity according to the differences among samples is proposed to increase the regional inversion precision. Nonnegative matrix factorization was employed to decompose soil salinity spectral variables from the Sentinel-2A Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) image and the simulated spectra on ground spectra. Then, the base spectra matrix of soil salinity was from the simulated data, and the weight coefficient matrix was obtained from the Sentinel-2A MSI data as the differentiated correction coefficients. By multiplying the base matrix and weight matrix, the spectral variables were reconstructed. The results indicate that this differentiated fusion method can not only enhance the correlation between soil salinity and Sentinel-2A MSI data but also improve the precision of regional soil salinity inversion models. For the differentiated fused model, the validation R2, RMSE, and RPD were 0.71, 7.02 g/kg, and 1.49, respectively; compared with the unfused model, the validation R2 increased by 0.09, the RMSE decreased by 0.80 g/kg, and the RPD increased by 0.18. Furthermore, the differentiated fused model performed better than the average-ratio adjusted model. These findings have practical implications for the use of multisource optical remote sensing data for regional soil salinity mapping and analysis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Monitoring of Soil CO<sub>2</sub> Efflux in a Subtropical Forest during the Dry Season Based on Field Observations and Remote Sensing Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The CO2 efflux from forest soil (FCO2) is one of the largest components of the global carbon cycle. Accurate estimation of FCO2 can help us better understand the carbon cycle in forested areas and precisely predict future climate change. However, the scarcity of field-measured FCO2 data in the subtropical forested area greatly limits our understanding of FCO2 dynamics at regional and global scales. This study used an automatic cavity ring-down spectrophotometer (CRDS) analyzer to measure FCO2 in a typical subtropical forest of southern China in the dry season. We found that the measured FCO2 at two experimental areas experienced similar temporal trends in the dry season and reached the minima around December, whereas the mean FCO2 differed apparently across the two areas (9.05 vs. 5.03 g C m(-2) day(-1)) during the dry season. Moreover, we found that both abiotic (soil temperature and moisture) and biotic (vegetation productivity) factors are significantly and positively correlated, respectively, with the FCO2 variation during the study period. Furthermore, a machine-learning random forest model (RF model) that incorporates remote sensing data is developed and used to predict the FCO2 pattern in the subtropical forest, and the topographic effects on spatiotemporal patterns of FCO2 were further investigated. The model evaluation indicated that the proposed model illustrated high prediction accuracy for the training and testing dataset. Based on the proposed model, the spatiotemporal patterns of FCO2 in the forested watershed that encloses the two monitoring sites were mapped. Results showed that the spatial distribution of FCO2 is obviously affected by topography: the high FCO2 values mainly occur in relatively high altitudinal areas, in slopes of 10-25 degrees, and in sunny slopes. The results emphasized that future studies should consider topographical effects when simulating FCO2 in subtropical forests. Overall, our study unraveled the spatiotemporal variations of FCO2 and their driving factors in a subtropical forest of southern China in the dry season, and demonstrated that the proposed RF model in combination with remote sensing data can be a useful tool for predicting FCO2 in forested areas, particularly in subtropical and tropical forest ecosystems.

TI  - A Quick Band-to-Band Mis-Registration Detection Method for Sentinel-2 MSI Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A band-to-band mis-registration (BBMR) error often occurs in remote sensing (RS) images acquired by multi-spectral push broom spectrometers such as the Sentinel-2 Multi-spectral Instrument (MSI), leading to adverse impacts on the reliability of further RS applications. Although the systematic band-to-band registration conducted during the image production process corrects most BBMR errors, there are still quite a few images being observed with discernible BBMR. Thus, a quick BBMR detection method is needed to assess the quality of online RS products. We here propose a hybrid framework for detecting BBMR between the visible bands in MSI images. This framework comprises three main steps: first, candidate chips are captured based on Google Earth Engine (GEE) spatial analysis functions to shrink the valid areas inside image scenes as potential target chips. The redundant data pertaining to the local operation process are thus narrowed down. Second, spectral abnormal areas are precisely extracted from inside every single chip, excluding the influences of clouds and water surfaces. Finally, the abnormal areas are matched pixel by pixel between bands, and the best-fit coordinates are then determined to compare with tolerance. Here, the proposed method was applied to 71,493 scenes of MSI Level-1C images covering China and its surrounding areas on the GEE platform. From these images, 4356 chips from 442 scenes were detected with inter-band offsets among the visible bands. Further manual visual inspection revealed that the proposed method had an accuracy of 98.07% at the chip scale and 88.46% at the scene scale.

TI  - Elevation-Dependent Changes to Plant Phenology in Canada's Arctic Detected Using Long-Term Satellite Observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic temperatures have increased at almost twice the global average rate since the industrial revolution. Some studies also reported a further amplified rate of climate warming at high elevations; namely, the elevation dependency of climate change. This elevation-dependent climate change could have important implications for the fate of glaciers and ecosystems at high elevations under climate change. However, the lack of long-term climate data at high elevations, especially in the Arctic, has hindered the investigation of this question. Because of the linkage between climate warming and plant phenology changes and remote sensing's ability to detect the latter, remote sensing provides an alternative way for investigating the elevation dependency of climate change over Arctic mountains. This study investigated the elevation-dependent changes to plant phenology using AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) time series from 1985 to 2013 over five study areas in Canada's Arctic. We found that the start of the growing season (SOS) became earlier faster with an increasing elevation over mountainous study areas (i.e., Sirmilik, the Torngat Mountains, and Ivvavik National Parks). Similarly, the changes rates in the end of growing season (EOS) and the growing season length (GSL) were also higher at high elevations. One exception was SOS in the Ivvavik National Park: "no warming trend" with the May-June temperature at a nearby climate station decreased slightly during 1985-2013, and so no elevation-dependent amplification.

TI  - Contrast-Enhanced Mammographic Features of In Situ and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Manifesting Microcalcifications Only: Help to Predict Underestimation?
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary Mammography frequently detects the early breast cancers manifesting microcalcifications only. By means of mammographically guided vacuum-assisted core needle biopsy, noninvasive ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is often diagnosed. Unfortunately, invasive components are occasionally embedded within the noninvasive cancer bed, which will alter the preoperative planning. Whether or not to perform single-step sentinel lymph node sampling is an area of controversy. In order to minimize the overtreatment or undertreatment, we retrospectively reviewed the enhanced features of DCIS and invasive ductal carcinomas (IDCs) on contrast-enhanced spectral mammograms (CESMs). The CESM is a modern technique enabling the provision of conventional mammograms and contrast-enhanced images. The results of our study revealed low DCIS upgrade of the unenhanced DCIS. Otherwise, DCIS tended to appear as nonmass and pure ground glass enhancements, and IDC tended to appear as mass and unpurified solid enhancement. The enhanced features allow distinguishing DCIS and IDC. Background: The contrast-enhanced mammographic features of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) manifesting microcalcifications only on mammograms were evaluated to determine whether they could predict IDC underestimation. Methods: We reviewed patients who underwent mammography-guided biopsy on suspicious breast microcalcifications only and received contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) within 2 weeks before the biopsy. Those patients who were proven to have cancers (DCIS or IDC) by biopsy and subsequently had surgical treatment in our hospital were included for analysis. The presence or absence, size, morphology and texture of enhancement on contrast-enhanced spectral mammography were reviewed by consensus of two radiologists. Results: A total of 49 patients were included for analysis. Forty patients (81.6%) showed enhancement, including 18 (45%) DCIS and 22 (55%) IDC patients. All nine unenhanced cancers were pure DCIS. Pure DCIS showed 72.22% nonmass enhancement and 83.33% pure ground glass enhancement. IDC showed more mass (72.2% vs. 27.8%) and solid enhancements (83.33% vs. 16.67%). The cancer and texture of enhancement were significantly different between pure DCIS and IDC, with moderate diagnostic performance for the former (p-value < 0.01, AUC = 0.66, sensitivity = 93%, specificity = 39%) and the latter (p-value < 0.01, AUC = 0.74, sensitivity = 65%, specificity = 83%). Otherwise, pure DCIS showed a significant difference in enhanced texture compared with upgraded IDC and IDC (p = 0.0226 and 0.0018, respectively). Conclusions: Nonmass and pure ground glass enhancements were closely related to pure DCIS, and cases showing mass and unpurified solid enhancements should be suspected as IDC. Unenhanced DCIS with microcalcifications only has a low DCIS upgrade rate. The CESM-enhanced features could feasibly predict IDC underestimation.

TI  - Controls on Water Storage and Drainage in Crevasses on the Greenland Ice Sheet
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface crevasses on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) capture nearly half of the seasonal runoff, yet their role in transferring meltwater to the bed has received little attention relative to that of supraglacial lakes and moulins. Here, we present observations of crevasse ponding and investigate controls on their hydrological behavior at a fast-moving, marine-terminating sector of the GrIS. We map surface meltwater, crevasses, and surface-parallel stress across a similar to 2,700 km(2) region using satellite data and contemporaneous uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys. From 2017 to 2019 an average of 26% of the crevassed area exhibited ponding at locations that remained persistent between years despite rapid advection. We find that the spatial distribution of ponded crevasses does not relate to previously proposed controls on the distribution of supraglacial lakes (elevation and topography) or crevasses (von Mises stress thresholds), suggesting the operation of some other physical control(s). Ponded crevasse fields were preferentially located in regions of compressive surface-parallel mean stress, which we interpret to result from the hydraulic isolation of these systems. This contrasts with unponded crevasse fields, which we suggest are readily able to transport meltwater into the wider supraglacial and englacial network. UAV observations show that ponded crevasses can drain episodically and rapidly, likely through hydrofracture. We therefore propose that the surface stress regime influences a spatially heterogeneous transfer of meltwater through crevasses to the bed of ice sheets, with consequences for processes, such as subglacial drainage and the heating of ice via latent heat release by refreezing meltwater.

TI  - Imaging Updates to Breast Cancer Lymph Node Management
T2  - RADIOGRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Metastatic lymph node involvement in breast cancer is a key determinant of the overall stage of disease and prognosis. Historically, lymph node status was determined by surgery first, with adjuvant treatments determined based on the results of the final surgical pathologic analysis. While this sequence is still applicable in many cases, neoadjuvant systemic treatment (NST) is increasingly being administered as the initial treatment. In cases that demonstrate good therapeutic response to drug therapies, NST may permit the option to perform less radical surgeries subsequently. Current breast cancer treatment has become multidisciplinary, with overlapping roles from the different disciplines. As surgery may be postponed, imaging and image-guided lymph node interventions have gained importance as the primary means of lymph node assessment. Imaging enables evaluation of all regional nodal basins, including locations where surgery is not usually performed. By differentiating limited versus extensive nodal involvement, imaging findings help determine whether initial treatment should be surgical or medical. If medical treatment with NST is indicated, imaging is performed to monitor the in vivo nodal response to drug therapy and ultimately to help determine the surgical technique to perform on the basis of the final imaging findings after NST. The authors discuss the imaging features of nodal metastases and the indications and techniques for the various image-guided procedures. The relative usefulness and shortcomings of the various imaging examinations are reviewed to discuss how they can be applied when biopsy results are not available. The role of imaging in the multidisciplinary team approach is emphasized based on past clinical trials of lymph node management and recent evolving knowledge of breast cancer staging.

TI  - Ten-year outcome results of cT4 breast cancer after neoadjuvant treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives cT4 breast cancer (BC) is classified as noninflammatory breast cancer (non-IBC) or inflammatory breast cancer (IBC). The outcome often is considered worse. The purpose of this study was to determine recurrence and outcomes in overall survival (OS), invasive disease-free survival (IDFS), distant disease-free survival (DDFS) according to pathological complete response (pCR), and inflammatory status. Methods From 2000 to 2015 we selected 634 nonmetastatic cT4 BC patients treated with neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgery at the European Institute of Oncology. OS, IDFS, and DDFS were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method. Results The median follow-up was 9.0 years. Twenty patients underwent only sentinel node biopsy (SNB), 13 SNB + AD, and 601 only AD. Considering the 614 patients with AD, only 2.5% of non-IBC patients reported pCR compared to 15% of IBC cases. Only two axillary recurrences were reported. Ten-year results were 52.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.8-56.5) for OS, 37.0% (95% CI: 32.6-41.3) for IDFS, and 49.8% (95% CI: 45.0-54.4) for DDFS. OS, IDFS, and DDFS were better in all BC with pCR (irrespective of inflammatory status). Conclusion Our long-term results demonstrated that pCR significantly improves survival, reducing locoregional and distant recurrence risk in cT4 tumors with respect to patients with no pCR and according to inflammatory status of cT4 BC.

TI  - Empirical Models for Spatio-Temporal Live Fuel Moisture Content Estimation in Mixed Mediterranean Vegetation Areas Using Sentinel-2 Indices and Meteorological Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Live fuel moisture content (LFMC) is an input factor in fire behavior simulation models highly contributing to fire ignition and propagation. Developing models capable of accurately estimating spatio-temporal changes of LFMC in different forest species is needed for wildfire risk assessment. In this paper, an empirical model based on multivariate linear regression was constructed for the forest cover classified as shrublands in the central part of the Valencian region in the Eastern Mediterranean of Spain in the fire season. A sample of 15 non-monospecific shrubland sites was used to obtain a spatial representation of this type of forest cover in that area. A prediction model was created by combining spectral indices and meteorological variables. This study demonstrates that the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) extracted from Sentinel-2 images and meteorological variables (mean surface temperature and mean wind speed) are a promising combination to derive cost-effective LFMC estimation models. The relationships between LFMC and spectral indices for all sites improved after using an additive site-specific index based on satellite information, reaching a R-adj(2) = 0.70, RMSE = 8.13%, and MAE = 6.33% when predicting the average of LFMC weighted by the canopy cover fraction of each species of all shrub species present in each sampling plot.

TI  - Forest Conservation with Deep Learning: A Deeper Understanding of Human Geography around the Betampona Nature Reserve, Madagascar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Documenting the impacts of climate change and human activities on tropical rainforests is imperative for protecting tropical biodiversity and for better implementation of REDD+ and UN Sustainable Development Goals. Recent advances in very high-resolution satellite sensor systems (i.e., WorldView-3), computing power, and machine learning (ML) have provided improved mapping of fine-scale changes in the tropics. However, approaches so far focused on feature extraction or the extensive tuning of ML parameters, hindering the potential of ML in forest conservation mapping by not using textural information, which is found to be powerful for many applications. Additionally, the contribution of shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands in forest cover mapping is unknown. The objectives were to develop end-to-end mapping of the tropical forest using fully convolution neural networks (FCNNs) with WorldView-3 (WV-3) imagery and to evaluate human impact on the environment using the Betampona Nature Reserve (BNR) in Madagascar as the test site. FCNN (U-Net) using spatial/textural information was implemented and compared with feature-fed pixel-based methods including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). Results show that the FCNN model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 90.9%, while SVM, RF, and DNN provided accuracies of 88.6%, 84.8%, and 86.6%, respectively. When SWIR bands were excluded from the input data, FCNN provided superior performance over other methods with a 1.87% decrease in accuracy, while the accuracies of other models-SVM, RF, and DNN-decreased by 5.42%, 3.18%, and 8.55%, respectively. Spatial-temporal analysis showed a 0.7% increase in Evergreen Forest within the BNR and a 32% increase in tree cover within residential areas likely due to forest regeneration and conservation efforts. Other effects of conservation efforts are also discussed.

TI  - Critical realism as worldview and political attitude
T2  - POLITICA & SOCIETA
M3  - Article
AB  - Political realism and critical attitude have mostly constituted two opposite ways of relating to the political and social world. Critique has often had to confront the limits of what is possible, while reality has frequently been played against aspirations for other political institutions and / or for another way of life in society. The critical realism proposed here is, therefore, in many ways an oxymoron. A strange creature that tries, however, to overcome the limits, the aporias, the paradoxes and, above all, the adaptive outcomes typical of an a-critical realism and the lack of effectiveness and reflexivity of a critique, in some sense, unrealistic. The perspective is, therefore, that of a joint declination of realism and critique in which criticism invests realism itself and in which realism is thought of as a component and not as a limit of the critical effort. Realism thus constitutes both the object of criticism, its target, and the factor that induces critique to reflect on its own, always contingent, potential, on the burdens of one's action and on the conditions of one's own effectiveness. Reality loses any normative value and becomes the tool for awareness of the effects and costs of critical posture.

TI  - Determining Evapotranspiration by Using Combination Equation Models with Sentinel-2 Data and Comparison with Thermal-Based Energy Balance in a California Irrigated Vineyard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A new approach is proposed to derive evapotranspiration (E) and irrigation requirements by implementing the combination equation models of Penman-Monteith and Shuttleworth and Wallace with surface parameters and resistances derived from Sentinel-2 data. Surface parameters are derived from Sentinel-2 and used as an input in these models; namely: the hemispherical shortwave albedo, leaf area index and water status of the soil and canopy ensemble evaluated by using a shortwave infrared-based index. The proposed approach has been validated with data acquired during the GRAPEX (Grape Remote-sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment) in California irrigated vineyards. The E products obtained with the combination equation models are evaluated by using eddy covariance flux tower measurements and are additionally compared with surface energy balance models with Landsat-7 and -8 thermal infrared data. The Shuttleworth and Wallace (S-W S-2) model provides an accuracy comparable to thermal-based methods when using local meteorological data, with daily E errors < 1 mm/day, which increased from 1 to 1.5 mm/day using meteorological forcing data from atmospheric models. The advantage of using the S-W S-2 modeling approach for monitoring ET is the high temporal revisit time of the Sentinel-2 satellites and the finer pixel resolution. These results suggest that, by integrating the thermal-based data fusion approach with the S-W S-2 modeling scheme, there is the potential to increase the frequency and reliability of satellite-based daily evapotranspiration products.

TI  - NIR II Luminescence Imaging for Sentinel Lymph Node and Enhanced Chemo-/Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research, a NIR II luminescence imaging and enhanced chemo-/photothermal therapy system of CuS-DOX- Nd/FA NPs for breast cancer and lymph node tracing under single 808 nm irradiation is proposed. Nd-DTPA molecular cluster with the NIR II imaging effect as the carrier was designed to load the ultrasmall CuS nanoparticles and chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX). The composite probe is used for tumor lesion imaging and tracking the breast cancer sentinel lymph nodes with simultaneous chemo-/ photothermal therapy (PTT) for breast cancer under the single 808 nm laser. This designed probe not only has high permeability and retention (EPR) targeting effect but also can respond to the tumor microenvironment (TME), realizing more precise and efficient release of DOX at the cancer focus. At the same time, CuS as a drug carrier has a good photothermal therapy effect (photothermal conversion efficiency: 27.9%). The serialized released chemotherapy DOX and synergistic PTT effect can be used to the treat the in situ breast cancer land and simultaneously kill the metastasis cancer. The system made the combined molecular clusters Nd-DTPA achieve NIR II imaging of tumor lesions of breast cancer and lymph node to obtain the integration of diagnosis of the transferred disease for better prognosis. The feasibility of the system had obvious tumor growth inhibition effect with NIR II imaging guided is verified by a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.

TI  - Application of remote sensing in environmental impact assessment: a case study of dam rupture in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The collapse of mining tailing dams in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, Brazil, that occurred in 2019 was one of the worst environmental and social disasters witnessed in the country. In this sense, monitoring any impacted areas both before and after the disaster is crucial to understand the actual scenario and problems of disaster management and environmental impact assessment. In order to find answers to that problem, the aim of this study was to identify and analyze the spatiality of the impacted area by rupture of the tailing dam of the Corrego do Feijao mine in Brumadinho, Minas Gerais, by using orbital remote sensing. Land use and land occupation, phytoplankton chlorophyll-a, water turbidity, total suspended solids on water, and carbon sequestration efficiency by vegetation (CO(2)Flux) were estimated by orbital imagery from the Landsat-8/OLI and MSI/Sentinel-2 sensors in order to assess the environmental impacts generated by the disaster. Data were extracted from spectral models in which the variables that best demonstrated the land use variation over the years were sought. Mean comparison by t-test was performed to compare the time series analyzed, that is, before and after the disaster. Through the analysis of water quality, it was observed that the environmental impact was calamitous to natural resources, especially water from Corrego do Feijao.

TI  - Remote Sensing Approach for Monitoring Coastal Wetland in the Mekong Delta, Vietnam: Change Trends and Their Driving Forces
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands in the Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam, provide various vital ecosystem services for the region. These wetlands have experienced critical changes due to the increase in regional anthropogenic activities, global climate change, and the associated sea level rise (SLR). However, documented information and research on the dynamics and drivers of these important wetland areas remain limited for the region. The present study aims to determine the long-term dynamics of wetlands in the south-west coast of the MD using remote sensing approaches, and analyse the potential factors driving these dynamics. Wetland maps from the years 1995, 2002, 2013, and 2020 at a 15 m spatial resolution were derived from Landsat images with the aid of a hybrid classification approach. The accuracy of the wetland maps was relatively high, with overall accuracies ranging from 86-93%. The findings showed that the critical changes over the period 1995/2020 included the expansion of marine water into coastal lands, showing 129% shoreline erosion; a remarkable increase of 345% in aquaculture ponds; and a reduction of forested wetlands and rice fields/other crops by 32% and 73%, respectively. Although mangrove forests slightly increased for the period 2013/2020, the overall trend was also a reduction of 5%. Our findings show that the substantial increase in aquaculture ponds is at the expense of mangroves, forested wetlands, and rice fields/other crops, while shoreline erosion significantly affected coastal lands, especially mangrove forests. The interaction of a set of environmental and socioeconomic factors were responsible for the dynamics. In particular, SLR was identified as one of the main underlying drivers; however, the rapid changes were directly driven by policies on land-use for economic development in the region. The trends of wetland changes and SLR implicate their significant effects on environment, natural resources, food security, and likelihood of communities in the region sustaining for the long-term. These findings can assist in developing and planning appropriate management strategies and policies for wetland protection and conservation, and for sustainable development in the region.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Data on short-term peripheral intravenous catheter-related bloodstream infections per 1,000 peripheral venous catheter days (PIVCR BSIs per 1,000 PVC days) rates from Latin America are not available, so they have not been thoroughly studied. Methods: International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) members conducted a prospective, surveillance study on PIVCR BSIs from January 2010 to March 2018 in 100 intensive care units (ICUs) among 41 hospitals, in 26 cities of 9 countries in Latin America (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican-Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health Safety Network (NHSN) definitions were applied, and INICC methodology and INICC Surveillance Online System software were used. Results: In total, 10,120 ICU patients were followed for 40,078 bed days and 38,262 PVC days. In addition, 79 PIVCR BSIs were identified, with a rate of 2.06 per 1,000 PVC days (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.635-2.257). The average length of stay (ALOS) of patients without a PIVCR BSI was 3.95 days, and the ALOS was 5.29 days for patients with a PIVCR BSI. The crude extra ALOS was 1.34 days (RR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.0975-1.6351; P = .040). The mortality rate in patients without PIVCR BSI was 3.67%, and this rate was 6.33% in patients with a PIVCR BSI. The crude extra mortality was 1.70 times higher. The microorganism profile showed 48.5% gram-positive bacteria (coagulase-negative Staphylococci 25.7%) and 48.5% gram-negative bacteria: Acinetobacter spp, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella spp (8.5% each one), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%), and Candida spp (2.8%). The resistances of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0% to amikacin and 50% to meropenem. The resistance of Acinetobacter baumanii to amikacin was 0%, and the resistance of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus to oxacillin was 75%. Conclusions: Our PIVCR BSI rates were higher than rates from more economically developed countries and were similar to those of countries with limited resources.

TI  - Multi-criteria decision based geospatial mapping of flood susceptibility and temporal hydro-geomorphic changes in the Subarnarekha basin, India
T2  - GEOSCIENCE FRONTIERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Subarnarekha River in east India experiences frequent high magnitude flooding in monsoon season. In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of flood hydrology and GIS-based flood susceptibility mapping of the entire catchment. About 40 years of annual peak discharge data, historical cross-sections of different gauging sites, and 12 flood conditioning factors were considered. Our flood susceptibility mapping followed an expert knowledge-based multi-parametric analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and optimized AHP-VIP methods. Peak hydrology data indicated more than 5 times higher discharge contrasted with the mean streamflow of the peak monsoon month in all hydro-monitoring stations that correspond to possible overbank flooding in the shallow semi-alluvial reaches of the Subarnarekha River. Width-depth ratio revealed continuous changes on the channel cross-sections at decadal scale in all gauging sites. Predicted flood susceptibility map through optimized AHP-VIP method showed a great amount of areas (38%) have a high probability of flooding and demands earnest attention of administrative bodies. The AHP-VIP based flood susceptibility map was theoritically validated through AUC approach and it showed fairly high accuracy (AUC = 0.93). Our study offers an exceptionally cost and time effective solution to the flooding issues in the Subarnarekha basin. (C) 2021 China University of Geosciences (Beijing) and Peking University.

TI  - Detecting Pipeline Pathways in Landsat 5 Satellite Images with Deep Learning
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Energy system modeling is essential in analyzing present and future system configurations motivated by the energy transition. Energy models need various input data sets at different scales, including detailed information about energy generation and transport infrastructure. However, accessing such data sets is not straightforward and often restricted, especially for energy infrastructure data. We present a detection model for the automatic recognition of pipeline pathways using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to address this lack of energy infrastructure data sets. The model was trained with historical low-resolution satellite images of the construction phase of British gas transport pipelines, made with the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper instrument. The satellite images have been automatically labeled with the help of high-resolution pipeline route data provided by the respective Transmission System Operator (TSO). We have used data augmentation on the training data and trained our model with four different initial learning rates. The models trained with the different learning rates have been validated with 5-fold cross-validation using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric. We show that our model can reliably identify pipeline pathways despite the comparably low resolution of the used satellite images. Further, we have successfully tested the model's capability in other geographic regions by deploying satellite images of the NEL pipeline in Northern Germany.

TI  - Monitoring the Recovery after 2016 Hurricane Matthew in Haiti via Markovian Multitemporal Region-Based Modeling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this paper is to address the monitoring of the recovery phase in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew (28 September-10 October 2016) in the town of Jeremie, southwestern Haiti. This is accomplished via a novel change detection method that has been formulated, in a data fusion perspective, in terms of multitemporal supervised classification. The availability of very high resolution images provided by last-generation satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and optical sensors makes this analysis promising from an application perspective and simultaneously challenging from a processing viewpoint. Indeed, pursuing such a goal requires the development of novel methodologies able to exploit the large amount of detailed information provided by this type of data. To take advantage of the temporal and spatial information associated with such images, the proposed method integrates multisensor, multisource, and contextual information. Markov random field modeling is adopted here to integrate the spatial context and the temporal correlation associated with images acquired at different dates. Moreover, the adoption of a region-based approach allows for the characterization of the geometrical structures in the images through multiple segmentation maps at different scales and times. The performances of the proposed approach are evaluated on multisensor pairs of COSMO-SkyMed SAR and Pleiades optical images acquired over Jeremie, in the aftermath of and during the three years after Hurricane Matthew. The effectiveness of the change detection results is analyzed both quantitatively, through the computation of accuracy measures on a test set, and qualitatively, by visual inspection of the classification maps. The robustness of the proposed method with respect to different algorithmic choices is also assessed, and the detected changes are discussed in relation to the recovery endeavors in the area and ground-truth data collected in the field in April 2019.

TI  - Geodetic Model of the March 2021 Thessaly Seismic Sequence Inferred from Seismological and InSAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we propose a geodetic model for the March 2021 Thessaly seismic sequence (TSS). We used the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technique and exploited a dataset of Sentinel-1 images to successfully detect the surface deformation caused by three major events of the sequence and constrain their kinematics, further strengthened by seismic data analysis. Our geodetic inversions are consistent with the activation of distinct blind faults previously unknown in this region: three belonging to the NE-dipping normal fault associated with the Mw 6.3 and Mw 6.0 events, and one belonging to the SW-dipping normal fault associated with the Mw 5.6, the last TSS major event. We performed a Coulomb stress transfer analysis and a 1D pore pressure diffusivity modeling to investigate the space-time evolution of the sequence; our results indicate that the seismic sequence developed in a sort of domino effect. The combination of the lack of historical records of large earthquakes in this area and the absence of mapped surface features produced by past faulting make seismic hazard estimation difficult for this area: InSAR data analysis and modeling have proven to be an extremely useful tool in helping to constrain the rupture characteristics.

TI  - The role of fluorescent and hybrid tracers in radioguided surgery in urogenital malignancies
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing availability of new imaging technologies and tracers has enhanced the application of nuclear molecular imaging in urogenital interventions. In this context, preoperative nuclear imaging and radioactivity-based intraoperative surgical guidance have become important tools for the identification and anatomical allocation of tumor lesions and/or suspected lymph nodes. Fluorescence guidance can provide visual identification of the preoperatively defined lesions during surgery. However, the added value of fluorescence guidance is still mostly unlaiown. This review provides an overview of the role of fluorescence imaging in radioguided surgery in urogenital malignancies. The sentinel node (SN) biopsy procedure using hybrid tracers (radioactive and fluorescent component) serves as a prominent example for in-depth evaluation of the complementary value of radio- and fluorescence guidance. The first large . patient cohort and long-term follow-up studies show: 1) improvement in the SN identification rate compared to blue dye; 2) improved detection of cancer-positive SNs; and 3) hints towards a positive effect on (biochemical) recurrence rates compared to extended lymph node dissection. The hybrid tracer approach also highlights the necessity of a preoperative roadmap in preventing incomplete resection. Recent developments focus on receptor-targeted approaches that allow intraoperative identification of tumor tissue. Here radioguidance is still leading, but fluorescent and hybrid tracers are also finding their way into the clinic. Emerging multiwavelength approaches that allow concomitant visualization of different anatomical features within the surgical field may provide the next step towards even more refined procedures.

TI  - Bridging Spirituality/Religiousness and Ecotherapy: Four Psychospiritual Themes to Guide Conceptualization and Practice
T2  - ECOPSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in the ecopsychology literature have yielded an increasing plurality of ecotherapy orientations. Simultaneously, clients' religious and spiritual (R/S) worldviews are becoming more diverse. Ecopsychology and ecotherapy, however, carry a common set of assumptions consistent with earth-based spirituality and religiousness. Though theoretically congruent this may be problematic; the worldview most common to American culture and clients-Christianity, and specifically Christian dualism-is understood and practiced in ways at odds with the holistic and ecocentric worldview of ecotherapy. Level One ecotherapy practices may not overtly cause dissonance for clients of all R/S persuasions, but how can ecotherapists make the riches of a Level Two ecospiritual worldview available without imposing values? Differentiating Level One ecotherapy from Level Two ecotherapy is a foundational step, but more work is still needed to align ecotherapy with many clients' worldviews. This article applies parts of the Ways Paradigm framework-the four psychospiritual themes of self, suffering, change, and flourishing-to conceptualize and bridge Level Two ecospiritual insights with a broader range of R/S traditions. Case applications are provided.

TI  - Potential and Challenges of Harmonizing 40 Years of AVHRR Data: The TIMELINE Experience
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth Observation satellite data allows for the monitoring of the surface of our planet at predefined intervals covering large areas. However, there is only one medium resolution sensor family in orbit that enables an observation time span of 40 and more years at a daily repeat interval. This is the AVHRR sensor family. If we want to investigate the long-term impacts of climate change on our environment, we can only do so based on data that remains available for several decades. If we then want to investigate processes with respect to climate change, we need very high temporal resolution enabling the generation of long-term time series and the derivation of related statistical parameters such as mean, variability, anomalies, and trends. The challenges to generating a well calibrated and harmonized 40-year-long time series based on AVHRR sensor data flown on 14 different platforms are enormous. However, only extremely thorough pre-processing and harmonization ensures that trends found in the data are real trends and not sensor-related (or other) artefacts. The generation of European-wide time series as a basis for the derivation of a multitude of parameters is therefore an extremely challenging task, the details of which are presented in this paper.

TI  - On-Board Volcanic Eruption Detection through CNNs and Satellite Multispectral Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the growth of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms has raised the number of studies including their applicability in a variety of different scenarios. Among all, one of the hardest ones is the aerospace, due to its peculiar physical requirements. In this context, a feasibility study, with a prototype of an on board Artificial Intelligence (AI) model, and realistic testing equipment and scenario are presented in this work. As a case study, the detection of volcanic eruptions has been investigated with the objective to swiftly produce alerts and allow immediate interventions. Two Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been designed and realized from scratch, showing how to efficiently implement them for identifying the eruptions and at the same time adapting their complexity in order to fit on board requirements. The CNNs are then tested with experimental hardware, by means of a drone with a paylod composed of a generic processing unit (Raspberry PI), an AI processing unit (Movidius stick) and a camera. The hardware employed to build the prototype is low-cost, easy to found and to use. Moreover, the dataset has been published on GitHub, made available to everyone. The results are promising and encouraging toward the employment of the proposed system in future missions, given that ESA has already moved the first steps of AI on board with the Phisat-1 satellite, launched on September 2020.

TI  - Modelling, Characterizing, and Monitoring Boreal Forest Wetland Bird Habitat with RADARSAT-2 and Landsat-8 Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation technologies have strong potential to help map and monitor wildlife habitats. Yellow Rail, a rare wetland obligate bird species, is a species of concern in Canada and provides an interesting case study for monitoring wetland habitat with Earth observation data. Yellow Rail has highly specific habitat requirements characterized by shallowly flooded graminoid vegetation, the availability of which varies seasonally and year-to-year. Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) in combination with optical data should, in theory, be a great resource for mapping and monitoring these habitats. This study evaluates the use of RADARSAT-2 data and Landsat-8 data to characterize, map, and monitor Yellow Rail habitat in a wetland area within the mineable oil sands region. Specifically, we investigate: (1) The relative importance of polarimetric SAR and Landsat-8 data for predicting Yellow Rail habitat; (2) characterization of wetland habitat with polarimetric SAR data; (3) yearly trends in available habitat; and (4) predictions of potentially suitable habitat across northeastern Alberta. Results show that polarimetric SAR using the Freeman-Durden decomposition and polarization ratios were the most important predictors when modeling the Yellow Rail habitat. These parameters also effectively characterize this habitat based on high congruence with existing descriptions of suitable habitat. Applying the prediction model across all wetland areas showed accurate predictions of occurrence (validated on field occurrence data), and high probability habitats were constrained to very specific wetland areas. Using the RADARSAT-2 data to monitor yearly changes to Yellow Rail habitat was inconclusive, likely due to the different image acquisition times of the 2014 and 2016 images, which may have captured seasonal, rather than inter-annual, wetland dynamics. Polarimetric SAR has proved to be very useful for capturing the specific hydrology and vegetation structure of the Yellow Rail habitat, which could be a powerful technology for monitoring and conserving wetland species habitat.

TI  - Misinformation in the Information Space of Ukrainian Society during the Covid-19 Pandemic
T2  - POSTMODERN OPENINGS
M3  - Article
AB  - The specificity of misinformation about Covid-19 which was outspread in the media landscape of Ukrainian society was demonstrated in the article. The authors relying on the basics of postmodern theory within interdisciplinary discourse trace the means of forming misinformation and its influence on changing worldview landmarks of humanity. The authors underline that information in the postmodern conception of Jean Baudrillard is also capable to destroy its own content, communication and social ground. Misinformation about Covid-19 is 'a stage setting of communication" since it only creates insight into sense and is outspreaded with different channels (traditional and new media) with usage of photographic and video materials, emotional headlines and messages. Fake materials which have been outspreaded in online media and social networks are analyzed in the article. The authors found out that fake messages outspreaded in Ukrainian media refer to the following topic (the origin of Covid-19; frauds under the guise of doctors try to get the money of nationals; fictional money penalties for breaking the rules of quarantine; pseudomedical recommendations for taking some medicines and means of diagnosis Covid-19; statements of public authorities about strengthening the regime of quarantine; the speed of spreading Covid-19 in other countries; insufficient readiness of the Ukrainian society to Covid-19, etc.). It is stated that quick expansion of misinformation was facilitated by the fact that the nationals of Ukraine took information without criticism, without fact-checking, since they moved to a new space of life of individual and made 'a stage setting of sense".

TI  - Understanding the Links between LULC Changes and SUHI in Cities: Insights from Two-Decadal Studies (2001-2020)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - An urban heat island (UHI) is a serious phenomenon associated with built environments and presents threats to human health. It is projected that UHI intensity will rise to record levels in the following decades due to rapid urban expansion, as two-thirds of the world population is expected to live in urban areas by 2050. Nevertheless, the last two decades have seen a considerable increase in the number of studies on surface UHI (SUHI)-a form of UHI quantified based on land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite imagery-and its relationship with the land use/cover (LULC) changes. This surge has been facilitated by the availability of freely accessible five-decade archived remotely sensed data, the use of state-of-art analysis methods, and advancements in computing capabilities. The authors of this systematic review aimed to summarize, compare, and critically analyze multiple case studies-carried out from 2001 to 2020-in terms of various aspects: study area characteristics, data sources, methods for LULC classification and SUHI quantification, mechanisms of interaction coupled with linking techniques between SUHI intensity with LULC spatial and temporal changes, and proposed alleviation actions. The review could support decision-makers and pave the way for scholars to conduct future research, especially in vulnerable cities that have not been well studied.

TI  - Statistical analysis of active fire remote sensing data: examples from South Asia
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Active fires emit aerosols and greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. In this paper, the behavior of active fires over a period of 1 year in Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka is studied using spatial statistics. In these countries, these fires are mainly forest and vegetation fires; they wreak havoc to the environment by damaging flora and fauna and emitting toxic gases. This study is based on data acquired through remote sensing of data acquisition platform, NASA's MODIS. Spatial statistics is used here to study the incidence of such fires with respect to geographical location. The behaviors of parameters of various autoregressive models like Spatial Durban Model, Spatial Lag Model, Spatial Error Model, Manski Model, and Kelegian Prucha Model are minutely analyzed. The best model with the highest pseudo R-2 is selected. The spatial behavior of the fire radiative power (FRP) for the three countries is also predicted using spatial interpolation and kriging. The burning potential of vegetations in unsampled areas is envisaged by thus predicting FRP. This study gives a country-wise perspective to the behavior of fire; this is with reference to South Asia. It holds a great significance for countries of the developing world which lack a strong backbone of good-quality official records. Through the statistical analyses of data collected by such platforms, important information on impact of forest fires can be indirectly assessed.

TI  - One-Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) of Sentinel Lymph Node in Early-Stage Endometrial Cancer: Spanish Multicenter Study (ENDO-OSNA)
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple Summary One-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) is an automated molecular diagnostic assay used to detect metastases by analyzing the levels of cytokeratin 19 mRNA in whole lymph nodes. It has been validated as an accurate and reliable tool for staging in several types of cancers and is included in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines for the management of breast cancer. ENDO-OSNA is a large, observational, multicenter study designed to evaluate the efficacy of OSNA for the detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer. We found that the OSNA assay shows higher sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy in the detection of SLN metastasis, including low-volume metastasis, compared to standard pathological ultrastaging. Moreover, OSNA could aid in the identification of patients with intermediate or high-risk endometrial cancer, and lead to treatment decisions that could improve their prognosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) for the detection of sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis compared to standard pathological ultrastaging in patients with early-stage endometrial cancer (EC). A total of 526 SLNs from 191 patients with EC were included in the study, and 379 SLNs (147 patients) were evaluated by both methods, OSNA and standard pathological ultrastaging. The central 1 mm portion of each lymph node was subjected to semi-serial sectioning at 200 mu m intervals and examined by hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemistry with CK19; the remaining tissue was analyzed by OSNA for CK19 mRNA. The OSNA assay detected metastases in 19.7% of patients (14.9% micrometastasis and 4.8% macrometastasis), whereas pathological ultrastaging detected metastasis in 8.8% of patients (3.4% micrometastasis and 5.4% macrometastasis). Using the established cut-off value for detecting SLN metastasis by OSNA in EC (250 copies/mu L), the sensitivity of the OSNA assay was 92%, specificity was 82%, diagnostic accuracy was 83%, and the negative predictive value was 99%. Discordant results between both methods were recorded in 20 patients (13.6%). OSNA resulted in an upstaging in 12 patients (8.2%). OSNA could aid in the identification of patients requiring adjuvant treatment at the time of diagnosis.

TI  - Protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding and effectiveness of maternal vaccination in reducing pertussis-like illness
T2  - JORNAL DE PEDIATRIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To assess the protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding and the effectiveness of maternal vaccination in reducing pertussis-like illness.Method: This was a case-control study conducted in sentinel hospitals for pertussis in Recife between July 2016 and July 2018. Cases included children aged under six months with symptoms compatible with pertussis (pertussis-like illness). Controls included children aged under six months, living in the metropolitan region of Recife with no diagnosis of pertussis-like illness and matched by the same hospital and birth date.Results: Seventy-three cases and 194 controls were included. The diagnosis of pertussis-like illness was predominantly clinical (97,2%). Amongst the main symptoms, paroxysmal cough was observed in 95.89% of cases and vomiting in 53.4%. There were 29 hospitalized cases and no deaths. Out of the 73 cases, 47 were born to mothers vaccinated against pertussis during pregnancy, and the mothers of 144 of the 194 controls had been vaccinated. The protective effect of breastfeeding was of 74% (95% CI;38%, 89%). Children younger than six months, who were exclusively breastfed and with mothers vaccinated against pertussis during pregnancy were 5 times less likely to develop pertussis-like illness, corresponding to a protection of 79% (95% CI;31%, 94%). The effectiveness of maternal vaccination against pertussis-like illness in children under six months was low (27%) and not statistically significant (CI 95%; -34% a 60%).Conclusions: Exclusive breastfeeding protects children under six months from pertussis-like illness and may be enhanced when associated with maternal vaccination. These strategies should be encouraged because they also protect against pertussis-like illnesses. (C) 2021 Sociedade Brasileira de Pediatria. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

TI  - Digital Examination of Vegetation Changes in River Floodplain Wetlands Based on Remote Sensing Images: A Case Study Based on the Downstream Section of Hailar River
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Hailar River is an important river in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. It plays an extremely important role in maintaining the ecological balance of the region. However, in recent decades, the Hailar River and its surrounding areas have been developed at a high rate and its wetland resources have faced various threats. In this study, vegetation changes in the Hailar River wetlands were analyzed using remote sensing data from the Landsat TM (1987, 2001, and 2010) and Landsat OLI-TIRS (2019) satellites. A vegetation change model was developed using Matlab software to assess vegetation changes in the area. There were significant changes in the wetland vegetation of the lower Hailar River study site between 1987 and 2019. There was an increase in open sand habitat with a sparse vegetation area of 1.08 km(2), a decrease in grassland area of 13.17 km(2), and an increase in the forest area of 15.91 km(2). The spatial distribution of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) varied across the study site and was high overall. The vegetation types varied with distance from the river. There are two possible explanations for positive and negative vegetation change trends. In areas where the water supply is sufficient and relatively stable, the cover of forest vegetation was gradually increasing and the herbaceous plant community is gradually evolving into a scrub woodland plant community. In areas where the water supply is lacking, there are changes in the sense of a decrease of forest vegetation and an increase of open sand habitat with sparse vegetation. Therefore, this study suggests that the existing wetlands should be protected, used wisely, and developed rationally to provide sustainable resources for the next generation.

TI  - UASea: A Data Acquisition Toolbox for Improving Marine Habitat Mapping
T2  - DRONES
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are widely used in the acquisition of high-resolution information in the marine environment. Although the potential applications of UAS in marine habitat mapping are constantly increasing, many limitations need to be overcome-most of which are related to the prevalent environmental conditions-to reach efficient UAS surveys. The knowledge of the UAS limitations in marine data acquisition and the examination of the optimal flight conditions led to the development of the UASea toolbox. This study presents the UASea, a data acquisition toolbox that is developed for efficient UAS surveys in the marine environment. The UASea uses weather forecast data (i.e., wind speed, cloud cover, precipitation probability, etc.) and adaptive thresholds in a ruleset that calculates the optimal flight times in a day for the acquisition of reliable marine imagery using UAS in a given day. The toolbox provides hourly positive and negative suggestions, based on optimal or non-optimal survey conditions in a day, calculated according to the ruleset calculations. We acquired UAS images in optimal and non-optimal conditions and estimated their quality using an image quality equation. The image quality estimates are based on the criteria of sunglint presence, sea surface texture, water turbidity, and image naturalness. The overall image quality estimates were highly correlated with the suggestions of the toolbox, with a correlation coefficient of -0.84. The validation showed that 40% of the toolbox suggestions were a positive match to the images with higher quality. Therefore, we propose the optimal flight times to acquire reliable and accurate UAS imagery in the coastal environment through the UASea. The UASea contributes to proper flight planning and efficient UAS surveys by providing valuable information for mapping, monitoring, and management of the marine environment, which can be used globally in research and marine applications.

TI  - An Improved Cloud Gap-Filling Method for Longwave Infrared Land Surface Temperatures through Introducing Passive Microwave Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) data are most commonly observed in the longwave infrared (LWIR) spectral region. However, such data suffer frequent gaps in coverage caused by cloud cover. Filling these 'cloud gaps' usually relies on statistical re-constructions using proximal clear sky LST pixels, whilst this is often a poor surrogate for shadowed LSTs insulated under cloud. Another solution is to rely on passive microwave (PM) LST data that are largely unimpeded by cloud cover impacts, the quality of which, however, is limited by the very coarse spatial resolution typical of PM signals. Here, we combine aspects of these two approaches to fill cloud gaps in the LWIR-derived LST record, using Kenya (East Africa) as our study area. The proposed "cloud gap-filling" approach increases the coverage of daily Aqua MODIS LST data over Kenya from 90%. Evaluations were made against the in situ and SEVIRI-derived LST data respectively, revealing root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 2.6 K and 3.6 K for the proposed method by mid-day, compared with RMSEs of 4.3 K and 6.7 K for the conventional proximal-pixel-based statistical re-construction method. We also find that such accuracy improvements become increasingly apparent when the total cloud cover residence time increases in the morning-to-noon time frame. At mid-night, cloud gap-filling performance is also better for the proposed method, though the RMSE improvement is far smaller (<0.3 K) than in the mid-day period. The results indicate that our proposed two-step cloud gap-filling method can improve upon performances achieved by conventional methods for cloud gap-filling and has the potential to be scaled up to provide data at continental or global scales as it does not rely on locality-specific knowledge or datasets.

TI  - Tumor-draining lymph nodes: At the crossroads of metastasis and immunity
T2  - SCIENCE IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Early engagement of the lymphatic system by solid tumors in peripheral, nonlymphoid tissues is a clinical hallmark of cancer and often forecasts poor prognosis. The significance of lymph node metastasis for distant spread, however, has been questioned by large-scale lymph node dissection trials and the likely prevalence of direct hematogenous metastasis. Still, an emerging appreciation for the immunological role of the tumor-draining lymph node has renewed interest in its basic biology, role in metastatic progression, antitumor immunity, and patient outcomes. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the early mechanisms through which tumors engage lymphatic transport and condition tumor-draining lymph nodes, the significance of these changes for both metastasis and immunity, and potential implications of the tumor-draining lymph node for immunotherapy.

TI  - The Effect of Synergistic Approaches of Features and Ensemble Learning Algorith on Aboveground Biomass Estimation of Natural Secondary Forests Based on ALS and Landsat 8
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the combination of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data and optical imagery and machine learning algorithms were proved to improve the estimation of aboveground biomass (AGB), the synergistic approaches of different data and ensemble learning algorithms have not been fully investigated, especially for natural secondary forests (NSFs) with complex structures. This study aimed to explore the effects of the two factors on AGB estimation of NSFs based on ALS data and Landsat 8 imagery. The synergistic method of extracting novel features (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) using optimal Landsat 8 features and the best-performing ALS feature (i.e., elevation mean) yielded higher accuracy of AGB estimation than either optical-only or ALS-only features. However, both of them failed to improve the accuracy compared to the simple combination of the untransformed features that generated them. The convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was much superior to other classic machine learning algorithms no matter of features. The stacked generalization (SG) algorithms, a kind of ensemble learning algorithms, greatly improved the accuracies compared to the corresponding base model, and the SG with the CNN meta-model performed best. This study provides technical support for a wall-to-wall AGB mapping of NSFs of northeastern China using efficient features and algorithms.

TI  - Fog Season Risk Assessment for Maritime Transportation Systems Exploiting Himawari-8 Data: A Case Study in Bohai Sea, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea fog is a disastrous marine phenomenon for ship navigation. Sea fog reduces visibility at sea and has a great impact on the safety of ship navigation, which may lead to catastrophic accidents. Geostationary orbit satellites such as Himawari-8 make it possible to monitor sea fog over large areas of the sea. In this paper, a framework for marine navigation risk evaluation in fog seasons is developed based on Himawari-8 satellite data, which includes: (1) a sea fog identification method for Himawari-8 satellite data based on multilayer perceptron; (2) a navigation risk evaluation model based on the CRITIC objective weighting method, which, along with the sea fog identification method, allows us to obtain historical sea fog data and marine environmental data, such as properties related to wind, waves, ocean currents, and water depth to evaluate navigation risks; and (3) a way to determine shipping routes based on the Delaunay triangulation method to carry out risk analyses of specific navigation areas. This paper uses global information system mapping technology to get navigation risk maps in different seasons in Bohai Sea and its surrounding waters. The proposed sea fog identification method is verified by CALIPSO vertical feature mask data, and the navigation risk evaluation model is verified by historical accident data. The probability of detection is 81.48% for sea fog identification, and the accident matching rate of the navigation risk evaluation model is 80% in fog seasons.

TI  - Applicability of CHIR PS-based satellite rainfall estimates for South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Long-term rainfall data with good spatial and temporal distribution is essential for all climaterelated analyses. The availability of observed rainfall data has become increasingly problematic over the years due to a limited and deteriorating rainfall station network, occasioned by limited reporting and/or quality control of rainfall and, in some cases, closure of these stations. Remotely sensed satellite-based rainfall data sets offer an alternative source of information. In this study, daily and monthly rainfall data derived from Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation (CHIRPS) is compared with observed rainfall data from 46 stations evenly distributed across South Africa. Various metrics, based on a pairwise comparison between the observed and CHIRPS data, were applied to evaluate CHIRPS performance in the estimation of daily and monthly rainfall. The results show that CHIRPS data correlate well with observed monthly rainfall data for all stations used, having an average coefficient of determination of 0.6 and bias of 0.95. This study concludes that monthly CHIRPS data corresponds well, with good precision and relatively little bias when compared to observed monthly rainfall data, and can therefore be considered for use in conjunction with observed rainfall data where no or limited data is available in South Africa for hydrological analysis.

TI  - Assessment of Land Use/Land Cover Change and Morphometric Parameters in the Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar Site, Ghana
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid urbanization, industrialization, agricultural activities, and increasing trend of some natural hazards, such as climate change, particularly in coastal areas, necessitate the continual assessment of critical but fragile ecosystems like that of the Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar Site (KLCRS). This productive ecosystem in Ghana faces serious threats from intensive exploitation, physical modification, changes in water regime, and water pollution. The current study employed geospatial and intensity analysis to assess the pattern of land use/land cover (LULC) change for almost the past three decades and morphometric parameters of the KLCRS landscape. Landsat Satellite images for 1991, 2007, and 2020 were acquired to uncover the pattern of LULC change, while morphometric changes were assessed using global Advance Space Thermal Emission and Radiometer (ASTER) digital elevation model (DEM) data and the spatial analyst tools in GIS software. The result established that the acceleration of land transformation was intensive between 2007 and 2020, which could be linked to population growth and increased socio-economic activities. There was a net gross gain of built-up that originated largely from the conversion of marsh, dense vegetation, and cultivated land. Prior to this period, cultivated land recorded net gain (125.51 km(2)) between 1991 and 2007, whereas dense vegetation and marshland showed a net loss of 151.37 km(2) and 2.44 km(2), respectively. The gain of cultivated land largely targeted marshland in both time intervals. The construction of saltpans contributed largely to the small increase in water extent. The morphometric analysis revealed the groundwater potential of the KLCRS. The low-lying nature of the landscape makes the area susceptible to coastal flooding. The trend of the observed changes could invariably affect the ecological integrity of the landscape, hence suggesting the need for immediate preparation and implementation of marine and coastal spatial plans by relevant stakeholders.

TI  - Augmenting the Standard Operating Procedures of Health and Air Quality Stakeholders With NASA Resources
T2  - GEOHEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - The combination of air quality (AQ) data from satellites and low-cost sensor systems, along with output from AQ models, have the potential to augment high-quality, regulatory-grade data in countries with in situ monitoring networks and provide much needed AQ information in countries without them, including Low and Moderate Income Countries (LMICs). We demonstrate the potential of free and publicly available USA National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) resources, which include capacity building activities, satellite data, and global AQ forecasts, to provide cost-effective, and reliable AQ information to health and AQ professionals around the world. We provide illustrative case studies that highlight how global AQ forecasts along with satellite data may be used to characterize AQ on urban to regional scales, including to quantify pollution concentrations, identify pollution sources, and track the long-range transport of pollution. We also provide recommendations to data product developers to facilitate and broaden usage of NASA resources by health and AQ stakeholders.Plain Language Summary We demonstrate that free and publicly available USA National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) resources, which include capacity building activities, satellite data, and global air quality (AQ) forecasts, have the potential to augment air pollution data from surface monitors and low-cost sensors. These resources are valuable for health and air quality stakeholders who have no or little access to air pollution data for their communities. For instance, they are a viable and cost-effective option for stakeholders in Low and Moderate Income Countries (LMICs) to acquire the data necessary for monitoring air quality trends, assessing the efficacy of emission controls, daily risk communication and local health studies. Such an approach to air quality monitoring combines the strengths of these monitoring technologies (i.e., regulatory-grade stationary monitors, satellite data, low-cost sensors, and air quality forecast models). We also provide recommendations to data product developers to facilitate and broaden usage of NASA resources by health and AQ stakeholders.

TI  - Assessing the potential of soil erosion in Kyrgyzstan based on RUSLE, integrated with remote sensing
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a serious ecological and economic issue occurring in all regions across the biosphere. Soil erosion contributes to land degradation, endangering both the pastoral and natural environments in Kyrgyzstan. This study objective is to identify the potential of soil erosion in Kyrgyzstan and estimate the total soil loss rate. The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) model with remote sensing (RS) was used to show the distribution of risk zones of soil erosion and soil loss. Variables were obtained from Kyrgyz Hydro-Meteorological agency, Harmonized World Soil Data (HWSD), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MOD13Q1-MODIS/Terra), Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and Global Land Cover Map (GlobeLand30). The study results display that the average annual soil erosion amount in Kyrgyzstan was 5.95 t ha(-1) year(-1), with an annual soil loss of 113.7 x 10(6) t year(-1). The entire area was separated into seven erosion risk classes. More than 28% of the territory of Kyrgyzstan is affected by limited soil erosion; the average volume of potential erosion is around 1.0 t ha(-1) year(-1). The northeastern and central parts of the country mainly experienced low soil erosion, whereas the west and southwestern parts were subject to high-to-extremely high soil erosion rates. This is the first time this method has been used to estimate the potential of soil loss throughout the country; it provides suitable tools for identifying priority areas for considering measures to decrease soil erosion risk. Our findings give valuable implementations for assessing soil loss and protecting the environment.

TI  - Combining Optical and Radar Satellite Imagery to Investigate the Surface Properties and Evolution of the Lordsburg Playa, New Mexico, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Driven by erodible soil, hydrological stresses, land use/land cover (LULC) changes, and meteorological parameters, windblown dust events initiated from Lordsburg Playa, New Mexico, United States, threaten public safety and health through low visibility and exposure to dust emissions. Combining optical and radar satellite imagery products can provide invaluable benefits in characterizing surface properties of desert playas-a potent landform for wind erosion. The optical images provide a long-term data record, while radar images can observe land surface irrespective of clouds, darkness, and precipitation. As a home for optical and radar imagery, powerful algorithms, cloud computing infrastructure, and application programming interface applications, Google Earth Engine (GEE) is an invaluable resource facilitating acquisition, processing, and analysis. In this study, the fractional abundance of soil, vegetation, and water endmembers were determined from pixel mixtures using the linear spectral unmixing model in GEE for Lordsburg Playa. For this approach, Landsat 5 and 8 images at 30 m spatial resolution and Sentinel-2 images at 10-20 m spatial resolution were used. Employing the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques, the playa's land surface changes and possible sinks for sediment loading from the surrounding catchment area were identified. In this data recipe, a pair of Sentinel-1 images bracketing a monsoon day with high rainfall and a pair of images representing spring (dry, windy) and monsoon seasons were used. The combination of optical and radar images significantly improved the effort to identify long-term changes in the playa and locations within the playa susceptible to hydrological stresses and LULC changes. The linear spectral unmixing algorithm addressed the limitation of Landsat and Sentinel-2 images related to their moderate spatial resolutions. The application of GEE facilitated the study by minimizing the time required for acquisition, processing, and analysis of images, and storage required for the big satellite data.

TI  - Combining Satellite Data and Spatial Analysis to Assess the UHI Amplitude and Structure within Urban Areas: The Case of Moroccan Cities
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat-8 surface temperature and the European Space Agency land cover are used to assess the impact of land cover on the Urban Heat Island (UHI) and Urban Heat Sink (UHS). We analyzed five Moroccan cities selected for their different local climate, size, and typology during summer at three different spatial scales. The results show multiple causes defining the different forms and amplitudes of the UHI, namely: the ambient climate, the proximity to the sea, the presence of landscaped areas, and the color of building roofs and walls. Contrary to what was expected, the vegetation was not systematically an island of coolness, either because of its typology or its irrigation status. In the coastal cities of Tangier and Casablanca, UHIs around 20 degrees C are observed on the seaside, whereas a UHS of up to 11 degrees C is observed between the city center and the southern periphery of Casablanca. A moderate amplitude UHI of 7 degrees C is formed in the mountainous city of Ifrane. For cities built in desert-like environments, well-defined UHSs between 9 degrees C and 12 degrees C are observed in Smara and Marrakech, respectively. At a finer scale, towns recorded lower temperatures than their immediate surroundings, which are attributed to evaporation from irrigated plants.

TI  - Monitoring agricultural water in the desert environment of New Valley Governorate for sustainable agricultural development: a case study of Kharga
T2  - EURO-MEDITERRANEAN JOURNAL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The New Valley Governorate (NVG) is characterized by a desert climate, with almost no rainfall during the year. Water shortages are a significant problem in this region, and farmers depend on underground water to irrigate their crops, which is reflected in the quantity and quality of the water used for cultivation. The primary aim of this study was to track the interaction between agricultural water use and changes in the agricultural system in the NVG. To distinguish between significant crops, the multitemporal normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI) derived from Sentinel-2 imagery was used. The FAO Penman-Monteith model (FPM) is considered a global standard method for estimating the reference evapotranspiration (ETo). However, this requires the values of several environmental variables (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation) obtained from weather reports. Based on NDVI data, the crop coefficient (Kc) is calculated. The Kc and ETo equations were used to estimate the crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Based on data from Sentinel-2, Kc was found to range from 0 to 1.2 in the study area and ETc ranged from 0 to 7.5 mm/day during the winter season of 2019/2020. While the vegetation cover increased from 6721 fed in 2000 to 9375 fed in 2010, there was a much greater increase from 9375 fed in 2010 to 22,869 fed in 2020. Over the period 2000-2020, the agricultural area increased by 244% in the NVG, thus greatly increasing water consumption in this region. Therefore, more detailed studies of groundwater depletion and quality in the NVG are needed.

TI  - Advances in management of nonendometrioid endometrial carcinoma, with an emphasis on the sentinel lymph node technique
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review During the last few years there have been important advances in our understanding of endometrial cancer biology, staging, and therapy. In this article, we discuss updates and controversies in the treatment of nonendometrioid endometrial carcinoma (non-EEC), with an emphasis on the role of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. Recent findings Lymph node involvement is an important factor in determining prognosis and guiding adjuvant therapy in endometrial carcinoma. SLN biopsy has emerged as a less morbid alternative to lymphadenectomy in surgical staging, and it has generally gained acceptance in the setting of low-grade endometrial carcinoma; however, its role in the setting of high-grade disease remains a topic of debate. Several prospective studies have demonstrated the accuracy of SLN biopsy in detecting nodal metastasis in high-grade endometrial carcinoma. Retrospective series have compared oncologic outcomes of patients with high-grade disease, surgically staged by SLN biopsy, to those staged with lymphadenectomy, and have reported similar survival outcomes. Prospective data on survival is lacking. Currently, there is sufficient data to support the diagnostic accuracy of SLN biopsy in the surgical staging of non-EEC. The retrospective evidence demonstrates similar survival for SLN biopsy versus lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Identification of Silvicultural Practices in Mediterranean Forests Integrating Landsat Time Series and a Single Coverage of ALS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding forest dynamics at the stand level is crucial for sustainable management. Landsat time series have been shown to be effective for identification of drastic changes, such as natural disturbances or clear-cuts, but detecting subtle changes requires further research. Time series of six Landsat-derived vegetation indexes (VIs) were analyzed with the BFAST (Breaks for Additive Season and Trend) algorithm aiming to characterize the changes resulting from harvesting practices of different intensities (clear-cutting, cutting with seed-trees, and thinning) in a Mediterranean forest area of Spain. To assess the contribution of airborne laser scanner (ALS) data and the potential implications of it being after or before the detected changes, two scenarios were defined (based on the year in which ALS data were acquired (2010), and thereby detecting changes from 2005 to 2010 (before ALS data) and from 2011 to 2016 (after ALS data). Pixels identified as change by BFAST were attributed with change in VI intensity and ALS-derived statistics (99th height percentile and forest canopy cover) for classification with random forests, and derivation of change maps. Fusion techniques were applied to leverage the potential of each individual VI change map and to reduce mapping errors. The Tasseled Cap Brightness (TCB) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) indexes provided the most accurate results, the latter being more precise for thinning detection. Our results demonstrate the suitability of Landsat time series and ALS data to characterize forest stand changes caused by harvesting practices of different intensity, with improved accuracy when ALS data is acquired after the change occurs. Clear-cuttings were more readily detectable compared to cutting with seed-trees and thinning, detection of which required fusion approaches. This methodology could be implemented to produce annual cartography of harvesting practices, enabling more accurate statistics and spatially explicit identification of forest operations.

TI  - Psychopathology, Normal Psychological Processes, or Supernatural Encounters? Three Ways to Frame Reports of After-Death Communication
T2  - SPIRITUALITY IN CLINICAL PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Many people believe that they have received after-death communications (ADCs) from deceased loved ones, and some bereaved individuals may disclose such experiences to their therapists. This can be a challenging area to navigate, especially given stigma around ADCs, uncertainty around their interpretation, and possible worldview differences between therapists and clients. This article illustrates how clinicians might frame ADCs through three different lenses: mental illness, psychological, and supernatural. I outline potential pros and cons of each lens and offer tentative suggestions about how each might be effectively applied in therapy. The mental illness lens frames ADCs as possible hallucinations, delusions, or other psychological or medical symptoms. Although this lens can help to identify and treat serious conditions, its overuse may lead to dismissal and pathologizing of ADCs and can contribute to stigma, along with inaccurate psychiatric diagnoses and treatments. The psychological lens, which frames ADCs as normal psychological phenomena, allows the deep exploration of potential meanings, predictors, and consequences of ADC, but some people may find that excessive analysis or sharing of these extraordinary, perhaps ineffable experiences strips them of personal impact or transcendent meaning. The supernatural lens, which frames ADCs as actual messages from the deceased, may provide reassurance, hope, and inspiration by suggesting or confirming positive afterlife beliefs and opening the possibility of continued communication with deceased loved ones; however, supernatural framing might also introduce problems such as disorienting worldview shifts, burdensome or frightening messages, or overreliance on external sources such as spirit mediums in the pursuit of ADCs.

TI  - Relationship between TIR and NIR-SWIR as Indicator of Vegetation Water Availability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water availability for vegetation use has been associated with the relative amount of water in the plant and is a key factor for modeling variables related to the soil-plant system (e.g., net primary production, drought effects on vegetation). To the best of our knowledge, the integration of spectral proxies of vegetation water content (near-infrared (NIR), shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands) and land surface temperature (LST) for estimation, not only of vegetation water content but also soil water available for the evapotranspiration process requires more analysis. This study aims to assess the relationship between NIR, SWIR reflectance, and LST data as indicators of water availability for crop use. For this purpose, vegetation water content, LST, and spectral reflectance over soybean, corn, and barley were measured in the field and the laboratory. Based on the consistency of satellite data from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS/Aqua) in relation to such measurements, a model is proposed, which can be parameterized from remotely sensed NIR-SWIR/LST scatterplots. The obtained results were tested in the Argentine Pampas, showing coherence with surface processes at regional scale associated with soil water availability. The comparison with soil moisture at different depths (R-2 > 0.7) showed that the method is sensitive to variations in root zone water availability. Given the reliance of the index on just satellite data, it can be pointed that the potential not only for vegetation water stress analyses but also in the context of hydrological modeling as an input of water availability.

TI  - Compatibility Optimal Design of Axially Loaded Circular Concrete-Filled Steel Tube Stub Columns
T2  - MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous studies have been carried out on the axially loaded circular concrete-filled steel tube (CCFST) stub columns. However, to date, no clear evaluation criterion for the compatibility of its design parameters has been established. In the present study, the compatibility of the design parameters (concrete compressive strength fc, steel yield strength fy, diameter D and thickness of steel tube t) of axially loaded CCFST stub columns was quantitatively investigated in terms of the contribution of the composite actions to the axial bearing capacity of the columns. The composite ratio lambda was proposed as an indicator to represent the effectiveness of the composite actions. A numerical framework of the determination of lambda was established, making use of a series of existing widely recognized constitutive models of structural steel and concrete. Some modifications were carried out on these models to ensure the numerical stability of the presented analysis. Moreover, the rationality of the combined use of these models was verified. The analytical results show that excessive or very small D/t ratio should be avoided in design. Meanwhile, the combined use of low-strength steel and high-strength concrete should be avoided. A table of optimal D/t ratios corresponding to different material strength matches was provided for designers. Finally, an optimization of the design parameters using the proposed method and the existing design specification was performed.

TI  - Estimation of pixel-level seismic vulnerability of the building environment based on mid-resolution optical remote sensing images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Building damage after seismic disasters is one of the most vital factors threatening people's lives. The seismic vulnerability of buildings over large scales at the regional or country level is a key parameter for the mitigation of seismic disaster risk and rapid assessment of casualties after seismic events. To acquire the seismic vulnerability of buildings over large areas, a machine learning method based on mid-resolution satellite optical images is proposed. Taking field-investigated building vulnerability at the satellite pixel scale as a reference, the 15 most correlated features are calculated based on VIIRS nighttime light, MODIS vegetation index and surface reflectance, and texture data from Landsat-8 OLI surface reflectance products. Taking Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China, as the study area, where 401 pixel-level seismic vulnerabilities (PLSVs) of the building environment are acquired based on field investigations, support vector regression (SVR) and random forest (RF) models are proposed using the 15 features calculated from satellite optical images. The results show that the proposed method can be used to estimate the PLSV with a root mean square error of approximately 0.1, with the PLSV normalized between 0 and 1. The machine learning model proposed in this study has a better accuracy for PLSV estimation than spatial interpolation.

TI  - Frost-driven lower treelines in Angola and their implications for tropical forest-grassland mosaics
T2  - JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions Forest-grassland boundaries in the tropics are primarily interpreted as driven by fire and herbivory. So far, frost has received little attention as driver of tropical vegetation boundaries. Here, we study mid-altitudes in south-central Africa and ask the following questions: (a) is there a lower treeline between grasslands and forests on the Angolan Plateau; (b) if so, do topoclimatic differences play a role in it; and (c) what do our results imply for tropical highlands globally? Location The Angolan Plateau (10 degrees-16 degrees S and 13 degrees-21 degrees E). Methods We mapped vegetation by applying a supervised support vector machine-based classification on a Landsat satellite image. We used a 1,000-m spaced point grid to extract the mean vertical distribution of the vegetation units from a digital elevation model. The topographic position of each point was calculated using a channel network approach. Microclimatic data were collected across topographic gradients at two sites along the Plateau. Analyses focussed on the number of nights where temperature dropped below 0celcius, median and minimum temperatures, and diurnal temperature ranges. Results Lower treelines separate Miombo forests from geoxyle grasslands in all major valley systems. Treelines are located 150-200 m below the headwater divides. Nocturnal outgoing net long-wave radiation and resulting cold-air pooling cause frequent frosts in the valleys during the dry season. Topography controls frost patterns, with minima of down to -7.5celcius and diurnal temperature amplitudes up to 40celcius. Conclusions The results show that vegetation patterns in central Angola are shaped by frost. The processes causing frost depend on air humidity. Drier atmosphere and lower global temperatures indicate a longer frost season, lower minima and frost extending to lower elevations and latitudes for the Pleistocene. Pleistocene forest fragmentations and the rise of endemism-rich grasslands in comparable tropical highlands worldwide may be explained by crossing thermic thresholds via increasing seasonal aridity.

TI  - Predicting how climate change threatens the prey base of Arctic marine predators
T2  - ECOLOGY LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic sea ice loss has direct consequences for predators. Climate-driven distribution shifts of native and invasive prey species may exacerbate these consequences. We assessed potential changes by modelling the prey base of a widely distributed Arctic predator (ringed seal; Pusa hispida) in a sentinel area for change (Hudson Bay) under high- and low-greenhouse gas emission scenarios from 1950 to 2100. All changes were relatively negligible under the low-emission scenario, but under the high-emission scenario, we projected a 50% decline in the abundance of the well-distributed, ice-adapted and energy-rich Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) and an increase in the abundance of smaller temperate-associated fish in southern and coastal areas. Furthermore, our model predicted that all fish species declined in mean body size, but a 29% increase in total prey biomass. Declines in energy-rich prey and restrictions in their spatial range are likely to have cascading effects on Arctic predators.

TI  - Optimal Management for Residual Disease Following Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion Statement Treatment sequencing in early-stage breast cancer has significantly evolved in recent years, particularly in the triple negative (TNBC) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive subsets. Instead of surgery first followed by chemotherapy, several clinical trials showed benefits to administering systemic chemotherapy (and HER2-targeted therapies) prior to surgery. These benefits include more accurate prognostic estimates based on the extent of residual cancer that can also guide adjuvant treatment, and frequent tumor downstaging that can lead to smaller surgeries in patients with large tumors at diagnosis. Patients with extensive invasive residual cancer after neoadjuvant therapy are at high risk for disease recurrence, and two pivotal clinical trials, CREATE-X and KATHERINE, demonstrated improved recurrence free survival with adjuvant capecitabine and ado-trastuzumab-emtansine (T-DM1) in TNBC and HER2-positive residual cancers, respectively. Patients who achieve pathologic complete response (pCR) have excellent long-term disease-free survival regardless of what chemotherapy regimen induced this favorable response. This allows escalation or de-escalation of adjuvant therapy: patients who achieved pCR could be spared further chemotherapy, while those with residual cancer could receive additional chemotherapy postoperatively. Ongoing clinical trials are testing this strategy (CompassHER2-pCR: NCT04266249). pCR also provides an opportunity to assess de-escalation of locoregional therapies. Currently, for patients with residual disease in the lymph nodes (ypN+), radiation therapy entails coverage of the undissected axilla, and may include supra/infraclavicular/internal mammary nodes in addition to the whole breast or chest wall, depending on the type of surgery. Ongoing trials are testing the safety of omitting post-mastectomy breast and post-lumpectomy nodal irradiation (NCT01872975) as well as omitting axillary lymph node dissection (NCT01901094) in the setting of pCR. Additionally, evolving technologies such as minimal residual disease (MRD) monitoring in the blood during follow-up may allow early intervention with "second-line systemic adjuvant therapy" for patients with molecular relapse which might prevent impending clinical relapse.

AB  - Given the consolidated circulation of Aethina tumida (SHB) in Reggio Calabria and Vibo Valentia provinces of Calabria region (Southern Italy), the need for a more effective and less time-consuming approach to SHB surveillance emerged. Accordingly, honeybee sentinel colonies were established in the infested areas under the supervision and management of the Veterinary Services of the Local Health Unit. In this short communication, we present the protocol adopted in the Calabria region to manage the SHB positive sentinel honeybee colonies. The procedures for safely packing and transport the SHB infested sentinel honeybee colonies from the field to the official laboratory and the subsequent procedure for their careful inspection in the laboratory are illustrated.

AB  - Tumor-draining lymph nodes play a paradoxical role in cancer. Surgeons often resect these sentinel lymph nodes to determine metastatic spread, thereby enabling prognosis and treatment. However, lymph nodes are vital organs for the orchestration of immune responses, due to the close encounters of dedicated immune cells. In view of the success of immunotherapy, the removal of tumor-draining lymph nodes needs to be re-evaluated and viewed in a different light. Recently, an important role for tumor-draining lymph nodes has been proposed in the immunotherapy of cancer. This new insight can change the use of immune checkpoint therapy, particularly with respect to the use in neoadjuvant settings in which lymph nodes are still operational.

TI  - Testing Sentinel-1 SAR Interferometry Data for Airport Runway Monitoring: A Geostatistical Analysis
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR) techniques are gaining momentum in the assessment and health monitoring of infrastructure assets. Amongst others, the Persistent Scatterers Interferometry (PSI) technique has proven to be viable for the long-term evaluation of ground scatterers. However, its effectiveness as a routine tool for certain critical application areas, such as the assessment of millimetre-scale differential displacements in airport runways, is still debated. This research aims to demonstrate the viability of using medium-resolution Copernicus ESA Sentinel-1A (C-Band) SAR products and their contribution to improve current maintenance strategies in case of localised foundation settlements in airport runways. To this purpose, "Runway n.3" of the "Leonardo Da Vinci International Airport" in Fiumicino, Rome, Italy was investigated as an explanatory case study, in view of historical geotechnical settlements affecting the runway area. In this context, a geostatistical study is developed for the exploratory spatial data analysis and the interpolation of the Sentinel-1A SAR data. The geostatistical analysis provided ample information on the spatial continuity of the Sentinel 1 data in comparison with the high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed data and the ground-based topographic levelling data. Furthermore, a comparison between the PSI outcomes from the Sentinel-1A SAR data-interpolated through Ordinary Kriging-and the ground-truth topographic levelling data demonstrated the high accuracy of the Sentinel 1 data. This is proven by the high values of the correlation coefficient (r = 0.94), the multiple R-squared coefficient (R-2 = 0.88) and the Slope value (0.96). The results of this study clearly support the effectiveness of using Sentinel-1A SAR data as a continuous and long-term routine monitoring tool for millimetre-scale displacements in airport runways, paving the way for the development of more efficient and sustainable maintenance strategies for inclusion in next generation Airport Pavement Management Systems (APMSs).

TI  - Temporal variations on NDVI predict temporal changes in vegetation cover across Patagonian drylands (Argentina)
T2  - ECOSISTEMAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal variations on NDVI predict temporal changes in vegetation cover across Patagonian drylands (Argentina). In drylands, natural vegetation is an important source of livelihood as they provide food, fuel and forage for livestock. In addition to the provision of goods and services, dryland vegetation also plays an important role in many ecological processes, such as recycling nutrients or protecting the soil from erosion. Long-term monitoring of vegetation cover is therefore key for decision-making and management of these regions. In this study, we analyze the variation of vegetation cover in 239 sites of a long-term monitoring network (MARAS network), in one of the largest dryland biomes in the world: the argentine patagonian steppe. Then we relate it to the variation of different periods of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), obtained from the MODIS sensor, which serve as a predictor variable. The adjusted empirical model explained up to 40% of the variation in the vegetation cover measured in the field. With this simple empirical model we have estimated and mapped temporal changes in the vegetation cover of a large dryland biome at low cost.

TI  - GIS-Based Landslide Susceptibility Mapping of the Circum-Baikal Railway in Russia Using UAV Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The investigation of hard-to-reach areas that are prone to landslides is challenging. The research of landslide hazards can be significantly advanced by using remote sensing data obtained from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Operational acquisition and high detail are the advantages of UAV data. The development of appropriate automated algorithms and software solutions is necessary for quick decision-making based on the received heterogeneous spatial data characterising various aspects of the environment. This article introduces the first phase of a long-term study about landslide detection and prediction that aims to develop an automatic algorithm for detecting potentially hazardous landslide areas, using data obtained by UAV surveys. As a part of the project, the selection of appropriate techniques was implemented and a landslide susceptibility (LS) map of the study site was developed. This paper presents the outcomes of the applied indirect heuristic approach of landslide susceptibility assessment using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) in a GIS environment, based on UAV data. The results obtained have been tested on a real-world entity.

TI  - Monitoring Drought through the Lens of Landsat: Drying of Rivers during the California Droughts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity during severe droughts has profound hydrological and ecological impacts on rivers. However, the drying dynamics of river surface extent during droughts remains largely understudied. Satellite remote sensing enables surveys and analyses of rivers at fine spatial resolution by providing an alternative to in-situ observations. This study investigates the seasonal drying dynamics of river extent in California where severe droughts have been occurring more frequently in recent decades. Our methods combine the use of Landsat-based Global Surface Water (GSW) and global river bankful width databases. As an indirect comparison, we examine the monthly fractional river extent (FrcSA) in 2071 river reaches and its correlation with streamflow at co-located USGS gauges. We place the extreme 2012-2015 drought into a broader context of multi-decadal river extent history and illustrate the extraordinary change between during- and post-drought periods. In addition to river extent dynamics, we perform statistical analyses to relate FrcSA with the hydroclimatic variables obtained from the National Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) model simulation. Results show that Landsat provides consistent observation over 90% of area in rivers from March to October and is suitable for monitoring seasonal river drying in California. FrcSA reaches fair (>0.5) correlation with streamflow except for dry and mountainous areas. During the 2012-2015 drought, 332 river reaches experienced their lowest annual mean FrcSA in the 34 years of Landsat history. At a monthly scale, FrcSA is better correlated with soil water in more humid areas. At a yearly scale, summer mean FrcSA is increasingly sensitive to winter precipitation in a drier climate; and the elasticity is also reduced with deeper ground water table. Overall, our study demonstrates the detectability of Landsat on the river surface extent in an arid region with complex terrain. River extent in catchments of deficient water storage is likely subject to higher percent drop in a future climate with longer, more frequent droughts.

TI  - New developments in rare vulvar and vaginal cancers
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review To provide the latest insight on the rare vulvar and vaginal malignancies, able to impact on clinical practice, and to outline new potential research developments. Recent findings Many efforts are being made to produce technical and scientific advances in the fields of vulvar and vaginal carcinoma, including imaging work-up, interventional procedures and minimally invasive surgical approach, as well as molecular profiling and identification of new target treatments. In the evaluation of lymph node status, ultrasound has demonstrated promising results because of high predictive value, low risk and low cost. Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography is confirmed to be reliable and should be prospectively investigated for its potential applications in radiomics, whilst Fusion-US could allow a precision guidance in diagnostics and interventional procedures. Regarding interventional procedure, surgery is becoming less invasive with the aim to increase quality of life; in carefully selected patients it would be possible to overcome the current strict criteria in the use of sentinel node biopsy. Future research should focus on potential target therapy, on the basis of tumor-specific biological features. Rare cancers should be referred to experienced centers with a high case flow, able to offer a full range of diagnostic and therapeutical options and a multidisciplinary approach. Networking should be encouraged to promote research opportunities and enable data sharing and multicenter trials.

TI  - The Persistence of Igbo Worldview in the Sabbath Church Healing Liturgy and Praxis
T2  - MISSION STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Healing and wholeness are common motifs in religion; even as there exist different conceptions of personhood, as well as ways and means of restoring a person to wholeness and wellbeing. This paper focuses on the influence of Igbo traditional worldviews and healing liturgies in the Sabbath Church in Nigeria. Utilizing a qualitative methodology, oral interviews, and participant observation, the paper examines the extent to which Igbo healing praxis has been incorporated into the healing liturgy and practices of the Sabbath Church. Using Our Lord's Sabbath Mission, an AIC in Nigeria, as a case study, how has the Sabbath Church valorized Igbo traditional symbols and religious categories in mediating healing? The insight resulting from this study is of great importance, particularly now that the demography of Christianity has shifted to the Global South.

TI  - DIGITALIZATION OF MUSEUMS AND THE NEED TO FORM AN INFORMATION CULTURE OF MUSEOLOGISTS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-KULTUROLOGIYA I ISKUSSTVOVEDENIE-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF CULTURAL STUDIES AND ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the article is to substantiate the need for the development of the information culture of museum specialists as an independent area of personnel training in the context of the digital transformation of society. As a research methodology, a set of complementary approaches was used: systemic, allowing to ensure the integrity of museologists' ideas about the phenomenon of information culture; technological and activity, revealing the possibilities of using information and communication technologies in various types of museum activities; culturological, allowing to give a holistic view of modern culture as a unity of its spiritual, social and technological sides. As a result of the study, the authors of the article proved the need to form a special facet of the culture of modern museum specialists - the information culture of a museologist. The definition of the notion "information culture of a museologist" has been developed, where a special place is occupied by the information worldview of a museologist. It acts as the basis for the development of professional self-awareness for the purpose of personal professional self-development and continuous improvement of the level of professional qualifications. The structure of the training course "Information culture of a museologist" is proposed. The purpose of which is the formation of a systematic understanding of the digitalization of culture and the digital transformation of information resources in museology, protection of objects of cultural and natural heritage and related subject areas; mastering the algorithms for searching for information in the electronic information environment, mastering the methods of analytical-synthetic processing and critical analysis of information in the structure of the professional activity of a museologist, mastering the technology for creating information products in the context of digital transformation of the culture industry in accordance with the tasks of educational and professionally oriented research work. The thesis is argued that in the professional training of museologists, a harmonious unity of intellectual and technological principles should be observed on the priorities and values of culture. It is concluded that the differences between the ideas of the formation of the information culture of a personality, the information culture of a museologist and the idea of integration of media and information literacy promoted by UNESCO, developed in Russia, are not of a fundamental nature. They only reflect the desire of Russian scientists and practitioners to combine the advantages of international theory and practice with the traditions of national culture and education, the accumulated experience of Russian museums and educational institutions. Scientific novelty consists, firstly, in the theoretical understanding of the danger of the digitalization of museums becoming a purely technical and technological process and the loss of the educational and educational function of the museum; secondly, in adapting the concept of the formation of an individual's information culture to the tasks of information training for museologists.

TI  - Small-Sized Ship Detection Nearshore Based on Lightweight Active Learning Model with a Small Number of Labeled Data for SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine ship detection by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important remote sensing technology. The rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technology has facilitated the wide use of deep learning methods in SAR imagery for ship detection. Although deep learning can achieve a much better detection performance than traditional methods, it is difficult to achieve satisfying performance for small-sized ships nearshore due to the weak scattering caused by their material and simple structure. Another difficulty is that a huge amount of data needs to be manually labeled to obtain a reliable CNN model. Manual labeling each datum not only takes too much time but also requires a high degree of professional knowledge. In addition, the land and island with high backscattering often cause high false alarms for ship detection in the nearshore area. In this study, a novel method based on candidate target detection, boundary box optimization, and convolutional neural network (CNN) embedded with active learning strategy is proposed to improve the accuracy and efficiency of ship detection in nearshore areas. The candidate target detection results are obtained by global threshold segmentation. Then, the strategy of boundary box optimization is defined and applied to reduce the noise and false alarms caused by island and land targets as well as by sidelobe interference. Finally, a lightweight CNN embedded with active learning scheme is used to classify the ships using only a small labeled training set. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed method for small-sized ship detection can achieve 97.78% accuracy and 0.96 F1-score with Sentinel-1 images in complex nearshore areas.

M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers the features of metaphorics in the journalism of Vasily Mikhailovich Peskov - a well-known publicist, TV -presenter, traveler and na- ture expert. The appeal to journalism in terms of the study of the figurative and aesthetic side of its texts determines the relevance of the article. The novelty is connected with the consideration in the linguistic aspect of the means of translating the objective and subjective in the metaphorical comparison of nature and human in journalistic texts, which characterizes the features of the pragmatic attitudes and worldview of the author's linguistic personality. The aim is to describe the objective and subjective in V.M. Peskov's metaphorics in the light of the evaluation of idio- style features, which are manifested in the selection and combination of language resources. Research methods: general scientific (observation, analysis, synthesis), structural -semantic, elements of compo- nent analysis in combination with contextual analy- sis. The practical and theoretical significance of the research is connected with the conclusion that the comparison of nature and human, with the realiza- tion of their inseparability in the unifying field of life, is the main motive of all V.M. Peskov's journalistic activity; with the first characterization of lexical- ized units in various syntactic functions as meta- phors; showing the role of bisubstantial sentences in creating a metaphor. The materials can be used in the further study of the idiostyle of V.M. Peskov, in the author's lexicography, when reading university courses in stylistics, language of the media.

TI  - Six central questions about biological invasions to which NEON data science is poised to contribute
T2  - ECOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological invasions are a leading cause of rapid ecological change and often present a significant financial burden. As a vibrant discipline, invasion biology has made important strides in identifying, mapping, and beginning to manage invasions, but questions remain surrounding the mechanisms by which invasive species spread and the impacts they bring about. Frequent, multiscalar ecological monitoring such as that provided through the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) can be an important tool for addressing some of these questions. We articulate a set of major outstanding questions in invasion biology, consider how NEON data science is positioned to contribute to addressing these questions, and provide suggestions to help equip a growing contingent of NEON data users in solving invasion biology problems. We demonstrate these ideas through four case studies examining the mechanisms of plant invasions in the U.S. Intermountain West. In Case Study I, we evaluate the relationships between native species richness, non-native species richness, and probability of invasion across scales. In Case Studies II and III, we explore the relationship between environmental factors and non-native species presence to understand invasion mechanisms. Case Study IV outlines a method for improving the ability to distinguish invasive plants from native vegetation in remotely sensed data by leveraging temporal patterns of phenology. There are many novel elements in the NEON sampling design that make it uniquely poised to shed light on the mechanisms that can help us understand invasibility, prediction, and progression, as well as on the variability, longevity, and interactions of multiple invasive species' impacts. Thus, knowledge gained through analysis of NEON data is expected to inform sound decision-making in unique ways for managers of systems experiencing biological invasions.

TI  - <i>Use of remote sensors to determine forage availability in grazed pastures of</i> Urochloa humidicola <i>cv. Llanero in the Colombian Altillanura</i>
T2  - TROPICAL GRASSLANDS-FORRAJES TROPICALES
M3  - Article
AB  - Modernization of pastoral systems based on the use of Urochloa species in the Colombian Eastern Llanos need the use of remote sensing techniques from satellite platforms to estimate amount of offered forage. In the Carimagua Research Centre of the Colombian Corporation for Agricultural Research (Agrosavia), an Urochloa humidicola cv. Llanero pasture was evaluated using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A images. The NDVI, SAVI, EVI y GNDVI vegetation indices were determined by using the blue, green, red and near infrared bands and the results analyzed with the R free software, to relate those indices with forage availability field measures taken during the dry season. Forage availability ranged between 290 and 656 kg DM ha(-1) and the vegetation indices for the Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A sensors were: NDVI = 0.67 (+/- 0.037) and 0.69 (+/- 0.061); SAVI = 0.48 (+/- 0.048) and 0.41 (+/- 0.046); EVI = 0.70 (+/- 0.052) and 0.41 (+/- 0.047); y GNDVI = 0.60 (+/- 0.028) and 0.70 (+/- 0.034), respectively. The relationships between vegetation indices and forage availability were linear. The Coefficient of Determination (R-2 = 0.56-0.72) and the Mean Square Error (MSR = 63.95-80.16) of the prediction equations were used. In conclusion, under the conditions of the study, the EVI for Landsat 8 and NDVI for Sentinel 2A were considered adequate for estimating forage availability of Urochloa humidicola cv. Llanero.

TI  - Generating Up-to-Date Crop Maps Optimized for Sentinel-2 Imagery in Israel
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The overarching aim of this research was to develop a method for deriving crop maps from a time series of Sentinel-2 images between 2017 and 2018 to address global challenges in agriculture and food security. This study is the first step towards improving crop mapping based on phenological features retrieved from an object-based time series on a national scale. Five main crops in Israel were classified: wheat, barley, cotton, carrot, and chickpea. To optimize the object-based classification process, different characteristics and inputs of the mean shift segmentation algorithm were tested, including vegetation indices, three-band combinations, and high/low emphasis on the spatial and spectral characteristics. Four known vegetation indices (VIs)-based time series were tested. Additionally, we compared two widely used machine learning methods for crop classification, support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), in addition to a newer classifier, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Lastly, we examined two accuracy measures-overall accuracy (OA) and area under the curve (AUC)-in order to optimally estimate the accuracy in the case of imbalanced class representation. Mean shift best performed when emphasizing both the spectral and spatial characteristics while using the green, red, and near-infrared (NIR) bands as input. Both accuracy measures showed that RF and XGBoost classified different types of crops with significantly greater success than achieved by SVM. Nevertheless, AUC was better able to represent the significant differences between the classification algorithms than OA was. None of the VIs showed a significantly higher contribution to the classification. However, normalized difference infrared index (NDII) with XGBoost classifier showed the highest AUC results (88%). This study demonstrates that the short-wave infrared (SWIR) band with XGBoost improves crop type classification results. Furthermore, the study emphasizes the importance of addressing imbalanced classification datasets by using a proper accuracy measure. Since object-based classification and phenological features derived from a VI-based time series are widely used to produce crop maps, the current study is also relevant for operational agricultural management and informatics at large scales.

TI  - Chlorophyll-<i>a</i>, SST and particulate organic carbon in response to the cyclone <i>Amphan</i> in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to explore the variation of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), particulate organic carbon (POC) and sea surface temperature (SST) before (pre-cyclone) and after (post-cyclone) the cyclone Amphan in the Bay of Bengal (BoB). Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua satellite level-3 data were used to assess the variability of the mentioned parameters. Chl-a concentration was observed to be significantly (t = -3.16, df approximate to 18.03, p = 0.005) high (peak 2.30 mg/m(3)) during the post-cyclone period compared to the pre-cyclone (0.19 mg/m(3)). Similarly, POC concentration was significantly (t = 3.41, df approximate to 18.06, p = 0.003) high (peak 464 mg/m(3)) during the post-cyclone compared to the pre-cyclone (59.40 mg/m(3)). Comparatively, high SST was observed during the pre-cyclone period and decreases drastically with a significant difference (t = 14, df = 33, p = 1.951e-15) after the post-cyclone period. The results indicated an increase in Chl-a (502%) and POC (240%) with a positive anomaly of 0.55 and 94.11 mg/m(3), but a decrease in SST (8.52%) with a negative anomaly of 2.7 degrees C in the BoB.

TI  - On the role of the anthropocentric factor in the realization of the derivational potential of names of ungulates as motivating lexical units
T2  - SIBIRSKII FILOLOGICHESKII ZHURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper is dedicated to describing the word-building system of the Russian language in terms of its vocabulary. Lexical factors are discussed influencing the formation of lexical units' potential as motivating units of word-building processes and relations and the realization of this potential in language activities. Of most interest for the authors are anthropocentric determinants, most of which are coordinating the lexical system and, through its mediation, the word-building system with the worldview of native speakers of the Russian language. The proposed model of derivational development of vocabulary provides such coordination through studying the deep-seated process of conceptualization of the words that are the potential motivators of neologisms. This study identifies the word frequency as an external manifestation of conceptualization. The frequency data were obtained from Google search system statistical data. Capturing not only usual but also occasional and potential words, this source is an effective tool for studying word-building processes and their results. This study has unveiled the interrelation between the language worldview of native speakers of Russian and their "word-building behavior" in language activities. The worldview has been found, first of all, to be determined by the pragmatic factor, which primarily influences the usage of a word in the speech reflected by its frequency. The frequency ranks lexical units due to their derivational potential and thereby provides a researcher with a reliable instrument for its study.

TI  - Fine-Scale Sea Ice Segmentation for High-Resolution Satellite Imagery with Weakly-Supervised CNNs
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine-scale sea ice conditions are key to our efforts to understand and model climate change. We propose the first deep learning pipeline to extract fine-scale sea ice layers from high-resolution satellite imagery (Worldview-3). Extracting sea ice from imagery is often challenging due to the potentially complex texture from older ice floes (i.e., floating chunks of sea ice) and surrounding slush ice, making ice floes less distinctive from the surrounding water. We propose a pipeline using a U-Net variant with a Resnet encoder to retrieve ice floe pixel masks from very-high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery. Even with a modest-sized hand-labeled training set and the most basic hyperparameter choices, our CNN-based approach attains an out-of-sample F1 score of 0.698-a nearly 60% improvement when compared to a watershed segmentation baseline. We then supplement our training set with a much larger sample of images weak-labeled by a watershed segmentation algorithm. To ensure watershed derived pack-ice masks were a good representation of the underlying images, we created a synthetic version for each weak-labeled image, where areas outside the mask are replaced by open water scenery. Adding our synthetic image dataset, obtained at minimal effort when compared with hand-labeling, further improves the out-of-sample F1 score to 0.734. Finally, we use an ensemble of four test metrics and evaluated after mosaicing outputs for entire scenes to mimic production setting during model selection, reaching an out-of-sample F1 score of 0.753. Our fully-automated pipeline is capable of detecting, monitoring, and segmenting ice floes at a very fine level of detail, and provides a roadmap for other use-cases where partial results can be obtained with threshold-based methods but a context-robust segmentation pipeline is desired.

TI  - Bots on Twitter: Evaluative Analysis on non-authentic tweets
T2  - ENTREPALAVRAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the information manipulation strategies, inauthentic accounts have been gaining strength, especially when related to issues about politics. The social network that makes this action easier is Twitter, with its bots and hashtags system. With this in mind, in this article we intend to locate, analyze and categorize occurences of evaluation in inauthentic accounts that encourage the spread of beliefs and opnions about the current brazilian political scenario. Through use of the Bot Sentinel, which use machine learning based on a mathematical model (ZHANG, 2020) to predict the authenticity of a user and expose inauthentic accounts and their connections with the most commented themes, we collect 60 tweets posted between may and october of 2020. From that, we selected 10 tweets from non-authentic accounts containing the most popular hashtag in your month in its said period for each month of the gathering. The theoretical apparatus on which we rely is the appraisal system, more precisely the attitude subsystem (MARTIN; WHITE, 2005), to see how such evaluations operate to build relations of alignment and relationships between writers and their readers. The results indicate the use of evaluative standards of positive capacity for the president of the republic and of negative property to denigrate your opponents' image, accentuating the idea of Us vs. Them (BORGES; VIDIGAL, 2018).

TI  - Seeing the world through the eyes of faith Philosophical- theological analysis of the "worldview" of "young priests"
T2  - REVISTA PISTIS & PRAXIS-TEOLOGIA E PASTORAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This article is going to analyze philosophically and theologically the "worldview" of data collected from "new priests". The reason of this theme is that the "world view" is the constitution of "world image" and, therefore, is a force or a power that allows to look and situate itself in the world. In this sense, the "world view" of "new priests" allows us to conceive that they see from the world their own "real world" and that, therefore, by exercising the priestly ministry, they can have the contribution of theology to the elaboration of their "worldview". Therefore, it is important that this analysis visualizes in the responses of the "new priests" not only the empirical description, but what underlies and what may appear in this "vision", especially when enhanced by theology. To achieve this goal, it will conceptually conceptualize "worldview" as "world image", and then analytically describe the "worldview" of "new priests" and glimpse how theology can lead to the deepening of the "worldview", enabling "honesty with real" of the world and revealed faith itself, which illuminates theology so that it is effectively scientia fidei.

TI  - The effect of altimetry data in estimating the elastic thickness of the lithosphere in the western Pacific Ocean
T2  - GEODESY AND GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The elastic thickness of the lithosphere (T-e) is a key parameter used to describe the strength of the lithosphere. It is usually estimated by a spectral analysis between gravity and topography. In previous research on the estimation of T-e, altimetry data were used on both the gravity data and topography data, which could lead to deviations. The study described in this paper analyzed the effects of using gravity anomalies derived from different data sources on the estimation of T-e. Taking the western Pacific region as an example, this study analyzed the impact of the repeated presence of altimetry satellite data on the calculation of the effective elastic thickness and found that if gravity anomalies and topography model both contain altimetry satellite data, they systematically overestimate effective elasticity. For a uniform area, the difference in T-e can reach up to 30%. For a T-e distribution, the difference can reach up to about 16%. After eliminating this effect, the effective elastic thickness of the western Pacific region was found to be 10 km, and the statistical results of the effective elastic thickness distribution showed that the effective elastic thickness of the lithosphere in most areas of the western Pacific is about 12 km. The paper shows the importance of choosing the appropriate gravity model in evaluating the elastic thickness of lithosphere in the oceans. A figure of T-e at seamounts with loading ages demonstrates that T-e in the western Pacific is generally distributed within the 100-300 degrees C isotherm depth and does not increase with loading age.

TI  - Using Historical Archives and Landsat Imagery to Explore Changes in the Mangrove Cover of Peninsular Malaysia between 1853 and 2018
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Archive records such as maps, journals, books, sketches, cadastre and notarial documents have been underutilised in describing past and present changes in ecological systems, such as mangrove forests. Historical records can be invaluable information sources for baseline establishment, to undertake long-term study on mangrove dynamics and enhance the historical land cover and land-use dynamics of a country. In this study, we explore these untapped information reservoirs, used complementarily with remote sensing techniques, to explain the dynamics of the mangrove systems in Peninsular Malaysia. The archives in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Malaysia and Singapore were explored and mined for related information on the mangrove systems in Peninsular Malaysia from past centuries. Most historical records found in this study were used to validate the mangrove presence in Peninsular Malaysia since 1853 while two records from 1944 and 1954 were used to quantify the mangrove cover extent. A significant finding of this study was the oldest record found in 1853 that attested to the presence of a mangrove system on the mainland Penang of Peninsular Malaysia which was not identified again as such in records post-1853. Remote sensing data, specifically Landsat images, were used to determine the mangrove extent in Peninsular Malaysia for the years 1988, 1992, 2002, 2012 and 2018. By complementing the historical records with remote sensing information, we were able to validate the mangrove presence in Peninsular Malaysia since 1853 and determine the gain/loss of mangrove systems over the last 74 years. Peninsular Malaysia has lost over 400 km(2) of mangrove forests, equivalent to 31% of its original extent between 1944 and 2018. This is a significant loss for Peninsular Malaysia which has less than 1% mangrove cover of its total land area presently.

TI  - Temporal dynamics of above ground biomass of Kaimoor Wildlife Sanctuary, Uttar Pradesh, India: conjunctive use of field and Landsat data
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE INDIAN NATIONAL SCIENCE ACADEMY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study assesses the temporal dynamics of above ground biomass (AGB) in Kaimoor Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS), Uttar Pradesh, India using series of Landsat data for the years 1989, 2000, 2010 and 2018. The satellite images were preprocessed for surface reflectance, and subsequently we computed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI). A forest density map was generated by slicing the computed NDVI and this was used as a basis for sampling strategy. A total of 30 sampling locations were randomly identified. Plot size of 30 mx30 m was established. Tree species were enumerated at each plot and the girth at breast height and tree height measurements were recorded for the year 2018. Tree and plot level AGB (i.e. AGB(F), t ha(-1)) was computed by multiplying the tree volume and specific gravity of wood. AGB (i.e. AGB(P)) prediction models were developed as linear regression equations for the year 2018 by assessing the vegetation indices and the AGB(F). The significant AGB(P) models (R-2=0.94; P=0.0001) were applied for all study years after the data correction among the Landsat sensor series. The AGB(P) was over estimated (22.67 t ha(-1); 7.75%) compared to AGB(F) (t ha(-1)). Moreover, EVI (R-2=0.90) was found to be a better predictor for AGB compared to NDVI (R-2=0.69) or SAVI (R-2=0.77). The AGB(P) of KWS ranged between 289 +/- 36 (in 1989) and 292 +/- 40 (in 2018) with an average decadal positive change of 1.06%.

TI  - Remote Monitoring of Ground Motion Hazards in High Mountain Terrain Using InSAR: A Case Study of the Lake Sarez Area, Tajikistan
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - High mountain terrains, with steep slopes and deep valleys, are generally challenging areas to monitor using satellite earth observation techniques since the terrain creates perspective distortions and differences in illumination that can occlude or obfuscate a significant proportion of the land. This is particularly prominent in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, where the oblique geometry can result in large areas of layover and shadow, which must be excluded from any analysis. Interferometric SAR (InSAR) is an established technique for monitoring ground motion and this study assesses its potential for geohazard monitoring in mountainous areas using Lake Sarez in Tajikistan as a case study, applying SAR data from the Sentinel-1 mission. It is shown that, although the effect of layover and shadow is severe, a judicious combination of ascending and descending satellite passes is still capable of surveying 88% of the land surface. It is also demonstrated that, through the use of an advanced InSAR technique (the APSIS (TM) Intermittent Small Baseline Subset technique), near-complete coverage of ground motion measurements is possible, despite intermittent snow cover. Moreover, this is achieved without the need for ground control, which can be hazardous to establish in such areas. It is concluded that a combination of satellite passes and advanced InSAR techniques greatly facilitates the remote monitoring of ground motion hazards in high mountain areas.

TI  - A Monitoring System of Sand Mining in Large Rivers and Its Application to the Ayeyarwady (Irrawaddy) River, Myanmar
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Sand mining is one of the major sustainability challenges of the 21st century. Rates of extraction are surpassing sand supply, and ensuing sand starvation is adversely impacting channel-floodplains and deltas. Therefore, quantifying sand mining's location and extent, through global monitoring and detection, particularly in fluvial systems, is becoming a priority. Sand mining by dredges and barges (extraction of sand and secondarily gravel) in South East Asian rivers, including illegal sand mining, has become rampant, and a monitoring system is not yet in place. Here, we present a high-resolution remote sensing-based mining monitoring system for sand mining in fluvial systems. We used Sentinel-1 mission, a radar component of the Copernicus joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA). The system, tested in the Ayeyarwady, the second largest river in SE Asia, detects sand mining by barges almost in real-time with a satisfactory accuracy level. An additional advantage of the monitoring system is that it does not incur any costs, making it accessible to multiple users, decision-makers, and stakeholders.

TI  - Reduction of Air Pollution in Poland in Spring 2020 during the Lockdown Caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many aspects of human well-being including air quality. The present study aims at quantifying this effect by means of ground-level concentrations of NO2, PM2.5, as well as aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements and tropospheric NO2 column number density (NO2 TVCD), during the imposed governmental restrictions in spring 2020. The analyses were performed for both urban and non-built-up areas across the whole of Poland accompanied by Warsaw (urban site) and Strzyzow (a background site). The results revealed that mean PM2.5 concentrations in spring 2020 for urban and non-built-up areas across Poland and for Warsaw were 20%, 23%, 15% lower than the 10-year average, respectively. Analogous mean NO2 concentrations were lower by 20%, 18%, 30% and NO2 TVCD revealed 9%, 4%, 9% reductions in 2020 as compared to 2019. Regarding mean AOD, retrieved from MERRA-2 reanalysis, it was found that for the whole of Poland during spring 2020 the reduction in AOD as compared to the 10-year average was 15%. The contribution of the lockdown within total air pollution reduction is not easily assessable due to anomalous weather conditions in 2020 which resulted in advection of clean air masses identified from MERRA-2 reanalysis and Strzyzow observatory.

T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Water diversion project is one of the effective ecological projects to alleviate desertification, reduce ice flood, and promote vegetation growth. In order to understand the impacts of water diversion project on vegetation in the northern edge of the Kubuqi Desert, based on Land sat -7/8, GF-1/2, project water diversion amount and temperature and precipitation data, we analyzed the land cover types and vegetation spatiotemporal variations of the northern edge of the Kubuqi Desert with and without water diversion engineering measures using Sen' s slope, residual analysis, and two -sample T test. We further discussed the contribution of temperature, precipitation and water diversion projects to NDVI changes. The results showed that annual maximum value of NDVI increased in the past 10 years. The NDVI value of 55% of the pixels showed an upward trend before 2015, while the number of pixels that showed an upward trend after 2015 increased to 73%. After the implementation of water diversion project in 2015, grassland area increased from 25 km2 to 41.31 km2, and sandy land area reduced from 65.95 km2 to 17.73 km2. Results of the residual analysis showed that the area where human activities promoted NDVI accounted for 52.92%. The area with significant NDVI changes after human activities accounted for 78.00%. Precipitation before 2015 was the main driving force of NDVI changes, whereas water diversion projects were the dominant factor driving NDVI changes after 2015.

TI  - Changes in Ecosystem Service Value in the 1 km Lakeshore Zone of Poyang Lake from 1980 to 2020
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Poyang Lake is a typical lake in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and is the largest freshwater lake in China. The habitat quality of Poyang Lake has been declining in recent years, leading to a series of ecological problems. An ecological risk evaluation, based on land use, is important in order to promote a coordinated development of land use and the ecological environment. In this paper, land use data from the Poyang Lake basin in the corresponding years are interpreted based on the images from the Landsat satellite mission in seven periods from 1980 to 2020. The lake surface and the 1 km lakeshore zone of Poyang Lake are extracted based on the interpreted land use data. Finally, the ecological service value per unit area of the area is measured by combining it with the Chinese terrestrial ecosystem service value equivalent table, and then with the value of each ecological factor and the value of the changes to land use type. The research results show that: (1) from 1980 to 2000, the lake area of Poyang Lake had an overall decreasing trend (the area slightly increased from 1980 to 1990); from 2000 to 2020, the lake area of Poyang Lake gradually increased (the area slightly decreased from 2015 to 2020). (2) The farmland, forest, grassland and desert areas gradually increased and the wetlands gradually decreased over 40 years; the area of the water body gradually increased from 1980 to 2010, and gradually decreased from 2010 to 2020. (3) The ecosystem service value of the lakeshore zone of Poyang Lake fluctuated around 15,000 x 10(6) Yuan from year to year.

AB  - Burn severity is an important component of the fire regime that has not yet been fully characterized for the forests of Canada. The objectives of this study were to (I) create a Canada-wide geospatial database of burn severity for wildland fires across forested regions of Canada from 1985 to 2015, and (U) use this database to evaluate seasonal and annual trends in burn severity across Canada and regionally using two different regional units (ecozones and Homogeneous Fire Regime zones). We developed the 30 m resolution geospatial Canadian Landsat Burn Severity (rani aRS) product from Landsat imagery, using values of pre-fire to post-fire differences in normalized burn ratios (dNBRs) for nearly 60 Mha of area burned across Canada's forests from 1985 to 2015, complemented with estimates of pre-fire forest composition, crown dosure, and biomass. Our results suggest that burn severity is generally lower in spring fires than in summer ones nationally and in almost every regional unit. We found no consistent relationship between burn severity and annual area burned across ecozones. Finally, we observed a small but significant decrease in burn severity from 1985 to 2015 across Canada, although this is regionally variable. The CanLaBS database is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.23687/b1f61b7e-4ba6-4244-bc79-c1174f2f92cd.

TI  - Integration and Analysis of Multi-Modal Geospatial Secondary Data to Inform Management of at-Risk Archaeological Sites
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change poses an imminent physical risk to cultural heritage sites and their surrounding landscape through intensifying environmental processes such as damaging wetting and drying cycles that disrupt archaeological preservation conditions, and soil erosion which threatens to expose deposits and alter the archaeological context of sites. In the face of such threats, geospatial techniques such as GIS, remote sensing, and spatial modelling have proved invaluable tools for archaeological research and cultural heritage monitoring. This paper presents the application of secondary multi-source and multi-temporal geospatial data within a processing framework to provide a comprehensive assessment of geophysical risk to the Roman fort of Magna, Carvoran, UK. An investigation into the ancient hydraulic system at Magna was carried out with analysis of vegetation change over time, and spatio-temporal analysis of soil erosion risk at the site. Due to COVID-19 restrictions in place at the time of this study, these analyses were conducted using only secondary data with the aim to guide further archaeological research, and management and monitoring strategies for the stakeholders involved. Results guided inferences about the ancient hydraulic system, providing insights regarding how to better manage the site at Magna in the future. Analysis of soil erosion allowed the identification of hot spot areas, indicating a future increase in rates of erosion at Magna and suggesting a seasonal period of higher risk of degradation to the site. Results have proven that freely available multi-purpose national-scale datasets are sufficient to create meaningful insights into archaeological sites where physical access to the site is inhibited. This infers the potential to carry out preliminary risk assessment to inform future site management practices.
