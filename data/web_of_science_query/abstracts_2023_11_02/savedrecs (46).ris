TI  - Deep Learning for Predicting Significant Wave Height From Synthetic Aperture Radar
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1 satellites equipped with synthetic aperture radars (SARs) provide near-global coverage of the world's oceans every six days. We curate a data set of collocations between SAR and altimeter satellites and investigate the use of deep learning to predict significant wave height from SAR. While previous models for predicting geophysical quantities from SAR rely heavily on feature-engineering, our approach learns directly from low-level image cross-spectra. Training on collocations from 2015 to 2017, we demonstrate on test data from 2018 that deep learning reduces the state-of-the-art root mean squared error by 50%, from 0.6 to 0.3 m when compared to altimeter data. Furthermore, we isolate the contributions of different features to the model performance.

TI  - Relative Total Variation Structure Analysis-Based Fusion Method for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The fusion of the hyperspectral image (HSI) and the light detecting and ranging (LiDAR) data has a wide range of applications. This paper proposes a novel feature fusion method for urban area classification, namely the relative total variation structure analysis (RTVSA), to combine various features derived from HSI and LiDAR data. In the feature extraction stage, a variety of high-performance methods including the extended multi-attribute profile, Gabor filter, and local binary pattern are used to extract the features of the input data. The relative total variation is then applied to remove useless texture information of the processed data. Finally, nonparametric weighted feature extraction is adopted to reduce the dimensions. Random forest and convolutional neural networks are utilized to evaluate the fusion images. Experiments conducted on two urban Houston University datasets (including Houston 2012 and the training portion of Houston 2017) demonstrate that the proposed method can extract the structural correlation from heterogeneous data, withstand a noise well, and improve the land cover classification accuracy.

TI  - Lux et Tenebris? Coloniality and Anglican Missions in Argentine Patagonia in the Nineteenth Century
T2  - HUMANITIES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the modern capitalist World-System, Missionary work was mostly developed through the connubiality with colonial powers. The missionary work of the Anglican Church is no exception. This article centers on the missionary enterprise carried out in Argentine Patagonia in the nineteenth century. Missionaries' reports carefully narrated that venture. However, the language and the notions underlying the missionary work's narration reveal the dominion of colonial ideologies that imbued how religious agents constructed alterity. Connecting the missionaries' worldview with the political context and expansion of the British Empire allows us to unfold the complex intersections of religious, ethnic, racial, and geopolitical discourses that traverse the lives of indigenous peoples in South America.

TI  - Multi-U-Net: Residual Module under Multisensory Field and Attention Mechanism Based Optimized U-Net for VHR Image Semantic Segmentation
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the acquisition of very high resolution (VHR) images becomes easier, the complex characteristics of VHR images pose new challenges to traditional machine learning semantic segmentation methods. As an excellent convolutional neural network (CNN) structure, U-Net does not require manual intervention, and its high-precision features are widely used in image interpretation. However, as an end-to-end fully convolutional network, U-Net has not explored enough information from the full scale, and there is still room for improvement. In this study, we constructed an effective network module: residual module under a multisensory field (RMMF) to extract multiscale features of target and an attention mechanism to optimize feature information. RMMF uses parallel convolutional layers to learn features of different scales in the network and adds shortcut connections between stacked layers to construct residual blocks, combining low-level detailed information with high-level semantic information. RMMF is universal and extensible. The convolutional layer in the U-Net network is replaced with RMMF to improve the network structure. Additionally, the multiscale convolutional network was tested using RMMF on the Gaofen-2 data set and Potsdam data sets. Experiments show that compared to other technologies, this method has better performance in airborne and spaceborne images.

M3  - Article
AB  - Over the years, the management of early breast cancer has evolved by leaps and bounds, as has the concept of axillary staging and armpit surgical management. Five randomised studies exist that evaluate the possibility of omitting regional locus surgical axillary treatment in patients with early breast cancer and positive sentinel lymph nodes without it having an impact on the prognosis of the disease in selected cases. A review of the literature on the management of the axilla in early breast cancer is presented.

TI  - Satellite estimation of emission factors and emissions of biomass-carbon due to deforestation and forest degradation in Bangladesh for a REDD plus program
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Deforestation and forest degradation are two important contributors to atmospheric emissions of carbon. To claim carbon credit for conservation plus enhancement of existing forest carbon stock under reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) program, a post-Kyoto climate change mitigation initiative, developing countries need to assess the level of respective forest biomass-carbon and corresponding emissions of carbon in a complete and verifiable manner. We aimed to develop a comprehensive approach following the recommended inter-governmental panel on climate change good practice guidelines to estimate emission factors and emissions of biomass-carbon due to deforestation and forest degradation at Raghunandan Hills Reserved Forest, Bangladesh, for REDD+ implications. The estimation was done using a combination of field and satellite data employing geospatial techniques. The critical assessment provided a comprehensive estimate of the emission factors and emissions of biomass-carbon in the form of maps and statistics with acceptable accuracy. The approaches and findings of this study may have important scientific and management implications including providing baseline information for biomass-carbon stock-related concerns such as REDD+.

TI  - Organic Farming and Cover-Crop Management Reduce Pest Predation in Austrian Vineyards
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryGlobal declines in arthropods necessitate a rethinking of current agricultural practices. Organic farming, complex landscapes with high proportions of seminatural habitats and local vineyard management practices such as implementation of flower-rich cover-crop mixtures may be a promising approach to enhance arthropod biodiversity and, thus, natural pest control in viticulture. We examined effects of organic farming, different types of vineyard inter-row vegetation, and landscape composition on natural pest control of a major grapevine pest, the grape berry moth Lobesia botrana, and identified its dominant natural enemies. Surprisingly, natural pest control was reduced by sown cover-crops and organic farming. Interestingly, bush crickets were one of the most dominant natural enemies in the Austrian study region. Negative effects of organic farming in our study are most likely related to high fungicide inputs. Thus, a promising approach to reduce fungicide input and, therefore, promote a more sustainable viticulture may be the implementation of fungus-resistant grape varieties.Habitat simplification and intensive use of pesticides are main drivers of global arthropod declines and are, thus, decreasing natural pest control. Organic farming, complex landscapes, and local vineyard management practices such as implementation of flower-rich cover-crop mixtures may be a promising approach to enhance predator abundance and, therefore, natural pest control. We examined the effect of organic versus integrated management, cover-crop diversity in the vineyard inter-rows, and landscape composition on the natural pest control of Lobesia botrana eggs and pupae. Predation of L. botrana pupae was reduced by organic farming and species-poor cover-crops by about 10%. Predation rates of L. botrana eggs did not differ significantly in any of the studied management options. Dominant predators were earwigs (Forficulidae), bush crickets (Tettigoniidae), and ants (Formicidae). Negative effects of organic viticulture are most likely related to the negative nontarget effects on arthropods related to the frequent sulfur and copper applications in combination with the avoidance of strongly damaging insecticides by integrated winegrowers. While a 10% difference in predation rates on a single pest stage is unlikely to have strong practical implications, our results show that the assumed effectiveness of environmentally friendly agriculture needs to be evaluated for specific crops and regions.

TI  - Atmospheric Pollutants Assessment during the COVID-19 Lockdown Using Remote Sensing and Ground-based Measurements in Buenos Aires, Argentina
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak measures of lockdown have generated exceptional urban behavior conditions allowing the analysis of a unique scenario. We examined the atmospheric emissions in Buenos Aires, Argentina, based on urban and industrial continuous monitoring of NO2, PM10 and PM2.5, and NO2 (TROPOMI/Sentinel-5p) and AOD (MAIAC/MODIS, Aqua) satellite products, in addition with meteorological data. We considered the time intervals before and after the announcement of lockdown, including the same periods for 2019. The results showed that NO2 and PM10 concentrations fell by similar to 30% and 44%, respectively, at urban stations during lockdown compared to 2019. An increase in PM at the industrial station (64% PM2.5 and 8% PM10) could be due to the contribution of industrial sources other than vehicle traffic. Also, we observed a reduction of the tropospheric NO2 column density mean by 54% at urban stations, and AOD values decreased between 38% and 66% during 2020. Concerning the spatial distribution, the tropospheric NO2 column showed a significant reduction of NO2 for the monthly mean in the metropolitan area at lockdown. Similarly, the AOD highest values had a greater extension for 2020 during the pre-lockdown monthly period. After the strict lockdown, concentration values increased steadily, particularly in ground-based measurements. Therefore, we were able to demonstrate the complementarity of ground-based and satellite data measurements of NO2 and aerosol to identify the effects of lockdown measures on the spatial and temporal variability of pollutants.

TI  - The Explanatory Gap: Progress and Problems
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF CONSCIOUSNESS-THEORY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - In the target article, Klein (2021) argues that current science, because of its commitment to a restrictive physicalist metaphysics, will not be able to solve the hard problem. The message seems to be rather pessimistic: Unless the science of consciousness finds an alternative metaphysical basis that embraces the qualitative, subjective nature of phenomenal consciousness, there will be little if any true progress made in explaining consciousness scientifically. In this commentary, I present a more optimistic view: For now, the science of consciousness can still make progress in explaining consciousness even without resorting to any radical metaphysical changes to the scientific worldview. But if future neuroscience fails to discover the true neural constituents of consciousness in the brain, and the explanatory gap thereby remains wide open, then the science of consciousness might be forced to reconsider its metaphysical commitments.

TI  - Evaluation of Barrier Sprays Containing a Pyrethroid and an Insect Growth Regulator to Control <i>Aedes albopictus</i> in a Suburban Environment in North Carolina
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Barrier sprays are a common method for controlling a variety of diurnal and crepuscular mosquito species, especially for residential backyard applications. Little is known, however, about the extent to which barrier sprays containing insect growth regulators (IGR) such as pyriproxyfen affect immature mosquito development and life table characteristics. To learn more, we carried out a field study in a suburban Eastern North Carolina neighborhood from May 16-November 2, 2017. We evaluated the effect of Demand CS (pyrethroid adulticide with active ingredient lambda-cyhalothrin) and Archer (IGR with active ingredient pyriproxyfen) exposure with respect to reproduction (measured by fecundity, fertility, and adult emergence) and abundance of host-seeking mosquitoes Aedes albopictus (Diptera: Culicidae). These mosquitoes were collected using BG-Sentinel 2 traps; oviposition intensity was monitored using ovitraps for each property involved in the study. Eggs from ovitraps were reared in the laboratory to assess life table characteristics. Significantly more Ae. albopictus eggs (p < .05) were detected in ovitraps located in control lots, whereas no significant differences were observed in host-seeking adult abundance of Ae. albopictus between treatments. Potential reasons for this finding are discussed with respect to oviposition and host-seeking behavior of Ae. albopictus. Pyriproxyfen could be a useful control method for some populations of Ae. albopictus, especially where resistance to other active ingredients or cryptic oviposition sources are present.

T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING
M3  - Review
AB  - Within interventional nuclear medicine (iNM) a prominent role is allocated for the sub-discipline of radioguided surgery. Unique for this discipline is the fact that an increasing number of clinical indications (e.g. lymphatic mapping, local tumor demarcation and/or tumor receptor targeted applications) have been adopted into routine care. The clinical integration is further strengthened by technical innovations in chemistry and engineering that enhance the translational potential of radioguided procedures in iNM. Together, these features not only ensure ongoing expansion of iNM but also warrant a lasting clinical impact for the sub-discipline of radioguided surgery.

AB  - Vulval cancer is rare. With Bartholin gland carcinomas representing <5% of all vulval carcinomas they present both diagnostic and management challenges. There are a small number of cases in the literature describing Bartholin gland carcinomas with unusual histology which necessitates the need to explore the possibility of metastases from elsewhere. We present a case of a 55-yr-old woman presenting with a vulval lesion within the Bartholin gland. Morphology demonstrated enteric type adenocarcinoma and the immunohistochemistry profile was positive for CK7, CK20, CDX2, CEA, and CA19-9. There was no evidence of an alternative primary cancer and the tumor was excised with negative regional sentinel node assessment. Genotyping showed no detectable mutations in KRAS, BRAF or NRAS suggesting a possible future role for anti-EGFR therapy.

TI  - From local spectral species to global spectral communities: A benchmark for ecosystem diversity estimate by remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - In the light of unprecedented change in global biodiversity, real-time and accurate ecosystem and biodiversity assessments are becoming increasingly essential. Nevertheless, estimation of biodiversity using ecological field data can be difficult for several reasons. For instance, for very large areas, it is challenging to collect data that provide reliable information. Some of these restrictions in Earth observation can be avoided through the use of remote sensing approaches. Various studies have estimated biodiversity on the basis of the Spectral Variation Hypothesis (SVH). According to this hypothesis, spectral heterogeneity over the different pixel units of a spatial grid reflects a higher niche heterogeneity, allowing more organisms to coexist. Recently, the spectral species concept has been derived, following the consideration that spectral heterogeneity at a landscape scale corresponds to a combination of subspaces sharing a similar spectral signature. With the use of high resolution remote sensing data, on a local scale, these subspaces can be identified as separate spectral entities, the so called "spectral species". Our approach extends this concept over wide spatial extents and to a higher level of biological organization. We applied this method to MODIS imagery data across Europe. Obviously, in this case, a spectral species identified by MODIS is not associated to a single plant species in the field but rather to a species assemblage, habitat, or ecosystem. Based on such spectral information, we propose a straightforward method to derive a-(local relative abundance and richness of spectral species) and fl-diversity (turnover of spectral species) maps over wide geographical areas.

TI  - Effects of Bark Beetle Outbreaks on Forest Landscape Pattern in the Southern Rocky Mountains, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the late 1990s, extensive outbreaks of native bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) have affected coniferous forests throughout Europe and North America, driving changes in carbon storage, wildlife habitat, nutrient cycling, and water resource provisioning. Remote sensing is a crucial tool for quantifying the effects of these disturbances across broad landscapes. In particular, Landsat time series (LTS) are increasingly used to characterize outbreak dynamics, including the presence and severity of bark beetle-caused tree mortality, though broad-scale LTS-based maps are rarely informed by detailed field validation. Here we used spatial and temporal information from LTS products, in combination with extensive field data and Random Forest (RF) models, to develop 30-m maps of the presence (i.e., any occurrence) and severity (i.e., cumulative percent basal area mortality) of beetle-caused tree mortality 1997-2019 in subalpine forests throughout the Southern Rocky Mountains, USA. Using resultant maps, we also quantified spatial patterns of cumulative tree mortality throughout the region, an important yet poorly understood concept in beetle-affected forests. RF models using LTS products to predict presence and severity performed well, with 80.3% correctly classified (Kappa = 0.61) and R-2 = 0.68 (RMSE = 17.3), respectively. We found that >= 10,256 km(2) of subalpine forest area (39.5% of the study area) was affected by bark beetles and 19.3% of the study area experienced >= 70% tree mortality over the twenty-three year period. Variograms indicated that severity was autocorrelated at scales < 250 km. Interestingly, cumulative patch-size distributions showed that areas with a near-total loss of the overstory canopy (i.e., >= 90% mortality) were relatively small (<0.24 km(2)) and isolated throughout the study area. Our findings help to inform an understanding of the variable effects of bark beetle outbreaks across complex forested regions and provide insight into patterns of disturbance legacies, landscape connectivity, and susceptibility to future disturbance.

TI  - Disturbance detection in landsat time series is influenced by tree mortality agent and severity, not by prior disturbance
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat time series (LTS) and associated change detection algorithms are useful for monitoring the effects of global change on Earth's ecosystems. Because LTS algorithms can be easily applied across broad areas, they are commonly used to map changes in forest structure due to wildfire, insect attack, and other important drivers of tree mortality. But factors such as initial forest density, tree mortality agent, and disturbance severity (i.e., percent tree mortality) influence patterns of surface reflectance and may influence the accuracy of LTS algorithms. And while LTS algorithms are widely used in areas with a history of multiple disturbance events during the Landsat record, the effectiveness of LTS algorithms in these conditions is not well understood. We compared products from the LTS algorithm LandTrendr (Landsat-based Detection of Trends in Disturbance and Recovery) with a unique field dataset from a landscape heavily influenced by both wildfire and spruce beetles (Dendroctonus rufipennis) since c. 2000. We also compared LandTrendr to other common methods of mapping fire- and spruce beetle-affected areas. We found that LandTrendr more accurately detected wildfire than spruce beetle-induced tree mortality, and both mortality agents were more easily detected when they occurred at high severity. Surprisingly, prior spruce beetle outbreaks did not influence the detectability of subsequent wildfire. Compared to alternative disturbance mapping approaches, LandTrendr predicted a c. 40% lower area affected by wildfire or spruce beetle outbreaks. Our findings indicate that disturbance type- and severity-specific differences in omission error may have broad implications for disturbance mapping efforts that utilize Landsat data. Gradual, low-severity disturbances (e.g., background tree mortality and non-stand replacing disturbance) are pervasive in forest ecosystems, yet they can be difficult to detect using automated LTS algorithms. Whenever possible, methods to account for these biases should be incorporated in LTS-based mapping efforts, including the use of multispectral ensembles and ancillary spatial data to refine predictions. However, our findings also indicate that LTS algorithms appear to be robust in areas with multiple disturbance events, which is important because these areas will increase as new acquisitions extend the length of the Landsat record.

TI  - Observation of Maritime Traffic Interruption in Patagonia during the COVID-19 Lockdown Using Copernicus Sentinel-1 Data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Human mobilization during the COVID-19 lockdown has been reduced in many areas of the world. Maritime navigation has been affected in strategic connections between some regions in Patagonia, at the southern end of South America. The purpose of this research is to describe this interruption of navigation using satellite synthetic aperture radar data. For this goal, three locations are observed using geoinformatic techniques and high-resolution satellite data from the Sentinel-1 satellites of the European Commission's Copernicus programme. The spatial information is analyzed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform as a global geographical information system and the EO Browser tool, integrated with several satellite data. The results demonstrate that the total maritime traffic activity in the three geographical hotspots selected along western Patagonia, the Chacao Channel, crossing of the Reloncavi Fjord and the Strait of Magellan was totally interrupted during April-May 2020. This fact has relevant repercussions for the population living in isolated areas, such as many places in Patagonia, including Tierra del Fuego. The study also demonstrates the relevance of satellite radar observations in coastal areas with severe cloud cover, such as the one evaluated here.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Snow Cover Variability and Its Influence on the Runoff of Sapmi's Rivers
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The boreal winter 2019/2020 was very irregular in Europe. While there was very little snow in Central Europe, the opposite was the case in northern Fenno-Scandia, particularly in the Arctic. The snow cover was more persistent here and its rapid melting led to flooding in many places. Since the last severe spring floods occurred in the region in 2018, this raises the question of whether more frequent occurrences can be expected in the future. To assess the variability of snowmelt related flooding we used snow cover maps (derived from the DLR's Global SnowPack MODIS snow product) and freely available data on runoff, precipitation, and air temperature in eight unregulated river catchment areas. A trend analysis (Mann-Kendall test) was carried out to assess the development of the parameters, and the interdependencies of the parameters were examined with a correlation analysis. Finally, a simple snowmelt runoff model was tested for its applicability to this region. We noticed an extraordinary variability in the duration of snow cover. If this extends well into spring, rapid air temperature increases leads to enhanced thawing. According to the last flood years 2005, 2010, 2018, and 2020, we were able to differentiate between four synoptic flood types based on their special hydrometeorological and snow situation and simulate them with the snowmelt runoff model (SRM).

TI  - Challenges in the atmospheric characterization for the retrieval of spectrally resolved fluorescence and PRI region dynamics from space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the coming years, Earth Observation missions like the FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX) will acquire the radiance signal from the visible to the near-infrared at a very high spectral resolution, enabling exciting prospects for new insights in satellite-based photosynthetic studies. In this context, the process of de-coupling atmospheric and vegetation-related spectral signatures will become essential to guarantee a reliable estimation of the vegetation photosynthetic activity from space. Dynamic changes related to the vegetation photosynthetic status result in subtle contributions to the top of atmosphere radiance signal, e.g. due to the emission of the solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (similar to 650-800 nm) or due to changes in surface reflectance spectra (500-600 nm) indicating variations in the vegetation photoprotection and light use efficiency. Conversely, atmospheric effects (molecular and aerosol absorption and scattering) dominate the spectral interval of interest for vegetation studies. This article presents a comprehensive overview of the atmospheric radiative effects caused by aerosols, ozone (O-3), water vapor (H2O), oxygen (O-2), and atmospheric pressure and temperature changes within the visible and near-infrared spectral interval, and paying special attention to the co-occurring vegetation-related spectral changes associated with the fluorescence emission and the activation of the photoprotection mechanisms. Since the largest uncertainties in the atmospheric correction process are associated with the characterization of the aerosol radiative effects, this work largely concentrates on the satellite retrieval-related implications under different aerosol absorbing and scattering scenarios on a global scale. Through a simulation exercise, it is evaluated to what extent aerosol climatology could influence the accuracy of satellite-derived surface apparent reflectance spectra impacting; therefore, any vegetation-related satellite product on a seasonal and global scale.

TI  - Late Cretaceous Ridge Reorganization, Microplate Formation, and the Evolution of the Rio Grande Rise - Walvis Ridge Hot Spot Twins, South Atlantic Ocean
T2  - GEOCHEMISTRY GEOPHYSICS GEOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rio Grande Rise (RGR) and Walvis Ridge (WR) are South Atlantic large igneous provinces (LIPs), formed on the South American and African plates, respectively, mainly by volcanism from a hot spot erupting at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) during the Late Cretaceous. Both display morphologic complexities that imply their tectonic evolution is incompletely understood. We studied bathymetry, gravity, and vertical gravity gradient maps derived from satellite altimetry to trace faults providing indications of seafloor spreading directions and changes. We also examined magnetic anomalies for time constraint and reflection seismic data for structural information. Abyssal hill fabric and magnetic anomaly data indicate that the area between RGR and WR was anomalous between anomalies C34 (83.6 Ma) and C30 (66.4 Ma) owing to reorganization of a right-lateral transform on the MAR. This event began similar to 92 Ma as the transform shifted south to form multiple, short-offset right-lateral transforms, with the reorganization extending through anomaly C34 and ending before anomaly C30. Anomalous spacing of magnetic anomalies and discordant fault fabric indicate that a microplate formed with a core of Cretaceous Quiet Zone seafloor. As the MAR jumped eastward, this microplate was captured by the South American plate and now resides mostly in a basin between the main RGR plateau and a related ridge to the east (East Rio Grande Rise). The microplate is ringed by igneous massifs, implying a link with volcanism. The results presented here indicate that these two LIPs had a complex Late Cretaceous history that belies simple hot spot models.

TI  - The Utilization of Supervised Classification Sampling for Environmental Monitoring in Turin (Italy)
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a world threatened by climate change, the need to observe the land transformation is crucial to set environmental policies. One of the most prominent issues of environmental monitoring is the availability of updated and reliable land use data. The last land-use release in Piedmont Region (Italy) is in 2010, while the most updated Normalized Difference Vegetation Index is in 2016. To overcome this limit, in this study, a supervised classification sampling has been applied on a Sentinel-2 image produced by the Copernicus Program on 29 September 2020, using Esri ArcGIS (ver.10.8 Redlands, California, US) by accessing via ONDA-DIAS services to L2A products. After land classification, three maps were generated-the Habitat Quality, the Habitat Decay, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. This study aimed at classifying the environmental status in five classes ranging from "critical" to "health" with a double perspective-(i) to make a comparative metropolitan assessment between municipalities and (ii) to evaluate the quality of urban public green areas in the city of Turin while defining a different kind of intervention. Results indicate that products derived from supervised classification sampling can be applied in a wide range of applications while reaching seasonal monitoring of the environmental status and delivering just-in-time solutions.

M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a newly developed model for automated monitoring and control of productivity in earth-moving operations. The model makes use of advancements in wireless sensing networks, Internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence. It utilizes data analytics and a dashboard to provide project managers with actionable data on the status of these operations in near-real time. The model consists of two modules; the first is a low-cost open-source remote sensing data acquisition module for collecting data throughout the execution of earthmoving operations. The collected data are sent to a cloud-based MySQL database, in which the second module is designed to (1) measure actual productivity in nearreal-time, (2) detecting the location and condition of hauling roads, and (3) monitoring and reporting driving conditions over these roads. Artificial neural network (ANN) is used in cloud computing for analyzing the productivity to determine and prioritize causes behind experienced loss of productivity from that planned. This paper presents cloud computing over a web-based platform ( KnowiVR). Productivity measurement and analysis outputs are retrieved through any web browser. The work encompassed field and scaled laboratory experiments in the development and validation processes of the developed model. The laboratory experiments 1:24 scaled loader and dumping truck to simulate loading, hauling, and dumping operations. The data collected from the lab experiments and field work was used as input for the developed model. The results obtained highlight the accuracy of the developed model in recognition of the status of the hauling truck, traveled road condition, and in the estimated duration of the simulated earthmoving cycles.

T2  - OPTICA PURA Y APLICADA
M3  - Article
AB  - The land on which we live has a tight environmental system, and the elements of life in it must be preserved, as pollution rates have increased in general, including water pollution, and the environmental problems it causes due to population inflation. The development of modern science and technology can contribute greatly to preserving the components of the environmental balance. It was scientifically found that each body has a radiative value that distinguishes it from other bodies and this is called the thermal fingerprint of objects, and therefore the radiation signature of a body is what distinguishes it from other bodies. Accordingly, from here it is possible to reveal what these objects are without direct contact and know their components from distance. This study addresses the aspect of monitoring the spectral footprint of polluted water, especially the waste of hospitals and factories, which causes great damage to the beaches and must be monitored first-hand through the use of a thermal monitoring device and conducting field examinations directly. The study area was determined near one of the wastes of Baghdad hospitals on one side of the Tigris River and compared with the values of the thermal spectral footprint taken from satellites that carry thermal sensors The results showed the convergence of the measured values with the values taken from the thermal sensors, which confirms the accuracy of the thermal images in the (10-11) beam of the satellite.

M3  - Article
AB  - The paper pays attention to a fragment of socio-psycholinguistic research of a religious component of the associative word meaning - a component of the word structure. On a psycho-verbal level this component arouses a certain minimum of verbal reactions which are similar in relation to a number of characteristics (the inner - of perceptive, cognitive, emotive nature and the external - contextual ones) in consciousness of representatives of Christian (Orthodox) and Islamic (Muslim) religions. The authors rely on the heuristic that the studying of interconfessional verbal communication is determined by the importance of this phenomenon as one of the linguo-social structure aspects. The results of the experiments conducted on a staged basis in 2012-2018 make for a relevant conclusion: religious component of a different degree of formation and awareness exists in a linguistic consciousness of almost every native speaker of the Russian language (regardless of belonging to a particular ethnic group), including participants of the religious groups. The study also shows that interconfessional groups have different social experience and resulting identity of axiological attitudes that defines complex dialectic of their social-psychological and verbal interaction. The role of a word in shaping individual's religiosity resides in the fact that it is precisely the meaning of a word that may act not only as a transparent (in terms of semantics) code of religious knowledge, but also as a sacred, religious object. Perspectives of researching the specific of religious component of the word`s meaning is oriented to the analysis of people linguistic consciousness peculiarities on the grounds of different religious identity.

TI  - On the Seasonality of the Snow Optical Behaviour at Ny Ålesund (Svalbard Islands, Norway)
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Polar areas are the most sensitive targets of climate change. From this perspective, the continuous monitoring of the cryosphere represents a critical need, which, now, we can only partially supply with specific satellite missions. The integration between remote-sensed multi-spectral images and field data is crucial to validate retrieval algorithms and climatological models. The optical behavior of snow, at different wavelengths, provides significant information about the microphysical characteristics of the surface in addition to the spatial distribution of snow/ice covers. This work presents the unmanned apparatus installed at Ny Alesund (Svalbard) that provides continuous spectral surface albedo. A narrow band device was compared to a full-range system, to remotely sensed data during the 2015 spring/summer period at the Amundsen-Nobile Climate Change Tower. The system was integrated with a camera aimed to acquire sky and ground images. The results confirmed the possibility of making continuous observations of the snow surface and highlighted the opportunity to monitor the spectral variations of snowed surfaces during the melting period.

AB  - In their comments about our paper, the authors remark on two issues regarding our results relating to the MACCS-ATCOR Joint Algorithm (MAJA). The first relates to the sub-optimal performance of this algorithm under the conditions of our tests, while the second corresponds to an error in our interpretation of MAJA's bit mask. To answer the first issue, we acknowledge MAJA's capacity to improve its performance as the number of images increases with time. However, in our paper, we used the images we had available at the time we wrote our paper. Regarding the second issue, we misread the MAJA's bit mask and mistakenly labelled shadows as clouds. We regret our error and here we present the updated tables and images. We corrected our estimation and, consequently, there is an increment in MAJA's accuracy in the detection of clouds and cloud shadows. However, these increments are not enough to change the conclusion of our original paper.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) following neoadjuvant treatment (NACT) has been questioned by many studies that reported heterogeneous identification (IR) and false negative rates (FNR). As a result, some patients receive axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) regardless of response to NACT, leading to a potential overtreatment. To better assess reliability and clinical significance of SLNB status on ycN0 patients, we retrospectively analyzed oncological outcomes of 399 patients treated between January 2016 and December 2019 that were either cN0-ycN0 (219 patients) or cN1/2-ycN0 (180 patients). The Endpoints of our study were to assess, furthermore than IR: oncological outcomes as Overall Survival (OS); Distant Disease Free Survival (DDFS); and Regional Disease Free Survival (RDFS) according to SLNB status. SLN identification rate was 96.8% (98.2% in patients cN0-ycN0 and 95.2% in patients cN+-ycN0). A median number of three lymph nodes were identified and removed. Among cN0-ycN0 patients, 149 (68%) were confirmed ypN0(sn), whereas regarding cN1/2-ycN0 cases 86 (47.8%) confirmed an effective downstaging to ypN0. Three year OS, DDFS and RDFS were significantly related to SLNB positivity. Our data seemed to confirm SLNB feasibility following NACT in ycN0 patients, furthermore reinforcing its predictive role in a short observation timing.

TI  - Variability in Population Traits of a Sentinel Iberian Fish in a Highly Modified Mediterranean-Type River
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Human pressures on water resources have been suggested as a driver of biological traits that induce changes in native fish populations. This study highlighted the interplay between environmental stress factors, mostly related to flow regulation, and the longitudinal river gradient in biological traits such as the growth, size structure and somatic condition of a sentinel fish, Luciobarbus sclateri. We found an increase in size-related metrics and somatic condition at population levels associated with downstream reaches, although fragmentation and habitat alteration, flow regime alteration and the abundance of non-native fish were also significantly involved in their variability. Age-related parameters and growth were only explained by flow regime alterations and the abundance of non-native fish species. The high plasticity observed in L. sclateri population traits suggests that this is a key factor in the species adaptability to resist in a strongly altered Mediterranean river basin. However, the interplay of multiple stressors plays an important role in fish population dynamics and could induce complex responses that may be essential for long-term monitoring in sentinel species.

TI  - The Effect of DEM on the Land Use/Cover Classification Accuracy of Landsat OLI Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use provides crucial data for earth science research and its accuracy has always been a hot topic. Various auxiliary data are used to improve the classification accuracy of land use. The digital elevation model (DEM) is one of the common auxiliary data since topography directly affects the surface landscape. However, few researches focus on the impact of the DEM on the classification accuracy of images. In this study, the terrain steepness index (TSI) was initially put forward to study the effect of the DEM on the classification accuracy of the land use/cover. Seven areas with different terrain were taken as the studied areas and the classification and regression tree was utilized to derive thematic land use/cover maps. It indicated that the DEM had an impact on classification accuracy in a certain TSI extent. The developed quadratic model accurately described the correlation between the DEM and the TSI. Based on the model, the DEM with 30 m resolution had a positive impact on the classification accuracy, when the TSI varies from 9.106 to 34.014. It was concluded that the TSI index for the DEM could be effectively used in the land use/cover classification.

TI  - Interannual Climate Variability in the West Antarctic Peninsula under Austral Summer Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to describe the interannual climate variability in the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) under austral summer conditions. Time series of January sea-surface temperature (SST) at 1 km spatial resolution from satellite-based multi-sensor data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) Terra, MODIS Aqua, and Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) were compiled between 2001 and 2020 at localities near the Gerlache Strait and the Carlini, Palmer, and Rothera research stations. The results revealed a well-marked spatial-temporal variability in SST at the WAP, with a one-year warm episode followed by a five-year cold episode. Warm waters (SST > 0 degrees C) reach the coast during warm episodes but remain far from the shore during cold episodes. This behavior of warm waters may be related to the regional variability of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, particularly when the South Polar Front (carrying warm waters) reaches the WAP coast. The WAP can be divided into two zones representing two distinct ecoregions: the northern zone (including the Carlini and Gerlache stations) corresponds to the South Shetland Islands ecoregion, and the southern zone (including the Palmer and Rothera stations) corresponds to the Antarctic Peninsula ecoregion. The Gerlache Strait is likely situated on the border between the two ecoregions but under a greater influence of the northern zone. Our data showed that the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the primary driver of SST variability, while the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) plays a secondary role. However, further studies are needed to better understand regional climate variability in the WAP and its relation with SAM and ENSO; such studies should use an index that adequately describes the ENSO in these latitudes and addresses the limitations of the databases used for this purpose. Multi-sensor data are useful in describing the complex climate variability resulting from the combination of local and regional processes that elicit different responses across the WAP. It is also essential to continue improving SST approximations at high latitudes.

TI  - Identifying Spatiotemporal Patterns in Land Use and Cover Samples from Satellite Image Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite image time series analysis and machine learning methods brings new opportunities and challenges for land use and cover changes (LUCC) mapping over large areas. One of these challenges is the need for samples that properly represent the high variability of land used and cover classes over large areas to train supervised machine learning methods and to produce accurate LUCC maps. This paper addresses this challenge and presents a method to identify spatiotemporal patterns in land use and cover samples to infer subclasses through the phenological and spectral information provided by satellite image time series. The proposed method uses self-organizing maps (SOMs) to reduce the data dimensionality creating primary clusters. From these primary clusters, it uses hierarchical clustering to create subclusters that recognize intra-class variability intrinsic to different regions and periods, mainly in large areas and multiple years. To show how the method works, we use MODIS image time series associated to samples of cropland and pasture classes over the Cerrado biome in Brazil. The results prove that the proposed method is suitable for identifying spatiotemporal patterns in land use and cover samples that can be used to infer subclasses, mainly for crop-types.

TI  - Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Temporal Responses to Temperature and Precipitation in Arid Rangelands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rangeland degradation caused by increasing misuses remains a global concern. Rangelands have a remarkable spatiotemporal heterogeneity, making them suitable to be monitored with remote sensing. Among the remotely sensed vegetation indices, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is most used in ecology and agriculture. In this paper, we research the relationship of NDVI with temperature, precipitation, and Aridity Index (AI) in four different arid rangeland areas in Spain's southeast. We focus on the interphase variability, studying time series from 2002 to 2019 with regression analysis and lagged correlation at two different spatial resolutions (500 x 500 and 250 x 250 m(2)) to understand NDVI response to meteorological variables. Intraseasonal phases were defined based on NDVI patterns. Strong correlation with temperature was reported in phases with high precipitations. The correlation between NDVI and meteorological series showed a time lag effect depending on the area, phase, and variable observed. Differences were found between the two resolutions, showing a stronger relationship with the finer one. Land uses and management affected the NDVI dynamics heavily strongly linked to temperature and water availability. The relationship between AI and NDVI clustered the areas in two groups. The intraphases variability is a crucial aspect of NDVI dynamics, particularly in arid regions.

TI  - Exploring Climate Change Effects on Vegetation Phenology by MOD13Q1 Data: The Piemonte Region Case Study in the Period 2001-2019
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising temperature, rainfall, and wind regime changes, increasing of frequency and intensity of extreme events are only some of the effects of climate change affecting the agro-forestry sector. Earth Observation data from satellite missions (often available for free) can certainly support analysis of climate change effects on vegetation, making possible to improve land management in space and time. Within this context, the present work aims at investigating natural and agricultural vegetation, as mapped by Corine Land Cover (CLC) dataset, focusing on phenological metrics trends that can be possibly conditioned by the ongoing climate-change. The study area consists of the entire Piemonte region (NW-Italy). MOD13Q1-v6 dataset from TERRA MODIS mission was used to describe pluri-annual (2001-2019) phenological behavior of vegetation focusing on the following CLC classes: Non-irrigated arable land, Vineyards, Pastures, and Forests. After computing and mapping some phenological metrics as derivable from the interpretation of at-pixel level NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) temporal profile, we found that the most significant one was the maximum annual NDVI (MaxNDVI). Consequently, its trend was analyzed at CLC class level for the whole Piemonte region. Natural and semi-natural vegetation classes (Pastures and Forests) were furtherly investigated testing significance of the Percent Total Variation (TV%) of MaxNDVI in the period 2001-2019 for different altitude classes. Results proved that Non-irrigated arable land showed a not significant trend of MaxNDVI; differently, vineyards and forests showed a significant increasing one. Concerning TV%, it was found that it increases with altitude for the Forests CLC class, while it decreases with altitude for the pastures class.

TI  - Defending one's worldview under mortality salience: Testing the validity of an established idea
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror management theory (TMT) posits that mortality salience (MS) leads to more negative perceptions of persons who oppose one's worldview and to more positive perceptions of persons who confirm one's worldview. Recent failed replications of classic findings have thrown into question empirical validity for this established idea. We believe, that there are crucial methodological and theoretical aspects that have been neglected in these studies which limit their explanatory power; thus, the studies of this registered report aimed to address these issues and to directly test the worldview defense hypothesis. First, we conducted two preregistered lab studies applying the classic worldview defense paradigm. The stimulus material (worldview-confirming and -opposing essays) was previously validated for students at a German university. In both studies, the MS manipulation (between-subjects) was followed by a distraction phase. Then, in Study 1 (N = 131), each participant read both essays (within-subjects). In Study 2 (N = 276), the essays were manipulated between-subjects. Credibility attribution towards the author was assessed as the dependent variable. In both studies, the expected interaction effects were not significant. In a third highly powered (registered) study (N = 1356), we used a previously validated worldview-opposing essay. The five classic worldview defense items served as the main dependent measure. The MS effect was not significant. Bayesian analyses favored the null hypothesis. An internal meta-analysis revealed a very small (Hedges' g = 0.09) but nonsignificant (p = .058) effect of MS. Altogether, the presented studies reveal challenges in providing convincing evidence for this established idea.

TI  - MEDIEVAL ALTERNATIVES TO THE NATION-STATE: THE CONCEPT OF THE NATION IN THE VULGATE
T2  - HISTORY OF POLITICAL THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - It is widely assumed today that nations are inherently political communities and, consequently, that nations and states are - or ought to be congruent. As an alternative to the ideal of the nation-state, this article aims to recover the early medieval understanding of the nation. The analysis of keywords - gens, natio and populus - in the Latin Vulgate Bible reveals that the early medieval worldview clearly had a concept of the nation, defined by common descent, shared language and distinct geographic territory, but that this community was not understood in a political sense. Consequently, the existence of various cultural-linguistic communities within the same polity was quite self-evident in the medieval mind and national communities did not require political self-determination.

TI  - Estimating water balance components in irrigated agriculture using a combined approach of soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, and numerical modelling
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on water balance components such as evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge are crucial for water management. Due to differences in physical conditions, but also due to limited budgets, there is not one universal best practice, but a wide range of different methods with specific advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we propose an approach to quantify actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge and water inflow, i.e. precipitation and irrigation, that considers the specific conditions of irrigated agriculture in warm, arid environments. This approach does not require direct measurements of precipitation or irrigation quantities and is therefore suitable for sites with an uncertain data basis. For this purpose, we combine soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, remote sensing data analysis and numerical modelling using Hydrus. Energy balance data and routine weather data serve to estimate ET0. Surface reflectance data from satellite images (Sentinel-2) are used to derive leaf area indices, which help to partition ET0 into energy limited evaporation and transpiration. Subsequently, first approximations of water inflow are derived based on observed soil moisture changes. These inflow estimates are used in a series of forward simulations that produce initial estimates of drainage and ETact, which in turn help improve the estimate of water inflow. Finally, the improved inflow estimates are incorporated into the model and then a parameter optimization is performed using the observed soil moisture as the reference figure. Forward simulations with calibrated soil parameters result in final estimates for ETact and groundwater recharge. The presented method is applied to an agricultural test site with a crop rotation of cotton and wheat in Punjab, Pakistan. The final model results, with an RMSE of 2.2% in volumetric water content, suggest a cumulative ETact and groundwater recharge of 769 and 297 mm over a period of 281 days, respectively. The total estimated water inflow accounts for 946 mm, of which 77% originates from irrigation.

TI  - Simulation of future land surface temperature distribution and evaluating surface urban heat island based on impervious surface area
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to simulate the future form of Land Surface Temperature (LST) distribution and Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI) evaluation based on the impervious surface area. For this purpose, Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellite data acquired in 2006, 2011 and 2016, respectively, were utilized, and Zonguldak, a province of Turkey, was selected as a test site. In the study, LST image for 2021 was projected using spectral indices, namely Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Actually, the correlation analysis between four spectral indices (NDVI, SAVI, MNDWI and NDBI) and LST was conducted. However, NDBI and NDVI were determined as highly correlated indices with LST having correlation coefficient 0.89 and -0.90, respectively, thus MNDWI and SAVI were not considered for the further steps. A Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis was carried out between these two indices (NDBI and NDVI) and LST to extract a mathematical model for LST retrieval. In order to obtain the future form of LST image (2021), these indices were simulated for 2021 using Markov Chain method and then regression model was applied. Before generating LST image for 2021, LST for 2016 image was simulated and compared with the existing 2016 LST image using Kappa index of agreement technique to evaluate the performance. The Kappa value was obtained as 0.73 which is reasonable for future simulation. SUHI evaluation was conducted based on the observed (2016) and simulated (2021) impervious area and normalized LST images. The obtained results showed that the distribution of SUHI effect was highly related to impervious area and if the urbanization rate in the study area continues as it is, this expansion will cause to a dramatic increase in SUHI distribution unless any proper urban planning model is considered by decision makers.

TI  - Deriving Water Quality Parameters Using Sentinel-2 Imagery: A Case Study in the Sado Estuary, Portugal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring water quality parameters and their ecological effects in transitional waters is usually performed through in situ sampling programs. These are expensive and time-consuming, and often do not represent the total area of interest. Remote sensing techniques offer enormous advantages by providing cost-effective systematic observations of a large water system. This study evaluates the potential of water quality monitoring using Sentinel-2 observations for the period 2018-2020 for the Sado estuary (Portugal), through an algorithm intercomparison exercise and time-series analysis of different water quality parameters (i.e., colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), suspended particulate matter (SPM), and turbidity). Results suggest that Sentinel-2 is useful for monitoring these parameters in a highly dynamic system, however, with challenges in retrieving accurate data for some of the variables, such as Chl-a. Spatio-temporal variability results were consistent with historical data, presenting the highest values of CDOM, Chl-a, SPM and turbidity during Spring and Summer. This work is the first study providing annual and seasonal coverage with high spatial resolution (10 m) for the Sado estuary, being a key contribution for the definition of effective monitoring programs. Moreover, the potential of remote sensing methodologies for continuous water quality monitoring in transitional systems under the scope of the European Water Framework Directive is briefly discussed.

TI  - Adaptive Reservation of Network Resources According to Video Classification Scenes
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Video quality evaluation needs a combined approach that includes subjective and objective metrics, testing, and monitoring of the network. This paper deals with the novel approach of mapping quality of service (QoS) to quality of experience (QoE) using QoE metrics to determine user satisfaction limits, and applying QoS tools to provide the minimum QoE expected by users. Our aim was to connect objective estimations of video quality with the subjective estimations. A comprehensive tool for the estimation of the subjective evaluation is proposed. This new idea is based on the evaluation and marking of video sequences using the sentinel flag derived from spatial information (SI) and temporal information (TI) in individual video frames. The authors of this paper created a video database for quality evaluation, and derived SI and TI from each video sequence for classifying the scenes. Video scenes from the database were evaluated by objective and subjective assessment. Based on the results, a new model for prediction of subjective quality is defined and presented in this paper. This quality is predicted using an artificial neural network based on the objective evaluation and the type of video sequences defined by qualitative parameters such as resolution, compression standard, and bitstream. Furthermore, the authors created an optimum mapping function to define the threshold for the variable bitrate setting based on the flag in the video, determining the type of scene in the proposed model. This function allows one to allocate a bitrate dynamically for a particular segment of the scene and maintains the desired quality. Our proposed model can help video service providers with the increasing the comfort of the end users. The variable bitstream ensures consistent video quality and customer satisfaction, while network resources are used effectively. The proposed model can also predict the appropriate bitrate based on the required quality of video sequences, defined using either objective or subjective assessment.

TI  - Artificial Neural Network based thermal anomalies associated with earthquakes in Pakistan from MODIS LST
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - There are several reports about thermal anomalies associated with the impending earthquakes (EQs); among which the underlying mechanism is linked with the main shock with long, intermediate and short-term precursors. In this paper, we analyzed thermal anomalies from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) based Land Surface Temperature (LST) of three different magnitudes and shallow depth EQs in Pakistan. Our focus is to investigate the thermal anomalies by the statistical approach and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) in spatial and temporal LST values within 10 days before and after the main shock as short-term precursors. After implementing statistical and the ANN approach, LST revealed that thermal anomalies occurred within 1-10 days before the main shock of M-w > 6.0 EQs. However, a low intensity LST anomaly is also recorded within 20-25 days before the main shock of M-w 5.2 EQ. We study that LST anomalies are magnitude and depth dependent and it is more likely to occur before EQ of M-w > 6.0 and shallow depth within 10 days before/after the main shock day. The results depict that M-w 5.2 EQ anomaly is not clearly associated to the main shock, as it locates outside the window of 1-10 days before/after the main shock. Similarly, two out of three events caused post-seismic thermal anomalies of less magnitude as compared to the pre-seismic thermal anomalies. The preseismic LST anomalies occur with high intensity before shallow depth and large magnitude EQs than post seismic LST anomalies. The LST anomalies occurred before all the EQs suggesting it to be a reliable precursor of short to intermediate interval associated with an impending EQ.

T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - To explore the ability of different sensors to estimate soil Na+ content, we got the measured soil spectra and Sentinel-2B image spectra of the typical soil samples from the northern area of Ningxia. We filtered the sensitive parameters from the spectra data by means of stepwise regression (SR) and principal component regression analysis (PCA). We established the models to estimate soil Na+ content based on the measured spectra and image data using partial least square regression (PLSR), support vector machine (SVM) and back propagation neural network model (BPNN). The results showed that, except for Band9, there was significant correlation between the resampling data and the image data. The estimation accuracy of models based on SR-screening was generally higher than the PCA (excluding SVM model). The PCA-SVM model was the best image estimation model for soil Na+ content, with a prediction accuracy of 0.792. The SR-BPNN model was the best measured estimation model, with a prediction accuracy of 0.908. The estimating accuracy of the SR-PLSR image-spectra-based model increased from 0.481 to 0.798 after calibrated by the resampled measured spectrum model, which effectively enhanced the accuracy in estimating the soil Na+ content at large scale. We successfully made the spatial transformation of soil Na+ content from point to surface. Our results provided a scientific reference for Sentinel-2B image to monitor Na+ content in salinized soil.

TI  - Forest condition in the Congo Basin for the assessment of ecosystem conservation status
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying ecological condition, notably the extent of forest degradation is important for understanding and designing measures to protect biodiversity and enhancing the capacity of forests to deliver ecosystem services. Conservation planning, particularly the prioritization of management interventions for forests, is often lacking spatial data on forest degradation, and it is often overlooked within decision-making processes. We develop a continuous metric termed Forest Condition (FC) which aims to measure the degree of forest degradation on a scale from 0 to 100, incorporating the temporal history of forest change over any spatial extent. We parameterize this metric based on estimated changes in above ground biomass in the context of forest fragmentation over time to estimate a continuous measure of forest degradation for Congo Basin countries. We estimate that just <70% of Congo Basin forests remain fully intact, a decrease from 78% in the year 2000. FC was validated by direct remote sensing measurements from Landsat imagery for DRC. Results showed that FC was significantly positively correlated with forest canopy cover, gap area per hectare, and magnitude of temporal change in Normalized Burn Ratio. We tested the ability of FC to distinguish primary and secondary degradation and deforestation and found significant differences in gap area and spectral anomalies to validate our theoretical model. We apply the IUCN Red List of Ecosystems criteria to demonstrate the integration of forest condition to assess the risk of ecosystem collapse. Based on this assessment, we found that without including FC in the assessment of biotic disruption, 12 ecosystems representing over 11% of forested area in 2015 would not have been assigned a threat status, and an additional 9 ecosystems would have a lower threat status. Our overall assessment of ecosystems found about half of all Congo Basin ecosystem types, accounting for 20% of all forest area are threatened to some degree, including 4 ecosystems (<1% of total area) which are critically engendered. FC is a transferrable and scalable assessment to support forest monitoring, planning, and management.

AB  - Imaging cameras are cost-effective sensors for spacecraft navigation. Image-driven techniques to extract the target spacecraft from its background are efficient and do not require pretraining. In this paper, we introduce several image-driven foreground extraction methods, including combining the difference of Gaussian-based scene detection and graph manifold ranking-based foreground saliency generation. We successfully apply our foreground extraction method on infrared images from the STS-135 flight mission captured by the space shuttle's Triangulation and LIDAR Automated Rendezvous and Docking System (TriDAR) thermal camera. Our saliency approach demonstrates state of-the-art performance and provides an order of magnitude reduction in processing speed from the traditional methods. Furthermore, we develop a new uncooperative spacecraft pose estimation method by combining our foreground extraction technique with the level-set region-based pose estimation with novel initialization and gradient descent enhancements. Our method is validated using synthetically generated Envisat, Radarsat model, and International Space Station motion sequences. The proposed process is also validated with real rendezvous flight images of the International Space Station.

TI  - Mapping lead concentrations in urban topsoil using proximal and remote sensing data and hybrid statistical approaches
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to rapid urbanization in China, lead (Pb) continues to accumulate in urban topsoil, resulting in soil degradation and increased public exposure. Mapping Pb concentrations in urban topsoil is therefore vital for the evaluation and control of this exposure risk. This study developed spatial models to map Pb concentrations in urban topsoil using proximal and remote sensing data. Proximal sensing reflectance spectra (350-2500 nm) of soils were pre-processed and used to calculate the principal components as landscape factors to represent the soil properties. Other landscape factors, including vegetation and land-use factors, were extracted from time-sequential Landsat images. Two hybrid statistical approaches, regression kriging (RK) and geographically weighted regression (GWR), were adopted to establish prediction models using the landscape factors. The results indicated that the use of landscape factors derived from combined remote and proximal sensing data improved the prediction of Pb concentrations compared with useing these data individually. GWR obtained better results than RK for predicting soil Pb concentration. Thus, joint proximal and remote sensing provides timely, easily accessible, and suitable data for extracting landscape factors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Development of a Spatial Model for Soil Quality Assessment under Arid and Semi-Arid Conditions
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Food security has become a global concern for humanity with rapid population growth, requiring a sustainable assessment of natural resources. Soil is one of the most important sources that can help to bridge the food demand gap to achieve food security if well assessed and managed. The aim of this study was to determine the soil quality index (SQI) for El Fayoum depression in the Western Egyptian Desert using spatial modeling for soil physical, chemical, and biological properties based on the MEDALUS methodology. For this purpose, a spatial model was developed to evaluate the soil quality of the El Fayoum depression in the Western Egyptian Desert. The integration between Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and Sentinel-2 satellite image was used to produce landforms and digital soil mapping for the study area. Results showed that the study area located under six classes of soil quality, e.g., very high-quality class represents an area of 387.12 km(2) (22.7%), high-quality class occupies 441.72 km(2) (25.87%), the moderate-quality class represents 208.57 km(2) (12.21%), slightly moderate-quality class represents 231.10 km(2) (13.5%), as well as, a low-quality class covering an area of 233 km(2) (13.60%), and very low-quality class occupies about 206 km(2) (12%). The Agricultural Land Evaluation System for arid and semi-arid regions (ALESarid) was used to estimate land capability. Land capability classes were non-agriculture class (C6), poor (C4), fair (C3), and good (C2) with an area 231.87 km(2) (13.50%), 291.94 km(2) (17%), 767.39 km(2) (44.94%), and 416.07 km(2) (24.4%), respectively. Land capability along with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) used for validation of the proposed model of soil quality. The spatially-explicit soil quality index (SQI) shows a strong significant positive correlation with the land capability and a positive correlation with NDVI at R-2 0.86 (p < 0.001) and 0.18 (p < 0.05), respectively. In arid regions, the strategy outlined here can easily be re-applied in similar environments, allowing decision-makers and regional governments to use the quantitative results achieved to ensure sustainable development.

TI  - Using Satellite Image Fusion to Evaluate the Impact of Land Use Changes on Ecosystem Services and Their Economic Values
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accelerated land use change is a current challenge for environmental management worldwide. Given the urgent need to incorporate economic and ecological goals in landscape planning, cost-effective conservation strategies are required. In this study, we validated the benefit of fusing imagery from multiple sensors to assess the impact of landscape changes on ecosystem services (ES) and their economic values in the Long County, Shaanxi Province, China. We applied several landscape metrics to assess the local spatial configuration over 15 years (2004-2019) from fused imageries. Using Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Indian Remote Sensing Satellite System Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor 3 (IRS LISS 3) imageries fused for 2004, 2009, 2014 and 2019, we reclassified land use/land cover (LULC) changes, through the rotation forest (RF) machine-learning algorithm. We proposed an equivalent monetary metric for estimating the ES values, which also could be used in the whole China. Results showed that agriculture farmland and unused land decreased their spatial distribution over time, with an observed increase on woodland, grassland, water bodies and built-up area. Our findings suggested that the patterns of landscape uniformity and connectivity improved, while the distribution of landscape types stabilized, while the landscape diversity had a slight improvement. The overall ES values increased (4.34%) under a benefit transfer approach, mainly concerning woodland and grassland. A sensitivity analysis showed the selected economic value (EV) was relevant and suitable for the study area associated with our ES for LULC changes. We suggested that changes in landscape patterns affected the ESV trends, while the increases on some LULC classes slightly improved the landscape diversity. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we recommend that local authorities and environmental practitioners should balance the economic benefits and ecological gains in different landscapes to achieve a sustainable development from local to regional scales.

TI  - Evapotranspiration of banana using the SEBAL algorithm in an irrigated perimeter from the Northeastern Brazil
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA E AMBIENTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study aimed to estimate the evapotranspiration of banana (Musa spp.) in an irrigated perimeter of the municipality of Barbalha, CE, Brazil, using the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model and to compare these results with those estimated using the Penman-Monteith method. Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS satellite images of May 22, 2016, August 10, 2016, and October 29, 2016 and data on temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and solar irradiance, obtained from an automatic weather station, installed close to the experimental area were used. The bands were stacked, and the stacked images were cut, then mathematical operations and evapotranspiration estimation were performed, whose actual daily banana values, estimated by the SEBAL algorithm, were 4.70; 5.00 and 6.50 mm, respectively, for May 22, August 10, and October 29, 2016. Comparing the daily ETr given by SEBAL with that obtained by the Penman-Monteith method, absolute errors of 0.26, 0.44, and 0.64 mm d-1 were observed for May 22, August 10, and October 29, 2016, respectively. These errors are within the ranges accepted in the literature.

TI  - Spatio-temporal remotely sensed indices identify hotspots of biodiversity conservation concern
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the course of a year, vegetation and temperature have strong phenological and seasonal patterns, respectively, and many species have adapted to these patterns. High inter-annual variability in the phenology of vegetation and in the seasonality of temperature pose a threat for biodiversity. However, areas with high spatial variability likely have higher ecological resilience where inter-annual variability is high, because spatial variability indicates presence of a range of resources, microclimatic refugia, and habitat conditions. The integration of inter-annual and spatial variability is thus important for biodiversity conservation. Areas where spatial variability is low and inter-annual variability is high are likely to limit resilience to disturbance. In contrast, areas of high spatial variability may be high priority candidates for protection. Our goal was to develop spatiotemporal remotely sensed indices to identify hotspots of biodiversity conservation concern. We generated indices that capture the inter-annual and spatial variability of vegetation greenness and land surface temperature and integrated them to identify areas of high, medium, and low biodiversity conservation concern. We applied our method in Argentina (2.8 million km(2)), a country with a wide range of climates and biomes. To generate the inter-annual variability indices, we analyzed MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) time series from 2001 to 2018, fitted curves to obtain annual phenological and seasonal metrics, and calculated their inter-annual variability. To generate the spatial variability indices, we calculated standard deviation image texture of Landsat 8 EVI and LST. When we integrated our inter-annual and spatial variability indices, areas in the northeast and parts of southern Argentina were the hotspots of highest conservation concern. High inter-annual variability poses a threat in these areas, because spatial variability is low. These are areas where management efforts could be valuable. In contrast, areas in the northwest and central-west are where protection should be strongly considered because the high spatial variability may confer resilience to disturbance, due to the variety of conditions and resources within close proximity. We developed remotely sensed indices to identify hotspots of high and low conservation concern at scales relevant to biodiversity conservation, = which can be used to target management actions in order to minimize biodiversity loss.

TI  - THE SACRED IMAGE OF "TREE-DEER" IN NORTHERN RUSSIAN FOLK CULTURE
T2  - VESTNIK SLAVIANSKIKH KULTUR-BULLETIN OF SLAVIC CULTURES-SCIENTIFIC AND INFORMATIONAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper considers the hypothesis that the image of a "tree-deer", imprinted in the Northern Russian folk culture, was formed on the basis of figurative and semantic identification of a deer / elk and a tree. The analysis of such analogies, traces of which are preserved in folklore and in Russian folk dialects, is carried out taking into account the peculiarities of pagan worldview. Due to the antiquity of the cult of these animals, which developed in the hunting period, its signs have to be searched not only among the few archaisms of Slavic culture that have come down to our days, but also among traditional cultures of the Northern peoples. The fact that these animals, like the "world tree", were once cosmological symbols explains the origin of the figurative-semantic relationship between a deer / elk and a tree. This is what determines the interchangeability of the image of a deer / elk and the image of a tree observed in folklore. In this context, the Genesis of a number of homonyms and similar words that exist in the Russian dialect lexicon, united by a corresponding theme, also becomes comprehensible. Moreover, the author conducts analysis of a number of images of deer / elk found in Northern Russian decorative and applied art (on embroidery and wood carving) in the context of representations that existed in the Slavic magical protective practice. This allows for understanding why the "tree-deer" image was endowed with sacred properties.

TI  - The Three-Cornered Hat Method for Estimating Error Variances of Three or More Atmospheric Datasets. Part I: Overview and Evaluation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The three-cornered hat (3CH) method, which was originally developed to assess the random errors of atomic clocks, is a means for estimating the error variances of three different datasets. Here we give an overview of the historical development of the 3CH and select other methods for estimating error variances that use either two or three datasets. We discuss similarities and differences between these methods and the 3CH method. This study assesses the sensitivity of the 3CH method to the factors that limit its accuracy, including sample size, outliers, different magnitudes of errors between the datasets, biases, and unknown error correlations. Using simulated datasets for which the errors and their correlations among the datasets are known, this analysis shows the conditions under which the 3CH method provides the most and least accurate estimates. The effect of representativeness errors caused by differences in vertical resolution of datasets is investigated. These representativeness errors are generally small relative to the magnitude of the random errors in the datasets, and the impact of this source of errors can be reduced by appropriate filtering.

TI  - An experimental sky-image-derived cloud validation dataset for Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellites over NASA GSFC
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Availability of a reliable cloud mask for optical satellite imagery is a prerequisite, when generating high-quality high-level geoinformation products. Creation of a reference (ground truth) cloud mask for moderate spatial resolution sensors, such as Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard Landsat 8 and Multispectral Instrument (MSI) aboard Sentinel-2A/B satellites, is a challenging and time-consuming task. Existing reference datasets were mainly produced through photointerpretation of satellite images by an analyst, which can introduce subjectivity in detecting clouds. Therefore, other methods for generating cloud reference data shall be explored and evaluated that can complement existing datasets. In this paper, we document generation and provide the description of a new reference cloud dataset, named GSFC-Cloud, which is based on the extensive use of ground-based images of the sky. The dataset is collected over the same area, covers various cloud conditions, and is available for six Landsat 8 and twenty-eight Sentinel-2 scenes spanning the period of September 2017 to November 2018. The dataset is available in the vector format, so cloud masks at various spatial resolutions can be validated. We also describe a system to automate the process of ground-based data collection using low-cost off-the-shelf parts with the long-term objective to replicate this set-up in multiple locations around the world. We use the proposed dataset to validate and improve the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) for cloud detection in Sentinel-2 imagery. We show that adding a parallax feature to estimate a subpixel shift between red and green bands with a phase correlation method can reduce overdetection of clouds and improve performance of LaSRC.

TI  - Assessing within-Field Corn and Soybean Yield Variability from WorldView-3, Planet, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield monitoring is an important component in agricultural assessment. Multi-spectral remote sensing instruments onboard space-borne platforms such as Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) have shown to be useful for efficiently generating timely and synoptic information on the yield status of crops across regional levels. However, the coarse spatial resolution data inherent to these sensors provides little utility at the management level. Recent satellite imagery collection advances toward finer spatial resolution (down to 1 m) alongside increased observational cadence (near daily) implies information on crops obtainable at field and within-field scales to support farming needs is now possible. To test this premise, we focus on assessing the efficiency of multiple satellite sensors, namely WorldView-3, Planet/Dove-Classic, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 (through Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS)), and investigate their spatial, spectral (surface reflectance (SR) and vegetation indices (VIs)), and temporal characteristics to estimate corn and soybean yields at sub-field scales within study sites in the US state of Iowa. Precision yield data as referenced to combine harvesters' GPS systems were used for validation. We show that imagery spatial resolution of 3 m is critical to explaining 100% of the within-field yield variability for corn and soybean. Our simulation results show that moving to coarser resolution data of 10 m, 20 m, and 30 m reduced the explained variability to 86%, 72%, and 59%, respectively. We show that the most important spectral bands explaining yield variability were green (0.560 mu m), red-edge (0.726 mu m), and near-infrared (NIR - 0.865 mu m). Furthermore, the high temporal frequency of Planet and a combination of Sentinel-2/Landsat 8 (HLS) data allowed for optimal date selection for yield map generation. Overall, we observed mixed performance of satellite-derived models with the coefficient of determination (R-2) varying from 0.21 to 0.88 (averaging 0.56) for the 30 m HLS and from 0.09 to 0.77 (averaging 0.30) for 3 m Planet. R-2 was lower for fields with higher yields, suggesting saturation of the satellite-collected reflectance features in those cases. Therefore, other biophysical variables, such as soil moisture and evapotranspiration, at similar fine spatial resolutions are likely needed alongside the optical imagery to fully explain the yields.

TI  - Spatial Analysis of the Drivers, Characteristics, and Effects of Forest Fragmentation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Building on the existing literature, this study examines whether specific drivers of forest fragmentation cause particular fragmentation characteristics, and how these characteristics can be linked to their effects on forest-dwelling species. This research uses Landsat remote imaging to examine the changing patterns of forests. It focuses on areas which have undergone a high level of a specific fragmentation driver, in particular either agricultural expansion or commodity-driven deforestation. Seven municipalities in the states of Rondonia and Mato Grosso in Brazil are selected as case study areas, as these states experienced a high level of commodity-driven deforestation and agricultural expansion respectively. Land cover maps of each municipality are created using the Geographical Information System software ArcGIS Spatial Analyst extension. The resulting categorical maps are input into Fragstats fragmentation software to calculate quantifiable fragmentation metrics for each municipality. To determine the effects that these characteristics are likely to cause, this study uses a literature review to determine how species traits affect their responses to forest fragmentation. Results indicate that, in areas that underwent agricultural expansion, the remaining forest patches became more complex in shape with longer edges and lost a large amount of core area. This negatively affects species which are either highly dispersive or specialist to core forest habitat. In areas that underwent commodity-driven deforestation, it was more likely that forest patches would become less aggregated and create disjunct core areas. This negatively affects smaller, sedentary animals which do not naturally travel long distances. This study is significant in that it links individual fragmentation drivers to their landscape characteristics, and in turn uses these to predict effects on species with particular traits. This information will prove useful for forest managers, particularly in the case study municipalities examined in this study, in deciding which species require further protection measures. The methodology could be applied to other drivers of forest fragmentation such as forest fires.

TI  - Improved Boreal Forest Wildfire Fuel Type Mapping in Interior Alaska Using AVIRIS-NG Hyperspectral Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Alaska the current wildfire fuel map products were generated from low spatial (30 m) and spectral resolution (11 bands) Landsat 8 satellite imagery which resulted in map products that not only lack the granularity but also have insufficient accuracy to be effective in fire and fuel management at a local scale. In this study we used higher spatial and spectral resolution AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data (acquired as part of the NASA ABoVE project campaign) to generate boreal forest vegetation and fire fuel maps. Based on our field plot data, random forest classified images derived from 304 AVIRIS-NG bands at Viereck IV level (Alaska Vegetation Classification) had an 80% accuracy compared to the 33% accuracy of the LANDFIRE's Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) product derived from Landsat 8. Not only did our product more accurately classify fire fuels but was also able to identify 20 dominant vegetation classes (percent cover >1%) while the EVT product only identified 8 dominant classes within the study area. This study demonstrated that highly detailed and accurate fire fuel maps can be created at local sites where AVIRIS-NG is available and can provide valuable decision-support information to fire managers to combat wildfires.

TI  - Making Meaning without a Maker: Secular Consciousness through Narrative and Cultural Practice
T2  - SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Drawing on fieldwork and in-depth interviews, this study examines the ways affirmatively secular individuals construct moral frameworks, navigate hardship, and create meaningful selves. Based on an inductive, thematic analysis of the data, we show that secular individuals' identities and interpretations of everyday experience and important life events are made meaningful through personal narratives and shared social spaces where cultural values are practiced, imbuing secular worldviews with a sense of legitimacy. Through participants' responses to questions of "ultimate concern" including life's purpose, and the meaning of happiness, hardship, and death, we argue that a sense of otherness, appeals to normative values, and the reframing of existential questions in secular terms plays an essential role in the lives of a segment of the growing, increasingly diverse nonreligious community. Our findings have implications for scholars of secularity, including the role of ambiguity in secular beliefs and the importance of narrative in worldview formation.

TI  - Using a Groundwater Adjusted Water Balance Approach and Copulas to Evaluate Spatial Patterns and Dependence Structures in Remote Sensing Derived Evapotranspiration Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to improve the standard water balance evapotranspiration (WB ET) estimate, which is typically used as benchmark data for catchment-scale ET estimation, by accounting for net intercatchment groundwater flow in the ET calculation. Using the modified WB ET approach, we examine errors and shortcomings associated with the long-term annual mean (2002-2014) spatial patterns of three remote-sensing (RS) MODIS-based ET products from MODIS16, PML_V2, and TSEB algorithms at 1 km spatial resolution over Denmark, as a test case for small-scale, energy-limited regions. Our results indicate that the novel approach of adding groundwater net in water balance ET calculation results in a more trustworthy ET spatial pattern. This is especially relevant for smaller catchments where groundwater net can be a significant component of the catchment water balance. Nevertheless, large discrepancies are observed both amongst RS ET datasets and compared to modified water balance ET spatial pattern at the national scale; however, catchment-scale analysis highlights that difference in RS ET and WB ET decreases with increasing catchment size and that 90%, 87%, and 93% of all catchments have increment ET < +/- 150 mm/year for MODIS16, PML_V2, and TSEB, respectively. In addition, Copula approach captures a nonlinear structure of the joint relationship with multiple densities amongst the RS/WB ET products, showing a complex dependence structure (correlation); however, among the three RS ET datasets, MODIS16 ET shows a closer spatial pattern to the modified WB ET, as identified by a principal component analysis also. This study will help improve the water balance approach by the addition of groundwater net in the ET estimation and contribute to better understand the true correlations amongst RS/WB ET products especially over energy-limited environments.

TI  - Mapping Alteration Mineralogy in Eastern Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, Based on the WorldView-3 and Field Shortwave-Infrared Spectroscopy Analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study produces alteration mineral maps based on WorldView-3 (WV-3) data and field shortwave-infrared (SWIR) spectroscopy. It is supported by conventional analytical methods such as X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and electron probe X-ray micro analyzer as an initial step for mineral exploration in eastern Tsogttsetsii, Mongolia, where access is limited. Distributions of advanced argillic minerals (alunite, dickite, and kaolinite), illite/smectite (illite, smectite, and mixed-layered illite-smectite), and ammonium minerals (buddingtonite and NH4-illite) were mapped using the decorrelation stretch, band math, and mixture-tuned-matched filter (MTMF) techniques. The accuracy assessment of the WV-3 MTMF map using field SWIR data showed good WV-3 SWIR data accuracy for spectrally predominant alteration minerals such as alunite, kaolinite, buddingtonite, and NH4-illite. The combination of WV-3 SWIR mineral mapping and a drone photogrammetric-derived digital elevation model contributed to an understanding of the structural development of the hydrothermal system through visualization of the topographic and spatial distribution of surface alteration minerals. Field SWIR spectroscopy provided further detailed information regarding alteration minerals such as chemical variations of alunite, crystallinity of kaolinite, and aluminum abundance of illite that was unavailable in WV-3 SWIR data. Combining WV-3 SWIR data and field SWIR spectroscopy with conventional exploration methods can narrow the selection between deposit models and facilitate mineral exploration.

TI  - Calibration and parameter corrections for the new generation of the TSI monitor on the FY-3E satellite
T2  - ASTROPHYSICS AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to support the analysis of potential long-term trends in the Sun's variability and trace the WRR ground calibration ratio to the measurement on the satellite. We established the total solar irradiance (TSI) calibration model in orbit for the new generation of solar radiation monitor on the FY-3E satellite. First, we measured the non-equivalence of the instrument, and the air to vacuum ratio of the SIAR radiometer is 0.9958-0.9973. Then, we established the temperature correction model for the important parameters, such as the aperture area, the standard voltage and the heating wire resistance. Finally, we calibrated the SIAR with the world radiation reference (WRR) and traced the ground calibration result to the measurement on the satellite. The end-to-end calibration ratio is 0.9991-1.0006, and the uncertainties for three channels are all better than 0.08%.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 on the Air Quality over China and India Using Long-term (2009-2020) Multi-satellite Data
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We have examined the air quality over China, India and demonstrated marked differences in levels of air pollution resulted from the COVID-19 restrictions during December-April, 2019-20 to that of 11 years mean of 2009-19. The criteria air quality indicators i.e., nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), Aerosol Index (Al) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) data are retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor on the Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. Over China, during COVID-19 lockdown a significant drop in columnar abundances of tropospheric NO2 (-37%), SO2 (-64%) and AOD (-8%) for 2020 in comparison to 11 years mean (2009-19) has been observed. A noticeable difference in NO2 column burden is seen over SE (-35%), NE (-33%), NW (-13%) and SW (-5%) China. Over the SE and NE China, both NO2 and SO2 levels decreased dramatically in 2020 from that of 2009-19, by more than 40% and 65%, respectively, because of both stricter regulations of emissions and less traffic activity due to reduced social and industrial activities during COVID-19 restrictions. In contrast, the curve of monthly mean tropospheric columnar burden of NO2 and SO2 over India has shown moderate reduction of 16% and 20%, respectively because lockdown came into effect much later in March 2020. The mean NO2 and SO2 over IGP region is found to be 25% higher than whole India's mean concentration due to large scale urban settlement and crop burning events. The statistical t-test analysis results confirm significant (p <0.05) improvements in AQ during lockdown. The COVID-19 pandemic provided an unprecedented opportunity to investigate such large-scale reduction in emissions of trace gases and aerosols. Therefore, it is important to further strengthen environmental policies to tackle air quality, human health, and climate change in this part of the world.

TI  - Influence of Wind on Suspended Matter in the Water of the Albufera of Valencia (Spain)
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind significantly influences suspended matter in lakes, especially in shallow lagoons. To know how wind affects the water in Albufera of Valencia, a shallow coastal lagoon, the measured variables of turbidity and transparency have been correlated with the estimates by processing Sentinel-2 satellite images with the Sen2Cor processor. Data from four years of study of winds show that most of them are light to gentle easterly breezes and moderate to fresh westerly breezes. The obtained results show significant correlations between the measured variables and those obtained from the satellite images for total suspended matter and water transparency, as well as with the average daily wind speed. There is no significant correlation between wind and chlorophyll a. Moderate to fresh breezes resuspend the fine sediment reaching concentration values from 100 to 300 mg L-1 according to satellite data. However, it is necessary to obtain field data for the values of moderate and fresh winds, as for now, there are no experimental data to verify the validity of the satellite estimates.

TI  - Validation of Water Quality Monitoring Algorithms for Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 in Mediterranean Inland Waters with In Situ Reflectance Data
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater quality maintenance is essential for human use and ecological functions. To ensure this objective, governments establish programs for a continuous monitoring of the inland waters state. This could be possible with Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-3 (S3), two remote sensing satellites of the European Space Agency, equipped with spectral optical sensors. To determine optimal water quality algorithms applicable to their spectral bands, 36 algorithms were tested for different key variables (chlorophyll a (Chl_a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), colored dissolved organic matter (TSS), phycocyanin (PC) and Secchi disk depth (SDD)). A database of 296 water-leaving reflectance spectra were used, as well as concomitant water quality measurements of Mediterranean reservoirs and lakes of Spain. Two equal data sets were used for calibration and validation. The best algorithms were recalculated using all database and used the following band relations: SDD, R560/R700; CDOM, R665/R490; PC, R705/R665 for S2 and R620, R665, R709 and R779 for S3, using a semi-analytical algorithm; R700 for TSS < 20 mg/L and R783/R492 (S2) or R779/R510 (S3) for TSS > 20 mg/L; and for Chl_a, the maximum (R443; R492)/R560 for Chl_a < 5 mg/m(3) and R700/R665 for Chl_a > 5 mg/m(3). A preliminary test with a satellite image in a well-known reservoir showed results consistent with the expected ranges and spatial patterns of the variables.

T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Three major Maya centers recently discovered in the northern part of the uninhabited Calakmul Biosphere Reserve in eastern Campeche, Mexico, provided the first archaeological information obtained in an extensive, formerly unexplored area in the central lowlands of the Yucat ' an peninsula. Based on ALS (lidar) data, which were acquired for a broader area of 230 km(2) and revealed a thoroughly modified and undisturbed archaeological landscape, and on additional information provided by subsequent field surveys and test excavations, we focus on the techniques of water management and agricultural intensification reflected in specific types of landscape modifications. By analyzing their characteristics, distribution and chronology, we discuss their practical functions, which in the region characterized by the lack of permanent water sources were of foremost importance, and further infer the sociopolitical structures involved in their construction and maintenance. We also interpret the significance of these features in Maya worldview and ritual and their role in landscape construction and conceptualization, and show their potential for addressing other fundamental questions of archaeological relevance, including population estimates, settlement dynamics, and the processes that led to the final demise of Classic Maya culture in the central lowlands.

TI  - Sensory studies, or when physics was <i>psychophysics</i>: Ernst Mach and physics between physiology and psychology, 1860-71
T2  - HISTORY OF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper highlights the significance of sensory studies and psychophysical investigations of the relations between psychic and physical phenomena for our understanding of the development of the physics discipline, by examining aspects of research on sense perception, physiology, esthetics, and psychology in the work of Gustav Theodor Fechner, Hermann von Helmholtz, Wilhelm Wundt, and Ernst Mach between 1860 and 1871. It complements previous approaches oriented around research on vision, Fechner's psychophysics, or the founding of experimental psychology, by charting Mach's engagement with psychophysical experiments in particular. Examining Mach's study of the senses and esthetics, his changing attitudes toward the mechanical worldview and atomism, and his articulation of comparative understandings of sensual, geometrical, and physical spaces helps set Mach's emerging epistemological views in the context of his teaching and research. Mach complemented an analytic strategy focused on parallel psychic and physical dimensions of sensation, with a synthetic comparative approach - building analogies between the retina, the individual, and social life, and moving between abstract and sensual spaces. An examination of the broadly based critique that Mach articulated in his 1871 lecture on the conservation of work shows how his historical approach helped Mach cast what he now saw as a narrowly limiting emphasis on mechanics as a phase yet to be overcome.

TI  - Accumulated Heating and Chilling Are Important Drivers of Forest Phenology and Productivity in the Algonquin-to-Adirondacks Conservation Corridor of Eastern North America
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research Highlights: Forest phenology and productivity were responsive to seasonal heating and chilling accumulation, but responses differed across the temperature range. Background and Objectives: Temperate forests have responded to recent climate change worldwide, but the pattern and magnitude of response have varied, necessitating additional studies at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. We investigated climatic drivers of inter-annual variation in forest phenology and productivity across the Algonquin-to-Adirondacks (A2A) conservation corridor of eastern North America. Methods: We used remotely sensed indices from the AVHRR sensor series and a suite of gridded climate data from the Daymet database spanning from 1989-2014. We used random forest regression to characterize forest-climate relationships between forest growth indices and climatological variables. Results: A large portion of the annual variation in phenology and productivity was explained by climate (R-p(2) > 80%), with variation largely driven by accumulated heating and chilling degree days. Only very minor relationships with precipitation-related variables were evident. Conclusions: Our results indicate that anthropogenic climate change in the A2A has not yet reached the point of triggering widespread changes in forest phenology and productivity, but the sensitivity of forest growth to inter-annual variation in seasonal temperature accumulation suggests that more temperate forest area will be affected by climate change as warming continues.

TI  - Ketamine Use Among People Who Regularly Use Ecstasy and Other Illicit Stimulants in Australia: Trends and Characteristics of Use, 2009-2019
T2  - JOURNAL OF STUDIES ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic used in medical practice, used recreationally since the mid-1960s. This study describes trends in ketamine use in sentinel cross-sectional samples of Australians who regularly use illicit stimulants, along with characteristics of consumers. Method: Data on trends in recent ketamine use (i.e., use in past 6 months) were drawn from annual interviews (approximately 800/year) with cross-sectional samples of people recruited from Australian state capitals from 2009 to 2019 as part of the Ecstasy and Related Drugs Reporting System (EDRS) study. Characteristics of those reporting recent use were examined in the 2019 EDRS data set (n = 728) using logistic regression. Results: Recent ketamine use increased between 2009 and 2019 (10% to 41%, respectively, p <.001), primarily driven by use among participants recruited in Melbourne (21% to 84%, p < .001) and Sydney (19% to 68%, p < .001). However, frequency of use remained low. In 2019, consumer characteristics associated with use included being born outside of Australia and residing in Sydney or Melbourne (compared with Canberra). Conclusions: Among EDRS participants in Australia, we observed an increase in recent ketamine use between 2009 and 2019, although indicators of potential problematic use remained low. The increase in recent ketamine use was largely driven by increases in Melbourne and Sydney. Further research on drivers of use in these cities is required to effectively inform harm-reduction strategies.

AB  - A set of multi-stage image processing algorithms developed to detect the change of image sequence analysis. This means Moving Target Identification (MTI). The difference compared with the traditional method, the new method of spatial diversity. General purpose of object detection, image processing and image understanding of the specific field of research. Hue Saturation and Value (HSV,) colour space algorithm uses spot and shape detection to ensure detection under various conditions of lighting, shade, and distance. The algorithm is tested on the lighting and form detection account where the different variation of the displays. The only computational process of the challenge group is the presence of more than one target of the same colour in finding the correct target under changing lighting conditions. It has been found that the elasticity target people based on localization of these image processing methods for better detection is compared with the target detection. Digital image data contains most of this image data recognition model is optimized by integrating task planning normalization and inertial representation of the remote sensing image classification model based on spatial communication. The immediate message issue is that the Gaussian compound model cannot detect the entire moving object, and is prone to sudden light changes, etc. The advanced algorithm to be performed is proposed based on the Gaussian compound model and the detection method of the three legal difference moving object. Subsequently, a new adaptive selection technique for Gaussian distributions is introduced to reduce processing time and improve detection accuracy.

TI  - Mapping Above-Ground Carbon Stock of Secondary Peat Swamp Forest Using Forest Canopy Density Model Landsat 8 OLI-TIRS: A Case Study in Central Kalimantan Indonesia
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the above-ground carbon potential by using a non-destructive method has been a serious challenge for researchers in the effort to improve the performance of natural forest management in Indonesia, particularly in the exMega Rice Project (MRP) area in Central Kalimantan Province. Nevertheless, the rapid and dynamic changes in secondary peat swamp forests are currently mapped effectively with the remote sensing technology using the Forest Canopy Density (FCD) model. FCD analysis as done by integrating vegetation index, soil index, temperature index and shadow index of Landsat 8 OLI images. The result was an FCD class map. In each class, parameter measurements were established for seedling, sapling, poles and tree stages. Above-ground carbon stock was calculated using three allometric equations. The results revealed that the values of carbon stock in +/- 16,147.26 ha dense secondary peat swamp forest, +/- 1,509.66 ha moderately dense scrub swamp forest, and +/- 632.07 ha sparse scrub swamp forest were, respectively, 79.28-122.96; 74.06-113.06; and 40.48-63.60 ton/ha. These results show that FCD application could be used to classify forest density effectively and in line with the variety of their attributes such us aboveground biomass and carbon stock potential.

TI  - Denoising Sentinel-1 Extra-Wide Mode Cross-Polarization Images Over Sea Ice
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-1 (S1) extra-wide (EW) swath data in cross-polarization (horizontal-vertical, HV or verticalhorizontal, VH) are strongly affected by the scalloping effect and thermal noise, particularly over areas with weak backscattered signals, such as sea surfaces. Although noise vectors in both the azimuth and range directions are provided in the standard S1 EW data for subtraction, the residual thermal noise still significantly affects sea ice detection by the EW data. In this article, we improve the denoising method developed in previous studies to remove the additive noise for the S1 EW data in cross-polarization. Furthermore, we propose a new method for eliminating the residual noise (i.e., multiplicative noise) at the subswath boundaries of the EW data, which cannot be well processed by simply subtracting the reconstructed 2-D noise field. The proposed method of removing both the additive and multiplicative noise was applied to EW HV-polarized images processed using different Instrument Processing Facility (IPF) versions. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm significantly improves the quality of EW HV-polarized images under various sea ice conditions and sea states in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) of the Arctic. This is of great support for the utilization of cross-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in wide swaths for intensive sea ice monitoring in polar regions.

TI  - The Role of Rulers in the Winding Up of the Old Norse Religion
T2  - NUMEN-INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE HISTORY OF RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a common opinion in research that the Scandinavians changed religion during the second half of the Viking Age, that is, ca. 950-1050/1100 CE. During this period, Christianity replaced the Old Norse religion. When describing this transition in recent studies, the concept "Christianization" is often applied. To a large extent this historiography focuses on the outcome of the encounter, namely the description of early Medieval Christianity and the new Christian society. The purpose and aims of the present study are to concentrate more exclusively on the Old Norse religion during this period of change and to analyze the questions of how and why it disappeared. A special focus is placed on the native kings. These kings played a most active role in winding up the indigenous tradition that previously formed their lives. It seems as if they used some deliberate methods during this process. When designing their strategies they focused on the religious leadership as well as the ritual system. These seem to have been the aspects of the indigenous religion of which they had direct control, and at the same time, were central for the modus operandi of the old religion. Most of all, it seems as if these Christian kings were pragmatists. Since they could not affect the traditional worldview and prevent people from telling the mythical narratives about the old gods, they turned to such aims that they were able to achieve.Y

TI  - Identification of a localization wire tip in an occult breast lesion using a handheld magnetometer
T2  - ADVANCES IN CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Sentimag hand-held probe detects the magnetic response from iron oxide particles trapped in a sentinel node.Objectives: To investigate if an electromagnetic probe can be helpful in the identification of a hook wire tip located in an occult breast lesion.Material and methods: Forty-two patients undergoing lumpectomy without axillary procedure were enrolled. In all cases, suspicious non-palpable microcalcifications without mass were found, and a vacuum-assisted stereotactic biopsy was performed. On the day of surgery, a traditional localization wire (LW) was placed under imaging guidance. The Sentimag magnetometer was used to precisely detect the wire tip through the skin. Then, the skin incision was made and Sentimag was used again to guide the surgeon to the lumpectomy bed. The accuracy of excision was assessed with intra-operative specimen 3D tomosynthesis.Results: Median lesion size was 16 mm (range: 4-38 mm) and median depth was 33 mm (range: 14-78 mm). In all cases, the wire tip was successfully identified. Neither wire displacement nor transection occurred. Intraoperative radiography demonstrated doubtful margin requiring selective cavity shaving in 6 patients (14%). The need for cavity shaving was significantly influenced by the lesion size and histology: median size 30 mm (range: 24-38 mm) compared to 15 mm (range: 4-28 mm) and histology of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) compared to atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH) and lobular neoplasia (LN). Tumors requiring cavity shaving tended to be deeper - they had a median depth of 43 mm (range: 17-78 mm) compared to 32 mm (range: 14-76 mm) in patients who did not need cavity shaving, but this parameter was statistically significant.Conclusions: Intraoperative identification of the wire tip using Sentimag is a simple technique facilitating targeted excision without excessive removal of breast tissue. Since it is not associated with additional costs, it may be worth considering, particularly in developing countries.

TI  - Bio-Inspired Hybridization of Artificial Neural Networks: An Application for Mapping the Spatial Distribution of Soil Texture Fractions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil texture and particle size fractions (PSFs) are a critical characteristic of soil that influences most physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil; furthermore, reliable spatial predictions of PSFs are crucial for agro-ecological modeling. Here, series of hybridized artificial neural network (ANN) models with bio-inspired metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as a genetic algorithm (GA-ANN), particle swarm optimization (PSO-ANN), bat (BAT-ANN), and monarch butterfly optimization (MBO-ANN) algorithms, were built for predicting PSFs for the Mazandaran Province of northern Iran. In total, 1595 composite surficial soil samples were collected, and 64 environmental covariates derived from terrain, climatic, remotely sensed, and categorical datasets were used as predictors. Models were tested using a repeated 10-fold nested cross-validation approach. The results indicate that the hybridized ANN methods were far superior to the reference approach using ANN with a backpropagation training algorithm (BP-ANN). Furthermore, the MBO-ANN approach was consistently determined to be the best approach and yielded the lowest error and uncertainty. The MBO-ANN model improved the predictions in terms of RMSE by 20% for clay, 10% for silt, and 24% for sand when compared to BP-ANN. The physiographical units, soil types, geology maps, rainfall, and temperature were the most important predictors of PSFs, followed by the terrain and remotely sensed data. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of bio-inspired algorithms for improving ANN models. The outputs of this study will support and inform sustainable soil management practices, agro-ecological modeling, and hydrological modeling for the Mazandaran Province of Iran.

M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important parameter for the biosphere, cryosphere, and climate change studies. In this study, we estimate LST, NDMI, and NDWI over the Ravi basin, India, and parts of Pakistan, using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data. The study develops an ERDAS IMAGINE image processing method by using the LANDSAT 8 band 3(Green), band 4(Red), band 5(NIR), band 6(SWIR 1), and band 10 (TIR) data for determining the various spectral indices. The LST results show that most of the areas experienced extreme anomalies ranging from-350Cand 36 degrees C. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) value ranges from 0.685 to - 0.154. The normalized difference water index (NDWI) value ranges from 0.146 to - 0.444. Further, the LST result validated with in situ temperature observations at six locations in the study area, providing excellent correlation.

TI  - N-YOLO: A SAR Ship Detection Using Noise-Classifying and Complete-Target Extraction
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution images provided by synthetic aperture radar (SAR) play an increasingly important role in the field of ship detection. Numerous algorithms have been so far proposed and relative competitive results have been achieved in detecting different targets. However, ship detection using SAR images is still challenging because these images are still affected by different degrees of noise while inshore ships are affected by shore image contrasts. To solve these problems, this paper introduces a ship detection method called N-YOLO, which based on You Only Look Once (YOLO). The N-YOLO includes a noise level classifier (NLC), a SAR target potential area extraction module (STPAE) and a YOLOv5-based detection module. First, NLC derives and classifies the noise level of SAR images. Secondly, the STPAE module is composed by a CA-CFAR and expansion operation, which is used to extract the complete region of potential targets. Thirdly, the YOLOv5-based detection module combines the potential target area with the original image to get a new image. To evaluate the effectiveness of the N-YOLO, experiments are conducted using a reference GaoFen-3 dataset. The detection results show that competitive performance has been achieved by N-YOLO in comparison with several CNN-based algorithms.

TI  - Diagnostic Accuracy of Axillary Ultrasound for Prediction of Axillary Pathologic Response after Neoadjuvant Treatment in Breast Cancer.
T2  - Chirurgia (Bucharest, Romania : 1990)
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Background: In the era of NAT, to accurately predict pathologic response is a great challenge, which might influence surgical approach for breast and axilla. Axillary staging via imaging methods as an adjunct have long been used with various reported accuracy rates. However, the role of preoperative axillary ultrasonography (AUS) in clinical N0 patients after NAT is still controversial. The primary goal of the present study was to evaluate the precision of preoperative AUS for identifying pathologic complete response (ypCR = ypT0, ypN0) after NAT. Methods: A single-institution, retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database was analyzed to identify breast cancer patients treated with NAT. Only those patients who underwent AUS and 18F-FDG-PET/CT before and after NAT with documentation of clinical and radiological response were incorporated for outcome analysis. Results: In 253 consecutive invasive breast cancer patients axillary ypN0 disease was achieved in 67.19%. In 11.23% ynon-pCR patients AUS failed to detect residual disease presence 80% of which were ITCs and micrometastases. Macrometastasis was present in 21.73% (55/253) of the cases 98.18% (54/55) of which was determined by AUS. Overall accuracy for axillary pCR was found to be 89.32% for AUS and 76.28 % for 18-FDG-PET/CT. The false negative rate (FNR) of AUS and 18-FDG-PET/CT was 12.04% and 15.59%, respectively. The PPV of AUS was higher in Luminal-like tumors (%87.69), whereas HER-2 positive (%100) and triple-negative (93.47%) subtypes had higher NPV. Conclusions: AUS is a beneficial tool with the potential of accurate prediction of pCR in more than 80% of patients following NAT. Nevertheless, in cases of residual ITCs and micrometastasis the accuracy of US should be interrogated cautiously.

TI  - Ultrasound Evaluation of the Axilla in the Breast Imaging Setting
T2  - ULTRASOUND QUARTERLY
M3  - Review
AB  - Ultrasound evaluation of the axilla plays a critical role in the setting of newly diagnosed breast cancer as surgical management evolves toward more targeted axillary nodal resection. Regional nodal involvement by metastatic carcinoma is one of most important prognostic factors in breast cancer and guides local, regional, and systemic treatment. Ultrasound also evaluates response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This article will review ultrasound techniques and the anatomy and the morphology of axillary lymph nodes. Lymph node staging in breast cancer will also be discussed. Ultrasound-guided interventions and localizations and emerging technologies of elastography and contrast-enhanced ultrasound will be discussed. In addition, this article will discuss the role of ultrasound as it applies to management of the axilla since the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z011 and Z1071 trials. Finally, other causes of benign and malignant axillary lymphadenopathy, not related to breast cancer, are discussed.

TI  - Multi-year vector dynamic time warping-based crop mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent automated crop mapping via supervised learning-based methods have demonstrated unprecedented improvement over classical techniques. Classification accuracies of these methods degrade considerably in cross-year mapping. Cross-year crop mapping is more useful as it allows the prediction of the following years' crop maps using previously labeled data. We propose vector dynamic time warping (VDTW), an innovative multi-year classification approach based on warping of angular distances between phenological vectors. The results prove that the proposed VDTW method is robust to temporal and spectral variations compensating for different farming practices, climate and atmospheric effects, and measurement errors between years. We also describe a method for determining the most discriminative time window that allows high classification accuracies with limited data. We carried out tests with Landsat 8 time-series imagery from years 2013 to 2015 for the classification of corn and cotton in the Harran Plain of southeastern Turkey. In addition, we tested VDTW corn and soybean in Kansas, the US for 2017 and 2018 with the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel data. The VDTW method improved cross-year overall accuracies by 3% with fewer training samples compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.

TI  - Assessing habitat suitability for wintering geese by using Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) in a large floodplain wetland, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrological condition is one of the most important factors affecting the abundance and distribution of water-birds in large freshwater floodplains, as it influences their habitat and food availability. The hydrological condition is commonly indicated with site-based hydrological data such as water level. Site-based data have high temporal resolution but are less effective to represent the spatial characteristics, a requirement for ecological/habitat models. In this study, we propose a method to identify suitable habitats for wintering geese based on the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from Sentinel-2 satellite images. The relationships between NDWI, water level and geese occurrence were analyzed. The results showed that the NDWI of Poyang Lake can explain 75% of the changes in water level and at least 42% of the geese occurrence during wintering periods (with the exception of February 2019). The monthly NDWI optimal ranges suitable for wintering geese were identified to be from -0.12 to 0 and suitable NDWI threshold range is from -0.27 to 0.14. Based on this threshold range, we identified the suitable habitat for geese and found that the suitable habitat area first increased and later decreased during the whole wintering periods, following an inverted U-shaped dynamic. We concluded that NDWI can be used to improve distribution models of waterbird species to support their protection and wetland management.

TI  - The influence of preoperative biopsy on the surgical method in breast cancer patients: a single-center experience of 3,966 cases in China
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B32 trial reported that the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes by core needle biopsy (CNB) is higher than that by segmental resection. However, there are few reports regarding the detection rate of sentinel lymph nodes by vacuum-assisted breast biopsy (VABB). Therefore, we analyzed the impact of preoperative biopsy methods on the surgical modes of 3,966 patients with breast cancer in our center.Methods: In total, 3,966 female breast cancer patients [clinical tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage I-III] were enrolled in this study. Preoperative pathological diagnosis methods included fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, CNB, excision biopsy, and VABB. According to the time of diagnosis. The data were analysis by chi square test, variance analysis and the Kaplan-Meier time series in SPSS 22.0.Results: There was a decrease in the number of patients that underwent excision biopsy (7.3% to 2.7%) and intraoperative freezing (89.4% to 28.9%) over time, while CNB exhibited an increasing trend (1.6% to 55.3%). The positive rates of VABB, CNB, excision biopsy, and FNA were 99.5%, 97.1%, 97.9%, and 82.2%, respectively, and the false negative rates were 0%, 1.8%, 0.34%, and 8.9%, respectively. The overall breast-conserving rate was 36.7%, while the breast-conserving rate for VABB was 57.1%. The axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy rate of cN0 patients was 48.3%, and the intraoperative frozen group (36.7%) and excision biopsy group (39.5%) were lower than the CNB (57.1%) and VABB (77.9%) groups. Until December 2019, there were 350 cases with tumor recurrence or metastasis. The methods of biopsy were not correlated to the cumulative survival time.Conclusions: Changes to the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer has a profound impact on the method of tumor biopsy. VABB biopsy offers advantages such as accurate diagnosis, a greater volume of tissue taken at one time, minimally invasive and repeatable, and does not affect the surgical approach and prognosis of patients. It will gradually become the primary method of preoperative pathological evaluation of breast cancer.

T2  - OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction. In the context of modernisation in modern education, a deeper (by contrast to interdisciplinary) transdisciplinary level of cognition is becoming prevalent. Transdisciplinary level generates a universal methodology capable of addressing the complex multi-factorial interdisciplinary problems of nature and society. The result is transdisciplinary branches of science such as cybernetics, disaster theory, synergetics, artificial intelligence, big data, etc. All these concepts have been developed on the basis of the achievements of mathematics over the past 70-80 years, the era of mathematical sciences. As a consequence, mathematics has become the basis of the language of information technologies and processes, and, thereby, this science has given rise to a global digital transformation of society based on the use of the unique computer capabilities.The aim of the present research was to explore the role of mathematics in the transdisciplinary trend in updating the content of education with a view to bringing education to a higher (by contrast to interdisciplinary) level, based on the inclusion of modern mathematical theories and methods in the content of education and their applications depending on the direction and profile of the student training.Methodology and research methods. In the course of research, the systemic, cultural, and meta-subject approaches were employed to analyse the role of mathematics in education and to solve the transdisciplinary problems of education content modernisation (based on the most striking manifestations of modern mathematical culture). As a result of the synthesis of these approaches, a holistic scientific worldview emerges, which not only goes beyond the traditional disciplines and methods, but also appears above them.Results and scientific novelty. The analysis of transdisciplinary trend in postindustrial education was carried out. Mathematical and pedagogical aspects of the implementation of systemic, cultural and meta-subject approaches were investigated in order to achieve a higher level of educational process. At the same time, the authors justified the use of mathematical modelling, discrete mathematics, computational processes and artificial intelligence in the training, i.e. formation of a new superdisciplinary way of thinking in students, acquisition of a general cultural cognitive strategy to perform professional and transprofessional tasks.Practical importance. The findings of the current publication contribute to the realisation of the transdisciplinary trend in the content of student training, and will be of interest to both educational theorists and teachers, who train students in many fields. Moreover, this work will be useful for all those interested in the future advancement of the system of education.

TI  - Vulnerability Assessment of the Ratnagiri Coast (Maharashtra, West Coast of India)
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ratnagiri coast, situated in Maharashtra state, West Coast of India, is potentially vulnerable to the erosional hazards, frequent rehabilitation of land, and accelerated sea-level rise. In recent years, the evidence shows erosional threats and gradual submergence along the creeks and lowlands of Ratnagiri. To deliberate the vulnerability of these hazards, vulnerability ranking was assigned using a coastal vulnerability index (CVI) using six geophysical parameters. The datasets were obtained from the satellite data of Landsat series from the years 1973, 2015, and 2019 to derive geomorphology of the coast and coastal landforms. Shoreline change along Kelshi, Kachave-Undi-Waravde region, and Mirya bay and beach have been evaluated using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System by demarcating the baseline and shorelines from the series of Landsat data. Data obtained is re-improvised with Google data for updating the recent change in the study area. Elevation data is extracted from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer data of 30 m spatial resolution, the susceptibility of coastal inundation was derived using General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans data, and this has indicated northerly submergence of the coast, prone to become vulnerable. The tidal variations along two major gauging stations were extracted from Windows Unix program for Tides 32 software for Rajapur and Mormugao stations. The CVI results in the categorization of areas with a high-risk vulnerability along the beaches, creeks, and estuaries of Kelshi, Jaigad, Rajapur, and Kajali, while low-risk areas like cliffs and shoals are geologically confronted. The findings from the CVI suggest the need for identifying and mapping such vulnerable areas and is an initial step to emphasize coastal regions for climate change adaptations.

TI  - The Intestinal Carriage of Plasmid-Mediated Colistin-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae in Tertiary Care Settings
T2  - ANTIBIOTICS-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In order to estimate the prevalence of plasmid borne colistin resistance and to characterize in detail the mcr-positive isolates, we carried out a sentinel testing survey on the intestinal carriage of plasmid-mediated colistin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in hospitalized patients. Methods: Between June 2018 and September 2019, 1922 faecal samples from hospitalised patients were analysed by selective culture in presence of colistin (3.5 mg/L), and in parallel by direct detection of the mcr-1 to mcr-8 genes by qPCR. The mcr-positive isolates were characterised by whole-genome sequencing. Results: The prevalence of the mcr-1 gene was 0.21% (n = 4/1922); the mcr-2 to 8 genes were not detected. The mcr-1 gene was found to be localised in the IncX4 (n = 3) and IncHI2 (n = 1) plasmid type. One Escherichia coli isolate was susceptible to colistin due to the inactivation of the mcr-1 gene through the insertion of the IS2 element; however, the colistin resistance was inducible by culture in low concentrations of colistin. One human mcr-1 positive E. coli isolate was related genetically to the mcr-1 E. coli isolate derived from turkey meat of Czech origin. Conclusions: mcr-mediated colistin resistance currently poses little threat to patients hospitalised in Czech healthcare settings. The presence of the mcr-1 gene in the human population has a possible link to domestically produced, retail meat.

TI  - Early Detection of COVID-19 in Portugal: Use of Clinical Records
T2  - ACTA MEDICA PORTUGUESA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Syndromic surveillance allows early detection of changes in the population's morbidity pattern. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of indicators related to access to healthcare services, in COVID-19 surveillance.Material and Methods: A time series analysis was performed using the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 in Mainland Portugal, between weeks 14/2020 (March 30 to April 5) and 25/2020 (June 15 to 21), and six indicators: 1) COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare; 2) number of COVID-19 emergency department visits; 3) number of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; 4) number of hospitalizations due to viral pneumonia; 5) proportion of emergency department visits due to viral pneumonia; and 6) proportion of hospitalizations for viral pneumonia. Pearson correlation and cross-correlations were computed.Results: A strong correlation was found between the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19 and all indicators. [(1) 0.76; (2) 0.82; (3) 0.77; (4) 0.84; (5) 0.86; e (6) 0.90]. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia detect variations in the frequency of the disease with a one week lag compared to the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. COVID-19 consultations in primary healthcare and emergency department visits trail behind the incidence rate of COVID-19, in one week. The proportion of viral pneumonias in emergency department visits, or hospitalizations, is temporally aligned with the weekly incidence rate of COVID-19.Discussion: The delay found in the COVID-19 primary healthcare consultations and emergency department visits, may be related to changes in access to healthcare services and clinical coding. Emergency department visits and hospitalizations for viral pneumonia may be useful in the early detection of COVID-19. Viral pneumonia may have been coded as being of unknown origin. Future monitoring of these indicators is necessary to ascertain whether the incidence of COVID-19 is significantly influenced by changes in testing strategies. The indicators described in this study will be an asset for the optimization of testing strategies, allocation of healthcare resources to the communities that are most vulnerable to severe morbidity and assessing vaccination impact. As such, surveillance systems based on clinical data will be a valuable complementary tool to SINAVE.Conclusion: The indicators under analysis could be used regularly, with special attention to viral pneumonias, to detect outbreaks of COVID-19. Information on pneumonia of unknown etiology may be considered in the surveillance of COVID-19.

TI  - Model-based system matrix for iterative reconstruction in sub-diffuse angular-domain fluorescence optical projection tomography
T2  - BIOMEDICAL OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work concerns a fluorescence optical projection tomography system for low scattering tissue, like lymph nodes, with angular-domain rejection of highly scattered photons. In this regime, filtered backprojection (FBP) image reconstruction has been shown to provide reasonable quality images, yet here a comparison of image quality between images obtained by FBP and iterative image reconstruction with a Monte Carlo generated system matrix, demonstrate measurable improvements with the iterative method. Through simulated and experimental phantoms, iterative algorithms consistently outperformed FBP in terms of contrast and spatial resolution. Moreover, when projection number was reduced, in order to reduce total imaging time, iterative reconstruction suppressed artifacts that hampered the performance of FBP reconstruction (structural similarity of the reconstructed images with "truth" was improved from 0.15 +/- 1.2 x 10(-3) to 0.66 +/- 0.02); and although the system matrix was generated for homogenous optical properties, when heterogeneity (62.98 cm(-1) variance in mu s) was introduced to simulated phantoms, the results were still comparable (structural similarity homo: 0.67 +/- 0.02 vs hetero: 0.66 +/- 0.02).

TI  - Postvolcanic Aerosols: Measurements of Altitude and Particle Sizes with Twilight-Sky Polarimetry
T2  - COSMIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensity and polarization of the twilight-sky background were measured during the epoch of "purple lights" after the Raikoke volcanic eruption in the summer of 2019. The increase in brightness paired with the decrease in polarization was registered, and the changes were especially noticeable in the dusk segment. The altitude distribution of aerosol particles and their mean size were found with previously developed techniques. The median radius of the lognormal distribution (0.11 mu m) is typical of the background conditions or weak eruptions; however, the aerosols were mostly concentrated in the upper troposphere and near the tropopause rather than in the stratosphere. From comparison with satellite data obtained almost a decade ago after similar eruptions (like those of the Kasatochi volcano and others), it has been shown that the properties of their aerosols are similar, which confirms that the purple light phenomenon observed in 2019 was of volcanic origin.

TI  - Improvement of Spatial Interpolation of Precipitation Distribution Using Cokriging Incorporating Rain-Gauge and Satellite (SMOS) Soil Moisture Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation data provide a crucial input for examining hydrological issues, including watershed management and mitigation of the effects of floods, drought, and landslides. However, they are collected frequently from the scarce and often insufficient network of ground-based rain-gauge stations to generate continuous precipitation maps. Recently, precipitation maps derived from satellite data have not been sufficiently linked to ground-based rain gauges and satellite-derived soil moisture to improve the assessment of precipitation distribution using spatial statistics. Kriging methods are used to enhance the estimation of the spatial distribution of precipitations. The aim of this study was to assess two geostatistical methods, ordinary kriging (OK) and ordinary cokriging (OCK), and one deterministic method (i.e., inverse distance weighting (IDW)) for improved spatial interpolation of quarterly and monthly precipitations in Poland and near-border areas of the neighbouring countries (similar to 325,000 or 800,000 km(2)). Quarterly precipitation data collected during a 5-year period (2010-2014) from 113-116 rain-gauge stations located in the study area were used. Additionally, monthly precipitations in the years 2014-2017 from over 400 rain-gauge stations located in Poland were used. The spatiotemporal data on soil moisture (SM) from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) global satellite (launched in 2009) were used as an auxiliary variable in addition to precipitation for the OCK method. The predictive performance of the spatial distribution of precipitations was the best for OCK for all quarters, as indicated by the coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.944-0.992), and was less efficient (R-2 = 0.039-0.634) for the OK and IDW methods. As for monthly precipitation, the performance of OCK was considerably higher than that of IDW and OK, similarly as with quarterly precipitation. The performance of all interpolation methods was better for monthly than for quarterly precipitations. The study indicates that SMOS data can be a valuable source of auxiliary data in the cokriging and/or other multivariate methods for better estimation of the spatial distribution of precipitations in various regions of the world.

TI  - The Effect of Forest Mask Quality in the Wall-to-Wall Estimation of Growing Stock Volume
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about forest cover and its characteristics are essential in national and international forest inventories, monitoring programs, and reporting activities. Two of the most common forest variables needed to support sustainable forest management practices are forest cover area and growing stock volume (GSV m(3) ha(-1)). Nowadays, national forest inventories (NFI) are complemented by wall-to-wall maps of forest variables which rely on models and auxiliary data. The spatially explicit prediction of GSV is useful for small-scale estimation by aggregating individual pixel predictions in a model-assisted framework. Spatial knowledge of the area of forest land is an essential prerequisite. This information is contained in a forest mask (FM). The number of FMs is increasing exponentially thanks to the wide availability of free auxiliary data, creating doubts about which is best-suited for specific purposes such as forest area and GSV estimation. We compared five FMs available for the entire area of Italy to examine their effects on the estimation of GSV and to clarify which product is best-suited for this purpose. The FMs considered were a mosaic of local forest maps produced by the Italian regional forest authorities; the FM produced from the Copernicus Land Monitoring System; the JAXA global FM; the hybrid global FM produced by Schepaschencko et al., and the FM estimated from the Corine Land Cover 2006. We used the five FMs to mask out non-forest pixels from a national wall-to-wall GSV map constructed using inventory and remotely sensed data. The accuracies of the FMs were first evaluated against an independent dataset of 1,202,818 NFI plots using four accuracy metrics. For each of the five masked GSV maps, the pixel-level predictions for the masked GSV map were used to calculate national and regional-level model-assisted estimates. The masked GSV maps were compared with respect to the coefficient of correlation (rho) between the estimates of GSV they produced (both in terms of mean and total of GSV predictions within the national and regional boundaries) and the official NFI estimates. At the national and regional levels, the model-assisted GSV estimates based on the GSV map masked by the FM constructed as a mosaic of local forest maps were closest to the official NFI estimates with rho = 0.986 and rho = 0.972, for total and mean GSV, respectively. We found a negative correlation between the accuracies of the FMs and the differences between the model-assisted GSV estimates and the NFI estimate, demonstrating that the choice of the FM plays an important role in GSV estimation when using the model-assisted estimator.

TI  - Validation of Visually Interpreted Corine Land Cover Classes with Spectral Values of Satellite Images and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyzed the Corine Land Cover 2018 (CLC2018) dataset to reveal the correspondence between land cover categories of the CLC and the spectral information of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope images. Level 1 categories of the CLC2018 were analyzed in a 25 km x 25 km study area in Hungary. Spectral data were summarized by land cover polygons, and the dataset was evaluated with statistical tests. We then performed Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Random Forest classifications to reveal if CLC L1 level categories were confirmed by spectral values. Wetlands and water bodies were the most likely to be confused with other categories. The least mixture was observed when we applied the median to quantify the pixel variance of CLC polygons. RF outperformed the LDA's accuracy, and PlanetScope's data were the most accurate. Analysis of class level accuracies showed that agricultural areas and wetlands had the most issues with misclassification. We proved the representativeness of the results with a repeated randomized test, and only PlanetScope seemed to be ungeneralizable. Results showed that CLC polygons, as basic units of land cover, can ensure 71.1-78.5% OAs for the three satellite sensors; higher geometric resolution resulted in better accuracy. These results justified CLC polygons, in spite of visual interpretation, can hold relevant information about land cover considering the surface reflectance values of satellites. However, using CLC as ground truth data for land cover classifications can be questionable, at least in the L1 nomenclature.

TI  - OpenStreetMap: Challenges and Opportunities in Machine Learning and Remote Sensing
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a community-based, freely available, editable map service created as an alternative to authoritative sources. Given that it is edited mainly by volunteers with different mapping skills, the completeness and quality of its annotations are heterogeneous across different geographical locations. Despite that, OSM has been widely used in several applications in geosciences, Earth observation, and environmental sciences. In this article, we review recent methods based on machine learning to improve and use OSM data. Such methods aim to either 1) improve the coverage and quality of OSM layers, typically by using geographic information systems (GISs) and remote sensing technologies, or 2) use the existing OSM layers to train models based on image data to serve applications such as navigation and land use classification. We believe that OSM (as well as other sources of open land maps) can change the way we interpret remote sensing data and that the synergy with machine learning can scale participatory mapmaking and its quality to the level needed for global and up-to-date land mapping. A preliminary version of this manuscript was presented in [120].

TI  - Analysis of Near-Cloud Changes in Atmospheric Aerosols Using Satellite Observations and Global Model Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines cloud-related variations of atmospheric aerosols that occur in partly cloudy regions containing low-altitude clouds. The goal is to better understand aerosol behaviors and to help better represent the radiative effects of aerosols on climate. For this, the paper presents a statistical analysis of a multi-month global dataset that combines data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) satellite instruments with data from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) global reanalysis. Among other findings, the results reveal that near-cloud enhancements in lidar backscatter (closely related to aerosol optical depth) are larger (1) over land than ocean by 35%, (2) near optically thicker clouds by substantial amounts, (3) for sea salt than for other aerosol types, with the difference from dust reaching 50%. Finally, the study found that mean lidar backscatter is higher near clouds not because of large-scale variations in meteorological conditions, but because of local processes associated with individual clouds. The results help improve our understanding of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions and our ability to represent them in climate models and other atmospheric models.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Northern Patagonia is one of the largest estuarine systems worldwide. It is characterized by complex geography, including islands, peninsulas, channels, and fjords. Here, the Inner Sea of Chiloe (ISC) is the largest estuarine system extending about 230 km in the meridional direction. Phytoplankton's long-term dynamics and the main physical drivers of their variability are not well understood yet. Time-space fluctuations of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Chlorophyll fluorescence (nFLH) within the ISC and their association with meteorological and oceanographic processes were analyzed using high resolution (1000 m) satellite data (2003-2019). Our results revealed a meridional Chl-a and nFLH gradient along the ISC, with higher concentrations north of the Desertores islands where the topography promotes a semi-closed system with estuarine characteristics yearlong. Satellite Chl-a and nFLH were characterized by asynchronous seasonal cycles (nFLH peaks in fall) that differed from the southern ISC where the maximum Chl-a and nFLH occurs in spring-summer. The adjacent coastal ocean influences the southern ISC, and thus, the Chl-a and nFLH variability correlated well with the seasonal variation of meridional winds. The northern ISC was clearly influenced by river discharges, which can bias the Chl-a retrievals, decoupling the annual cycles of Chl-a and nFLH. In situ data from a buoy in Seno Reloncavi reaffirmed this bias in satellite Chl-a and a higher correlation with nFLH, by which the construction of a local Chl-a algorithm for northern Patagonia is essential.

TI  - Scientific considerations and challenges for addressing cumulative effects in forest landscapes in Canada
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS
M3  - Review
AB  - Traditionally, forest management has focused on forestry-related practices whereas other industries have been managed separately. Forest management requires the integration of all natural resource development activities, along with other anthropogenic and natural forest disturbances (e.g., climate change, pollution, wildfire, pest disturbance) to understand how human activities can change forested ecosystems. The term cumulative effects has been used to describe these attempts to integrate all disturbances to develop an understanding of past, current, and future impacts on environmental, social, and economic components of the system. In this review, we focus on the science required to understand the past, current, and future impacts of the cumulative effects of anthropogenic and natural disturbances on forested ecosystems or their components. We have primarily focused on the terrestrial system with an emphasis on northern forests in Canada. Our paper is not intended to be a comprehensive review of all cumulative effects science but a synthesis of the challenges and approaches currently being used. Central repositories were identified as an approach to deal with issues of availability of remotely sensed data on anthropogenic and natural disturbances. Data integration projects, open data, and well-designed large-scale data collection efforts are needed to provide sufficient data on environmental responses to cumulative effects. As well, large-scale integrated, modularized ecosystem models are needed to bring stressor and environmental response data together to explore responses to, and interactions between, multiple stressors to project these effects into the future and to identify future data collection needs.

TI  - Evaluating accuracy of four MODIS-derived burned area products for tropical peatland and non-peatland fires
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based burned area products are accurate for many regions. However, only limited assessments exist for Indonesia despite extensive burning and globally important carbon emissions. We evaluated the accuracy of four MODIS-derived (moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer) burned area products (MCD45A1 collection 5.1, MCD64A1 (collection 5.1 and 6), FireCCI51), and their sensitivity to burned-area size and temporal window length used for detection. The products were compared to reference burned areas from SPOT 5 imagery using error matrices and linear regressions. The MCD45A1 product detected <1% of burned areas. The other products detected 38%-48% of burned area with accuracies increasing modestly (45%-57%) when smaller burns (<100 ha) were excluded, with MCD64A1 C6 performing best. Except for the MCD45 product, linear regressions showed generally good agreement in peatlands (R-2 ranging from 0.6 to 0.8) but detections were less accurate in non-peatlands (R-2 ranging from 0.2 to 0.5). Despite having higher spatial resolution, the FireCCI51 product (250 m) showed lower accuracy (OE = 0.55-0.88, CE = 0.33-0.50) than the 500 m MCD64A1 C6 product (OE = 0.43-0.79, CE = 0.36-0.51) but it was comparable to the C5.1 product (OE = 0.52-0.91, CE = 0.37-0.67). Dense clouds and smoke limited the accuracies of all burned area products, even when the temporal window for detection was lengthened. This study shows that emissions calculations based on burned area in peatlands remain highly uncertain. Given the globally significant amount of emissions from burning peatlands, specific attention is required to improve burned area mapping in these regions in order for global emissions models to accurately reflect when, where, and how much emissions are occurring.

TI  - Association between negative preoperative axillary node staging and surgical sentinel node biopsy in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer: A retrospective analysis
T2  - BIOMEDICAL PAPERS-OLOMOUC
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyse the preoperative ultrasound findings in patients with minimal or almost no morphological changes of axillary lymph nodes (LN) and to correlate these findings with the results of sentinel node (SN) biopsy.Materials and Methods. Between January 2014 and September 2018, 289 female patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and negative preoperative axillary staging were examined with preoperative ultrasound evaluation of axillary LNs. Patients with no evidence of LN metastases underwent primary surgical treatment with SN biopsy. Negative predictive value (NPV) of preoperative ultrasound was evaluated and the histopathological findings in positive SN biopsies were correlated with tumour type and preoperative ultrasound LN imaging.Results. Of 289 patients with negative preoperative axillary staging who had primary surgical treatment, 268 patients had negative SN biopsy while SN metastases were detected in 21 patients. Of patients with positive SN biopsies, 2 patients had negative core biopsy of axillary LN before surgery. The preoperative ultrasound examination was negative in the remaining 19 patients with SN metastases.Conclusions. Preoperative ultrasonography is very accurate in the detecting of axillary LN metastases. Patients with primary tumour size >= 1 cm, with grade >= 2 no special type carcinomas (NST - no special type, also known as invasive ductal carcinoma) or multicentric lobular invasive cancer should undergo a more thorough ultrasound evaluation.

TI  - Infinite Interpretations? A Corpus-based Study for the Identification and Interpretation of Competing Frames in Parliament- representations in Hungary
T2  - CENTRAL EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Political communication highly depends on generic figurative frames such as Politics Is War, Object, Sport, Art and Politics Is Landscape. Regarding political art, it is suggested that artists use complex cognitive solutions (e.g. parallel issue-specific frames) in creative ways which are connected with one of the major generic frames. The study discusses parliament-representations (made between 2006 and 2015) which are not only attractive elements of the cityscape; thus, not literary representations of the building. Using the method of visual framing, the analyses (1) describe the artworks, (2) interpret the occurring symbols and metaphors determined contextually, and (3) reveal the ideological and power relations. Summing up, political artworks can be comprehended according to conventional mental schemas. However, artists usually create a minimum of two competing specifications of the general frames occurring at the same time, and let the viewer choose the one that fits better with their worldview.

TI  - A New Benchmark Based on Recent Advances in Multispectral Pansharpening: Revisiting Pansharpening With Classical and Emerging Pansharpening Methods
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING MAGAZINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Pansharpening refers to the fusion of a multispectral (MS) image and panchromatic (PAN) data aimed at generating an outcome with the same spatial resolution of the PAN data and the spectral resolution of the MS image. In the last 30 years, several approaches to deal with this issue have been proposed. However, the reproducibility of these methods is often limited, making the comparison with the state of the art hard to achieve. Thus, to fill this gap, we propose a new benchmark consisting of recent advances in MS pansharpening. In particular, optimized classical approaches [multiresolution analysis (MRA) and component substitution (CS)] are compared with methods belonging to the third generation of pansharpening, represented by variational optimization-based (VO) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The benchmark is tested on different scenarios (from urban to rural areas) acquired by different commercial sensors [i.e., IKONOS (IK), GeoEye-1 (GE-1), and WorldView-3 (WV-3)]. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments and the computational burden are analyzed in this article, and all of the implementations have been collected in a MATLAB toolbox that is made available to the community.

TI  - A Better Understanding of Axillary Lymph Node Dissection in the Era of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy
T2  - CHIRURGIA
M3  - Review
AB  - Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) was and still is an important part of breast cancer treatment despite the fact the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has revolutionized breast cancer surgery. SLNB provides the same prognostic information as ALND but with significantly less morbidity. The results of numerous trials conducted over the past 20 years have crowned SLNB as the gold standard for early breast cancer treatment. ALND represents a very standardized intervention with precise landmarks and boundaries. An accurate technique and a good knowledge of axilla' anatomy are mandatory for a correct and complete ALND. But even with a meticulous and careful technique of dissection, a comprehensive ALND may be associated with important morbidity. Nowadays ALND indications are continuously evolving, but the procedure has still an indisputable place in breast cancer treatment.

TI  - Photoacoustic tomography for assessment and quantification of cutaneous and metastatic malignant melanoma-A systematic review
T2  - PHOTODIAGNOSIS AND PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) is an emerging noninvasive imaging technique combining high sensitivity optical absorption contrast, such as melanin, with high-resolution ultrasound for deep tissue imaging. The ability of PAT to provide real-time images of skin structures at depth has been studied for diagnosis of primary and metastatic malignant melanoma (MM).Objective: To provide an overview of the rapidly expanding clinical use of PAT for determination of melanoma thickness and architecture, visualization of metastases in lymph nodes and detection of circulating melanoma cells.Methods: Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google Scholar, and Cochrane Library were searched for papers using PAT to assess cutaneous malignant melanoma and melanoma metastases in humans or human specimens.Results: The research resulted in 14 articles which met the search criteria.Conclusions: Results from current studies suggest that PAT is a promising tool for assessing both primary and metastatic malignant melanoma in the clinic. The potential of PAT to noninvasively visualize tumour boundaries, as well as assist in the evaluation of metastatic status, could facilitate more effective treatment, resulting in better clearance and reducing the need for additional biopsies. However, larger and methodologically sound studies are warranted.

TI  - Anomalous Phenomena in the Development of Phytoplankton in the Black Sea on the Basis of Remote Sensing Data
T2  - DOKLADY EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Anomalous phenomena in the development of phytoplankton in the Black Sea for the period of 2000-2020 have been recorded on the basis of satellite data. Anomalous summer blooms of diatoms were detected in the field of chlorophyll a for the blooming periods of 2001, 2010, and 2015. These blooms were unusual for the summer periods and developed under conditions of a negative anomaly in the surface layer temperature caused by active wind mixing. The highest level of development of summer blooms of coccolithophore was recorded in 2006, 2012, and 2017. These phenomena have been observed after abnormally cold winters. It has been shown that in some years, under conditions of low summer temperatures and active wind mixing, the summer vegetation of coccolithophores is poorly manifested and can be replaced by the development of diatoms. Satellite data over a twenty-year period demonstrated numerous signs of mass development of coccolithophores during the cold season. Winter blooms of coccolithophorids occur in warm winters with low wind activity. It has been noted that after the winter blooms of coccolithophores, their summer vegetation is largely smoothed. The influence of hydrometeorological factors on the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton is discussed.

M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: We are presenting the experience of our centre with the surgical treatment of breast cancer, by comparing the use of axillary node dissection with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNLB).Method: We have made a retrospective analysis of breast cancer cases in the Surgical Oncology Clinic no. 1, "Alexandru Trestioreanu" Oncology Institute, Bucharest, in the period between December 2019 and December 2020. We are presenting the situations in which axillary node dissection can be replaced with SNLB and the limitations of this method.Result: Although the use of SNLB has advantages compared to axillary node dissection, it is limited by the early detection of breast cancer and by the necessity of adding axillary dissection to surgical treatment in the case of positive SNLB.Concuation: The replacement of axillary node dissection with SNLB is a desideratum for the following decades in view of an optimal treatment of early-stage breast cancer, with fewer postoperative complications and a better life quality.

TI  - Saintsavaism(s) and Nationalism: An Overview of the Development of the Serbian Orthodox Phenomenon of <i>Saintsavaism</i>, with a Special Focus on the Contribution of Justin Popovic (1894-1979)
T2  - EXCHANGE-JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY CHRISTIANITIES IN CONTEXT
M3  - Article
AB  - This article provides a reflection on a relatively controversial phenomenon in the Serbian Orthodox Church, namely saintsavaism (serb. svetosavlje). The controversy accompanying the term is related to its association with the Serbian nationalism that erupted during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990's. This article aims to demonstrate that this particular interpretation of saintsavaism is, in fact, only one of at least four distinct understandings of the notion. Moreover, this article will argue that the author who contributed most significantly to the development of saintsavaism as the guiding principle of the Serbian Church to this day, namely, Justin Popovic (1894-1979), envisioned saintsavaism as, indeed, a totalizing worldview, and recognized its national significance, without, however, reducing it to simple 'nationalism'. In order to make this case clear, the article will analyze in detail Popovic's seminal work on saintsavaism (available only in Serbian), Saintsavaism as a Philosophy of Life (1953).

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Research on the consistency of suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentration retrieved from multisource satellite sensors can serve as long-time monitoring of water quality. To explore the influence of the atmospheric correction (AC) algorithm and the retrieval model on the consistency of the SPM concentration values, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel 2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) images acquired on the same day are used to compare the remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) SPM retrieval values in two high-turbidity lakes. An SPM retrieval model for Shengjin Lake is established based on field measurements and applied to OLI and MSI images: two SPM concentration products are highly consistent (R-2 = 0.93, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 20.67 mg/L, Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) = 6.59%), and the desired results are also obtained in Chaohu Lake. Among the four AC algorithms (Management Unit of the North Seas Mathematical Models (MUMM), Atmospheric Correction for OLI'lite'(ACOLITE), Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S), Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Code & Sen2cor (LaSRC & Sen2cor)), the two Rrs products, as well as the final SPM concentration products retrieved from OLI and MSI images, have the best consistency when using the MUMM algorithm in SeaWIFS Data Analyst System (SeaDAS) software. The consistency of SPM concentration values retrieved from OLI and MSI images using the same model or same form of models is significantly better than that retrieved by applying the optimal models with different forms.

TI  - Integrating Weighted Feature Fusion and the Spatial Attention Module with Convolutional Neural Networks for Automatic Aircraft Detection from SAR Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The automatic detection of aircrafts from SAR images is widely applied in both military and civil fields, but there are still considerable challenges. To address the high variety of aircraft sizes and complex background information in SAR images, a new fast detection framework based on convolution neural networks is proposed, which achieves automatic and rapid detection of aircraft with high accuracy. First, the airport runway areas are detected to generate the airport runway mask and rectangular contour of the whole airport are generated. Then, a new deep neural network proposed in this paper, named Efficient Weighted Feature Fusion and Attention Network (EWFAN), is used to detect aircrafts. EWFAN integrates the weighted feature fusion module, the spatial attention mechanism, and the CIF loss function. EWFAN can effectively reduce the interference of negative samples and enhance feature extraction, thereby significantly improving the detection accuracy. Finally, the airport runway mask is applied to the detected results to reduce false alarms and produce the final aircraft detection results. To evaluate the performance of the proposed framework, large-scale Gaofen-3 SAR images with 1 m resolution are utilized in the experiment. The detection rate and false alarm rate of our EWFAN algorithm are 95.4% and 3.3%, respectively, which outperforms Efficientdet and YOLOv4. In addition, the average test time with the proposed framework is only 15.40 s, indicating satisfying efficiency of automatic aircraft detection.

TI  - Retrieval and Mapping of Soil Organic Carbon Using Sentinel-2A Spectral Images from Bare Cropland in Autumn
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil is the largest carbon reservoir on the terrestrial surface. Soil organic carbon (SOC) not only regulates global climate change, but also indicates soil fertility level in croplands. SOC prediction based on remote sensing images has generated great interest in the research field of digital soil mapping. The short revisiting time and wide spectral bands available from Sentinel-2A (S2A) remote sensing data can provide a useful data resource for soil property prediction. However, dense soil surface coverage reduces the direct relationship between soil properties and S2A spectral reflectance such that it is difficult to achieve a successful SOC prediction model. Observations of bare cropland in autumn provide the possibility to establish accurate SOC retrieval models using the S2A super-spectral reflectance. Therefore, in this study, we collected 225 topsoil samples from bare cropland in autumn and measured the SOC content. We also obtained S2A spectral images of the western Guanzhong Plain, China. We established four SOC prediction models, including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), partial least-squares regression (PLSR), and artificial neural network (ANN) based on 15 variables retrieved from the S2A images, and compared the prediction accuracy using RMSE (root mean square error), R-2 (coefficient of determination), and RPD (ratio of performance to deviation). Based on the optimal model, the spatial distribution of SOC was mapped and analyzed. The results indicated that the inversion model with the RF algorithm achieved the highest accuracy, with an R-2 of 0.8581, RPD of 2.1313, and RMSE of 1.07. The variables retrieved from the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands (B11 and B12) usually had higher variable importance, except for the ANN model. SOC content mapped with the RF model gradually decreased with increasing distance from the Wei river, and values were higher in the west than in the east. These results matched the SOC distribution based on measurements at the sample sites. This research provides evidence that soil properties such as SOC can be retrieved and spatially mapped based on S2A images that are obtained from bare cropland in autumn.

AB  - As a vital role in the processes of the energy balance and hydrological cycles, actual evapotranspiration (ET) is relevant to many agricultural, ecological and water resource management studies. The available global or regional ET products provide ET estimations with various temporal ranges, spatial resolutions and calculation methods (algorithms, inputs and parameterization, etc.), leading to varying degrees of introduced uncertainty. Northern China is the main agriculturally productive region supporting the whole country; thus, understanding the spatial and temporal changes in ET is essential to ensure water resource and food security. We developed a synthesis ET dataset for Northern China at a 1000 m spatial resolution, with a monthly temporal resolution covering a period ranging from 1982 to 2017, using an in-depth assessment of several ET products. Specifically, assessments were performed using in situ measured ET from eddy covariance (EC) observation towers at the site-pixel scale over interannual months under the conditions of different land cover types, climatic zones and elevation levels to select the most optimally performing ET products to be used in the synthesized ET dataset. Eight indicators under 21 conditions were involved in the assessment sheet, while the statistics of the different ET product occurrences and corresponding ratios were analyzed to select the best-performing ET products to build the synthesis ET dataset using the weighted mean method. The weights were determined by the Taylor skill score (TSS), calculated with ET products and EC ET observation data. Based on the assessment results, the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML_v2), ETWatch and Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) datasets were selected for implementation in the synthesis ET dataset from 2003 to 2017, while Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) v3.3a, complementary relationship (CR) ET, and Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) datasets were chosen for the synthesis ET dataset from 1982 to 2002. The weighted mean synthesized results from 2003 to 2017 performed well when compared to the in situ measured EC ET values produced under all of the above conditions, while the synthesized results from 1982 to 2002 performed well through the water balance method in Heihe River Basin. These results can provide more stable ET estimations for Northern China, which can contribute to relevant agricultural, ecological and hydrological studies.

TI  - GBRT-Based Estimation of Terrestrial Latent Heat Flux in the Haihe River Basin from Satellite and Reanalysis Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate and spatially continuous estimation of terrestrial latent heat flux (LE) is fundamental and crucial for the rational utilization of water resources in the Haihe River Basin (HRB). However, the sparsity of flux observation sites hinders the accurate characterization of spatiotemporal LE patterns over the HRB. In this study, we estimated the daily LE across the HRB using the gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT) from global land surface satellite NDVI data, reanalysis data and eddy covariance data. Compared with the random forests (RF) and extra tree regressor (ETR) methods, the GBRT obtains the best results, with R-2 = 0.86 and root mean square error (RMSE = 18.1 W/m(2). Then, we applied the GBRT algorithm to map the average annual terrestrial LE of the HRB from 2016 to 2018 with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees. When compared with the Global Land Surface Satellite (GLASS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LE products, the difference between the terrestrial LE estimated by the GBRT algorithm and the GLASS and MODIS products was less than 20 W/m(2) in most areas; thus, the GBRT algorithm was reliable and reasonable for estimating the long-term LE estimation over the HRB.

TI  - Automatic Extraction of <i>Sargassum</i> Features From Sentinel-2 MSI Images
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Frequent Sargassum beaching in the Caribbean Sea and other regions has caused severe problems for local environments and economies. Although coarse-resolution satellite instruments can provide large-scale Sargassum distributions, their use is problematic in nearshore waters that are directly relevant to local communities. Finer resolution instruments, such as the multispectral instruments (MSIs) on the Sentinel-2 satellites, show potential to fill this gap, yet automatic Sargassum extraction is difficult due to compounding factors. In this article, a new approach is developed to extract Sargassum features automatically from MSI Floating Algae Index (FAI) images. Because of the high spatial resolution, limited signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and staggered instrument internal configuration, there are many nonalgae bright targets (including cloud artifacts and wave-induced glints) causing enhanced near-infrared reflectance and elevated FAI values. Based on the spatial patterns of these image "noises," a Trainable Nonlinear Reaction Diffusion (TNRD) denoising model is trained to estimate and remove such noise. The model shows excellent performance when tested over realistic noise patterns derived fromMSI measurements. After removing such noise and masking clouds (as well as cloud shadows and glint patterns), biomass density from each valid pixel is quantified using the FAI-biomass model established from earlier field measurements, from which Sargassum morphology (length/width/biomass) is derived. Overall, the proposed approach achieves over 86% Sargassum extraction accuracy and shows preliminary success on Landsat-8 images. The approach is expected to be incorporated in the existing near real-time Sargassum Watch System for both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 observations to monitor Sargassum over nearshore waters.

TI  - Spring Frost Damage to Tea Plants Can Be Identified with Daily Minimum Air Temperatures Estimated by MODIS Land Surface Temperature Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is one of the most dominant economic plants in China and plays an important role in agricultural economic benefits. Spring tea is the most popular drink due to Chinese drinking habits. Although the global temperature is generally warming, spring frost damage (SFD) to tea plants still occurs from time to time, and severely restricts the production and quality of spring tea. Therefore, monitoring and evaluating the impact of SFD to tea plants in a timely and precise manner is a significant and urgent task for scientists and tea producers in China. The region designated as the Middle and Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River (MLRYR) in China is a major tea plantation area producing small tea leaves and low shrubs. This region was selected to study SFD to tea plants using meteorological observations and remotely sensed products. Comparative analysis between minimum air temperature (T-min) and two MODIS nighttime land surface temperature (LST) products at six pixel-window scales was used to determine the best suitable product and spatial scale. Results showed that the LST nighttime product derived from MYD11A1 data at the 3 x 3 pixel window resolution was the best proxy for daily minimum air temperature. A T-min estimation model was established using this dataset and digital elevation model (DEM) data, employing the standard lapse rate of air temperature with elevation. Model validation with 145,210 ground-based T-min observations showed that the accuracy of estimated T-min was acceptable with a relatively high coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.841), low root mean square error (RMSE = 2.15 degrees C) and mean absolute error (MAE = 1.66 degrees C), and reasonable normalized RMSE (NRMSE = 25.4%) and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency (EF = 0.12), with significantly improved consistency of LST and T-min estimation. Based on the T-min estimation model, three major cooling episodes recorded in the "Yearbook of Meteorological Disasters in China" in spring 2006 were accurately identified, and several highlighted regions in the first two cooling episodes were also precisely captured. This study confirmed that estimating T-min based on MYD11A1 nighttime products and DEM is a useful method for monitoring and evaluating SFD to tea plants in the MLRYR. Furthermore, this method precisely identified the spatial characteristics and distribution of SFD and will therefore be helpful for taking effective preventative measures to mitigate the economic losses resulting from frost damage.

T2  - CLAY MINERALS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - Asian Clay Conference
CL  - Singapore, SINGAPORE
AB  - A hybrid fluorescent pigment composed of fluorescent yellow X-10GFF (FY-10G) and palygorskite (PLG) was prepared by semi-dry grinding. The effects of the physically adsorbed water content and grinding time on the environmental stability of FY-10G/PLG hybrid fluorescent pigments in terms of acid, ethanol and ultraviolet irradiation are discussed in detail. The incorporated FY-10 G molecules are mainly trapped on the external surface and the groove of PLG. Due to the host-guest interaction between PAL and FY-10G, the emission spectrum of the FY-10G/PLG hybrids shifts to a greater wavelength compared with that of FY-10G, but the physically adsorbed water content and grinding time have no effect on the position of the emission spectrum except for its intensity. A larger, physically adsorbed water content and appropriate grinding time may effectively prevent the aggregation and breakage of the bundles of PLG and facilitate FY-10 G molecules to enter into the groove of PAL. This increases the environmental stability of the as-prepared hybrid pigments.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variation of net primary productivity and its climatic driving factors in Xilingol League
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Net primary productivity ( NPP) is widely used in evaluating the quality and function of ecosystems. Monitoring the temporal and spatial variations of NPP in ecological engineering region is an important task of ecological construction effectiveness evaluation. Here, we evaluated the spatial-temporal variations of NPP in Xilingol League using sequential remote sensing data from 2000 to 2015 and Carnegie-Ames Stanford approach ( CASA) , and analyzed the impacts of temperature and precipitation on NPP. The results showed that the NPP of Xilingol League ranged from 108.66 to 359.74 g C . m(-2) . a(-1) during 2000-2015, with an average growth rate of 13.47 g C . m(-2) . a(-1). The average NPP in Xilingol League was 254.18 g C . m(-2) . a(-1) from 2000 to 2015, with a spatially descending trend from east to west. The NPP in Taipusi Banner, Duolun County, Xiwuzhumuqin Banner and Dongwuzhumuqin Banner was above 280 g C . 111 (-2) . a(-1) , the total areas of these regions covered 40.13% of Xilingol League. Approximately 94.56% of total area in Xilingol League showed an increasing tendency in NPP between 2000 and 2015, while the increased magnitude of NPP in 33.95% of area was more than 120 g C . m(-2). The NPP in Xilingol League was positively correlated with rainfall, while 31.18% of area showed a positive correlation between NPP and temperature. The complex correlation coefficient between NPP and annual temperature and precipitation reached 0.59. We conclude that the NPP in about 55% of area is clearly driven by climatic factors. These regions should fully utilize the positive effects of climate change on ecological restoration. More ecological engineering measures should be adopted in the rest areas where the NPP is relatively insensitive to climate change.

TI  - Characterization and Exploration of Potential Neuroprotective Peptides in Walnut (<i>Juglans regia</i>) Protein Hydrolysate against Cholinergic System Damage and Oxidative Stress in Scopolamine-Induced Cognitive and Memory Impairment Mice and Zebrafish
T2  - JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND FOOD CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the neuroprotective effect and mechanism of walnut protein hydrolysates (WPH) against memory deficits induced by scopolamine in mice and further to validate the potent neuroprotective peptides identified by integrated approaches of in silico analysis and peptidomics in scopolamine-induced zebrafish. Results showed that a remarkable amelioration on behavioral performance was observed for oral administration of WPH, and disorders of cholinergic system and oxidative stress were normalized in the brains of mice also. Unfortunately, no obvious inflammatory response and anti-inflammatory effect were observed. Additionally, WPH significantly upregulated the expressions of antioxidant defense-related protein (Nrf2) and neurotrophic-related protein (BDNF and CREB). Furthermore, 20 peptides with relatively higher abundance and PeptideRanker scores were predicted by docking to AchE and Keap1. Among them, FY and SGFDAE with the highest binding affinities, -9.8 and -8.0 kcal/mol, were considered as the promising AchE and Keap1 inhibitors, respectively. They were further validated to have neuroprotective capacity in scopolamine-induced zebrafish, indicating that peptidomics and in silico prediction might be the effective approaches to screen neuroprotective peptides.

TI  - Quantifying the influences of land surface parameters on LST variations based on GeoDetector model in Syr Darya Basin, Central Asia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal variability in the land surface energy flux is largely and comprehensively affected by many factors, including land surface temperature (LST), land coverage, soil characteristics, terrain conditions, etc. In contrast with other climatic zones, arid and semiarid lands have fragile ecological environments that are more sensitive to land surface energy flux changes. In this study, we used MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST products (2001-2015) for air temperature comparisons. Then, we investigated the spatiotemporal variation in LSTs in the Syr Darya Basin (SDB) during 2001-2015. More specifically, a new statistical model known as GeoDetector was adopted to analyze the driving factors controlling the spatiotemporal variation in LSTs. The result shows that the MODIS LST can provide a good estimation of air temperature, especially at night. The LST change rate can be considered as an important indicator of climate change (rapid warming at high altitudes) and human activities (increased water consumption of crop). Based on the GeoDetector model, we determined that the elevation explained more of the LST distribution (84-90%) and spatiotemporal variation (22-26%) than any other land surface parameters. The combination of albedo and the other explanatory variables can significantly increase the explanatory power of each single factor, especially with elevation.

TI  - Study on the temporal and spatial distribution of chlorophyll a in Erhai Lake based on multispectral data from environmental satellites
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing technology presents advantages of macroscopicity, timeliness and cost effectiveness and has been increasingly used in lake water quality monitoring. In this paper, an empirical model for the remote sensing inversion of the chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentration in Erhai Lake was established using ground monitoring Chl-a concentration data and multispectral remote sensing data from environmental satellites from 2010 to 2017. The average absolute error and relative error were 1.92 mg/m(3) and 22%, respectively. A 10-year remote sensing inversion of Erhai blooms identified the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of blooms and showed that the occurrence frequency of blooms was 37%, and they were mainly in the form of light algal blooms at a local scale. Moderate and severe blooms occurred at a frequency of 42%, mainly from Oct. to Jan. Moderate algal blooms were distributed along the southern and northern coasts and in coastal areas, while severe algal blooms were distributed in the northern section and across the entire lake. During the bloom period, the growth rate of the bloom area reached 102 km(2)/d, which was faster than the reduction rate (90 km(2)/d). Bloom events generally lasted for 6-37 days. The inflow of pollution sources led to a higher frequency of blooms in the coastal zone than in the lake center, and the frequency in the northern section was nearly twice as high as that in the southern section. Most blooms in Erhai Lake occurred from late summer to winter (i.e., Jul. to Jan. of the following year) because of the higher average air temperature (AT) and lower wind speed (WS) in winter and spring and the amount of precipitation in summer and autumn. The remote sensing method captured the high-risk areas and the spatial-temporal evolution trend of algal blooms, and the model provided support for the prevention and control of lake algal blooms; however, this work should be complemented by ground monitoring data for cloudy days.

TI  - Monitoring Vegetation Greenness in Response to Climate Variation along the Elevation Gradient in the Three-River Source Region of China
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Three-River Source Region (TRSR) is vital to the ecological security of China. However, the impact of global warming on the dynamics of vegetation along the elevation gradient in the TRSR remains unclear. Accordingly, we used multi-source remote sensing vegetation indices (VIs) (GIMMS (Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies) LAI (Leaf Area Index), GIMMS NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), GLOBMAP (Global Mapping) LAI, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index), MODIS NDVI, and MODIS NIRv (near-infrared reflectance of vegetation)) and digital elevation model data to study the changes of VGEG (Vegetation Greenness along the Elevation Gradient) in the TRSR from 2001 to 2016. Results showed that the areas with a positive correlation of vegetation greenness and elevation accounted for 36.34 +/- 5.82% of the study areas. The interannual variations of VGEG showed that the significantly changed regions were mainly observed in the elevation gradient of 4-5 km. The VGEG was strongest in the elevation gradient of 4-5 km and weakest in the elevation gradient of >5 km. Correlation analysis showed that the mean annual temperature was positively correlated with VIs, and the effect of the mean annual precipitation on VIs was more obvious at low altitude than in high altitude. This study contributes to our understanding of the VGEG variation in the TRSR under global climate variation and also helps in the prediction of future carbon cycle patterns.

TI  - 250-m Aerosol Retrieval from FY-3 Satellite in Guangzhou
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol distribution with fine spatial resolution is crucial for atmospheric environmental management. This paper proposes an improved algorithm of aerosol retrieval from 250-m Medium Resolution Spectral Image (MERSI) data of Chinese FY-3 satellites. A mixing model of soil and vegetation was used to calculate the parameters of the algorithm from moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance products in 500-m resolution. The mixing model was used to determine surface reflectance in blue band, and the 250-m aerosol optical depth (AOD) was retrieved through removing surface contributions from MERSI data over Guangzhou. The algorithm was used to monitor two pollution episodes in Guangzhou in 2015, and the results displayed an AOD spatial distribution with 250-m resolution. Compared with the yearly average of MODIS aerosol products in 2015, the 250-m resolution AOD derived from the MERSI data exhibited great potential for identifying air pollution sources. Daily AODs derived from MERSI data were compared with ground results from CE318 measurements. The results revealed a correlation coefficient between the AODs from MERSI and those from the ground measurements of approximately 0.85, and approximately 68% results were within expected error range of +/-(0.05 + 15%tau).

TI  - Assessing relationship of forest biophysical factors with NDVI for carbon management in key coniferous strata of temperate Himalayas
T2  - MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION STRATEGIES FOR GLOBAL CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing biophysical variables are essential for evaluation of carbon dynamics due to anthropogenic activities. Biomass carbon is an important biophysical parameter of forest ecosystems that indicates carbon mitigation and human-forest interactions. Spectral modeling approach was used to assess the relation of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with biomass carbon, crown density, tree density, slope, altitude, aspect, species, and forest division in temperate conifer region of Himalaya. Field inventory was recorded from 188 biomass plots of 0.1 ha each across the study area. NDVI was observed to have a positive relation with aboveground biomass carbon, crown density, tree density, and altitude. The NDVI and ABC values ranged from (0.11 to 0.43) and (1.54 to 276.82 t ha(-1)), respectively. Among the aspects, highest and lowest average NDVI was observed for south east (0.289) and north (0.258), respectively. Similarly highest and lowest average aboveground biomass carbon was observed for north east (72.63 t ha(-1)) and east (44.30 t ha(-1)), respectively. NDVI expressed a fairly good relation with biophysical parameters including altitude, aspect, crown density, tree density, species, and location (forest division). NDVI using principal tree species composition (forest type) revealed a relation with aboveground biomass carbon for Cedrus deodara (R-2=0.63), Mixed I (R-2=0.61), Pinus wallichiana (R-2=0.57), and Mixed-II (R-2=0.48). NDVI demonstrates potential to understand biomass carbon variability through establishment of relations with forest biophysical parameters using spectral modeling approach. Varying NDVI can be ascribed to vegetation canopy density, number of stems, species, and altitude. The database and established relations would help indicate biomass carbon dynamics and enable to adopt site-specific management. The study further helps draw inferences on mitigation and adaptation perspectives in view of varying biophysical conditions that occur in a forest.

TI  - A Novel Multitemporal Approach for Satellite-Derived Bathymetry for Coastal Waters of Palau
T2  - JOURNAL OF COASTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Shallow water bathymetry is important for understanding biogeophysical and socioeconomic processes in coastal areas. In recent years, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) methods have been increasingly used to provide high-resolution bathymetry estimation in different regions using single remote sensing images. To tackle the common issues of single-image SDB, such as data gaps due to cloud coverage and false bathymetry due to water turbidity, this study applied a novel multitemporal workflow for SDB estimation in Palau, a Pacific Island nation. This workflow implements the typical empirical SDB steps to calculate relative water depth (i.e. log ratio of the blue and green band) of 20 Landsat 8 images that were composited and subsequently related to in situ depth measurements to estimate true depth. Before composition, a histogram equalization approach was employed to normalize the images and identify clear water areas of each image pair by applying a 1% difference threshold. To achieve better performance, different methodological options at three key steps were evaluated, including temporal composition (mean vs. median), point data extraction (direct vs. bilinear interpolation), and regression (linear vs. piecewise vs. polynomial). Among 12 models, the polynomial model built upon bilinearly interpolated mean composition data performed the best, accurately estimating water depth up to the extinction depth of 13.7 m (45 ft), with a root mean square error of 1.76 m (5.77 ft). This multitemporal approach, with proper methodological choices according to local circumstances, could be applied to other regions to derive gap-free and accurate bathymetry estimations.

TI  - Generative Adversarial Learning in YUV Color Space for Thin Cloud Removal on Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Clouds are one of the most serious disturbances when using satellite imagery for ground observations. The semi-translucent nature of thin clouds provides the possibility of 2D ground scene reconstruction based on a single satellite image. In this paper, we propose an effective framework for thin cloud removal involving two aspects: a network architecture and a training strategy. For the network architecture, a Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) in YUV color space called YUV-GAN is proposed. Unlike most existing approaches in RGB color space, our method performs end-to-end thin cloud removal by learning luminance and chroma components independently, which is efficient at reducing the number of unrecoverable bright and dark pixels. To preserve more detailed features, the generator adopts a residual encoding-decoding network without down-sampling and up-sampling layers, which effectively competes with a residual discriminator, encouraging the accuracy of scene identification. For the training strategy, a transfer-learning-based method was applied. Instead of using either simulated or scarce real data to train the deep network, adequate simulated pairs were used to train the YUV-GAN at first. Then, pre-trained convolutional layers were optimized by real pairs to encourage the applicability of the model to real cloudy images. Qualitative and quantitative results on RICE1 and Sentinel-2A datasets confirmed that our YUV-GAN achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with other approaches. Additionally, our method combining the YUV-GAN with a transfer-learning-based training strategy led to better performance in the case of scarce training data.

T2  - JOURNAL OF PLACE MANAGEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate COVID-19 as a super crisis in the design and management of places.Design/methodology/approachThis theory-driven work outlines why and how, by treating COVID-19 as a super crisis, the immunological view rises in priority and swiftly ushers in short- and long-term implications for space design and place management.FindingsFirst, this paper looks at the short-term impact of COVID-19 upon space and place management in addressing how porous bubbling, stippling and flexible curtaining respond to immediate retrofitting needs during the pandemic. Using the concept of COVID-19-induced collective trauma, this paper draws attention to health-care facilities, schools, workplaces, commercial buildings and public outdoor spaces. These sites require short-term improvisation in place and space design and will, where the collective trauma of COVID-19 leaves strong traces, require long-term redesign and rethinking.Social implicationsAs a super crisis, COVID-19 generates contradictions in the existing trend in space and place studies from the notion of space and place as a container to one focusing on "flow." A focus on flow highlights a focus on space and place as adaptable to changes in flow, especially as augmented and mediated by technology.Originality/valueThis treatment of COVID-19 as a super crisis is intended to stimulate the design and management of spaces and places in the post-COVID-19 period.

TI  - Prison as a Site of Intense Religious Change: The Example of Conversion to Islam
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the findings of mixed-methods research conducted with 279 Muslim prisoners in 10 prisons in England, Switzerland and France, this paper argues that contemporary European prisons are sites of intense religious change, in which many people born outside Islam and many born-Muslims believe in and practise Islam for the first time. In order to map this experience of intense religious change in prison, the paper articulates an original typology of conversion to identify Muslim converts as Switchers and Intensifiers. Both of these types of convert mobilise their Islam to turn to God in acts of repentance for their crime(s), to find a renewed purpose in life and to re-gain psychological balance and inner peace. By contrast, a minority of prisoners are Reducers, whose Islamic faith diminishes in prison. A minority of converts to Islam also persist or become more deeply entrenched in the Islamist Worldview of Us vs. Them. Therefore, while choosing to follow Islam in prison carries with it some criminogenic risk, conversion to Islam is significantly more likely to help than to hinder prisoners' rehabilitation by enabling them to feel remorse for their crimes, reconnecting them with work and education and encouraging them to find emotionally supportive company.

T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was conducted in the northwest highlands of Ethiopia to, (i) map the different land use types and detect land use changes between 2000 and 2017, (ii) assess whether A. Decurrens plantation brings a land use change, and (iii) evaluate the role of A. Decurrens plantation on man-made forest cover change. ArcGIS 10.3 was used for spatial analysis and mapping while ERDAS Imagine 9.2 was used for land use classification and change detection. Landsat images were used to generate the land use maps using unsupervised and supervised classification methods. Cultivated land, wetland, natural forest and bare lands were declining whereas plantation, grazing land and settlement lands were expanding. Plantation cover was the most expanded land use type, which increased by 16%. A. Decurrens plantation was found to be the main reason in changing the land use from crop based land use to plantation land use. Man-made plantation was also increased because of A. Decurrens plantation. Moreover, A. Decurrens planation based land use was found to be a means to rehabilitate the degraded mountainous areas by reducing soil erosion and increasing the fertility of the soil through nitrogen fixation.

T2  - A & A PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The case of a patient who experienced serious adverse effects following a potential overdose of Patent Blue V dye (PVB) is presented here. A 65-year-old woman developed cardiac arrythmias and circulatory instability 35 minutes after receiving 100 mg PVB during breast cancer surgery. An allergic reaction was assumed and treated accordingly. Intraoperatively, both epinephrine and norepinephrine infusions were required to support circulation. However, mast-cell tryptase levels were normal and subsequent allergy testing for all potential allergens was negative. This case highlights that life-threatening reactions to perioperative PVB should not always be attributed to anaphylaxis; systemic toxicity could occur with an overdose.

TI  - Retrieval of Ocean Wave Heights From Spaceborne SAR in the Arctic Ocean With a Neural Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The twin Sentinel-1 (S1) satellites have been extensively acquiring synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in the Arctic, providing the unique opportunity to obtain ocean dynamic parameters with both high spatial resolution and wide swath coverage in the Arctic Ocean. In this study, we proposed a method for retrieving the ocean significant wave height (SWH) from S1 SAR data in horizontal-horizontal (HH) polarization based on a backpropagation neural network (BPNN). A total of 4,273 scenes from S1 extra-wide swath mode data acquired in the Arctic were collocated with data from four radar altimeters (RA), yielding 126,128 collocated data pairs. These data were separated into training and testing data sets to develop the BPNN model for retrieving SWH. Comparing the S1 retrieved SWH using the testing data set with the RA SWH yielded a bias of 0.17 m, a root-mean-square error of 0.71 m and a scatter index (SI) of 23.05% for SWH less than 10 m. The S1 retrieved SWH was further compared with the CFOSAT/SWIM data acquired in the Arctic between August 2019 and May 2020, which suggests that the SWIM has different performances on wave measurements at different beams.Plain Language Summary The rapid decline of sea ice in the Arctic creates wider marginal ice zone (a transit from open water to sea ice, MIZ) than ever. Some studies have suggested that interaction between ocean dynamics (e.g., sea surface wind and wave) and sea ice is one possible feedback to retreat of sea ice in the Arctic. Therefore, ocean wave data in the Arctic Ocean are highly desirable. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as an active remote sensing technique, can operate independent on sunlight and weather conditions and image the earth with high spatial resolution. However, due to the complicated imaging process of ocean waves by spaceborne SAR, retrieval of sea state parameters by SAR data has been investigated for decades. Here, we developed an algorithm based on a back propagation neural network to retrieve significant wave height from spaceborne SAR data. This provides a chance of obtaining wave height information in both large coverages and high spatial resolution from satellite observation, and therefore, can contribute to scientific study, offshore operation and shipping in the Arctic.

M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the prevalence and etiological characteristics of hand, foot and mouth disease(HFMD) in Yangzhou, so as to provide scientific basis for prevention and control of HFMD. HFMD cases from six sentinel hospitals in Yangzhou from January 2015 to December 2019 were taken as the subject of study. The epidemiological data of HFMD were analyzed by descriptive epidemiology method, the enterovirus were detected using RT-PCR method and the etiological characteristics were analyzed. The data were collected by Excel 2007 and statistically analyzed by SPSS22.0 software. A total of 1 151 positive cases were detected from all 2 129 HFMD clinical specimens collected in Yangzhou from 2015 to 2019, with a total positive rate of 54.06%, including 148 cases of EV71(6.95%), 382 cases of CA16(17.94%) and 621 cases of other enterovirus(29.17%). The difference of positive rate in different years(chi(2)=99.28, P<0.05), different months(chi(2)=92.09, P<0.05) and different districts(chi(2)=71.39, P<0.05)was statistically significant. Each subtype of enterovirus showed alternating prevalence in different years. The peak period of detection rate was from April to September (720 cases, 62.55%). The reported incidence for males was higher than females, with the male-female ratio of 1.58: 1 and children under six (971 cases, 84.36%) as the major attacked population. There were obvious seasonal, regional and population characteristics of HFMD in Yangzhou City from 2015 to 2019. It reminds us that surveillance of HFMD should be continually implemented, more attention should be paid to the prevention and control of key population in high-risk seasons, and the booming HFMD cases caused by other enterovirus should be emphasized especially.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE CHINESE MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background:This study assessed the perception of facial taperness in Taiwanese females among people with dental knowledge and laypersons. Additionally, this study also specified the criteria by which "square face" was defined regarding Taiwanese females' facial taperness.Methods:A series of digitally modified photos with different levels of facial taperness (Gonion to Gonion/Zygoma point to Zygoma point-Go-Go/Zy-Zy ratio ranges from 65% to 90%) were randomly arranged and presented to the raters. Visual analog scale (VAS) lines were used for scoring the photos on a scale of 0-100. The true or false question about "defining square face" was incorporated in the same questionnaire. The reliability of the true/false square face question and the esthetic evaluation by VAS were assayed. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to define the cutoff point on "square face." The effects on the raters' genders, orthodontic treatment experience, and their professional background on the perception of a square face were assayed.Results:The overall reliability of the raters was within the acceptable range. The VAS score evaluation revealed that the average expectation for best facial taperness was 75%, whereas the facial taperness of over 83% was considered as the square face. The facial taperness reaching to 90% was regarded as the most unattractive. Gender, therapy, and professional experience have no impact on the standard of square facial form evaluation.Conclusion:A face with a taperness greater than 83% was evaluated as a square face, and a face with a taperness around 75% was considered as the most attractive.

TI  - Extraction of Impervious Surface Using Sentinel-1A Time-Series Coherence Images with the Aid of a Sentinel-2A Image
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The continuous increasing of impervious surface (IS) hinders the sustainable development of cities. Using optical images alone to extract IS is usually limited by weather, which obliges us to develop new data sources. The obvious differences between natural and artificial targets in interferometric synthetic-aperture radar coherence images have attracted the attention of researchers. A few studies have attempted to use coherence images to extract IS-mostly single-temporal coherence images, which are affected by de-coherence factors. And due to speckle, the results are rather fragmented. In this study, we used time-series coherence images and introduced multi-resolution segmentation as a postprocessing step to extract IS. From our experiments, the results from the proposed method were more complete and achieved considerable accuracy, confirming the potential of time-series coherence images for extracting IS.

TI  - Derivation of high-quality three-dimensional surface deformation velocities through multi-source point cloud fusion: Application to Kilauea volcano
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Kilauea volcano, located in the southeast of Hawai'i, is one of the most active volcanoes in the world. Multi-source InSAR measurements acquired from ascending and descending high-resolution COSMO-SkyMed SAR imagery are used to monitor Kilauea volcano's deformations. In order to obtain identical observations from multi-source SAR data, the InSAR measurements acquired by different platforms are generally geocoded and resampled into a unified coordinate system. Such method is however inapplicable to the point clouds provided by high-resolution SAR data. In addition, the geocoding accuracy of high-resolution InSAR measurements would be greatly affected by external DEM error, orbit error, propagation delay, reference point parameter error. In this study, a method for estimating 3-D deformations on the basis of SAR point cloud fusion is proposed. Firstly, iterative closest point (ICP) method is introduced to fuse InSAR point clouds from ascending and descending COSMO-SkyMed datasets to reduce the influence of geocoding offsets. Then, the precise 3-D surface deformations of Kilauea volcano are obtained by employing the homogeneous weighted observations in the local space based on the strain model. The maximum deformation rates between April 2012 and April 2013 of Kilauea volcano are estimated as 32 mm/year and 42 mm/year in the east and up directions, respectively. The accuracies of the InSAR measurements are validated by the deformation rates obtained from the precise GNSS observations.

TI  - Cooling effect of mountain greenspace on urban heat island in Karst mountain city A case study of Anshun
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain greenspace is a typical type of urban green land landscape in Karst mountain cities , which plays a significant role in improving the urban ecological environment and promoting urban ecological service in Karst mountain cities. We analyzed the relationship between mountain greenspace and the distribution of cold points of urban heat island effect in Anshun City , a typical Karst mountain city in central Guizhou Province. We used cold/hot spot analysis and the thermal infrared remote sensing images and urban landscape structure spatial data in 2011 and 2016, based on the inversion analysis of urban heat island effect and the spatial temporal distribution characteristics of its intensity. We further revealed the cooling effect of mountain greenspace on urban heat island. The results showed that the average retrieved land surface temperature in Xixiu District of Anshun City increased by about 4 degrees C from 2011 to 2016, based on the results of Landsat thermal infrared remote sensing data inversion of surface temperature. The heat island effect in the main urban area showed an increasing trend, whereas the overall heat island area showed a decreasing trend. The green island area was mostly distributed in water and mountain greenspace. The mitigation effect of mountain greenspace on the heat island increased year by year. The cold/ hot aggregation area showed an increasing trend. About 40%-50% of the cold accumulation area was contributed by mountain greenspace. The hot aggregation area was mainly composed of construction land and other land-use types. The mountain greenspace area was significantly negatively correlated with the surface temperature at the 500-m grid scale, as indicated by the fact that surface temperature would decrease by 0.17-0.27 degrees C for every 10% increase in the proportion of mountain greenspace area in the grid. Our results provide a scientific basis for the mountain greenspace management, urban greenspace planning, and urban thermal environment mitigation in Karst mountain cities.

TI  - Fusion of GF and MODIS Data for Regional-Scale Grassland Community Classification with EVI2 Time-Series and Phenological Features
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-borne multispectral data are suitable for regional-scale grassland community classification owing to comprehensive coverage. However, the spectral similarity of different communities makes it challenging to distinguish them based on a single multispectral data. To address this issue, we proposed a support vector machine (SVM)-based method integrating multispectral data, two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) time-series, and phenological features extracted from Chinese GaoFen (GF)-1/6 satellite with (16 m) spatial and (2 d) temporal resolution. To obtain cloud-free images, the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) algorithm was employed in this study. By using the algorithm on the coarse cloudless images at the same or similar time as the fine images with cloud cover, the cloudless fine images were obtained, and the cloudless EVI2 time-series and phenological features were generated. The developed method was applied to identify grassland communities in Ordos, China. The results show that the Caragana pumila Pojark, Caragana davazamcii Sanchir and Salix schwerinii E. L. Wolf grassland, the Potaninia mongolica Maxim, Ammopiptanthus mongolicus S. H. Cheng and Tetraena mongolica Maxim grassland, the Caryopteris mongholica Bunge and Artemisia ordosica Krasch grassland, the Calligonum mongolicum Turcz grassland, and the Stipa breviflora Griseb and Stipa bungeana Trin grassland are distinguished with an overall accuracy of 87.25%. The results highlight that, compared to multispectral data only, the addition of EVI2 time-series and phenological features improves the classification accuracy by 9.63% and 14.7%, respectively, and even by 27.36% when these two features are combined together, and indicate the advantage of the fine images in this study, compared to 500 m moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, which are commonly used for grassland classification at regional scale, while using 16 m GF data suggests a 23.96% increase in classification accuracy with the same extracted features. This study indicates that the proposed method is suitable for regional-scale grassland community classification.

TI  - Saline-Soil Deformation Extraction Based on an Improved Time-Series InSAR Approach
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Significant seasonal fluctuations could occur in the regional scattering characteristics and surface deformation of saline soil, and cause decorrelation, which limits the application of the conventional time-series InSAR (TS-InSAR). For extending the saline-soil deformation monitoring capability, this paper presents an improved TS-InSAR approach, based on the interferometric coherence statistics and high-coherence interferogram refinement. By constructing a network of the refined interferograms, high-accuracy ground deformation can be extracted through the weighted least square estimation and the coherent target refinement. To extract the high-accuracy deformation of a representative saline soil area in the Qarhan Salt Lake, 119 C-band Sentinel-1A images collected between May 2015 and May 2020 are selected as the data source. Subsequently, 845 refined interferograms are selected from all possible interferograms to conduct the network inversion, based on the related thresholds (the temporal baseline <49 days, the average spatial coherences >0.5, respectively). Compared with the conventional TS-InSAR measurements, both the accuracy and reliability of the extracted deformation results of the saline soil increased dramatically. Furthermore, the testing results indicate that the improved TS-InSAR method has advantages on the deformation extraction in the saline soil region, and is adaptive to reflecting the typical seasonal variations of the saline soil.

AB  - In tropical/subtropical monsoon regions, accurate rice mapping is hampered by the following factors: (1) The frequent occurrence of clouds in such areas during the rice-growing season interferes strongly with optical remote sensing observations; (2) The agro-landscape in such regions is fragmented and scattered. Rice maps produced using low spatial resolution data cannot well delineate the detailed distribution of rice, while pixel-based mapping using medium and high resolutions has significant salt-and-pepper noise. (3) The cropping system is complex, and rice has a rotation schedule with other crops. Therefore, the Phenology-, Object- and Double Source-based (PODS) paddy rice mapping algorithm is implemented, which consists of three steps: (1) object extraction from multi-temporal 10-m Sentinel-2 images where the extracted objects (fields) are the basic classification units; (2) specifying the phenological stage of transplanting from Savitzky-Golay filtered enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series using the PhenoRice algorithm; and (3) the identification of rice objects based on flood signal detection from time-series microwave and optical signals of the Sentinel-1/2. This study evaluated the potential of the combined use of the Sentinel-1/2 mission on paddy rice mapping in monsoon regions with the Hangzhou-Jiaxin-Huzhou (HJH) plain in China as the case study. A cloud computing approach was used to process the available Sentinel-1/2 imagery from 2019 and MODIS images from 2018 to 2020 in the HJH plain on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. An accuracy assessment showed that the resultant object-based paddy rice map has a high accuracy with a producer (user) accuracy of 0.937 (0.926). The resultant 10-m paddy rice map is expected to provide unprecedented detail, spatial distribution, and landscape patterns for paddy rice fields in monsoon regions.

TI  - Spring Temperature and Snow Cover Climatology Drive the Advanced Springtime Phenology (1991-2014) in the European Alps
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Shifts in phenology are important traces of climate change affecting mountainous ecosystems. We present an analysis of changes in spring phenology using a suite of Earth observation based parameters, that is, start of season (SOS), snow cover extent and meteorological variables from 1991 up to 2012/2014 for the European Alps. Our results show that SOS tends to occur earlier throughout the Alps during this period and spring temperatures have increased in the Eastern Alps. Spring temperatures presented a predominant influence on SOS for both, grasslands and forests across elevations between 500 and 2,200 m asl, while this effect is particularly pronounced in the northeastern Alps. Snow cover duration and snow cover melting days showed secondary impact on SOS. Our research provides a comprehensive observation of spatiotemporal changes in alpine spring vegetation phenology and its driving factors. They improve our understanding of the sensitivity of the European Alps ecosystems to a changing climate.

TI  - Mapping leaf area index in a mixed temperate forest using Fenix airborne hyperspectral data and Gaussian processes regression
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Machine learning algorithms, in particular, kernel-based machine learning methods such as Gaussian processes regression (GPR) have shown to be promising alternatives to traditional empirical methods for retrieving vegetation parameters from remotely sensed data. However, the performance of GPR in predicting forest biophysical parameters has hardly been examined using full-spectrum airborne hyperspectral data. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the potential of GPR to estimate forest leaf area index (LAI) using airborne hyperspectral data. To achieve this, field measurements of LAI were collected in the Bavarian Forest National Park (BFNP), Germany, concurrent with the acquisition of the Fenix airborne hyperspectral images (400 2500 nm) in July 2017. The performance of GPR was further compared with three commonly used empirical methods (i.e., narrowband vegetation indices (VIs), partial least square regression (PLSR), and artificial neural network (ANN)). The cross-validated coefficient of determination (R-cv(2)) and root mean square error (RMSEcv) between the retrieved and field-measured LAI were used to examine the accuracy of the respective methods. Our results showed that using the entire spectral data (400 2500 nm), GPR yielded the most accurate LAI estimation (R-cv(2) = 0.67, RMSEcv = 0.53 m(2) m(-2)) compared to the best performing narrowband VIs SAVI2 (R-cv(2) = 0.54, RMSEcv = 0.63 m(2) m(-2)), PLSR (R-cv(2) = 0.74, RMSEcv = 0.73 m(2) m(-2)) and ANN (R-cv(2) = 0.68, RMSEcv = 0.54 m(2) m(-2)). Consequently, when a spectral subset obtained from the analysis of VIs was used as model input, the predictive accuracies were generally improved (GPR RMSEcv = 0.52 m(2) m(-2); ANN RMSEcv = 0.55 m(2) m(-2); PLSR RMSEcv = 0.69 m(2) m(-2)), indicating that extracting the most useful information from vast hyperspectral bands is crucial for improving model performance. In general, there was an agreement between measured and estimated LAI using different approaches (p > 0.05). The generated LAI map for BFNP using GPR and the spectral subset endorsed the LAI spatial distribution across the dominant forest classes (e.g., deciduous stands were generally associated with higher LAI values). The accompanying LAI uncertainty map generated by GPR shows that higher uncertainties were observed mainly in the regions with low LAI values (low vegetation cover) and forest areas which were not well represented in the collected sample plots. This study demonstrated the potential of GPR for estimating LAI in forest stands using airborne hyperspectral data. Owing to its capability to generate accurate predictions and associated uncertainty estimates, GPR is evaluated as a promising candidate for operational retrieval applications of vegetation traits.

TI  - Seasonal association between viral causes of hospitalised acute lower respiratory infections and meteorological factors in China: a retrospective study
T2  - LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) caused by respiratory viruses are common and persistent infectious diseases worldwide and in China, which have pronounced seasonal patterns. Meteorological factors have important roles in the seasonality of some major viruses, especially respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Our aim was to identify the dominant meteorological factors and to model their effects on common respiratory viruses in different regions of China.Methods We analysed monthly virus data on patients hospitalised with ALRI from 81 sentinel hospitals in 22 provinces in mainland China from Jan 1, 2009, to Sept 30, 2013. We considered seven common respiratory viruses: RSV, influenza virus, human parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, human bocavirus, and human coronavirus. Meteorological data of the same period were used to analyse relationships between virus seasonality and seven meteorological factors according to region (southern vs northern China). The geographical detector method was used to quantify the explanatory power of each meteorological factor, individually and interacting in pairs, on the respiratory viruses.Findings 28 369 hospitalised patients with ALRI were tested, 10 387 (36.6%) of whom were positive for at least one virus, including RSV (4091 [32.0%] patients), influenza virus (2665 [20.8%]), human parainfluenza virus (2185 [17.1%]), adenovirus (1478 [11.6%]), human bocavirus (1120 [8.8%]), human coronavirus (637 [5.0%]), and human metapneumovirus (615 [4.8%]). RSV and influenza virus had annual peaks in the north and biannual peaks in the south. Human parainfluenza virus and human bocavirus had higher positive rates in the spring-summer months. Human metapneumovirus had an annual peak in winter-spring, especially in the north. Adenovirus and human coronavirus exhibited no clear annual seasonality. Temperature, atmospheric pressure, vapour pressure, and rainfall had most explanatory power on most respiratory viruses in each region. Relative humidity was only dominant in the north, but had no significant explanatory power for most viruses in the south. Hours of sunlight had significant explanatory power for RSV and influenza virus in the north, and for most viruses in the south. Wind speed was the only factor with significant explanatory power for human coronavirus in the south. For all viruses, interactions between any two of the paired factors resulted in enhanced explanatory power, either bivariately or non-linearly.Interpretation Spatiotemporal heterogeneity was detected for most viruses in this study, and interactions between pairs of meteorological factors were found to enhance their influence on virus variation. These findings might be helpful to guide government planning, such as public health interventions, infection control practice, and timing of passive immunoprophylaxis, and might facilitate the development of future vaccine strategies.Funding National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Ministry of Science and Technology of China, and the Technology Major Project of China.

TI  - <i>NDVI</i> dynamics and driving climatic factors in the Protected Zones for Ecological Functions in China
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims This study demonstrates the consistencies and discrepancies of correlations between climate factors and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the Protected Zones for Ecological Functions (EFPZs) in China, which provide useful information for monitoring in subsequent studies of vegetation dynamics.Methods Based on the MODIS NDVI data and the grid data for monthly precipitation and air temperatures from 2000 to 2015, the dynamics of NDVI and correlations with climatic factors were examined across 46 EFPZs at two spatial scales, by individual EFPZs and the pixels, using linear tendency and partial correlation methods. In accordance to the analyses, the EFPZs were categorized into different types of climatic influences.Important findings The overall NDVI across the EFPZs showed an increasing trend, with the average linear slope of 0.045.a-II. Pixel scale analysis showed that NDVI increased significantly in the central regions and the northeast of China. Partial correlation coefficients between NDVI and precipitation in the EFPZs varied between -0.30 to 0.72, and were positive for 32 in the EFPZs. Partial correlation between NDVI and air temperature ranged from -0.36 to 0.92, with positive correlations in 39 in the EFPZs. In 50.6% of the pixels, NDVI was positively correlated with precipitation, mainly in northeast and northwest China. In 64.6% of the pixels, NDVI was positively correlated with air temperatures, mainly in the northeastern and the northern edge of the Qingzang Plateau. Strong temperature-precipitation driving is the main type of climatic influences on NDVI changes across the EFPZs, accounting for 38.7% of the total, with temperature driving type being secondary, accounting for 27.3%; non-climatic driving type accounts for 17.6%. Our results show the NDVI in the EFPZs are significantly correlated with climatic factors concerning precipitation and air temperatures, and that NDVI dynamics in 82.4% of the areas are driven by climate factors. Studying the changes in NDVI and the responses of NDVI to climate factors is very important for understanding the dynamics of vegetation in the EFPZs under climate warming.

TI  - Exploring the Variation Trend of Urban Expansion, Land Surface Temperature, and Ecological Quality and Their Interrelationships in Guangzhou, China, from 1987 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study explored the model of urban impervious surface (IS) density, land surface temperature (LST), and comprehensive ecological evaluation index (CEEI) from urban centers to suburbs. The interrelationships between these parameters in Guangzhou from 1987 to 2019 were analyzed using time-series Landsat-5 TM (Thematic Mapper), Landsat-8 OLI (Operational Land Imager), and TIRS (Thermal Infrared Sensor) images. The urban IS densities were calculated in concentric rings using time-series IS fractions, which were used to construct an inverse S-shaped urban IS density function to depict changes in urban form and the spatio-temporal dynamics of urban expansion from the urban center to the suburbs. The results indicated that Guangzhou experienced expansive urban growth, with the patterns of urban spatial structure changing from a single-center to a multi-center structure over the past 32 years. Next, the normalized LST and CEEI in each concentric ring were calculated, and their variation trends from the urban center to the suburbs were modeled using linear and nonlinear functions, respectively. The results showed that the normalized LST had a gradual decreasing trend from the urban center to the suburbs, while the CEEI showed a significant increasing trend. During the 32-year rapid urban development, the normalized LST difference between the urban center and suburbs increased gradually with time, and the CEEI significantly decreased. This indicated that rapid urbanization significantly expanded the impervious surface areas in Guangzhou, leading to an increase in the LST difference between urban centers and suburbs and a deterioration in ecological quality. Finally, the potential interrelationships among urban IS density, normalized LST, and CEEI were also explored using different models. This study revealed that rapid urbanization has produced geographical convergence between several ISs, which may increase the risk of the urban heat island effect and degradation of ecological quality.

TI  - Mapping Rural Settlements from Landsat and Sentinel Time Series by Integrating Pixel- and Object-Based Methods
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Rural settlements account for 45% of the world's population and are targeted places for poverty eradication. However, compared to urban footprints, the distribution of rural settlements is not well characterized in most existing land use and land cover maps because of their patchy and scattered organization and relative stability over time. In this study, we proposed a pixel- and object-based method to map rural settlements by employing spectral-texture-temporal information from Landsat and Sentinel time series. Spectral indices (maximum normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and minimum normalized difference built-up index (NDBI composite) and texture indices (vertical transmit and vertical receive (VV) polarization of mean synthetic aperture radar (SAR) composite) were calculated from all available Landsat and Sentinel-1A data from 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018. These features were then stacked for segmentation to extract potential rural settlement objects. To better differentiate settlements from bare soil, the gradient of annual NDVI maximum (namely, gradient of change, use gradient for simplicity) from 1 January 1987 to 31 December 2018 was used. The rural training samples were selected from global urban footprint (GUF) products with a post filtering process to remove sample noise. Scatter plots between pixel- and object-based values per feature were delineated by t-distribution ellipses to determine the thresholds. Finally, pixel- and object-based thresholds were applied to four features (NDVI, NDBI, VV, gradient) in Google Earth Engine (GEE) to obtain the distribution of rural settlements in eight selected Asian regions. The derived maps of rural settlements showed consistent accuracy, with a producer's accuracy (PA) of 0.87, user's accuracy (UA) of 0.93 and overall accuracy (OA) reaching 90% in different landscape conditions, which are better than existing land cover products.

TI  - Spatial Downscaling of Land Surface Temperature Based on a Multi-Factor Geographically Weighted Machine Learning Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter of surface energy fluxes and has become the focus of numerous studies. LST downscaling is an effective technique for supplementing the limitations of the coarse-resolution LST data. However, the relationship between LST and other land surface parameters tends to be nonlinear and spatially nonstationary, due to spatial heterogeneity. Nonlinearity and spatial nonstationarity have not been considered simultaneously in previous studies. To address this issue, we propose a multi-factor geographically weighted machine learning (MFGWML) algorithm. MFGWML utilizes three excellent machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and Bayesian ridge regression (BRR), as base learners to capture the nonlinear relationships. MFGWML uses geographically weighted regression (GWR), which allows for spatial nonstationarity, to fuse the three base learners' predictions. This paper downscales the 30 m LST data retrieved from Landsat 8 images to 10 m LST data mainly based on Sentinel-2A images. The results show that MFGWML outperforms two classic algorithms, namely thermal image sharpening (TsHARP) and the high-resolution urban thermal sharpener (HUTS). We conclude that MFGWML combines the advantages of multiple regression, ML, and GWR, to capture the local heterogeneity and obtain reliable and robust downscaled LST data.

TI  - Long-Term Changes in the Unique and Largest Seagrass Meadows in the Bohai Sea (China) Using Satellite (1974-2019) and Sonar Data: Implication for Conservation and Restoration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seagrass meadows play critical roles in supporting a high level of biodiversity but are continuously threatened by human activities, such as sea reclamation. In this study, we reported on a large seagrass (Zostera marina L.) meadow in Caofeidian shoal harbor in the Bohai Sea of northern China. We evaluated the environmental impact of sea reclamation activities using Landsat imagery (1974-2019) by mapping seagrass meadow distribution changes. ISODATA was adopted for the unsupervised classification and mapping of seagrass beds. The error matrix developed using the in situ data obtained from acoustic surveys for Landsat 8OLI image classification was 87.20% accurate. The maps showed rapidly increasing changes in seagrass meadows as the amount of reclaimed land increased. Some seagrass meadows experienced large-scale changes, and sea reclamation has been suggested as the main factor responsible for habitat loss, which results from physical damage, excessive sedimentation, and increased turbidity caused by reclamation. In addition, habitat degradation may have resulted from three storm surges induced by typhoons in 1992-1998. Fortunately, land reclamation, forming an artificial "longshore bar", buffers seagrass meadows from wave actions, providing relatively sheltered conditions, which has allowed a large habitat increase since 2012. These were the largest eelgrass meadows (3,217.32 ha), with a peripheral area of similar to 100 km(2), in the Bohai Sea of northern China in 2019. However, the existing largest eelgrass beds in China are threatened by trawling, clam harvesting (especially clam sucking), channel dredging, and culture pond construction. Our work will help coastal managers monitor the environmental impacts of reclamation activities on seagrass meadows on a large spatio-temporal scale and will also provide information for seagrass restoration using artificial "longshore bars".

TI  - Contemporary Urban Expansion in the First Fastest Growing Metropolitan Region of China: A Multicity Study in the Pearl River Delta Urban Agglomeration from 1980 to 2015
T2  - URBAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Contemporary urbanization in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) Urban Agglomeration is the epitome of China's urbanization process as the PRD is the first fastest growing metropolitan region of China. Here, we mapped and quantified the spatiotemporal dynamics of urban expansion for seven major cities in the PRD between 1980 and 2015, using remotely sensed data integrated with landscape metrics, urban growth form, and rank clocks. Results showed that rapid land urbanization occurred in all the seven cities since the execution of reform and opening up, with the annual increase rate ranging from 8.1% to 11.3% among cities, suggesting a relatively equal level of urbanization within the PRD. Socioeconomic drivers underlying urban expansion in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Zhuhai can be characterized as "top-down" mechanisms led by the municipal government, while those in Foshan, Jiangmen, Dongguan, and Zhongshan are "bottom-up" ones from low-level administrative organizations. The trajectory of urban expansion in Shenzhen conformed to the diffusion-coalescence urban growth hypothesis in terms of temporal evolution of landscape metrics and urban growth types. This is related to the fact that Shenzhen, the first special economic zone established by the Chinese government, was the first mover of urbanization in China and functioned under the umbrella of a robust socialist market economy relative to a highly centralized planned economy for other cities. The changes of Shenzhen in rank order in terms of both urban population and urbanization area were the largest, exemplifying its evolution from a small fishing village to a metropolis. Furthermore, we found that moving up in the rank order in terms of land use efficiency of wealth creation over time for all cities was accompanied with rank clocking up of population per area (crowd). How to balance trade-offs between the benefits and costs of urbanization is the challenge faced by the urban agglomeration.

TI  - A new land surface temperature fusion strategy based on cumulative distribution function matching and multiresolution Kalman filtering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusing high-level passive microwave (PMW) LST and thermal infrared (TIR) LST products is a promising means of generating high-quality, all-weather land surface temperature (LST) data. In this paper, we propose a new fusion strategy for generating high-quality, all-weather LST data based on cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching and multiresolution Kalman filtering (MKF). CDF matching was employed to improve the quality of the high-resolution (0.01 degrees) LST data downscaled with the retrieved coarse-resolution (0.1 degrees) PMW LST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) brightness temperature (BT) data set. The MKF approach was employed to produce high-quality, all-weather LST data by fusing the retrieved coarse-resolution AMSR2 LST and high-resolution Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data sets filled with CDFimproved LST data. The spatial patterns in the high-resolution and coarse-resolution LST data were consistent after MKF fusion. The accuracy of coarse-resolution LST data was considerably improved. The biases, root mean square errors (RMSEs) and determination coefficients (R-2) were 0.79-1.47 K, 3.0-3.82 K, 0.88-0.96, respectively. The RMSE of the fused coarse-resolution LST data decreased by 1.51 K/1.82 K and 1.81 K/1.39 K in daytime/nighttime in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and Heihe River Basin (HRB) verification regions compared to the RMSE of the retrieved AMSR2 LST data. The accuracy of high-resolution LST data remained unchanged, but the spatial coverage was complete with exceptions at the orbital gaps. The bias, RMSE and R-2 values of high-resolution LST data were - 0.91- -0.81 K, 3.02-3.32 K, and 0.93-0.97 under all-sky conditions in the TP and HRB verification regions, respectively. Compared to methods in the existing LST fusion studies, the proposed strategy has advantages in terms of LST data quality and validation accuracy. When both coarse-resolution and high-resolution LST data are missing, the spatial coverages of fused all-weather LST data are incomplete. We attempted to fill the vacancies in PMW LST data with the DINEOF method in advance and subsequently obtained spatially complete all-weather LST data.

TI  - Construction of landscape ecological network based on landscape ecological risk assessment in a large-scale opencast coal mine area
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The comprehensive effect of multi-source factors changes the landscape structure and reduces the quality of landscape ecology in large-scale opencast coal mine area, resulting in an ecologically fragile environment. Landscape ecological quality directly affects the flow and transmission of ecological functions, which is an important factor in the construction of landscape ecological network. In the study, based on the Landsat remote sensing images of 1986, 1996, 2000, 2009, and 2015 in the Pingshuo opencast coal mine area of the Loess plateau in Shanxi Province of China, the landscape loss index and ecological sensitivity index were selected to establish the landscape ecological risk assessment model, and the spatial and temporal characteristics of the landscape ecological risks from 1986 to 2015 were analyzed. Considering the impact of landscape ecological quality on ecological resistance, the Minimum Cumulative Resistance model (MCR) was applied to build a landscape ecological network based on the landscape ecological risk assessment in 2015 to identify the important ecological elements, and the complex network method was used to analyze the structure of landscape ecological network. The local risk level of the study area reduced with opencast coal mining; however, the overall risk level was improved with conducting land reclamation. The high-risk area showed a trend of spreading from southwest to northeast; the risk of the peripheral areas of urban construction land and mining land was relatively high, while that of the forest and grassland area was relatively low. The risk change of the study area was mainly affected by the mining scale, urban expansion, conversion of farm land to forest and grassland, land reclamation, and village relocation. Through the complex network method, the energy flow fluency and the relationship between nodes were enhanced after the optimization of the landscape ecological network, and the ecological elements for specific land use protection were identified. The research results can provide scientific basis for the optimization of landscape pattern and the construction of ecological security pattern in Pingshuo opencast coal mine area.

TI  - A Watershed-Segmentation-Based Improved Algorithm for Extracting Cultivated Land Boundaries
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - To accurately extract cultivated land boundaries based on high-resolution remote sensing imagery, an improved watershed segmentation algorithm was proposed herein based on a combination of pre- and post-improvement procedures. Image contrast enhancement was used as the pre-improvement, while the color distance of the Commission Internationale de l ' Eclairage (CIE) color space, including the Lab and Luv, was used as the regional similarity measure for region merging as the post-improvement. Furthermore, the area relative error criterion (delta(A)), the pixel quantity error criterion (delta(P)), and the consistency criterion (K-hat) were used for evaluating the image segmentation accuracy. The region merging in Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color space was selected to compare the proposed algorithm by extracting cultivated land boundaries. The validation experiments were performed using a subset of Chinese Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing image with a coverage area of 0.12 km(2). The results showed the following: (1) The contrast-enhanced image exhibited an obvious gain in terms of improving the image segmentation effect and time efficiency using the improved algorithm. The time efficiency increased by 10.31%, 60.00%, and 40.28%, respectively, in the RGB, Lab, and Luv color spaces. (2) The optimal segmentation and merging scale parameters in the RGB, Lab, and Luv color spaces were C for minimum areas of 2000, 1900, and 2000, and D for a color difference of 1000, 40, and 40. (3) The algorithm improved the time efficiency of cultivated land boundary extraction in the Lab and Luv color spaces by 35.16% and 29.58%, respectively, compared to the RGB color space. The extraction accuracy was compared to the RGB color space using the delta(A), delta(P), and K-hat, that were improved by 76.92%, 62.01%, and 16.83%, respectively, in the Lab color space, while they were 55.79%, 49.67%, and 13.42% in the Luv color space. (4) Through the visual comparison, time efficiency, and segmentation accuracy, the comprehensive extraction effect using the proposed algorithm was obviously better than that of RGB color-based space algorithm. The established accuracy evaluation indicators were also proven to be consistent with the visual evaluation. (5) The proposed method has a satisfying transferability by a wider test area with a coverage area of 1 km(2). In addition, the proposed method, based on the image contrast enhancement, was to perform the region merging in the CIE color space according to the simulated immersion watershed segmentation results. It is a useful attempt for the watershed segmentation algorithm to extract cultivated land boundaries, which provides a reference for enhancing the watershed algorithm.

AB  - A 62-year-old woman was presented with blood stained nipple discharge for many years. Mammograms and ultrasound study revealed a prominent left nipple, increase in nipple vascularity and nipple calcifications. Ductogram revealed an obstruction at the proximal part of the discharging duct. Surgical excision of the nipple demonstrated encapsulated papillary carcinoma. The excision margins appeared to be clear, but tumor tissue was found within 1 mm from the deep margin. Ultra-filtered sulfur colloid sentinel node examination was negative. Thus, simple left mastectomy was performed. The specimen was confirmed as ductal carcinoma in situ of the left breast.

TI  - The Challenge of the Urban Compact Form: Three-Dimensional Index Construction and Urban Land Surface Temperature Impacts
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are growing higher and denser, and understanding and constructing the compact city form is of great importance to optimize sustainable urbanization. The two-dimensional (2D) urban compact form has been widely studied by previous researchers, while the driving mechanism of three-dimensional (3D) compact morphology, which reflects the reality of the urban environment has seldom been developed. In this study, land surface temperature (LST) was retrieved by using the mono-window algorithm method based on Landsat 8 images of Xiamen in South China, which were acquired respectively on 14 April, 15 August, 2 October, and 21 December in 2017, and 11 March in 2018. We then aimed to explore the driving mechanism of the 3D compact form on the urban heat environment (UHE) based on our developed 3D Compactness Index (VCI) and remote sensing, as well as Geo-Detector techniques. The results show that the 3D compact form can positively effect UHE better than individual urban form construction elements, as can the combination of the 2D compact form with building height. Individually, building density had a greater effect on UHE than that of building height. At the same time, an integration of building density and height showed an enhanced inter-effect on UHE. Moreover, we explore the temporal and spatial UHE heterogeneity with regards to 3D compact form across different seasons. We also investigate the UHE impacts discrepancy caused by different 3D compactness categories. This shows that increasing the 3D compactness of an urban community from 0.016 to 0.323 would increase the heat accumulation, which was, in terms of satellite derived LST, by 1.35 degrees C, suggesting that higher compact forms strengthen UHE. This study highlights the challenge of the urban 3D compact form in respect of its UHE impact. The related evaluation in this study would help shed light on urban form optimization.

TI  - Using High Resolution Images from UAV and Satellite Remote Sensing for Best Management Practice Analyses
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Best Management Practices (BMPs) are commonly adopted to ameliorate the quality of runoff and reduce the frequency and intensity of flash floods in urban areas. To date, many of the BMP studies are conducted using coarse resolution data. However, the accuracy of such studies may be compromised due to the shortcomings inherent in the input data; as such, the evaluation of the BMP cost-effectiveness may not be accurate. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the improvements of higher resolution images over coarse resolution data in BMP analyses. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) was used to collect a more detailed and accurate picture of the digital surface model and digital elevation model. Landsat 8 multi-spectral imagery was classified by object-oriented classification to generate a land use/land cover map. The method used in this study provided more detailed and accurate information of the physical conditions of the study area, an improved subwatershed delineation, a more comprehensive list of the suitable locations for BMPs, and a more reliable estimate of the cost-effectiveness of the BMP ensembles than that generated using coarse resolution data. Using the fine resolution data, this study further determined the utility of the selected BMP ensembles under a changed future climate regime and identified the best BMP and BMP ensemble in reducing urban surface runoff. This method can be especially useful in areas without quality topography and land use data.

TI  - A single-center, self-controlled, phase I clinical trial of mitoxantrone hydrochloride injection for lymph tracing for sentinel lymph node identification of breast cancer
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mitoxantrone hydrochloride injection for lymph tracing (MHI) is a novel lymphatic tracer for sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients with early breast cancer but exhibited remarkable liver, kidney, and hematologic toxicities in previous studies. Here, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics profiles of MHI were evaluated to surmise safety and tolerability.Methods: Phase 1 open-label, single center, and dose escalation study was performed. Ten patients with invasive breast cancer received 0.5, 1.0, or 2.0 mL of MHI into the breast tissues surrounding the tumor for lymphatic mapping. All of these patients were injected with 2 mCi nuclide-labeled sulfur colloid as a self-control 24 to 48 hours before surgery. Safety was assessed by the incidence of adverse events graded by the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria, version 4.0.3 (CTCAE4.0.3). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analyses were collected before and after administration at 15, 30, 60, 120, and 240 min of the injection of MHI.Results: Up to the cutoff date of the study (Aug 8, 2018), no dose-limiting toxic effects or obvious allergic reactions were observed. Only one case of an adverse event was certainly related to MHI, where it caused blue discoloration of the local skin over the injection site after the operation, but this stain gradually went away. The peak level of MHI was achieved after 15-30 min post injection and completely eliminated from the plasma after 60 min. There were no significant differences in the number of lymph nodes detected by MHI and radioactive colloid. Only one patient with lymph node macrometastases had no SLN detected by either the radioactive colloid or the MHI.Conclusions: At a dose of up to 2.0 mL, MHI was well tolerated and safe for conducting SLN biopsies in patients with breast cancer. Although there was a case with blue discoloration of the local skin over the injection site after the operation, and remained for a short period of time, but the overall safety was acceptable. Here, we approached a novel SLN tracing slant; however, more investigations of MHI should be performed for further evaluations.

TI  - Tropospheric NO<sub>2</sub> Pollution Monitoring with the GF-5 Satellite Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument over the North China Plain during Winter 2018-2019
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) is a high-spectral-resolution payload onboard the latest pathfinder mission GaoFen-5, designed specifically for the monitoring of global atmospheric trace gas compositions and trends. This study describes a comparative analysis of the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) columns over the North China Plain (NCP) from November 2018 to April 2019 based on EMI products. Validation of satellite products based on a cross-correlation analysis with data from four ground-based multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy sites provided good correlation coefficients (r) ranging from 0.78 to 0.88. The distribution and monthly averaged tropospheric NO2 columns revealed high pollution exposure levels during winter (November-January) and a decrease from February onward in the NCP. Moreover, a typical pollution event was analyzed in detail in combination with wind field statistics. The results indicated that variations of NO2 concentrations in Beijing and Tianjin were highly correlated with the wind direction from 22.5-45.0 degrees west of south, especially during times of high NO2 amounts. These findings highlight that the EMI payload on the GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite is useful for remote sensing of regional and global NO2 detection.

TI  - Availability analysis of GNSS signals above GNSSs constellation
T2  - JOURNAL OF NAVIGATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of many problems associated with the availability of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals in high-altitude space, this paper presents a comprehensive and systematic analysis. First, the coverage and strength characteristics of GNSS signals in high-altitude space (i.e., space above the GNSS constellation) are presented, and the visibility of GNSS signals is evaluated by combining these two factors. Second, the geometric configuration and geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) of visible GNSS satellites are analysed. Then, the Doppler shift range of the GNSS signals is deduced based on the dynamic performance of high-altitude spacecraft. Finally, taking GaoFen-4 (GF-4) as the application object, the availability of GNSS signals is simulated and evaluated. GNSS signals in high-altitude space are generally weak, and the visible GNSS satellites are concentrated in the high-elevation range. The combination of main and side lobe signals and compatibility of multiple constellations can increase the number of visible satellites, improve the geometry configuration, reduce GDOP, and thus improve the availability of GNSS signals. The results of this research can provide technical support for the design and development of GNSS receivers suitable for high-altitude space.

TI  - Temporal variation in the diet of Yangtze finless porpoise calls for conservation of semi-migratory fish
T2  - FRESHWATER BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying the feeding patterns of large-bodied predators is necessary to predict their potential effects on food-web dynamics and to inform species conservation. In contrast to diet information from stomach contents, diet estimates obtained using stable isotopes in blood and muscle can reveal temporal variation in diets.Here, we used an extensive stable isotope dataset and Bayesian stable isotope mixing model to evaluate the trophic role of the Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena asiaeorientalis asiaeorientalis), a critically endangered species distributed in the middle and lower catchments of the Yangtze River. We analysed blood samples from 24 individuals captured during March 2017 in Poyang Lake (which adjoins the Yangtze River), and muscle samples from 8 individuals stranded in the lake over a 1-year period (2012-2013). We additionally genotyped prey from faecal samples taken from 13 individuals captured in March 2017.We found that as a generalist apex predator, this finless porpoise consumes semi-migratory and non-migratory fish prey. However, relative proportions of these two prey resources were different between dietary analyses based on blood samples compared to muscle samples, reflecting recent and longer-term consumption patterns, respectively.Non-migratory fish contributed mainly to the diet of predators in the early and middle of March. In contrast, semi-migratory fish comprised the majority of the prey composition over a more extended period (e.g. 2-3 months), and the difference may be linked to changes in the fish abundance influenced by seasonal factors.Our findings provide insights into the trophic role of this critically imperilled but little studied species, demonstrate how stable isotope analyses can elucidate finless porpoise feeding ecology, and emphasise the importance of semi-migratory fish to conserving this porpoise population.

TI  - Advanced Dual-Satellite Method for Detection of Low Stratus and Fog near Japan at Dawn from FY-4A and Himawari-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection of low stratus and fog (LSF) at dawn remains limited because of their optical features and weak solar radiation. LSF could be better identified by simultaneous observations of two geostationary satellites from different viewing angles. The present study developed an advanced dual-satellite method (DSM) using FY-4A and Himawari-8 for LSF detection at dawn in terms of probability indices. Optimal thresholds for identifying the LSF from the spectral tests in DSM were determined by the comparison with ground observations of fog and clear sky in/around Japan between April to November of 2018. Then the validation of these thresholds was carried out for the same months of 2019. The DSM essentially used two traditional single-satellite tests for daytime such as the 0.65-mu m reflectance (R-0.65), and the brightness temperature difference between 3.7 mu m and 11 mu m (BTD3.7-11); in addition to four more tests such as Himawari-8 R-0.65 and BTD13.5-8.5, the dual-satellite stereoscopic difference in BTD3.7-11 (Delta BTD3.7-11), and that in the Normalized Difference Snow Index (Delta NDSI). The four were found to show very high skill scores (POD: 0.82 +/- 0.04; FAR, 0.10 +/- 0.04). The radiative transfer simulation supported optical characteristics of LSF in observations. The LSF probability indices (average POD: 0.83, FAR: 0.10) were constructed by a statistical combination of the four to derive the five-class probability values of LSF occurrence in a grid. The indices provided more details and useful results in LSF spatial distribution, compared to the single satellite observations (i.e., R-0.65 and/or BTD3.7-11) of either LSF or no LSF. The present DSM could apply for remote sensing of environmental phenomena if the stereoscopic viewing angle between two satellites is appropriate.

TI  - High-Resolution Rice Mapping Based on SNIC Segmentation and Multi-Source Remote Sensing Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution crop mapping is of great significance in agricultural monitoring, precision agriculture, and providing critical information for crop yield or disaster monitoring. Meanwhile, medium resolution time-series optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images can provide useful phenological information. Combining high-resolution satellite data and medium resolution time-series images provides a great opportunity for fine crop mapping. Simple Non-Iterative Clustering (SNIC) is a state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithm that shows the advantages of efficiency and high accuracy. However, the application of SNIC in crop mapping based on the combination of high-resolution and medium-resolution images is unknown. Besides, there is still little research on the influence of the superpixel size (one of the key user-defined parameters of the SNIC method) on classification accuracy. In this study, we employed a 2 m high-resolution GF-1 pan-sharpened image and 10 m medium resolution time-series Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar Instrument (C-SAR) and Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) images to carry out rice mapping based on the SNIC method. The results show that with the increase of the superpixel size, the classification accuracy increased at first and then decreased rapidly after reaching the summit when the superpixel size is 27. The classification accuracy of the combined use of optical and SAR data is higher than that using only Sentinel-2 MSI or Sentinel-1 C-SAR vertical transmitted and vertical received (VV) or vertical transmitted and horizontal received (VH) data, with overall accuracies of 0.8335, 0.8282, 0.7862, and 0.7886, respectively. Meanwhile, the results also indicate that classification based on superpixels obtained by SNIC significantly outperforms classification based on original pixels. The overall accuracy, producer accuracy, and user accuracy of SNIC superpixel-based classification increased by 9.14%, 17.16%, 27.35% and 1.36%, respectively, when compared with the pixel-based classification, based on the combination of optical and SAR data (using the random forest as the classifier). The results show that SNIC superpixel segmentation is a feasible method for high-resolution crop mapping based on multi-source remote sensing data. The automatic selection of the optimal superpixel size of SNIC will be focused on in future research.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration by coupling Bayesian model averaging methods with machine learning algorithms
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important components of global hydrologic cycle and has significant impacts on energy exchange and climate change. Numerous models have been developed to estimate ET so far; however, great uncertainties in models still require considerations. The aim of this study is to reduce model errors and uncertainties among multi-models to improve daily ET estimate. The Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method is used to assemble eight ET models to produce ET with Landsat 8 satellite data, including four surface energy balance models (i.e., SEBS, SEBAL, SEBI, and SSEB) and four machine learning algorithms (i.e., polymars, random forest, ridge regression, and support vector machine). Performances of each model and BMA method were validated through in situ measurements of semi-arid region. Results indicated that the BMA method outperformed all eight single models. The four most important models obtained by the BMA method were ranked by random forest, SVM, SEBS, and SEBAL. The BMA method coupled with machine learning can significantly improve the accuracy of daily ET estimate, reducing uncertainties among models, and taking different intrinsic benefits of empirically and physically based models to obtain a more reliable ET estimate.

TI  - Functions of Dendritic Cells and Its Association with Intestinal Diseases
T2  - CELLS
M3  - Review
AB  - Dendritic cells (DCs), including conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), serve as the sentinel cells of the immune system and are responsible for presenting antigen information. Moreover, the role of DCs derived from monocytes (moDCs) in the development of inflammation has been emphasized. Several studies have shown that the function of DCs can be influenced by gut microbes including gut bacteria and viruses. Abnormal changes/reactions in intestinal DCs are potentially associated with diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and intestinal tumors, allowing DCs to be a new target for the treatment of these diseases. In this review, we summarized the physiological functions of DCs in the intestinal micro-environment, their regulatory relationship with intestinal microorganisms and their regulatory mechanism in intestinal diseases.

TI  - Revisit of a Case Study of Spilled Oil Slicks Caused by the Sanchi Accident (2018) in the East China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Marine oil spills occur suddenly and pose a serious threat to ecosystems in coastal waters. Oil spills continuously affect the ocean environment for years. In this study, the oil spill caused by the accident of the Sanchi ship (2018) in the East China Sea was hindcast simulated using the oil particle-tracing method. Sea-surface winds from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), currents simulated from the Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model (FVCOM), and waves simulated from the Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) were employed as background marine dynamics fields. In particular, the oil spill simulation was compared with the detection from Chinese Gaofen-3 (GF-3) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The validation of the SWAN-simulated significant wave height (SWH) against measurements from the Jason-2 altimeter showed a 0.58 m root mean square error (RMSE) with a 0.93 correlation (COR). Further, the sea-surface current was compared with that from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Climate Forecast System Version 2 (CFSv2), yielding a 0.08 m/s RMSE and a 0.71 COR. Under these circumstances, we think the model-simulated sea-surface currents and waves are reliable for this work. A hindcast simulation of the tracks of oil slicks spilled from the Sanchi shipwreck was conducted during the period of 14-17 January 2018. It was found that the general track of the simulated oil slicks was consistent with the observations from the collected GF-3 SAR images. However, the details from the GF-3 SAR images were more obvious. The spatial coverage of oil slicks between the SAR-detected and simulated results was about 1 km(2). In summary, we conclude that combining numerical simulation and SAR remote sensing is a promising technique for real-time oil spill monitoring and the prediction of oil spreading.

TI  - The 2020 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 6.0 Jiashi Earthquake: A Fold Earthquake Event in the Southern Tian Shan, Northwest China
T2  - SEISMOLOGICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The complexity of the coseismic rupture process of active thrust faults and the limitation of the 3D geometry of the fault plane play important roles in seismic risk assessment. The 2020 M-w 6.0 Jiashi earthquake is an example of seismic events that have occurred in the Kepingtage fold-and-thrust belt (FTB) in the southern Tian Shan belt. Integrated analysis of surface geology, topography, and seismic reflection profiles has delineated the surface and subsurface geometries of the Keping thrust fault (KPT). Combined with the focal mechanism, seismic reflection profiles, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar coseismic deformation, we are able to reveal the seismogenic structure of this earthquake. The Jiashi event was mainly a horizontal compression deformation; the sliding distribution was concentrated at a depth of 4-6 km, and the fault-slip angle was similar to 15 degrees. Our results show that the seismogenic structure of the Jiashi event was the KPT at the leading edge of the Kepingtage FTB. The fault plane is separated at depth by a horizontal detachment, with an upper (similar to 30 degrees) and lower (similar to 15 degrees) ramp. The coseismic rupture of the Jiashi event was constrained within the lower ramp. This event is a good example that readily explains why the Kepingtage FTB is characterized by moderate-magnitude (M-w 6.0-6.5) events.

TI  - Simplified Priestley-Taylor Model to Estimate Land-Surface Latent Heat of Evapotranspiration from Incident Shortwave Radiation, Satellite Vegetation Index, and Air Relative Humidity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An operational and accurate model for estimating global or regional terrestrial latent heat of evapotranspiration (ET) across different land-cover types from satellite data is crucial. Here, a simplified Priestley-Taylor (SPT) model was developed without surface net radiation (Rn) by combining incident shortwave radiation (Rs), satellite vegetation index, and air relative humidity (RH). Ground-measured ET for 2000-2009 collected by 100 global FLUXNET eddy covariance (EC) sites was used to calibrate and evaluate the SPT model. A series of cross-validations demonstrated the reasonable performance of the SPT model to estimate seasonal and spatial ET variability. The coefficients of determination (R-2) of the estimated versus observed daily (monthly) ET ranged from 0.42 (0.58) (p < 0.01) at shrubland (SHR) flux sites to 0.81 (0.86) (p < 0.01) at evergreen broadleaf forest (EBF) flux sites. The SPT model was applied to estimate agricultural ET at high spatial resolution (16 m) from Chinese Gaofen (GF)-1 data and monitor long-term (1982-2018) ET variations in the Three-River Headwaters Region (TRHR) of mainland China using the Global LAnd-Surface Satellite (GLASS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product. The proposed SPT model without Rn provides an alternative model for estimating regional terrestrial ET across different land-cover types.

TI  - Improving Co-Registration for Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 Optical Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Co-registering the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 optical data of the European Space Agency (ESA) is of great importance for many remote sensing applications. However, we find that there are evident misregistration shifts between the Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images that are directly downloaded from the official website. To address that, this paper presents a fast and effective registration method for the two types of images. In the proposed method, a block-based scheme is first designed to extract evenly distributed interest points. Then, the correspondences are detected by using the similarity of structural features between the SAR and optical images, where the three-dimensional (3D) phase correlation (PC) is used as the similarity measure for accelerating image matching. Lastly, the obtained correspondences are employed to measure the misregistration shifts between the images. Moreover, to eliminate the misregistration, we use some representative geometric transformation models such as polynomial models, projective models, and rational function models for the co-registration of the two types of images, and we compare and analyze their registration accuracy under different numbers of control points and different terrains. Six pairs of the Sentinel-1 SAR L1 and Sentinel-2 optical L1C images covering three different terrains are tested in our experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve precise correspondences between the images, and the third-order polynomial achieves the most satisfactory registration results. Its registration accuracy of the flat areas is less than 1.0 10 m pixel, that of the hilly areas is about 1.5 10 m pixels, and that of the mountainous areas is between 1.7 and 2.3 10 m pixels, which significantly improves the co-registration accuracy of the Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 optical images.

TI  - WORLDVIEW AND PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATIONS OF BERDYAEV'S "EXISTENTIAL CHRISTIANITY"
T2  - JOURNAL FOR THE STUDY OF RELIGIONS AND IDEOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of the study is to review the philosophical foundations of the religious doctrine by Berdyaev based on a comparative analysis of the epistemological, anthropological, and ontological backgrounds for his thinking. The study combines methods and theories from various cultural, religious, and historical-philosophical approaches, which made it possible to reveal the peculiarities of Berdyaev's rethinking of traditional Christianity in the context of the crisis of Western culture. The scientific novelty proves a fundamental break in his conception with classical metaphysics as the basis of Christian orthodoxy. Human freedom, spirituality as a system-forming principle of human existence, which humanize anthropologism and de-objectification as a priori of the general system of the world-understanding, form that new type of the religious-metaphysical basis of "modern Orthodoxy" that Berdyaev sought to establish as a new model of Christianity in the world. The conclusions emphasize that the specifics of "existential Christianity" by Berdyaev consisted in establishing a special commensurability between man and God, and in the thesis about the "eternal humanity" of God, beyond which, in his deep conviction, one can hardly understand and interpret the very possibility of Revelation.

TI  - A comprehensive analysis on abundance, distribution, and bionomics of potential malaria vectors in Anseba zone, Eritrea (2020)
T2  - International Journal of Mosquito Research
M3  - Article
AB  - In Eritrea malaria is still remains a public health concern despite the drastic decline in morbidity and mortality. With all the achievements, little has been invested in entomological studies. So the gains may be reversed considering the receptivity and vulnerability of most of the malarias areas and/or previously malarias areas. A cross-sectional entomological survey was conducted in 3 sentinel sites of Anseba zone, Eritrea during the period Aug. - Nov.2020 for a comprehensive analysis on abundance, distribution and bionomics of potential malaria vectors. Mosquito immature stages and adults were collected from different habitats using both immature and adult collection options. From the total 40 aquatic larval habitats, more than 77.5% were River edges found along the Anseba River, animal foot print, small streams, dams and swamps was among the preferred mosquito breeding habitats. Larval densities among the study sites were found to be high with approximately 20.7 larvae per dip. A total of 1746 femal mosquitoes were identified to their species level morphologically. As a result 5 species were identified vis. An. gambiae, An. cineruse, An pretoriensis, An. pharoensis and other 1 species not identified yet. An gambiae was the most dominant vector and was found to be endophlic and endophagic. The pick biting hours were found to be from 08:00pm-12:00pm, most high at 10:00pm to 12:00pm. Nearly 95% of all adult mosquitoes collected using human landing catch was between these hours.

TI  - Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of snow cover in the central and western Karakoram Mountains based on a refined MODIS product during 2002-2018
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming has a significant impact on the water cycle, especially in regions where the water supply is dominated by snow and glacier meltwater. In this study, spatiotemporal changes of snowpack in the Yarkant River Basin (YRB) and the west of Upper Indus Basin (WUIB), associated with the Karakoram Mountains, were examined using Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) daily cloud-free snow cover product. A sensitivity analysis was carried out to explore the climatic effects on snow cover changes. From 2002 to 2018, overall slight (but non-significant) decreasing and increasing trends in snow cover extent were observed in the basins, which occupy the northern and southern slopes of the central and western Karakoram Mountains, respectively. In both basins, the low-altitude areas experienced a slight decrease in snow cover extent, while the high-altitude areas experienced an increase. Significant elevation dependences were found for the snow cover percentage (SCP), snow covered days (SCD) and snow cover melting dates (SCMD), with an inverse elevation dependence for snow cover onset dates (SCOD). Most of the study area showed a decreasing trend in SCD, which was delayed in SCOD, and an advanced trend in SCMD by a rate of <2 d/a. An increased trend in SCD was observed at 5000-6000 m a.s.l. in the YRB and at 3000-4000 m a.s.l. in the WUIB, both attributed to delayed SCMD. Parts of the Karakoram and eastern Pamir experienced lengthened SCD, advanced SCOD, and delayed SCMD against a background of increased temperature. This was attributed to increased precipitation in the snow accumulation season, and might be related to the Karakoram Anomaly. Moreover, SCOD was found to be positively sensitive to air temperature in snow accumulation season, but negatively sensitive to precipitation. Similarly, SCMD had a positive sensitivity to precipitation, but a negative sensitivity to air temperature in both the snow accumulation season and snowmelt season.

TI  - A Nonlinear Radiometric Normalization Model for Satellite Imgaes Time Series Based on Artificial Neural Networks and Greedy Algroithm
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite Image Time Series (SITS) is a data set that includes satellite images across several years with a high acquisition rate. Radiometric normalization is a fundamental and important preprocessing method for remote sensing applications using SITS due to the radiometric distortion caused by noise between images. Normalizing the subject image based on the reference image is a general strategy when using traditional radiometric normalization methods to normalize multi-temporal imagery (usually two or three scenes in different time phases). However, these methods are unsuitable for calibrating SITS because they cannot minimize the radiometric distortion between any pair of images in SITS. The existing relative radiometric normalization methods for SITS are based on linear assumptions, which cannot effectively reduce nonlinear radiometric distortion caused by continuously changing noise in SITS. To overcome this problem and obtain a more accurate SITS, we propose a nonlinear radiometric normalization model (NMAG) for SITS based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Greedy Algorithm (GA). In this method, GA is used to determine the correction order of SITS and calculate the error between the image to be corrected and normalized images, which avoids the selection of a single reference image. ANN is used to obtain the optimal solution of error function, which minimizes the radiometric distortion between different images in SITS. The SITS composed of 21 Landsat-8 images in Tianjin, China, from October 2017 to January 2019 was selected to test the method. We compared NMAG with other two contrast methods (Contrast Method 1 (CM1) and Contrast Method 2 (CM2)), and found that the average root mean square error (mu RMSE) of NMAG (497.22) is significantly smaller than those of CM1 (641.39) and CM2 (543.47), and the accuracy of normalized SITS obtained using NMAG increases by 22.4% and 8.5% compared with CM1 and CM2, respectively. These experimental results confirm the effectiveness of NMAG in reducing radiometric distortion caused by continuously changing noise between images in SITS.

TI  - Anterior Axillary Arch: An Anatomic Variant Every Surgeon Operating in the Axilla Should Be Aware of
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Anterior axillary arch (AAA) is a slip of latissimus dorsi muscle, of variable thickness, which crosses anterior to the axillary vessels and brachial plexus. It is the most common anatomic variant in the axilla and surgeons operating in this area should be familiar with this finding to prevent confusion and complications. The aim of this study is to enhance surgeon's awareness of AAA, report the prevalence, and to describe our experience with this anomaly.Methods: An institutionally maintained database was used to identify patients with AAA in a single surgeon's experience, from 2008 to 2019. Patient characteristics, including tumor type, laterality, and pathologic node counts were determined and compared with patients undergoing axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) without this anatomic anomaly.Results: Nineteen patients with AAA were identified (13 on ALND and 6 during sentinel lymph node biopsy). Indications for ALND included breast cancer (12), melanoma (5), and Merkel cell carcinoma (2). In patients with AAA undergoing an ALND, the median number of lymph nodes pathologically identified was 23 and similar to those without AAA (27, P = 0.14). The prevalence of AAA in patients who underwent ALND was 3.1% (13/422).Conclusions: Surgeons who operate in the axilla are likely to encounter an AAA. Knowledge of this variant should improve operative efficiency and may prevent technical errors during an ALND or sentinel lymph node biopsy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of erosion induced nutrients loss under different land uses: A case study in Miandam Valley, Swat Pakistan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to design Sustainable Land Management (SLM) plans or interventions it is important to understand the land use change and subsequent impacts. The basic aim of this study was to assess the impact of land use land cover (LULC) change on soil physico-chemical properties and nutrients loss under different land use/land cover changes within Miandam watershed of Swat valley, Pakistan. The study area was divided into three major types on the basis LULC type (Dense forest, Moderate forest and Agriculture land). A total of 81 soil samples were collected from the study area (27 from each land use) through stratified random sampling and were transferred to the laboratory. The prepared soil samples were then tested for various physico-chemical properties such as pH, electrical conductivity, contents of organic matter, organic carbon, sand, silt, clay, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, iron, copper and zinc. Results showed that LULC significantly affected all soil parameters except electrical conductivity and potassium. For all the nutrients assessed, the enrichment ratio was greater than 1 which showed that the most fertile layer of the soil in the cropped areas was transported through soil erosion. In this study, time-series satellite images were used to determine the spatiotemporal changes in the LULC of Miandam valley of Swat, Pakistan, and the possible effect of LULC on soil properties was reported. The information generated on the soil properties as indicators of soil health could be used to inform the stakeholders about the effect of LULC change in the study area. Multi-temporal image acquired by Landsat sensors for the year 2018 was used for quantifying changes in the study area. The Landsat images for the year 2018 were classified into six land cover/land use classes. The increase in agricultural activities caused an increase in the land farming areas which led to an increase in the rate of deforestation in the valley. Thus, the present study results reveal that the use of the soil for agriculture instead of keeping them naturally or in other words changes in the land use land cover affects the soil physico-chemical properties and the overall nutrients availability.

TI  - Aerosol Trends during the Dusty Season over Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed the aerosol climatology over Iran, based on the monthly data of aerosol optical depth (AOD) derived from the reanalysis-based Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) and the satellite-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). In addition, sea level pressure, wind speed, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and soil moisture from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset were applied to investigate the climate-related effects on temporal AOD changes. Our analysis identified positive and negative AOD trends during 2000-2010 and 2010-2018, respectively, which are likely linked to aeolian dust changes. The dust-driven AOD trends were supported by changes in the angstrom ngstrom exponent (AE) and fine mode fraction (FMF) of aerosols over Iran. During the early period (2000-2010), results of AOD-meteorology correlation analyses suggest reduced soil moisture, leading to increased dust emissions, whereas our results suggest that during the later period (2010-2018) an increase of soil moisture led to decreased AOD levels. Soil moisture appears to be a key factor in dust mobilization in the region, notably in southwestern Iran, being influenced by adjacent mineral dust sources. These phenomena were affected by large-scale sea level pressure transformations and the associated meteorology in the preceding winter seasons. Using a multiple linear regression model, AOD variability was linked to various meteorological factors in different regions. Our results suggest that climatic variations strongly affect the dust cycle, with a strong dependence on wintertime conditions in the region.

TI  - Long-Term Dynamics of Different Surface Water Body Types and Their Possible Driving Factors in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Various surface water bodies, such as rivers, lakes and reservoirs, provide water and essential services to human society. However, the long-term spatiotemporal dynamics of different types of surface water bodies and their possible driving factors over large areas remain very limited. Here, we used unprecedented surface water data layers derived from all available Landsat images and further developed two databases on China's lakes and reservoirs larger than 1 km(2) to document and understand the characteristics of changes in different water body types during 2000 to 2019 in China. Our results show that China is dominated by permanent water bodies. The areas of permanent and seasonal water bodies in China increased by 16,631.02 km(2) (16.72%) and 16,994.95 km(2) (25.14%), respectively, between 2000 and 2019, with permanent and seasonal water bodies exhibiting divergent spatial variations. Lakes and artificial reservoirs larger than 1 km(2), which collectively represent a significant proportion of the permanent water bodies in China, displayed net increases of 6884.52 km(2) (10.71%) and 4075.13 km(2) (36.10%), respectively, from 2000 to 2019; these increases accounted for 41.40% and 24.50%, respectively, of the total permanent water body increment. The expanding lakes were mainly distributed on the Tibetan Plateau, whereas the rapidly growing reservoirs were mainly located on the Northeast Plain and Eastern Plain. Statistical analyses indicated that artificial reservoirs were an important factor controlling both permanent and seasonal water body changes in most of provinces. Climate factors, such as precipitation and temperature, were the main influencing factors affecting the changes in different water bodies in the sparsely populated Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - A Space-Time Interactive Visualization Approach for Managing Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of earth observation technology, the remote sensing data produced gradually shows characteristics of multi-source and heterogeneous, and data volumes are also exploding. Designing approaches and tools to manage the remote sensing data brings a unique set of research and engineering challenges, specifically with regards to data condition query and interpretation. First, we extract the metadata of the data to prepare for unified data retrieval. Considering the real-time, intuitive and interactive in data management, visual images are generated and used to represent the data itself. By considering the spatial characteristics of remote sensing data, we then propose a method based on mouse real-time plotting for the setting of spatial attribute condition, and the condition can be dynamically modified based on the feedback of the query result. After getting the query result, line frame and wall projection are used to display the data spatial distribution. For the intuitiveness and accuracy of data interpretation, we present an approach based on space-time cube technology to assess in a single view where remote sensing data with different parameters is unobstructed displayed in a layered manner. The approach consists of several parts, including a stack view, two cube boxes and a data probe. As an essential component, an information balloon is used to show data parameters and provide a convenient interface for data manipulation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness and the usefulness of the proposed approach using a real-world case and three tests.

TI  - Detecting Forest Degradation in the Three-North Forest Shelterbelt in China from Multi-Scale Satellite Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detecting forest degradation from satellite observation data is of great significance in revealing the process of decreasing forest quality and giving a better understanding of regional or global carbon emissions and their feedbacks with climate changes. In this paper, a quick and applicable approach was developed for monitoring forest degradation in the Three-North Forest Shelterbelt in China from multi-scale remote sensing data. Firstly, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), Fraction of Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FPAR) and Net Primary Production (NPP) from remote sensing data were selected as the indicators to describe forest degradation. Then multi-scale forest degradation maps were obtained by adopting a new classification method using time series MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images, and were validated with ground survey data. At last, the criteria and indicators for monitoring forest degradation from remote sensing data were discussed, and the uncertainly of the method was analyzed. Results of this paper indicated that multi-scale remote sensing data have great potential in detecting regional forest degradation.

TI  - Changes in the End-of-Summer Snow Line Altitude of Summer-Accumulation-Type Glaciers in the Eastern Tien Shan Mountains from 1994 to 2016
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For summer-accumulation-type glaciers, the glaciological literature is lacking studies on determining the snow line altitude (SLA) from optical images at the end of the summer as an indicator of the equilibrium line altitude (ELA). This paper presents a workflow for extracting the SLA from Landsat images based on the variation in the albedo with the altitude in the central line area of glaciers. The correlation of >0.8 at the 99% confidence level between the retrieved SLAs with ELAs derived from the interpolation of ground-based, mass balance measurements indicated that the workflow can be applied to derive the SLA from end-of-summer satellite data as an indicator of ELA. The ELA was under-estimated by the calculated SLA. The relationship between the end-of-summer SLA and the ELA depends on the intensity of glacier melting. Subsequently, the workflow was applied to the seven glaciers in the Eastern Tien Shan Mountains, and a time series of the SLA was obtained using 12 end-of-summer Landsat scenes from 1994 to 2016. Over the whole study period, a mean SLA of 4011.6 +/- 20.7 m above sea level (a.s.l.) was derived for the seven investigated glaciers, and an increasing SLA was demonstrated. The increase in SLAs was consistent for the seven glaciers from 1994 to 2016. Concerning the spatial variability, the east-west difference was prominent, and these differences exhibited a decreasing trend. The average SLA of each glacier is more influenced by its morpho-topographic variables. The interannual variations in the average SLA are mainly driven by the increasing summer air temperature, and the high correlation with the cumulative summer solid precipitation reflects the characteristics of the summer-accumulation-type glaciers.

TI  - Trend analysis of the decadal variations of water bodies and land use/land cover through MODIS imagery: an in-depth study from Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water is a primary element for human life on Earth. Fresh water, which includes rivers, lakes, streams, and ponds, contributes less than one thousandth of a percent of the total water on Earth, but it is critical for the environment and human life. Change in land use and land cover (LULC) is a foremost concern in global environment change. Rapid changes in LULC lead to the degradation of ecosystems and have adverse effects on the environment. There is an urgent need to monitor changes in LULC and evaluate the effects of these changes in order to inform decision makers on how to support sustainable development. This study used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometry images to detect and investigate changes in LULC patterns in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, between 2008 and 2017. Six types of LULC were used to explain the major changes of LULC in the study area. The results showed that there was a reduction of barren lands and an increase of urban areas. It also showed an inconsistent behavior of water bodies during the study. Snow area, which also increased, needs further investigation.

TI  - The Effect of Typhoon Goni on the Production Characteristics of Coastal Water in Posyet Bay, the Sea of Japan
T2  - WATER RESOURCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The effect caused by the typhoon Goni in the coastal water of Posyet Bay, the Sea of Japan, is considered. In nearshore expeditions, profilograph SBE-19plus was used to measure the hydrological characteristics: water temperature and salinity, as well as the hydrobiological characteristics of the fluorescence of chlorophyll a and dyed dissolved organic matter a week after the passage of the typhoon. To reveal the effect of the typhoon on the ecosystem, the data measured after typhoon passage were compared with the appropriate characteristics obtained in the same season in about the same place a year before, when there was no typhoon. A high correlation was found to exist between chlorophyll a concentration and the input of fresh water from the continent. It was shown that the dyed dissolved organic matter is determined, in addition to the continental export, by autochthonous processes. The problem formulated in the study was solved with the involvement of satellite data, which reflected changes in the ecosystem in large water areas and suggested the conclusion that the changes caused by the typhoon shift the state of the coastal zone toward that of river estuaries.

TI  - A nonparametric algorithm for automatic classification of large multivariate statistical data sets and its application
T2  - COMPUTER OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A nonparametric algorithm for automatic classification of large statistical data sets is proposed. The algorithm is based on a procedure for optimal discretization of the range of values of a random variable. A class is a compact group of observations of a random variable corresponding to a unimodal fragment of the probability density. The considered algorithm of automatic classification is based on the "compression" of the initial information based on the decomposition of a multidimensional space of attributes. As a result, a large statistical sample is transformed into a data array composed of the centers of multidimensional sampling intervals and the corresponding frequencies of random variables. To substantiate the optimal discretization procedure, we use the results of a study of the asymptotic properties of a kernel-type regression estimate of the probability density. An optimal number of sampling intervals for the range of values of one- and two-dimensional random variables is determined from the condition of the minimum root-mean square deviation of the regression probability density estimate. The results obtained are generalized to the discretization of the range of values of a multidimensional random variable. The optimal discretization formula contains a component that is characterized by a nonlinear functional of the probability density. An analytical dependence of the detected component on the antikurtosis coefficient of a one-dimensional random variable is established. For independent components of a multidimensional random variable, a methodology is developed for calculating estimates of the optimal number of sampling intervals for random variables and their lengths. On this basis, a nonparametric algorithm for the automatic classification is developed. It is based on a sequential procedure for checking the proximity of the centers of multidimensional sampling intervals and relationships between frequencies of the membership of the random variables from the original sample of these intervals. To further increase the computational efficiency of the proposed automatic classification algorithm, a multithreaded method of its software implementation is used. The practical significance of the developed algorithms is confirmed by the results of their application in processing remote sensing data.

TI  - Precipitable water vapor fusion based on a generalized regression neural network
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapor plays an important role in Earth's weather and climate processes and energy transfer. Plenty of techniques have developed to monitor precipitable water vapor (PWV), but joint use of different techniques has some problems, including systematic biases, different spatiotemporal coverages and resolutions among different datasets. To address the above problems and improve the data utilization, we propose to use a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) to fuse PWVs from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5 (ERA5). The core idea of this method is to use the high-quality GNSS PWV to calibrate and optimize the relatively low-quality MODIS and ERA5 PWV through the constructed GRNNs. Using the proposed method, we generated more than 400 PWV maps that combine GNSS, MODIS, and ERA5 PWVs in North America in 2018. Results show that the overall bias, standard deviation (STD), and root-mean-square (RMS) error are 0.0 mm, 2.1 mm, and 2.2 mm for the improved MODIS PWV, and 0.0 mm, 1.6 mm, and 1.6 mm for the improved ERA5 PWV. Compared to the original MODIS and ERA5 PWV, the total improvements are 37.1% and 15.8% in terms of RMS. The RMS improvements are mainly contributed from the calibration of bias for the MODIS PWV and optimization for the ERA5 PWV. It also demonstrates that the original MODIS PWV tends to be greater than the GNSS PWV while the ERA5 PWV has very small biases. After calibration and optimization, the correlation coefficients between the modified PWV and the GNSS PWV are 0.96 for the MODIS PWV and 0.98 for the ERA5 PWV. The proposed method also diminishes the temporal and spatial variations in accuracy, generating homogeneous PWV products. Since the biases among the three datasets are well removed and data accuracies are improved to the same level, they are thus easily fused and jointly used.

TI  - Inferring Mixed Use of Buildings with Multisource Data Based on Tensor Decomposition
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on the mixed use of buildings helps understand the status of mixed-use urban vertical land and assists in urban planning decisions. Although a few studies have focused on this topic, the methods they used are quite complex and require manual intervention in extracting different function patterns of buildings, while building recognition rates remain unsatisfying. In this paper, we propose a new method to infer the mixed use of buildings based on a tensor decomposition algorithm, which integrates information from both high-resolution remote sensing images and social sensing data. We selected the Tianhe District of Guangzhou, China to validate our method. The results show that the recognition rate of buildings can reach 98.67%, with an average recognition accuracy of 84%. Our study proves that the tensor decomposition algorithm can extract different function patterns of buildings unsupervised, while remote sensing data can provide key information for inferring building functions. The tensor decomposition-based method can serve as an effective and efficient way to infer the mixed use of buildings, which can achieve better results with simpler steps.

TI  - An automated, generalized, deep-learning-based method for delineating the calving fronts of Greenland glaciers from multi-sensor remote sensing imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the past two decades, the data volume of remote sensing imagery in the polar regions has increased dramatically. The calving fronts of many Greenland glaciers have been undergoing substantial variations, and a comprehensive front dataset is necessary for better understanding such frontal dynamics. Therefore, there is a need for an automated approach to identifying glaciological features such as calving fronts. In 2019, three deep-learning-based methods were applied to calving front delineation, but were restricted to a specific area or dataset. Here, we develop a more generalized method that can be applied to a major outlet glacier or remote sensing datasets that are not included in the training. We integrate seven remote sensing datasets into a single deep learning network. The core datasets include optical (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and synthetic aperture radar images (Envisat, ALOS-1 TerraSAR-X, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2) taken over Jakobshavn Isbme, Kangerlussuaq, and Helheim, spanning from 2002 to 2019. We evaluate four neural network architectures (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabv3+ with ResNet, DRN, and MobileNet as the backbones) and three histogram modification strategies (e.g., histogram normalization, linear stretching, and no histogram modification). We find that the combination of histogram normalization and DRN-DeepLabv3+ has the lowest test error, at 86 m. These promising results show that our method has a high generalization ability on various glaciers and data types.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-3 OLCI Land Products and MERRA2 Meteorology Data into Light Use Efficiency and Vegetation Index-Driven Models for Modeling Gross Primary Production
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately and reliably estimating total terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) on a large scale is of great significance for monitoring the carbon cycle process. The Sentinel-3 satellite provides the OLCI FAPAR and OTCI products, which possess a higher spatial and temporal resolution than MODIS products. However, few studies have focused on using LUE models and VI-driven models based on the Sentinel-3 satellites to estimate GPP on a large scale. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of Sentinel-3 OLCI FAPAR and OTCI products combined with meteorology reanalysis data in estimating GPP at site and regional scale. Firstly, we integrated OLCI FAPAR and meteorology reanalysis data into the MODIS GPP algorithm and eddy covariance light use efficiency (EC-LUE) model (GPP(MODIS-GPP) and GPP(EC-LUE), respectively). Then, we combined OTCI and meteorology reanalysis data with the greenness and radiation (GR) model and vegetation index (VI) model (GPP(GR) and GPP(VI), respectively). Lastly, GPP(MODIS-GPP), GPP(EC-LUE), GPP(GR), and GPP(VI) were evaluated against the eddy covariance flux data (GPP(EC)) at the site scale and MODIS GPP products (GPP(MOD17)) at the regional scale. The results showed that, at the site scale, GPP(MODIS-GPP) and GPP(EC-LUE) agreed well with GPP(EC) for the US-Ton site, with R-2 = 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. The performance of GPP(GR) and GPP(VI) varied across different biome types. Strong correlations were obtained across deciduous broadleaf forests, mixed forests, grasslands, and croplands. At the same time, there are overestimations and underestimations in croplands, evergreen needleleaf forests and deciduous broadleaf forests. At the regional scale, the annual mean and maximum daily GPP(MODIS-GPP) and GPP(EC-LUE) agreed well with GPP(MOD17) in 2017 and 2018, with R-2 > 0.75. Overall, the above findings demonstrate the feasibility of using Sentinel-3 OLCI FAPAR and OTCI products combined with meteorology reanalysis data through LUE and VI-driven models to estimate GPP, and fill in the gaps for the large-scale evaluation of GPP via Sentinel-3 satellites.

TI  - A Review of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Low-Altitude Remote Sensing (UAV-LARS) Use in Agricultural Monitoring in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Precision agriculture relies on the rapid acquisition and analysis of agricultural information. An emerging method of agricultural monitoring is unmanned aerial vehicle low-altitude remote sensing (UAV-LARS), which possesses significant advantages of simple construction, strong mobility, and high spatial-temporal resolution with synchronously obtained image and spatial information. UAV-LARS could provide a high degree of overlap between X and Y during key crop growth periods that is currently lacking in satellite and remote sensing data. Simultaneously, UAV-LARS overcomes the limitations such as small scope of ground platform monitoring. Overall, UAV-LARS has demonstrated great potential as a tool for monitoring agriculture at fine- and regional-scales. Here, we systematically summarize the history and current application of UAV-LARS in Chinese agriculture. Specifically, we outline the technical characteristics and sensor payload of the available types of unmanned aerial vehicles and discuss their advantages and limitations. Finally, we provide suggestions for overcoming current limitations of UAV-LARS and directions for future work.

TI  - Setting the Flow Accumulation Threshold Based on Environmental and Morphologic Features to Extract River Networks from Digital Elevation Models
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Determining the flow accumulation threshold (FAT) is a key task in the extraction of river networks from digital elevation models (DEMs). Several methods have been developed to extract river networks from Digital Elevation Models. However, few studies have considered the geomorphologic complexity in the FAT estimation and river network extraction. Recent studies estimated influencing factors' impacts on the river length or drainage density without considering anthropogenic impacts and landscape patterns. This study contributes two FAT estimation methods. The first method explores the statistical association between FAT and 47 tentative explanatory factors. Specifically, multi-source data, including meteorologic, vegetation, anthropogenic, landscape, lithology, and topologic characteristics are incorporated into a drainage density-FAT model in basins with complex topographic and environmental characteristics. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was employed to evaluate the factors' predictive performance. The second method exploits fractal geometry theory to estimate the FAT at the regional scale, that is, in basins whose large areal extent precludes the use of basin-wide representative regression predictors. This paper's methodology is applied to data acquired for Hubei and Qinghai Provinces, China, from 2001 through 2018 and systematically tested with visual and statistical criteria. Our results reveal key local features useful for river network extraction within the context of complex geomorphologic characteristics at relatively small spatial scales and establish the importance of properly choosing explanatory geomorphologic characteristics in river network extraction. The multifractal method exhibits more accurate extracting results than the box-counting method at the regional scale.

TI  - Map-based variable-rate manure application in wheat using a data fusion approach
T2  - SOIL & TILLAGE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor manure management practices lead to excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in soils that are still common in many countries in Europe. One way to optimize the economic returns and at the same time minimize the environmental impacts of poor manure management is by Variable Rate Manure (VRM) application. This work aimed at the evaluation of potential economic benefits of VRM application, compared to Uniform Rate Manure (URM) application, using advanced sensing, modeling and control technologies. Soil fertility attributes were measured using an on-line visible and near-infrared (vis-NIR) spectroscopy sensor, and crop normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was retrieved from Sentinel-2 images in a field of 8 ha with wheat in Flanders, Belgium. The predicted soil properties and the crop NDVI were clustered into a four-class fertility map using the k-mean clustering, each of which has different fertility level. The fertility map was overlaid by parallel strips representing URM, VRM1 and VRM2 treatments. VRM1 intended to apply 40 % more manure than URM to high fertility zones, 20 % more to medium-high fertility zones, 20 % less to medium-low fertility zones, and 40 % less to low fertility zones, whereas VRM2 adopted the opposite approach to that of VRM1. Results showed that VRM2 had increased crop yield by 1.5 % (0.19 t/ha), but reduced applied N by 4.1 % (11.01 kg/ha) and P by 7.1 % (3.72 kg/ha), compared to URM. The VRM1 approach consumed extra N of 5.21 kg/ha (1.8 %) and extra P of 1.63 kg/ha (3.1 %), to achieve a yield increase of 0.31 t/ha with a profit of 40.06 EUR/ha (2.1 %), compared to URM. However, a slightly smaller profit of VRM2 of 36.32 EUR/ha was calculated. Although VRM1 was more profitable than VRM2 by 0.2 % (3.74 EUR/ha), the latter is recommended as the best approach, as VRM1 increased environmental risks in the sense of increasing both N and P applied, by 5.9 % (17.12 kg/ha) and 10.4 % (5.35 kg/ha), respectively.

TI  - Simulation of Gross Primary Productivity Using Multiple Light Use Efficiency Models
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the most basic variable in a carbon cycle study that determines the carbon that enters the ecosystem. The remote sensing-based light use efficiency (LUE) model is one of the primary tools that is currently used to estimate the GPP at the regional scale. Many remote sensing-based GPP models have been developed in the last several decades, and these models have been well evaluated at some sites. However, an accurate estimation of the GPP remains challenging work using LUE models because of uncertainties in the model caused by model parameters, model forcing, and vegetation spatial heterogeneity. In this study, five widely used LUE models, Glo-PEM, VPM, EC-LUE, the MODIS GPP algorithm, and C-fix, were selected to simulate the GPP of the Heihe River Basin forced using in situ measurements. A multiple-model averaging method, Bayesian model averaging (BMA), was used to combine the five models to obtain a more reliable GPP estimation. The BMA was trained using carbon flux data from five eddy covariance towers located at dominant vegetation types in the study area. Generally, the BMA method performed better than any single LUE model. From the case study in the study area, it is indicated that the trained BMA is an efficient method to combine multiple LUE models and can improve the GPP simulation accuracy.

TI  - Assessing soil thickness in a black soil watershed in northeast China using random forest and field observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil thickness determines the soil productivity in the black soil region of northeast China, which is important for national food security. Existing information on the spatial variation of black soil thickness is inadequate. In this paper, we propose a model framework for spatial estimation of the black soil thickness at the watershed scale by integrating field observations, unmanned aerial vehicle variations of topography, and satellite variations of vegetation with the aid of random forest. We sampled 141 sample profiles over a watershed and identified the black soil thickness based on indices of the mollic epipedon. Topographic variables were derived from a digital elevation model and vegetation variables were derived from Landsat 8 imagery. Random forest was used to determine the relationship between black soil thickness and environmental variables. The resulting model explained 61% of the black soil thickness spatial variation, which was more than twice that of traditional interpolation methods (ordinary kriging, universal kriging and inverse distance weighting). Topographic variables contributed the most toward explaining the thickness, followed by vegetation indices. The black soil thickness over the watershed had a clear catenary soil pattern, with thickest black soil in the low depositional areas and thinnest at the higher elevations that drain into the low areas. The proposed model framework will improve estimates of soil thickness in the region of our study.

TI  - MicroRNA-34b-5p inhibits proliferation, stemness, migration and invasion of retinoblastoma cells via Notch signaling
T2  - EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Retinoblastoma (RB) is one of the most common forms of childhood intraocular cancer. While the occurrence of RB is traditionally associated with dysregulation of the RB1 gene, efforts have been made to assess the role of several other pathways that may result in RB. The Notch signaling pathway has been identified as one of the sentinel pathways in retinal development and has been indicated to serve as a tumor suppressor. However, epigenetic modifications of the Notch signaling pathway, and their consequences on tumor establishment and progression, have received little attention. The present study attempted to elucidate the microRNA (miR)-mediated dysregulation of the Notch signaling pathway and its implications on tumor initiation. Upon recruitment of patients with RB (age, 4-25 months), the levels of miR-34b-5p were determined in tumor and adjacent healthy tissues. Simultaneously, the serum levels of miR-34b-5p were measured in tumor and healthy samples using reverse transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Binding of miR-34b-5p to Notch1 and Notch2 were confirmed bioinformatically. In vitro studies were performed in Y79 and Weri-Rb-1 RB cell lines. The cell lines were transfected with miR-34b-5p constructs and miR-34b-5p overexpression was confirmed using RT-qPCR. The impact of miR-34b-5p overexpression on cell growth and cancer stemness markers (Sox-2, Nanog, and CD133) was examined. The expression levels of Notch1 and Notch2 were evaluated in the presence of miR-34b-5p. The rescue of cell growth and cancer stemness phenotypes was evaluated by co-transfection of miR-34b-5p with Notch1 or Notch2. The results of the present study indicated that the expression levels of miR-34b-5p were reduced in patient tissues and serum samples compared with those in healthy tissues and samples. Notch1 and Notch2 expression level was negatively correlated with the expression level of miR-34b-5p. Overexpression of miR-34b-5p resulted in reduced cell proliferation, migration, invasion and cancer stemness compared with the control group. Further in vivo experiments confirmed the inhibitory effects of miR-34b-5p on RB cell proliferation. Upon co-transfection of miR-34b-5p with Notch1 or Notch2, these phenotypes were rescued with reversal of cell growth and tumor sphere formation. Collectively, the results indicated that miR-34b-5p functions as a tumor suppressor in RB via regulating the Notch signaling pathway. Therefore, miR-34b-5p may be explored for its utility as a therapeutic target in RB.

TI  - Mapping the Dynamics of Winter Wheat in the North China Plain from Dense Landsat Time Series (1999 to 2019)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring spatio-temporal changes in winter wheat planting areas is of high importance for the evaluation of food security. This is particularly the case in China, having the world's largest population and experiencing rapid urban expansion, concurrently, it puts high pressure on food demands and the availability of arable land. The relatively high spatial resolution of Landsat is required to resolve the historical mapping of smallholder wheat fields in China. However, accurate Landsat-based mapping of winter wheat planting dynamics over recent decades have not been conducted for China, or anywhere else globally. Based on all available Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI images (similar to 28,826 tiles) using Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing and a Random Forest machine-learning classifier, we analyzed spatio-temporal dynamics in winter wheat planting areas during 1999-2019 in the North China Plain (NCP). We applied a median value of 30-day sliding windows to fill in potential data gaps in the available Landsat images, and six EVI-based phenological features were then extracted to discriminate winter wheat from other land cover types. Reference data for training and validation were extracted from high-resolution imagery available via Google Earth (TM) online mapping service, Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. We ran a sensitivity analysis to derive the optimal training sample class ratio (beta = 1.8) accounting for the unbalanced distribution of land-cover types. We mapped winter wheat planting areas for 1999-2019 with overall accuracies ranging from 82% to 99% and the user's/producer's accuracies of winter wheat range between 90% and 99%. We observed an overall increase in winter wheat planting areas of 1.42 x 10(6) ha in the NCP as compared to the year 2000, with a significant increase in the Shandong and Hebei provinces (p < 0.05). This result contrasts the general discourse suggesting a decline in croplands (e.g., rapid urbanization) and climate change-induced unfavorable cropping conditions in the NCP. This suggests adjustments of the winter wheat planting area over time to satisfy wheat supply in relation to food security. This study highlights the application of Landsat images through GEE in documenting spatio-temporal dynamics of winter wheat planting areas for adequate management of cropping systems and assessing food security in China.

TI  - Land Use and Land Cover Mapping Using RapidEye Imagery Based on a Novel Band Attention Deep Learning Method in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) change has been recognized as one of the most important indicators to study ecological and environmental changes. Remote sensing provides an effective way to map and monitor LULC change in real time and for large areas. However, with the increasing spatial resolution of remote sensing imagery, traditional classification approaches cannot fully represent the spectral and spatial information from objects and thus have limitations in classification results, such as the "salt and pepper" effect. Nowadays, the deep semantic segmentation methods have shown great potential to solve this challenge. In this study, we developed an adaptive band attention (BA) deep learning model based on U-Net to classify the LULC in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) combining RapidEye imagery and topographic information. The BA module adaptively weighted input bands in convolution layers to address the different importance of the bands. By comparing the performance of our model with two typical traditional pixel-based methods including classification and regression tree (CART) and random forest (RF), we found a higher overall accuracy (OA) and a higher Intersection over Union (IoU) for all classification categories using our model. The OA and mean IoU of our model were 0.77 and 0.60, respectively, with the BA module and were 0.75 and 0.58, respectively, without the BA module. The OA and mean IoU of CART and RF were both below 0.51 and 0.30, respectively, although RF slightly outperformed CART. Our model also showed a reasonable classification accuracy in independent areas well outside the training area, which indicates the strong model generalizability in the spatial domain. This study demonstrates the novelty of our proposed model for large-scale LULC mapping using high-resolution remote sensing data, which well overcomes the limitations of traditional classification approaches and suggests the consideration of band weighting in convolution layers.

TI  - Retrieval of aerosol fine-mode fraction over China from satellite multiangle polarized observations: validation and comparison
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol fine-mode fraction (FMF) is an important optical parameter of aerosols, and the FMF is difficult to accurately retrieve by traditional satellite remote sensing methods. In this study, FMF retrieval was carried out based on the multiangle polarization data of Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Science coupled with Observations from Lidar (PARASOL), which overcame the shortcomings of the FMF retrieval algorithm in our previous research. In this research, FMF retrieval was carried out in China and compared with the AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) ground-based observation results, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) FMF products, and Generalized Retrieval of Aerosol and Surface Properties (GRASP) FMF results. In addition, the FMF retrieval algorithm was applied, a new FMF dataset was produced, and the annual and quarterly average FMF results from 2006 to 2013 were obtained for all of China. The research results show that the FMF retrieval results of this study are comparable with the AERONET ground-based observation results in China and the correlation coefficient (r), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and the proportion of results that fall within the expected error (Within EE) are 0.770, 0.143, 0.170, and 65.01 %, respectively. Compared with the MODIS FMF products, the FMF results of this study are closer to the AERONET ground-based observations. Compared with the FMF results of GRASP, the FMF results of this study are closer to the spatial variation in the ratio of PM2.5 to PM10 near the ground.

TI  - Analyzing the Effects of Hyperspectral ZhuHai-1 Band Combinations on LAI Estimation Based on the PROSAIL Model
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is a key biophysical variable to characterize vegetation canopy. Accurate and quantitative LAI estimation is significant for monitoring vegetation growth status. ZhuHai-1 (ZH-1), which is a commercial remote sensing micro-nano satellite, provides a possibility for quantitative detection of vegetation with high spatial and spectral resolution. However, the band characteristics of ZH-1 are closely related to the accuracy of vegetation monitoring. In this study, a simulation dataset containing 32 bands of ZH-1 was generated by using the PROSAIL model, which was used to analyze the performance of 32 bands for LAI estimation by using the hybrid inversion method. Meanwhile, the effect of different band combinations on LAI estimation was discussed based on sensitivity analysis and the correlation between bands. Then, the optimal band combination from ZH-1 hyperspectral satellite data for LAI estimation was obtained. LAI estimation was performed based on the selected optimal band combination of ZH-1 satellite images in Xiantao city, Hubei province, and compared with the Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values and LAI product. The results demonstrated that the obtained LAI map based on the optimal band combination of ZH-1 was generally consistent with the overall distribution of Sentinel-2 NDVI and the LAI product, but had a moderate correlation with Sentinel-2 LAI (R = 0.60), which may not favorably indicate the validity of indirect validation. However, the method of this study on the analysis of hyperspectral data bands has application potential to provide a reference for selecting appropriate bands of hyperspectral satellite data to estimate LAI and improve the application of hyperspectral data such as ZH-1 in vegetation monitoring.

TI  - Wetland Changes and Their Relation to Climate Change in the Pumqu Basin, Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland ecosystems play one of the most crucial roles in the world. Wetlands have the functions of ecological water storage, water supply, and climate regulation, which plays an indispensable role in global environmental security. The Pumqu River Basin (PRB) is located in an area with extremely vulnerable ecological environment, where climate change is obvious. Understanding wetland distribution, changes and causes in the PRB are of great importance to the rational management and protection of wetlands. Using the Landsat series satellite images, wetlands of this area in 2000, 2010, and 2018 were extracted. The results showed that (1) there were obvious regional differences in wetland types and their distribution patterns in the basin. Wetlands were mainly distributed in areas with slopes less than 12 degrees and at elevations between 4000 m and 5500 m. (2) During the past 20 years, the wetland area in the basin decreased, and the changing trend of wetlands was different. Palustrine wetlands decreased tremendously, riverine and lacustrine wetlands first decreased and then increased, while floodplain wetlands first increased and then decreased. Palustrine wetlands were reclaimed to cultivated land, but the proportion of reclamation is small. (3) Climate dominated wetland changes in the PRB. The changes in riverine and lacustrine wetlands were mainly affected by the warm-season average temperature, the change in palustrine wetlands was mainly related to the annual precipitation and the warm-season average temperature, and the change in floodplain wetlands was related to the warm-season precipitation. To achieve sustainable development, the government plays a guiding role and actively formulates and implements wetland protection policies, such as restricting or prohibiting grazing on wetlands, which play an important role in wetland protection and restoration.

TI  - Temperature Variations in Multiple Air Layers before the Mw 6.2 2014 Ludian Earthquake, Yunnan, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On 3 August 2014, an Mw 6.2 earthquake occurred in Ludian, Yunnan Province, China (27.245 degrees N 103.427 degrees E). This damaging earthquake caused approximately 400 fatalities, 1800 injuries, and the destruction of at least 12,000 houses. Using air temperature data of the National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the tidal force fluctuant analysis (TFFA) method, we derive the temperature variations in multiple air layers between before and after the Ludian earthquake. In the spatial range of 30 degrees x 30 degrees (12 degrees-42 degrees N, 88 degrees-118 degrees E) of China, a thermal anomaly appeared only on or near the epicenter before earthquake, and air was heated from the land, then uplifted by a heat flux, and then cooled and dissipated upon rising. With the approaching earthquake, the duration and range of the thermal anomaly during each tidal cycle was found to increase, and the amplitude of the thermal anomaly varied with the tidal force potential: air temperature was found to rise during the negative phase of the tidal force potential, to reach peak at its trough, and to attenuate when the tidal force potential was rising again. A significance test supports the hypothesis that the thermal anomalies are physically related to Ludian earthquakes rather than being coincidences. Based on these results, we argue that the change of air temperature could reflect the stress changes modulated under the tidal force. Moreover, unlike the thermal infrared remote sensing data, the air temperature data provided by NCEP are not affected by clouds, so it has a clear advantage for monitoring the pre-earthquake temperature variation in cloudy areas.

TI  - Response of altitudinal vegetation belts of the Tianshan Mountains in northwestern China to climate change during 1989-2015
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Within the mountain altitudinal vegetation belts, the shift of forest tree lines and subalpine steppe belts to high altitudes constitutes an obvious response to global climate change. However, whether or not similar changes occur in steppe belts (low altitude) and nival belts in different areas within mountain systems remain undetermined. It is also unknown if these, responses to climate change are consistent. Here, using Landsat remote sensing images from 1989 to 2015, we obtained the spatial distribution of altitudinal vegetation belts in different periods of the Tianshan Mountains in Northwestern China. We suggest that the responses from different altitudinal vegetation belts to global climate change are different. The changes in the vegetation belts at low altitudes are spatially different. In high-altitude regions (higher than the forest belts), however, the trend of different altitudinal belts is consistent. Specifically, we focused on analyses of the impact of changes in temperature and precipitation on the nival belts, desert steppe belts, and montane steppe belts. The results demonstrated that the temperature in the study area exhibited an increasing trend, and is the main factor of altitudinal vegetation belts change in the Tianshan Mountains. In the context of a significant increase in temperature, the upper limit of the montane steppe in the eastern and central parts will shift to lower altitudes, which may limit the development of local animal husbandry. The montane steppe in the west, however, exhibits the opposite trend, which may augment the carrying capacity of pastures and promote the development of local animal husbandry. The lower limit of the nival belt will further increase in all studied areas, which may lead to an increase in surface runoff in the central and western regions.

TI  - Remotely observed variations of reservoir low concentration chromophoric dissolved organic matter and its response to upstream hydrological and meteorological conditions using Sentinel-2 imagery and Gradient Boosting Regression Tree
T2  - WATER SUPPLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Freshwater lakes are facing increasingly serious water quality problems. Remote sensing techniques are effective tools for monitoring spatiotemporal information of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM), a biochemical indicator for water quality. In this study, the Gradient Boosting Regression Tree (GBRT) model and Sentinel-2A/B imagery were combined to estimate low CDOM concentrations (0.003 m(-1) < a(CDOM)(440) <1.787 m(-1)) in Xin'anjiang Reservoir, an important drinking water resource in Zhejiang Province, China, providing the CDOM distributions and dynamics with high spatial (10 m) and temporal (5 day) resolutions. The possible environmental factors that may affect CDOM spatiotemporal patterns and dynamics were analyzed using Sentinel-2 image-observed data in 2018. Results showed that CDOM in the reservoir exhibited a clear increased gradient from its transition and lacustrine zones to the riverine zones, indicating that the rivers carried a substantial load of organic matter to the lake. The precipitation may increase CDOM concentrations but it has a delayed effect, while it may also shortly decrease CDOM concentrations due to the rainwater dilution. We also found that the correlations between CDOM and water temperature, air pressure, and wind speed were very low, indicating that these factors may not have significant impacts on CDOM variations in the reservoir. This study demonstrated that the GBRT model and Sentinel-2 imagery have the potential to accurately monitor CDOM spatiotemporal variations in reservoirs with low CDOM concentrations, which advances our understanding on the relations between the dissolved organic matter and its coupling environmental factors in river-reservoir systems.

TI  - The implications of future climate change on the blue water footprint of hydropower in the contiguous US*
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - As the largest renewable energy source, hydropower is essential to the sustainability of the global energy market. However, a considerable amount of water can be lost in the form of evaporation from the associated multipurpose reservoirs, and hence enlarge the blue water footprint (BWF) of hydropower in a warming climate. To facilitate the sustainable management of both water and energy resources under the impact of climate change in the contiguous United States (CONUS), the BWF values of 143 major multipurpose reservoirs were evaluated during the historical period (1985-2014) and two future periods (2020-2049 and 2070-2099). The historical reservoir evaporation loss was calculated using the Landsat-based reservoir surface area and a new evaporation rate algorithm that considers the heat storage effect. Future projections of runoff availability, hydropower generation, and reservoir evaporation were estimated based on the downscaled climate model ensemble from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. It was found that the BWF for the CONUS is highly spatially heterogeneous, with an average value of 26.2 m(3) MWh(-1) in the historical period. In the future, the BWF values are projected to increase under both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. This is especially noticeable under RCP 8.5, which has an average BWF value of 30.2 m(3) MWh(-1) for 2070-2099 (increasing by 15.3% from 26.2 m(3) MWh(-1)). The uncertainty ranges increase even more, from 3.4 m(3) MWh(-1) during 2020-2049 to 5.7 m(3) MWh(-1) during 2070-2099. These findings can benefit water and energy resources management in identifying suitable environmental, economic, operational, and investment strategies for multipurpose reservoirs in a changing environment.

TI  - Interannual and Seasonal Variability of Greenhouse Gases and Aerosol Emissions from Biomass Burning in Northeastern China Constrained by Satellite Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biomass burning is a major source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and particulate matter (PM) emissions in China. Despite increasing efforts of fire monitoring, it remains challenging to quantify the variability in interannual and seasonal emissions of GHGs and PM from biomass burning. In this study, we investigated the biomass burning emissions in Northeastern China based on fire radiative power (FRP) obtained from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suites (VIIRS) active fires datasets during the period 2012 to 2019. Our results showed that the average annual emissions from biomass burning in Northeastern China during 2012-2019 were: 81.6 Tg for CO2, 260.2 Gg for CH4, 5.5 Gg for N2O, 543.2 Gg for PM2.5 and 573.6 Gg for PM10, respectively. Higher levels of GHGs and PM emissions were concentrated in the Songnen Plain and Sanjiang Plain, the main grain producing areas in this region, and were associated with dense fire points. There were two emission peaks observed each year: after harvesting (October to November) and before planting (March to April). During this study period, the total fire emissions initially increased and then decreased in a fluctuating pattern, with emissions peaking in 2015, the year when more emission regulations were introduced. Crop straw was the major source of GHGs and PM among all kinds of biomass burning. Following more stringent controls on burning and the utilization of crop straw, the main burning season changed from autumn to spring. The proportion from spring burning increased from 20.5% in 2013 to 77.1% in 2019, with an annual growth rate of 20%. The results of this study demonstrate the effectiveness of regulatory control in reducing GHGs and PM emissions, as well as satellite fire observations as a powerful means to assess such outcomes.

TI  - Cooperative Inversion of Winter Wheat Covered Surface Soil Moisture Based on Sentinel-1/2 Remote Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat is one of the most important food crops in China. Monitoring the soil moisture over winter wheat covered surface can help to solve the problem of poor harvest of winter wheat and waste of agricultural water due to soil water supply. In order to reduce the influence of winter wheat on radar backscattering coefficient in the process of microwave remote sensing retrieval of soil moisture covered by winter wheat, based on the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data carried by Sentinel-1 and the MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) data carried by Sentinel-2, combined with the water cloud model, the collaborative inversion of soil moisture over winter wheat mulching surface is carried out. Firstly, based on the MSI data from Sentinel-2, a new vegetation index called Fusion Vegetation Index (FVI) is defined for inversion of winter wheat moisture. Secondly, a semi-empirical soil moisture inversion model based on active and passive remote sensing data is developed to correct the influence of winter wheat on radar backscatter coefficient. Finally, by taking a winter wheat field in Henan Province as the study area, the comparative experiments of soil moisture inversion are carried out under six combinations, which are composed of two vegetation indexes, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and FVI respectively, and three types of polarization data, VV, VH and VV/VH respectively. Through the experimental results, FVI shows a better performance than NDWI in reducing the influence of winter wheat on radar backscatter coefficient. Meanwhile, among the six inversion combinations, the one of FVI and VV/VH achieves the optimal inversion precision, with a determination coefficient of 0.7642, a Root Mean Square Error of 0.0209 cm(3)/cm(3), and a Mean Absolute Error of 0.0174 cm(3)/cm(3), demonstrating the application potential of the soil inversion model developed in this paper.

TI  - Aerosol characteristics over the Tibetan Plateau simulated with a coupled aerosol-climate model (FGOALS-f3-L)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents the simulated aerosol spatiotemporal characteristics over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with a newly developed coupled aerosol-climate model (FGOALS-f3-L). The aerosol properties are simulated over the TP for the period 2002-11. The results indicate that soil dust, sulfate, and carbonaceous aerosols (black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and BC/OC) account for 53.6%, 32.2%, and 14.2% of the total aerosol mass over the TP, respectively. The simulated aerosol surface mass concentrations and aerosol optical depths (AODs) are evaluated with ground-based and satellite observations, respectively. Underestimations of the aerosol surface mass concentration are found at the Lhasa site, especially for BC and OC. The spatial distribution and interannual variation of AOD are consistent with MODIS observations, with the RMSE of 0.081 and bias of 0.036. Due to the uncertainty of the parameterization of dust emissions, the model's performance in summer and autumn is much better than that in spring.

TI  - QUANTIFYING URBAN VEGETATION COVERAGE CHANGE WITH A LINEAR SPECTRAL MIXING MODEL: A CASE STUDY IN XI'AN, CHINA
T2  - ECOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY AND ENGINEERING S-CHEMIA I INZYNIERIA EKOLOGICZNA S
M3  - Article
AB  - With the rapid development of urban area of Xi'an in recent years, the contradiction between ecological environmental protection and urban development has become prominent. The traditional remote sensing classification method has been unable to meet the accuracy requirements of urban vegetation monitoring. Therefore, how to quickly and accurately conduct dynamic monitoring of urban vegetation based on the spectral component characteristics of vegetation is urgent. This study used the data of Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI in 2011, 2014 and 2017 as main information source and LSMM, region of variation grid analysis and other methods to analyse the law of spatial-temporal change of vegetation components in Xi'an urban area and its influencing factors. The result shows that: (1) The average vegetation coverage of the study area from 2011 to 2017 reached more than 50 %, meeting the standard of National Garden City (great than 40 %). The overall vegetation coverage grade was high, but it had a decreasing trend during this period. (2) The vegetation in urban area of Xi'an experienced a significant change. From 2011 to 2017, only 30 % of the low-covered vegetation, 24.39 % of the medium-covered vegetation and 20.15 % of the high-covered vegetation remained unchanged, while the vegetation in the northwest, northeast, southwest and southeast of the edge of the city's third ring changed significantly. (3) The vegetation quality in urban area of Xi'an has decreased from 2011 to 2014 with 6.9 % of vegetation coverage reduced; while from 2014 to 2017, the overall vegetation quality of this area has improved with 2.1 % of the vegetation coverage increased, which was mainly attributed to urban construction and Urban Green Projects. This study not only can obtain the dynamic change information of urban vegetation quickly, but also can provide suggestions and data support for urban planning of ecological environmental protection.

TI  - Using the Negative Soil Adjustment Factor of Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) to Resist Saturation Effects and Estimate Leaf Area Index (LAI) in Dense Vegetation Areas
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Saturation effects limit the application of vegetation indices (VIs) in dense vegetation areas. The possibility to mitigate them by adopting a negative soil adjustment factor X is addressed. Two leaf area index (LAI) data sets are analyzed using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) for validation. The first one is derived from observations of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 16 April 2013, to 21 October 2020, in the Apiacas area. Its corresponding VIs are calculated from a combination of Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 surface reflectance products. The second one is a global LAI dataset with VIs calculated from Landsat-5 surface reflectance products. A linear regression model is applied to both datasets to evaluate four VIs that are commonly used to estimate LAI: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), transformed SAVI (TSAVI), and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). The optimal soil adjustment factor of SAVI for LAI estimation is determined using an exhaustive search. The Dickey-Fuller test indicates that the time series of LAI data are stable with a confidence level of 99%. The linear regression results stress significant saturation effects in all VIs. Finally, the exhaustive searching results show that a negative soil adjustment factor of SAVI can mitigate the SAVIs' saturation in the Apiacas area (i.e., X = -0.148 for mean LAI = 5.35), and more generally in areas with large LAI values (e.g., X = -0.183 for mean LAI = 6.72). Our study further confirms that the lower boundary of the soil adjustment factor can be negative and that using a negative soil adjustment factor improves the computation of time series of LAI.

TI  - Radiometric Performance Evaluation of FY-4A/AGRI Based on Aqua/MODIS
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) is the first satellite of the Chinese second-generation geostationary orbit meteorological satellites (FY-4). The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI), onboard FY-4A does not load with high-precision calibration facility in visible and near infrared (VNIR) channel. As a consequence, it is necessary to comprehensively evaluate its radiometric performance and quantitatively describe the attenuation while using its VNIR data. In this paper, the radiometric performance at VNIR channels of FY-4A/AGRI is evaluated based on Aqua/MODIS data using the deep convective cloud (DCC) target. In order to reduce the influence of view angle and spectral response difference, the bi-directional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) correction and spectral matching have been performed. The evaluation result shows the radiometric performance of FY-4A/AGRI: (1) is less stable and with obvious fluctuations; (2) has a lower radiation level because of 24.99% lower compared with Aqua/MODIS; 3) has a high attenuation with 9.11% total attenuation over 2 years and 4.0% average annual attenuation rate. After the evaluation, relative radiometric normalization between AGRI and MODIS in VNIR channel is performed and the procedure is proved effective. This paper proposed a more reliable reference for the quantitative applications of FY-4A data.

M3  - Article
AB  - This study examines the origins behind the meaning of everyday phrases forming the linguistic world image of Russian speakers. A large corpus of linguistic literature concerns the lexicon and phraseology and only a few studies look at phrases as the most common forms of thought formation in everyday pragmatics. The aim of this study was to identify origins behind the meaning of everyday phrases, and analyze their role and place in the formation and presentation of the linguistic world image in linguistic pragmatics. Unlike most studies, this work examines the problem of the worldview rooted in the language through the content analysis of phrases, rather than single lexemes, and analyzes them in the context of everyday use. The study monitored 128 individuals, aged 18 to 61 years, for three days to determine what phrases they use every day. The collected linguistic data underwent statistical processing and unique categorizes were distinguished. Of these categorizes, only one is likely to convey the linguistic worldview (it contains words with a broad range of meanings and multi-level semantics). The other two categorizes reflect single characteristics of linguistic consciousness and the pragmatics of social interaction. The results of the study may be useful in establishing links between the cognitive and communicative functions of the language and creating a map of the Russian linguistic worldview for the comparative linguistic research purposes.

TI  - The Influence of ENSO and MJO on Drought in Different Ecological Geographic Regions in China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mastering the spatial and temporal differences of ENSO (EI Nino-Southern Oscillation) and MJO (Madden-Julian Oscillation) and their influence on drought is very important for accurately monitoring and forecasting drought. In this study, spatiotemporal characteristics and variability of the impact of ENSO and MJO on drought were analyzed from the perspectives of meteorological drought and agricultural drought through temporal and spatial correlation analyses of China's 48 eco-geographical regions. The results show a strong correlation between drought and ENSO and MJO in general. The spatial correlation coefficients are different, and the response of extreme events varies in different regions. The influence of ENSO and MJO on agricultural drought is higher than that on meteorological drought. ENSO and MJO have a considerable influence on agricultural drought in regions such as the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and Xinjiang, with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.72. A significant influence of ENSO and MJO on meteorological drought was found in the Jiangnan region with the highest correlation coefficient of 0.40. In addition, agricultural drought shows a significant time lag in response to ENSO events. When the lag time is six months, the time series presents the highest correlation coefficient with the mean value of the correlation coefficient reaching 0.38 and the maximum value reaching 0.75. This research is of great significance for understanding the spatiotemporal correlation between climate patterns and drought on a large regional scale and it provides further insights into the teleconnection mechanisms of drought.

TI  - Mapping Groundwater Potential Zones Using a Knowledge-Driven Approach and GIS Analysis
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the Sahara being one of the most arid regions on Earth, it has experienced rainfall conditions in the past and could hold plentiful groundwater resources. Thus, groundwater is one of the most precious water resources in this region, which suffers from water shortage due to the limited rainfall caused by climatic conditions. This article will assess the knowledge-driven techniques employed to develop a model to integrate the multicriteria derived from geologic, geomorphic, structural, seismic, hydrologic, and remotely sensed data. This model was tested on the defunct Kom Ombo area of Egypt's Nile river basin in the eastern Sahara, which covers similar to 28,200 km(2), to reveal the promising areas of groundwater resources. To optimize the output map, we updated the model by adding the automated depression resulting from a fill-difference approach and seismic activity layers combined with other evidential maps, including slope, topography, geology, drainage density, lineament density, soil characteristics, rainfall, and morphometric characteristics, after assigning a weight for each using a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based knowledge-driven approach. The paleochannels and soil characteristics were visualized using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)/Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data. Several hydromorphic characteristics, sinks/depressions, and sub-basin characteristics were extracted using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. The results revealed that the assessed groundwater potential zones (GPZs) can be arranged into five distinctive groups, depending on their probability for groundwater, namely very low (6.56%), low (22.62%), moderate (30.75%), high (29.71%), and very high (10.34%). The downstream areas and Wadi Garara have very high recharge and storage potential. Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence change detection (CCD) derived from Sentinel-1 data revealed a consistency between areas with high InSAR CCD (low change) that received a plausible amount of surface water and those with very low InSAR CCD values close to 0 (high change). Landsat data validated the areas that received runoff and are of high potentiality. The twenty-nine groundwater well locations overlaid on the GPZs, to assess the predicted model, indicated that about 86.17% of the wells were matched with very good to moderate potential zones.

TI  - Impact of Atmospheric Correction on Spatial Heterogeneity Relations Between Land Surface Temperature and Biophysical Compositions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Investigating the relations between land surface temperature (LST) and biophysical compositions can help the understanding of the surface biophysical process. However, there are still uncertainties in determining the impacts of biophysical compositions on LST due to the atmospheric effects. In this article, four atmospheric correction algorithms were used to correct 12 Landsat 8 images in Xi'an, Beijing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, China, including the Atmospheric Correction for Flat Terrain (ATCOR2), Quick Atmospheric Correction (QUAC), Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercube (FLAASH), and Second Simulation of Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum (6S). Then, geodetector was used to investigate the atmospheric correction differences in the spatial heterogeneity relationships between LST and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and bare soil index (BSI). Results indicate that the selected composition factors were greatly improved after atmospheric correction, and the relations between LST and three factors were characterized by obvious atmospheric correction differences in four study areas. On the whole, the 6S algorithm performed the best in improving the factor values and impacting the spatial heterogeneity relations between LST and biophysical compositions, followed by FLAASH, QUAC, and ATCOR2 algorithms. Except for Wuhan, 6S, FLAASH, and QUAC algorithms significantly enhanced the correlation between LST and NDVI. However, all algorithms weakened the correlations between LST, NDVI, and BSI, except Guangzhou. These findings have been verified using the regression analysis. In addition, with geodetector, combinations of any two composition factors all had strongly enhanced impacts on LST, and a combination between NDVI and NDBI performed the strongest in most cases.

TI  - Analysis of the Spatiotemporal Changes in Watershed Landscape Pattern and Its Influencing Factors in Rapidly Urbanizing Areas Using Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyzing the spatiotemporal characteristics and causes of landscape pattern changes in watersheds around big cities is essential for understanding the ecological consequence of urbanization and provides a basic reference for the watershed management. This study used a land-use transition matrix and landscape indices to explore the spatiotemporal change of land use and landscape pattern over Liuxihe River basin of Guangzhou in the southeast of China from 1980 to 2015 with multitemporal Landsat satellite data in response to the rapid urbanization process. Primary temporal and spatial influencing factors were first quantitatively identified through grey relation analysis (calculating correlation degree between land use changes and influencing factors) and Geodetector (detecting landscape spatial heterogeneity and its driving factors), respectively. Considerable spatial and temporal differences in land use and landscape pattern changes were observed herein, thus determining the influencing factors of these differences in the Liuxihe River basin. These changes were characterized by a large increase in construction land converted from cropland, particularly in the middle and lower reaches of the basin from 2000 to 2010, causing dramatic fragmentation and homogenization of the landscape pattern there. Meanwhile, the landscape pattern gradually transitioned from an agricultural land use dominant landscape to a construction land use dominant landscape in these regions. Furthermore, the rapid growth of a nonagricultural population and the transformation of industry primarily caused the temporal changes of landscape pattern, and the landscape spatial heterogeneity was mainly caused by the interaction of complicated geomorphology and anthropogenic activities in different spatial locations, particularly after 2000. This study not only provides an improved approach to quantifying the main spatiotemporal influencing factors of landscape pattern changes during different time periods, but also offers a reference for decision-makers to formulate optimal strategies on ecological protection and urban sustainable development of different regions in this study area.

TI  - Conflict and Climate: Drivers of Fire Activity in Syria in the Twenty-First Century
T2  - EARTH INTERACTIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been 10 years since the start of the Syrian uprisings. While relative stability is improving overall, a new disaster, wildfires, impacted an already food-insecure population by burning through key production areas, damaging crops, soil, and livestock and causing air quality to deteriorate. As observed with remotely sensed data, fire affected 4.8% of Syria in 2019, as compared with the average 0.2%, and most fires were observed within agricultural land in the northeast. Abnormal amounts of rainfall during the 2019 growing season and, consequently, high soil moisture explained about 62% of the drastic increase in the burned area extent. In contrast, in 2020, fires continued despite the average amount of rainfall. Extremely high temperature could partially explain a 10-fold increase in the extent of burned area in 2020 but only within forested regions in the northwest. We argue that the abrupt changes in Syria's fire activity were driven by the complex interactions among conflict, migration, land use, and climate. On one side, the ongoing conflict leads to a drastic increase in the number of accidental and deliberate fires and reduced capacity for fire response. On the other side, years of insecurity, widespread displacement, and economic instability left no choice for locals other than exploiting fires to remove natural vegetation for expanding farming, logging, and charcoal trading. The loss of agricultural production and natural vegetation to fire can have serious implications for food security, soil property, biodiversity, and ecosystem services, which can further exacerbate the already unstable economy and make ongoing violence even more intense.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates the influence of armed and political conflicts on the urban climate, particularly the surface urban heat island (SUHI) of the Baghdad metropolitan area. This study analyzes changes in spatial patterns of land use and land cover and anthropogenic activities that have occurred as a result of wars and political conflicts. Multi-temporal Landsat data for the years 1984, 2001, and 2018 were used to quantify land use land cover (LULC) changes and thermal characteristics of the study area over 35 years. The relationship of intensity of SUHI to informal settlements (slums) and others anthropogenic practices were analyzed. The results indicate that LULC changes were indeed impacted by wars and political conflicts. Land surface temperature increased over time and its spatial-temporal pattern changed noticeably. A significant correlation between intensity of SUHI and informal settlements (slums) was also shown.

TI  - The Impact of COVID-19 on Weather Forecasts: A Balanced View
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aircraft reports are an important source of information for numerical weather prediction (NWP). From March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a large loss of aircraft data but despite this it is difficult to see any evidence of significant degradation in the forecast skill of global NWP systems. This apparent discrepancy is partly because forecast skill is very variable, showing both day-to-day noise and lower frequency dependence on the mean state of the atmosphere. The definitive way to cleanly assess aircraft impact is using a data denial experiment, which shows that the largest impact is in the upper troposphere. The method used by Chen (2020, ) to estimate the impact of COVID-19 is oversimplistic. Chen understates the huge importance of satellite data for modern weather forecasts and raises more alarm than necessary about a drop in forecast accuracy.

TI  - Improvement of Sentinel-1 Remote Sensing Data Classification by DWT and PCA
T2  - JOURNAL OF SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a new alternative for data resource, by applying the proposed methods of Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or of Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) on the VV and VH polarization images of the Sentinel-1 radar satellite, aiming at a better classification of data. The study area concerns the Houareb site located in the city of Kairouan in central Tunisia. In addition to Sentinel-1 data, field truth data and the Euclidian Minimum Distance (EMD) criterion were used for classification and validation. Energy descriptors have been proposed in this study for classifications. Cross validation was used to evaluate the results of the classification. The best classification result was achieved using the DWT method applied on VH and VV images with an Overall Precision (OA) of 0.671 and 0.548, respectively, against an OA value of 0.371 and of 0.449 when the PCA method and the Minimum Distance (MDist) classifier were applied on the dual (VV; VH) polarization, respectively. The DWT transformation gives the highest Kappa Precision Coefficient (KPC) of 0.8.

AB  - Land is split in to land parcels supported size and ownership. This land parcel is that the lowest unit in local level planning of villages in Indian context. During this research, a study was conducted to reinforce land parcel level Biocapacity using soil and water as parameters at villages of Gudiyattam Block, Vellore District. The Gudiyattam block consists of 44 panchayat villages including Gudiyattam town spatially encompasses an outsized area. Planning for such a large region requires significant resources of manpower, time and technology. Additionally, the enhancement of Biocapacity requires land-parcel level information. With the given time and resources, it's impossible to do that. Therefore, Gudiyattam block has been divided into performance zones. From each performance zone one panchayat village is taken into account for the analysis. This research used available data for a given year and validated the land parcel level planning as a reliable method for enhancement of biocapacity. This method also has the potential to be used with high-resolution satellite imagery to capture crop data periodically and use that as a basis for computing biocapacity at land parcel level. Land parcel level planning enables precision farming with high yields to reinforce biocapacity. This research used current crop data at land parcel level to spot the potential for higher yields to reinforce Biocapacity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimating water erosion from the brightness index of orbital images: A framework for the prognosis of degraded pastures
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The inadequate management of soils and the absence of conservation practices favor the degradation of pastures and can trigger adverse environmental alterations and damage under the terms of Brazilian Federal Law no. 6.938/1981. Based on this premise, this study aimed to estimate soil losses caused by water erosion in pasture areas using the brightness index (BI) from the annual series of Landsat 8 images in different geological formations. A specifically prepared Google Earth Engine (GEE) script automatically extracted the BI from the images. The study occurred in the Environmental Protection Area (EPA) of Uberaba River basin (Minas Gerais, Brazil). To accomplish the goal, 180 digital 500-wide random buffers were selected from 3 geologic types (60 points per type), and then analyzed for zonal statistics of USLE (Universal Soil Loss Equation) soil loss and BI in a Geographic Information System. The regression models BI versus USLE soil loss allowed estimating BI soil losses over the pastures of EPA. The model fittings were remarkable. The validation of soil loss maps in the EPA occurred in pasture phytophysiognomies through the probing of penetration resistance in 37 randomly selected locations. The results were satisfactory, mostly those based on the BI. The BI losses increased for greater resistances. Amplified losses also occurred in regions exposed to environmental land use conflicts (actual uses that deviate from land capability or natural use). Overall, the BI approach proved efficient to accurately track soil losses and pasture degradation over large areas, with the advantage of standing on a single parameter easily accessed through remote sensed data. From an environmental standpoint, this is an important result, because the accurate diagnosis and prognosis of degraded pastures is paramount to implement mitigation measures following the "polluter pays principle", even more in Brazil where the areas occupied by degraded pastures are enormous.

TI  - Automatic ultrasound image report generation with adaptive multimodal attention mechanism
T2  - NEUROCOMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Text report writing for medical images is a fundamental task for diagnosis and treatment in clinical medicine. However, this work is tedious and time-consuming because of the special report features (e.g., boundary conditions and fixed templates). The existing works mainly adopt image captioning methods for medical report generation but the special report features are not fully considered in these models. This paper proposes an Adaptive Multimodal Attention network (AMAnet) to generate high-quality medical image reports. First, a Multi-Label Classification network is designed to predict the essential local properties. And then the word embedding vectors of these properties can serve as the semantic features to aid report generation. Second, we develop a semantic attention mechanism to imitate the spatial attention. Third, we introduce an adaptive attention mechanism with a sentinel gate to control the attention level at current visual features and language model memories when generating the next word. Experimental results demonstrate AMAnet outperforms the state-of-the-art image captioning methods with over 1 CIDEr score improvement. (c) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Implementing a new texture-based soil evaporation reduction coefficient in the FAO dual crop coefficient method
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop evapotranspiration (ET) is a fundamental component of the hydrological cycle, especially in arid/semi-arid regions. The FAO-56 offers an operational method for deriving ET from the reduction (dual crop coefficient Kc) of the atmospheric evaporative demand (ET0). The dual coefficient approach (FAO-2Kc) is intended to improve the daily estimation of ET by separating the contribution of bare soil evaporation (E) and crop transpiration components. The FAO-2Kc has been a well-known reference for the operational monitoring of crop water needs. However, its performance for estimating the water use efficiency is limited by uncertainties in the modeled evaporation/transpiration partitioning. This paper aims at improving the soil module of the FAO-2Kc by modifying the E reduction coefficient (Kr) according to soil texture information and state-of-the-art formulations, hence, to amend the mismatch between FAO-2Kc and field-measured data beyond standard conditions. In practice this work evaluates the performance of two evaporation models, using the classical Kr (Kr,FAO) and a new texture-based Kr (Kr,text) over 33 bare soil sites under different evaporative demand and soil conditions. An offline validation is investigated by forcing both models with observed soil moisture (?s) data as input. The Kr,text methodology provides more accurate E estimations compared to the Kr,FAO method and systematically reduces biases. Using Kr,text allows reaching the lowest root means square error (RMSE) of 0.16 mm/day compared to the Kr,FAO where the lowest RMSE reached is 0.88 mm/day. As a step further in the assessment of the proposed methodology, ET was estimated in three wheat fields across the entire agricultural season. Both approaches were thus inter-compared in terms of ET estimates forced by SM estimated as a residual of the water balance model (online validation). Compared to ET measurements, the new formulation provided more accurate results. The RMSE was 0.66 mm/day (0.71 mm/day) and the R2 was 0.83 (0.78) for the texture-based (classical) Kr.

TI  - Assimilation of MWHS-2/FY-3C 183 GHz Channels Using a Dynamic Emissivity Retrieval and Its Impacts on Precipitation Forecasts: A Southwest Vortex Case
T2  - ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic emissivity retrieved from window channels of the microwave humidity sounder II (MWHS-2) onboard the China Meteorological Administration's FengYun (FY)-3C polar orbiting satellite can provide more realistic emissivity over lands and potentially improve the numerical weather prediction (NWP) forecasts. However, whether the assimilation with the dynamic emissivity works for the precipitation forecasts over the complex geography is less investigated. In this paper, a typical precipitating case generated by the Southwest Vortex is selected and the Weather Research and Forecasting data assimilation (WRFDA) system is applied to examine the impacts of assimilating MWHS-2/FY-3C with the uses of the emissivity atlas and the dynamic emissivity on the forecasts. The results indicate that the use of the dynamic emissivity retrieved from the 89 GHz channel of MW HS-2/FY-3C apparently increases the used data number for assimilation and does improve the initial fields and the 24-hour forecasts (from 0000 UTC 24 June 2016 to 0000 UTC 25 June 2016) of precipitation distribution and intensity except for the rainfall over 100 mm. But these positive impacts are not evidently better than those with the emissivity atlas. In general, these results still suggest that the future use of the dynamic emissivity in the assimilation over the complex terrain is promising.

TI  - Analysis of vegetation recovery in areas impacted by bauxite mining in the Amazon Forest
T2  - CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining activity is essential for the Brazilian economy, representing 21% of exports in 2018, but it causes several environmental impacts, including deforestation. To minimize these impacts, replanting techniques are applied for environmental recovery and regulatory compliance. In this context, this study aims to monitor vegetation recovery in decommissioned bauxite mining areas located in the Amazon rainforest. The case study was carried out in the municipality of Paragominas (state of Para). The monitoring used the series of a newly defined spectral index, called Biomass Composite Index (BCI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), both from Landsat images between 1986 and 2017. The analysis was complemented by interpretation of false-color images and by in situ photographs. The method was applied for periods before mining, during exploitation, and after decommissioning, when the traditional planting technique was implemented. BCI demonstrated greater sensitivity to forest disturbance in areas affected by forest degradation and less influence of canopy homogeneity where the forest was substituted by more open formations. The height homogeneity of recovered areas also affected the EVI data more than the BCI data, since these areas presented higher values of EVI, and some areas had index values close to those detected before mine operation. The analysis could have benefited from sampling intensification, with more images analyzed per year, to overcome the presence of clouds, which block the acquisition of surface data by the sensor. Nevertheless, the method proved to be very promising and can improve the evaluation of forest recomposition even in remote areas, besides facilitating large-scale monitoring of recovered forests.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Toward a Better Surface Radiation Budget Analysis Over Sea Ice in the High Arctic Ocean: A Comparative Study Between Satellite, Reanalysis, and local-scale Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reanalysis datasets from atmospheric models and satellite products are often used for Arctic surface shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative budget analyses, but they suffer from limitations and require validation against local-scale observations. These are rare in the high Arctic, especially for longer periods that include seasonal transitions. In this study, radiation and meteorological observations acquired during the Norwegian Young Sea Ice Cruise (N-ICE2015) campaign over sea ice north of Svalbard (80-83 degrees N, 5-25 degrees E) from January-June 2015, cloud lidar observations from the Ice-Atmosphere-Ocean Observing System and the Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization are compared to daily and monthly satellite retrievals from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalysis. Results indicate that surface temperature is a significant driver for winter LW radiation biases in both satellite and reanalysis data, along with cloud optical depth in CERES. In May, the SW and LW downwelling irradiances are close to observations and cloud properties are well captured (except for ERA-Interim), while SW upward irradiances are biased low due to surface albedo biases in all datasets. Net SW and LW radiation biases are comparable (similar to 20-30 Wm(-2)) but opposite in sign for ERA-Interim and CERES in May, which allows for error compensation. Biases reduce to +/- 10 Wm(-2) in ERA5. In June downward LW remains biased low (8-10 Wm(-2)) in all datasets suggesting unsettled cloud representation issues. Surface albedo always differs by more than 0.1 between datasets, leading to significant SW and total flux differences.

TI  - A Lagrangian Perspective on Tropical Anvil Cloud Lifecycle in Present and Future Climate
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of tropical anvil clouds from their origin in deep convective cores to their slow decay determines the climatic effects of clouds in tropical convective regions. Despite the relevance of anvil clouds for climate and responses of clouds to global warming, processes dominating their evolution are not well understood. Currently available observational data reveal instantaneous snapshots of anvil cloud properties, but cannot provide a process-based perspective on anvil evolution. We therefore conduct simulations with the high resolution version of the exascale earth system model in which we track mesoscale convective systems over the tropical Western Pacific and compute trajectories that follow air parcels detrained from peaks of convective activity. With this approach we gain new insight into the anvil cloud evolution both in present day and future climate.Comparison with geostationary satellite data shows that the model is able to simulate maritime mesoscale convective systems reasonably well. Trajectory results indicate that anvil cloud lifetime is about 15 h with no significant change in a warmer climate. The anvil ice mixing ratio is larger in a warmer climate due to a larger source of ice by detrainment and larger depositional growth leading to a more negative net cloud radiative effect along detrained trajectories. However, the increases in sources are counteracted by increases in sinks of ice, particularly snow formation and sedimentation. Furthermore, we find that the mean anvil cloud feedback along trajectories is positive and consistent with results from more traditional cloud feedback calculation methods.

T2  - JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover change analyses have an essential role in forest management. Thus, this study adopted Landsat satellite imagery to assess the decadal spatiotemporal forest cover changes that occurred between 1989 and 2019 and predicted the 2029 land cover distribution of the Nkandla forest reserve, facing encroachment threats. The support vector machine algorithm and Land Change Modeling were utilized to classify and detect changes that occurred between 1989-1999, 1999-2009, 2009-2019. The Markov Chain Model and Multi-Layer Perceptron were adopted for the future land cover prediction. Consistent changes through inter-transitioning between the land cover types (closed canopy forest, open canopy forest, grassland, and bare sites) were detected. The closed canopy forest increased from 883.46 ha to 1059.23 ha, whereas the open canopy forest declined from 1091.89 ha to 910.60 ha between 1989 and 2019. Generally, the observed changes were caused by ecological processes and human disturbances. The future cover prediction indicated that the closed canopy forest will decline between 2019 and 2029, whereas the open canopy forest, grassland, and bare sites will increase. The information provided through this study will support the management of the Nkandla forest to ensure its continual supply of ecosystem services of national and global importance.

TI  - New Inventory of Dust Emission Sources in Central Asia and Northwestern China Derived From MODIS Imagery Using Dust Enhancement Technique
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The first inventory of dust emission sources in Central Asia and northwestern China (35-50 degrees N, 50-100 degrees E) derived from the twice daily MODIS imagery from 2003 to 2012 is presented. A high-resolution (1 km) dust enhancement product was generated to produce maps of dust point sources (DPS), indicating geographical locations of the observed dust emissions, and gridded data sets of dust emission frequencies. About 13,500 DPS were detected over an area of similar to 5 x 10(6) km(2), however, their distribution was uneven. The highest frequency of DPS occurred in the northern and eastern Taklimakan, in the Aralkum, and in the regions, which were not widely reported in literature before, the Balkh delta in northern Afghanistan and the pre-Aral, from the northern Caspian coast to the Betpak-Dala desert in Kazakhstan. South of the Aral, DPS were mainly associated with fluvial features: drying lakes, dry river beds, alluvial deposits and agricultural activity which is closely linked to water availability in this arid region. In the pre-Aral and Balkhash-Junggar regions, land damaged by wildfire was the main source of dust. In China and eastern Kazakhstan dust emissions peaked in spring; in Central Asia and western Kazakhstan-in summer. The Aralkum was active throughout the year with a positive trend in emission frequency over the study period. Locations of DPS did not always correlate with high atmospheric optical depth (AOD) particularly west of the Aral and in the southern Taklimakan where few DPS were detected despite the high AOD values. This was attributed to dust transport from the upwind sources.

TI  - Evaluation of groundwater potential using Dempster-Shafer model and sensitivity analysis of effective factors: A case study of north Khuzestan province
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to optimize the management of groundwater resources, accurate measurement of groundwater potential is necessary. Application of learning models and remote sensing is very encouraging in reducing the costs of groundwater potential measurement. In this research, Dempster-Shafer learning model and remote sensing data are used to evaluate the groundwater potential in the north of Khuzestan. The study area has a semi-arid climate and is mostly covered by quaternary sediments except for the north, which is mountainous and different geological formations are seen there. For this purpose, 9 parameter layers including: lithology, soil type, slope percent, land use, altitude, TWI index, lineament density, river density and distance from the river as the most effective parameters in groundwater potential are prepared. Additionally, 474 wells in high potential areas have been selected as suitable real data for training and testing of the model. In the training phase, the weights of the layers were calculated using Dempster-Shafer model based on real data of 70% of wells then the groundwater potential map was obtained by combining the weighted layers. To confirm the efficiency of the model and the accuracy of the groundwater potential map, the ROC curve is plotted on the basis of 30% of wells that were not used during the training phase. The results show that the final groundwater potential map is 86% accurate. After verifying the efficiency of the model, sensitivity analysis of effective parameters in predicting groundwater potential is performed using map removal sensitivity analysis method. The results show that all of the considered parameters have a positive effect on groundwater potential prediction accuracy. However, lithology, soil type, and slope percent are the most effective on the accuracy of the model.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fires globally cause severe losses in vegetation, soil and habitats and inevitably have direct and indirect negative environmental impacts such as deforestation, climate change and drought. According to the official records, there has been an increase of 58% in the number of the forest fires in Turkey in the last 30 years, between 1988 and 2018. Therefore, it is vital to determine the forest fire risks in the country and develop more effective methodologies to mitigate them. From this point, in the first phase, forest fire risk map of Kutahya-oren region was prepared via the analyses of a variety of spatial data using geographical information system capabilities. The visibility analysis for the current fire towers was also performed. The results showed that very-high and high-risk, moderate-risk and low-risk zones respectively comprised 36.86%, 60.39% and 2.76% of the total study area, and 82.8% of the region was visible from the towers. In the second phase of the study, remote sensing methods were utilized for the detection of the areas burned in October 2001 in oren-camdibi region, which was officially recorded as 4 hectares. The results revealed that the actual amount of the burned area was 5.6 hectares, and 83% of the burned surfaces was classified as moderate-risk areas in the fire risk map, while 17% of it was that of very-high and high-risk zones.

TI  - Iterative detail-preserving thin-cloud removal method for panchromatic remote sensing images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing images are frequently affected by clouds, haze, and mist in the atmosphere. We introduce an iterative minimization light-cloud removal method designed for the specific quality improvement needs of military reconnaissance panchromatic remote sensing images. The proposed method is required to fulfill the military reconnaissance demands for improvements in the quality of panchromatic high-resolution images while guaranteeing high fidelity between the restored and observed images. A heuristic approach based on contrast enhancement is proposed to solve the thin-cloud removal problem. We design the target function of a minimization algorithm that contains a fidelity term, a contrast penalty term, and an information loss penalty term. By minimizing the target function with the iterative steepest descent method, a high-quality image can be restored from the observed satellite cloudy image, and the details are preserved by the penalty terms. The application of our iterative method to Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite data shows that the iterative method was applicable to GF-1 and ZY-3 satellite and the data showed that for panchromatic remote sensing images, the proposed method could reduce satellite image degradation caused by haze and thin clouds while preserving the details in the observed images.

TI  - Atmospheric and sunglint correction for retrieving chlorophyll-<i>a</i> in a productive tropical estuarine-lagoon system using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote monitoring of chlorophyll-a (chla) has been widely used to evaluate the trophic state of inland and coastal waters, however, there is still much uncertainty in the algorithms applied in different optical water types. The influence of different atmospheric correction (AC) processors, which can also provide correction for sunglint and adjacency effects, on the retrieved chla is poorly understood. In this study, state-of-the-art atmospheric correction and chla algorithms are evaluated using Sentinel-2 MSI imagery in the Mundau-Manguaba Estuarine-Lagoon System (MMELS), a productive tropical system that consists of two turbid lagoons of different optical water types (OWT). We compared the performance of six AC processors, with the addition of sunglint correction for two of them, with field measured water reflectance. There was difficulty in correcting for the atmospheric effects, especially for bands 2, 3 and 8A. Overall, C2X showed the best performance over MMELS, but with sunglint correction, ACOLITE and GRS provided the most consistent water reflectance (rho(w)). Sunglint correction might be essential for retrieving accurate rho(w) in most low-latitude water bodies. We also found that in Mundau, the dense urban area surrounding it likely caused heavy adjacency effects in the satellite-retrieved reflectance, and thus correction for it is necessary. We also compared the performance of six chla algorithms recommended for the OWTs present in MMELS in addition to a widely applied and a global chla algorithm in retrieving this variable using both field and satellite reflectance, in this case corrected with the three best performing processors. For the in situ data, most algorithms performed well in Manguaba lagoon, while in Mundau lagoon the semi-analytical NIR-red ratio (2SAR) algorithm was the most consistent model, and in both cases the locally calibrated algorithms outperformed the global algorithm. When retrieving chla with the satellite-derived rho(w), considerably poorer results were produced, especially in Mundau lagoon. The global algorithm was found to be especially sensitive to the atmospheric effects. We also found that the quality of AC provided by the algorithms is not a general predictor of the performance of the chla models, even when analysing individual bands separately, while the relationship between chla concentration and the ratio of bands used by most algorithms can be. Despite containing distinct water characteristics, chla can be modelled using a single algorithm, 2SAR, calibrated for MMELS as a whole, with r(2) of 0.77 and nRMSE of 38.7%, and we consider that 2SAR has the potential to be a global algorithm for these OWTs, provided that it is recalibrated for a large dataset of satellite-derived BOA reflectance. We recommend that further studies explore the impacts of AC, sunglint and adjacency effects on the performance of chla algorithms, in order to delineate the most suitable combinations of AC + chla algorithms for the variable OWTs, in an effort to provide the basis for global-scale retrievals of this pigment using medium-resolution sensors such as MSI and OLI.

TI  - Cyanobacterial bloom phenology in Saginaw Bay from MODIS and a comparative look with western Lake Erie
T2  - HARMFUL ALGAE
M3  - Article
AB  - Saginaw Bay and western Lake Erie basin (WLEB) are eutrophic catchments in the Laurentian Great Lakes that experience annual, summer-time cyanobacterial blooms. Both basins share many features including similar size, shallow depths, and equivalent-sized watersheds. They are geographically close and both basins derive a preponderance of their nutrient supply from a single river. Despite these similarities, the bloom phenology in each basin is quite different. The blooms in Saginaw Bay occur at the same time and place and at the same moderate severity level each year. The WLEB, in contrast, exhibits far greater interannual variability in the timing, location, and severity of the bloom than Saginaw Bay, consistent with greater and more variable phosphorus inputs. Saginaw Bay has bloom biomass that corresponds to relatively mild blooms in WLEB, and also has equivalent phosphorus loads. This result suggests that if inputs of P into the WLEB were reduced to similarly sized loads as Saginaw Bay the most severe blooms would be abated. Above 500 t P input, which occur in WLEB, blooms increase non-linearly indicating any reduction in P-input at the highest inputs levels currently occurring in the WLEB, would yield disproportionately large reductions in cyanobacterial bloom intensity. As the maximum phosphorus loads in Saginaw Bay lie just below this inflection point, shifts in the Saginaw Bay watershed toward greater agriculture uses and less wetlands may substantially increase the risk of more intense cyanobacterial blooms than presently occur.

TI  - The small molecule ZY-214-4 may reduce the virulence of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> by inhibiting pigment production
T2  - BMC MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundIn recent years, clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolates have become highly resistant to antibiotics, which has raised concerns about the ability to control infections by these organisms. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of a new small molecule, ZY-214-4 (C19H11BrNO4), on S. aureus pigment production.ResultsAt the concentration of 4 mu g/mL, ZY-214-4 exerted a significant inhibitory effect on S. aureus pigment synthesis, without affecting its growth or inducing a toxic effect on the silkworm. An oxidant sensitivity test and a whole-blood killing test indicated that the S. aureus survival rate decreased significantly with ZY-214-4 treatment. Additionally, ZY-214-4 administration significantly reduced the expression of a pigment synthesis-related gene (crtM) and the superoxide dismutase genes (sodA) as determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis. ZY-214-4 treatment also improved the survival rate of S. aureus-infected silkworm larvae.ConclusionsThe small molecule ZY-214-4 has potential for the prevention of S. aureus infections by reducing the virulence associated with this bacterium.

TI  - Assessing land use and land cover change in Los Molinos reservoir watershed and the effect on the reservoir water quality
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and modelling land use and land cover (LULC) change have become one of the major subjects of interest for environmental management due to the negative effects that human activities generate on the normal functioning and dynamics of freshwater resources. Remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) are essential tools for assessing the drivers that cause LULC change and its relationship with lake and reservoir water quality. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of LULC change in the watershed of Los Molinos reservoir (Argentina), and to investigate its relationship with the reservoir's water quality. Four Landsat imagery was used to analyse the LULC change in the studied watershed and in different buffer zones from 1990 to 2020. Further, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from a MODIS time-series dataset (2001-2020) was used to explain the effects of LULC change on the status of the reservoir. Results showed that the most significant LULC change started two decades ago and it has intensified during the last ten years. This change is related to the intensification of agriculture activities, and to the increasing conversion into urban areas, mainly on the shores of Los Molinos reservoir. During the period 2010-2020, urbanization located in the 1 km buffer zone defined from the shore of the reservoir increased at an annual rate of 18.02%. The degradation trend of LULC in Los Molinos watershed significantly contributed to the degradation of water quality of the reservoir. This was corroborated by analysing the MODIS NDVI time-series, which showed that since 2014 the NDVI trend-line presented an increasing behaviour and extreme values of NDVI, related to algal blooms, were more frequently observed.

TI  - Terrestrial Inputs Shape Coastal Bacterial and Archaeal Communities in a High Arctic Fjord (Isfjorden, Svalbard)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is experiencing dramatic changes including increases in precipitation, glacial melt, and permafrost thaw, resulting in increasing freshwater runoff to coastal waters. During the melt season, terrestrial runoff delivers carbon- and nutrient-rich freshwater to Arctic coastal waters, with unknown consequences for the microbial communities that play a key role in determining the cycling and fate of terrestrial matter at the land-ocean interface. To determine the impacts of runoff on coastal microbial (bacteria and archaea) communities, we investigated changes in pelagic microbial community structure between the early (June) and late (August) melt season in 2018 in the Isfjorden system (Svalbard). Amplicon sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were generated from water column, river and sediment samples collected in Isfjorden along fjord transects from shallow river estuaries and glacier fronts to the outer fjord. Community shifts were investigated in relation to environmental gradients, and compared to river and marine sediment microbial communities. We identified strong temporal and spatial reorganizations in the structure and composition of microbial communities during the summer months in relation to environmental conditions. Microbial diversity patterns highlighted a reorganization from rich communities in June toward more even and less rich communities in August. In June, waters enriched in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) provided a niche for copiotrophic taxa including Sulfitobacter and Octadecabacter. In August, lower DOC concentrations and Atlantic water inflow coincided with a shift toward more cosmopolitan taxa usually associated with summer stratified periods (e.g., SAR11 Clade Ia), and prevalent oligotrophic marine clades (OM60, SAR92). Higher riverine inputs of dissolved inorganic nutrients and suspended particulate matter also contributed to spatial reorganizations of communities in August. Sentinel taxa of this late summer fjord environment included taxa from the class Verrucomicrobiae (Roseibacillus, Luteolibacter), potentially indicative of a higher fraction of particle-attached bacteria. This study highlights the ecological relevance of terrestrial runoff for Arctic coastal microbial communities and how its impacts on biogeochemical conditions may make these communities susceptible to climate change.

TI  - Simulation of soil water content through the combination of meteorological and satellite data
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent investigations have supported the possibility of predicting soil water content (SWC) through a simplified soil water balance (WB) model fed with remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (ETa) estimates. This approach, however, requires information on main soil features (i.e. depth, wilting point, field capacity) which are generally difficult to retrieve over large regions. The current paper proposes an alternative model which directly predicts SWC relying on the same logic of the recently proposed ETa estimation method, i.e. the combination of meteorological and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets. The theoretical bases of the old and new SWC estimation methods are first described. Both methods are then applied in Central Italy using ancillary and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI data having a spatial resolution of 250 m; the outputs obtained are assessed versus SWC measurements taken both continuously and instantaneously. In the former case three ecosystems are analyzed (i.e. the grassland of Amplero and the forests of Barbialla and Amiata), where SWC was measured by probes during three different years (2003, 2012 and 2018, respectively). The latter experiment concerns 362 sample sites where SWC gravimetric measurements were taken during a similar time span (2000-2018). In both cases SWC is first normalized into relative SWC (RSWC), which is more directly influential on vegetation conditions. The results of both experiments indicate that the two simulation methods perform similarly when the former is driven by adequate information on soil features. The main limitations of the two simulation approaches are due to the spatial resolution mismatch between SWC measurements and estimates, which has a relatively minor impact on the first three homogeneous areas but is decisive for the other sampled sites. In general, the new simulation method is capable of predicting RSWC with relatively high spatial and temporal resolution without the use of specific soil information.

TI  - Mean spectral reflectance from bare soil pixels along a Landsat-TM time series to increase both the prediction accuracy of soil clay content and mapping coverage
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Visible, near-infrared and short wave infrared (VNIR/SWIR, 400-2500 nm) remote sensing imagery is a useful tool for topsoil property mapping, but limited to bare soils pixels. With the increasing amount of freely available VNIR/SWIR satellite imagery (e.g. Landsat TM, ETM+, OLI and Sentinel-2A/B), extensive time series data can be exploited to increase the spatial coverage of bare soil derived information. The objective of this study was to evaluate the benefits of using a bare soil image created from the mean spectral reflectance from bare soil pixels along a time series, compared to a single-date image. The benefits were analyzed in term of (i) proportion of soil mapping and (ii) accuracy of clay content prediction. The study was conducted over the Cap-Bon region (Northern Tunisia) which is a pedologically contrasted and cultivated area. To this end, 262 topsoil samples and three Landsat-TM images acquired during the summer season were used. Multiple linear regression (MLR) models based on the multi-date and single-date Landsat-derived spectral dataset were performed to quantify clay soil content. Our results have shown that (1) a bare soil image created from only mean spectral reflectance from common bare soil pixels along a time series provided the best accuracy of clay content prediction (i.e., coefficient of determination of validation (R-val(2)) of 0.75, a root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 88 g/kg) with a moderate bare soil coverage (i.e., 23% of the study area); (2) a bare soil image created from a mix of mean spectral reflectance from common bare soil pixels along a time series and of spectral reflectance from bare soil pixels of single-date images provided acceptable accuracy of clay content prediction (i.e., R-val(2) = 0.64, RMSEP = 109 g/kg) with a relatively high bare soil coverage (i.e., 44% of the study area); and (3) all the bare soil images provided similar spatial structures of the clay content predictions. With the actual availability of the VNIR/SWIR satellite imagery for the entire globe, this study offer a simple and accurate method for delivering accurate soil property maps over large areas, to the geoscience community.

M3  - Article
AB  - The biennial report of Vietnam includes updated information on the greenhouse gas emissions for the base years which are specified by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change for reporting on greenhouse gas emissions by member nations of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The estimation of greenhouse gas emissions in general and carbon emissions in particular in the field of land use, land use change, and forestry using advanced technology to provide the input data was recommended. Remote sensing technology with transparency, multi-time characteristics, and wide coverage is useful in this area. An experiment on carbon emission estimation was carried out based on land cover change over ten years between 2002 and 2012. The results obtained by remote sensing data classification for the land cover categories achieved a reliability of 68% for the year 2002 and 67% for the year 2012. Data in relation to the land cover change, soil zoning, and ecological/climate zoning in the Vietnamese mainland, through the process of integrating, processing, and synthesizing data, and using the reported activity data and carbon emission coefficients, were input into the Agriculture and Land Use Greenhouse Gas Inventory Software for carbon emission estimations based on the quality control and quality assurance work.

M3  - Article
AB  - The NWCSAF (Support to Nowcasting and Very Short Range Forecasting Satellite Application Facility) software package provides operational products that ensure the optimum use of meteorological satellite data in Nowcasting and Very Short Range Forecasting. The National Observatory of Athens operates NWCSAF since 2016. The rainfall estimates obtained by the Convective Rainfall Rate (CRR) nighttime algorithm and the Convective Rainfall Rate from Cloud Physical Properties (CRR-Ph) algorithm of the 2016 version are verified against rainfall observations provided by the dense network of automated surface weather stations operated by the National Observatory of Athens (NOA) for a full year. For the verification a temporal upscaling to 30 min was applied to all datasets. Overall, CRR overestimates the extent of the precipitation areas while at the same time it underestimates the precipitation totals. CRR-Ph clearly outperforms the CRR nighttime algorithm regarding the accurate delineation of precipitation areas but it overestimates the precipitation totals. Heavier precipitation is consistently detected by both algorithms although the false alarms rate is high. Seasonal variations are found, with the most important the poorer estimation performance during spring.

TI  - Differential Morphological Profile on remote sensing images for vegetation mapping in a semi-arid region of the Algerian Saharan Atlas
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Review
AB  - In this paper, a new approach for mapping polygenic depressions colonised by vegetation is presented. These spatially periodic vegetation patterns situated in the arid areas of North Africa are known locally as "Dayas". The mapping of these structures is an important component in monitoring their evolution which can be regarded as an indicator of socio-environmental conditions. For this purpose, a method based on satellite image analysis is proposed. First, Landsat Thematic Mapper image inspection is performed to highlight the vegetation spots using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Then, a Differential Morphological Profile (DMP) which includes both spectral and morphological information, is built for each NDVI pixel. We adapt the F-Score technique combined with the SVM classifier, to select and classify the most effective DMP images in order to extract the Daya?s signature. Using feature selection, overall classification accuracy reached 97.8% with a kappa value of 95.61 but also reduced the dimension of the DMP vector. Dayas? morphological and vegetation characteristics are related to their degree of evolution. Furthermore, we categorise categorise the 170 extracted Dayas into three classes according to their size. On the resulting map, each class corresponds to a specific morphological and vegetation evolution stage.

TI  - Spatial modeling of land use and land cover change in Sulaimani, Iraq, using multitemporal satellite data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/land cover (LULC) change is an important indicator used for assessing the function and health of ecosystems. Understanding the patterns of LULC change assists in managing natural resources effectively, especially for regions where there are minimal or no reported data on the status of LULC. In this study, remotely sensed Landsat satellite imagery from 5 years (i.e., 1988, 1996, 2002, 2008, and 2017), geographic information systems (GIS), and the hybrid cellular automata (CA)-Markov model were used to (i) quantify the past and present LULC changes and (ii) model the future changes in Sulaimani Province in the Kurdistan region of Iraq (KRI). To accomplish these objectives, five LULC maps with various class categories were generated using the maximum likelihood classifier (MCL). The classified maps for 1996, 2002, 2008, and 2017 were used in the hybrid model to simulate LULC maps for 2017 and 2037. The map simulated for 2017 was validated with the classified 2017 LULC map. The change analysis demonstrated that between 1988 and 2017, the built-up areas and agricultural fallow land increased by 419% and 226%, respectively. In the future predictions for 2037, built-up areas and agricultural fallow land showed increasing trends of 5.5% and 26.5%, respectively. In contrast, agricultural land, plantation land, and sparse vegetation areas were predicted to decrease by 29.4%, 65.8%, and 36.9%, respectively. In addition, in 2008, waterbodies shrank by 43.36% in comparison with their status in 1988, suggesting that 2008 was a severe drought year. These findings provide invaluable baseline information with which conservation biologists, agricultural engineers, urban planners, and decision makers can better manage natural resources and monitor environmental changes. Based on these results, sustainable development actions and an early warning system can be established.

TI  - Epidemiological trends of imported infectious diseases in Japan: Analysis of imported 2-year infectious disease registry data
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFECTION AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The epidemiology of infectious diseases in Japan remains undefined despite the increasing tourism. GeoSentinel, an epidemiological surveillance system for reporting imported infectious diseases, has only two participating facilities in Japan. Although the number of infectious diseases is reported by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, there is no detailed clinical information about these cases. Therefore, we established J-RIDA (Japan Registry for Infectious Diseases from Abroad) to clarify the status of imported infectious diseases in Japan and provide detailed information.Methods: J-RIDA was started as a registry of imported infectious diseases. Case registration began in October 2017. Between October 2017 and September 2019, 15 medical institutions participated in this clinical study. The registry collected information about the patient's age, sex, nationality, chief complaint, consultation date, date of onset, whether visit was made to a travel clinic before travel, blood test results (if samples were collected), travel history, and final diagnosis.Results: Of the 3046 cases included in this study, 46.7% to Southeast Asia, 13.0% to Africa, 13.7% to East Asia, 11.5% to South Asia, 7.5% to Europe, 3.8% to Central and South America, 4.6% to North America, 3.9% to Oceania, and 2.8% to Central and west Asia. More than 85% of chief complaints were fever and general symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, respiratory symptoms, or dermatologic problems. The most common diseases were travelers' diarrhea, animal bite, upper respiratory infection, influenza, and dengue fever.Conclusions: We summarized two-year cases registered in Japan's imported infectious disease registry. These results will significantly contribute to the epidemiology in Japan. (c) 2020 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Adaptive Superpixel-Level CFAR Detector for SAR Inshore Dense Ship Detection
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ship monitoring is an important application of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The constant false alarm rate (CFAR) methods are commonly used for ship detection. However, CFAR detectors usually face challenges for inshore dense ship detection. Due to the significant mixture of ship candidates and sea clutters within the clutter window, the detection threshold may be overestimated leading to many missed detections. To mitigate this issue, a superpixel-level CFAR detector is proposed. The main contribution contains two aspects. First, a labeling procedure is established for pure clutter superpixels and mixture superpixels discrimination in terms of unsupervised clustering. Second, a nonlocal topology strategy is proposed to adaptively determine a sufficient number of pure clutter superpixels for detection threshold estimation. In this vein, an adaptive superpixel-level CFAR approach is constructed and validated with Radarsat-2, Sentinel-1, and AIRSARShip-1 data sets. Comparison studies demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Compared with a traditional CFAR detector and two recent superpixel methods, the proposed method achieves clearly better performance for inshore dense ship regions.

TI  - Natural forest regeneration in Chernobyl Exclusion Zone: predictive mapping and model diagnostics
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the nuclear disaster of 1986, forests have established throughout the abandoned agricultural landscapes within Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (ChEZ). However, they are yet to be monitored properly. Their biometrical parameters need a robust assessment considering climate change mitigation potential and wildfire-induced risks. To predict basal area (BA) and growing stock volume (GSV) of these forests using spatially explicit approach, we utilized Sentinel-2 satellite data and three types of machine learning models (k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)). Root mean square error among all models ranged between 5.2 m(2) ha(-1) (49% of the mean) and 7.2 m(2) ha(-1) (71% of the mean), derived for BA by the GBM and k-NN models, respectively. While total and mean estimates of forest attributes were quite similar within an entire ChEZ, GBM approach outperformed other methods by predicting GSV more precisely when compared to local reference data. At the same time, k-NN approach has shown better performance in terms of preserving the initial empirical distribution and semivariation patterns. We concluded that k-NN method should be used for the spatial predictions of forest attributes, however, with a specific focus given on the training data set quality and profound model validation.

M3  - Article
AB  - Head and neck cancers (HNC) are defined as malignant tumours located in the upper aerodigestive tract and represents 5% of oncologic cases in adults in Spain. More than 90% of these tumours have squamous histology. In an effort to incorporate evidence obtained since 2017 publication, the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology (SEOM) presents an update of the squamous cell HNC diagnosis and treatment guideline. Most relevant diagnostic and therapeutic changes from the last guideline have been updated: introduction of sentinel node biopsy in early oral/oropharyngeal cancer treated with surgery, concomitant radiotherapy with weekly cisplatin 40 mg/m(2) in the adjuvant setting, new approaches for HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer and new treatments with immune-checkpoint inhibitors in recurrent/metastatic disease.

TI  - Improved Dust Detection over East Asia Using Geostationary Satellite Data
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents an improved algorithm, based on the D*-parameter, for dust detection over the East Asian region using brightness temperature differences (BTDs) between the infrared channels of the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard Himawari-8. The developed algorithm defines a dust index in the form of the ratio of BTDs: BTD between the 10.4 mu m and 12.4 mu m channels (BTD10.4-12.4) to that between the 8.6 mu m and 10.4 mu m channels (BTD8.6-10.4). To identify dust with this index, threshold values were determined empirically. A masking technique using the BTD8.6-10.4 was utilized in the dust index to mitigate the problem of detecting clear-sky deserts and fog over the ocean as dust. BTD8.6-10.4 was analyzed for dust, clear-sky desert, and fog over the ocean cases during 2017 and 2018 with this method. Fog over the ocean and clear-sky desert were distinguished by the criteria of BTD8.6-10.4 > -1.1 K and BTD8.6-10.4 > -1 K, respectively. Based on these thresholds, the influence of fog over the ocean and clear-sky desert was filtered out. The results showed that the dust area was qualitatively consistent with RGB images and ground observation data. Comparison with the AERONET aerosol optical depth (AOD) demonstrated that the D*-parameter was exponentially proportional to AOD, and the correlation coefficient between them was approximately 0.6. The improved Asian Dust detection algorithm can be applied to the monitoring of dust dispersion and movement and also serve as a quantitative indicator of Asian Dust.

TI  - Initialization of WRF Model Simulations With Sentinel-1 Wind Speed for Severe Weather Events
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The model initialization with high-resolution SAR wind data provided by the Sentinel-1 mission and its impact on the meteorological model WRF-ARW simulations is discussed. The activity is performed within the Horizon 2020 CEASELESS project, focusing on one of the target areas, the northern Adriatic Sea (northern-central Mediterranean). The Sentinel-1 SAR wind is ingested into LAPS, a numerical system developed at NOAA, specifically designed for data analysis and nowcasting issues, since it has the advantage of being faster and less computational demanding than advanced data assimilation methods. Here, LAPS analyses are used to perform a smarter initialization of the WRF-ARW model simulations than using simply global model fields. The impact of the Sentinel-1 SAR wind on the model simulations is evaluated for twenty cases, ranging through several atmospheric conditions occurring in different seasons of the years 2014-2018. For each case study, a reference WRF-ARW simulation is forced with GFS analysis and forecasts used as initial and boundary conditions, respectively. Additional model runs are initialized with the LAPS analyses, which include the information of Sentinel-1 SAR wind, METAR data and the SEVIRI/MSG (Eumetsat) brightness temperature. A statistical evaluation of the WRF-ARW simulations is performed versus an independent set of surface records, provided by the Friuli Venezia Giulia regional station network (northeastern Italy), and METAR data. The comparison is performed for 10 m wind, 2 m air and dew point temperature. The results show a positive, albeit modest, impact on the WRF model simulations initialized with the LAPS analyses. The initialization with the Sentinel-1 SAR wind show benefits for all surface variables. Finally, a Mediterranean tropical-like cyclone (Medicane), occurred in the Ionian Sea in November 2017, is considered in order to show how the use of Sentinel wind data can contribute to a better analysis and simulation of severe weather episodes in the Mediterranean. The improvement in the simulation of the pressure minimum location is remarkable.

TI  - Gharial nesting in a reservoir is limited by reduced river flow and by increased bank vegetation
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The gharial (Gavialis gangeticus Gmelin) is a fish-eating specialist crocodylian, endemic to south Asia, and critically endangered in its few remaining wild localities. A secondary gharial population resides in riverine-reservoir habitat adjacent to the Nepal border, within the Katerniaghat Wildlife Sanctuary (KWS), and nests along a 10 km riverbank of the Girwa River. A natural channel shift in the mainstream Karnali River (upstream in Nepal) has reduced seasonal flow in the Girwa stretch where gharials nest, coincident with a gradual loss of nest sites, which in turn was related to an overall shift to woody vegetation at these sites. To understand how these changes in riparian vegetation on riverbanks were related to gharial nesting, we sampled vegetation at these sites from 2017 to 2019, and derived an Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from LANDSAT 8 satellite data to quantify riverside vegetation from 1988 through 2019. We found that sampled sites transitioned to woody cover, the number of nesting sites declined, and the number of nests were reduced by>40%. At these sites, after the channel shift, woody vegetation replaced open sites that predominated prior to the channel shift. Our findings indicate that the lack of open riverbanks and the increase in woody vegetation at potential nesting sites threatens the reproductive success of the KWS gharial population. This population persists today in a regulated river ecosystem, and nests in an altered riparian habitat which appears to be increasingly unsuitable for the continued successful recruitment of breeding adults. This second-ranking, critically endangered remnant population may have incurred an "extinction debt" by living in a reservoir that will lead to its eventual extirpation.

TI  - Modeling the angular effect of MODIS LST in urban areas: A case study of Toulouse, France
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observation of land surface temperature (LST) is an important tool for monitoring urban thermal environments but is prone to significant angular effects over non-isothermal pixels characterized by the substantial three-dimensional (3D) structure of urban areas. However, accurately characterizing the urban thermal anisotropy at the satellite pixel scale is still challenging. In this paper, comparing the simultaneous airborne observations and the temporal-aggregated signal from MODIS LST, we further investigate the seasonal and diurnal patterns of thermal anisotropy in urban areas with various simulation scenarios. The anisotropy was defined as the difference between off-nadir and nadir temperatures. First, a realistic morphological representation of urban surfaces as well as urban component temperatures measured by infrared thermometers (IRTs) were input into the discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model to simulate MODIS-scale anisotropy for Toulouse, France in summer. Extending this 'IRT-DART' method to other seasons was restricted because the IRTs' radiative source areas are affected by shadows when the sun elevation is low, meaning that measured sunlit temperatures are not reliably available. An energy balance model, TUF3D, and a sensor view model, SUM, for simplified urban geometry were coupled to replace 'IRT-DART' in winter. The cross-comparison shows that 'TUF-SUM' can simulate MODIS-scale anisotropy if urban structure and materials are relatively homogeneous, which provides a basis for assessing anisotropy when IRT sunlit temperatures are unavailable. The MODIS anisotropy is subject to a strong diurnal yet a discernable seasonal variation. For example, for a mid-latitude city, the anisotropy over all MODIS view angles reaches up to 6.6 K for Terra-Day (around 11:00 local time) and 4.9 K for Aqua-Day (around 13:00) in summer, and 6.1 K for Terra-Day and 4.0 K for Aqua-Day in winter. Nocturnal anisotropy is weak with values less than 0.2 K. The modeling methods can be used to quantify anisotropy of satellite LST in a broad range of urban environments and facilitate the use of multi-angular MODIS LST for a better assessment of urban thermal environments in the future.

TI  - Large-scale rice mapping under different years based on time-series Sentinel-1 images using deep semantic segmentation model
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying spatial distribution of crop planting in large-scale is one of the most significant applications of remote sensing imagery. As an active remote sensing system, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides high-resolution polarimetric information of land covers. Nowadays, it is possible to carry out continuous multi-temporal analysis of crops in large-scales since an increased number of spaceborne SAR systems has been launched. This paper formulates rice mapping as a semantic segmentation problem and proposes to use deep learning techniques to exploit the phenological similarity of rice production to identify the rice distribution in large-scales. The study area (i.e., about 58504 km(2)) located in Arkansas River Basin is selected to develop an adapted U-Net for large-scale rice mapping. The Sentinel-1 data in previous years (i.e., data collected in 2017 and 2018) are used to train and fine-tune the network, and current season data (i.e., data collected in 2019) is selected to test the robustness of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves the state-of-the-art performance as it benefits from the spatial characteristics and phenological similarity of rice. The experiments of rice extraction in different planting pattern regions and extracted features visual projection are conducted to explain the features mined by the adapted U-Net. Furthermore, the advantages of temporal generalization in large-scale are validated by the comparison between space migration and time migration, which indicates that the difference of rice in different years is smaller than that of rice in different spaces. Finally, the issues for operational implementation are discussed.

TI  - Effects of Latitude-Dependent Gravity Wave Source Variations on the Middle and Upper Atmosphere
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ASTRONOMY AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are generated in the lower atmosphere by various weather phenomena. They propagate upward, carry energy and momentum to higher altitudes, and appreciably influence the general circulation upon depositing them in the middle and upper atmosphere. We use a three-dimensional first-principle general circulation model (GCM) with implemented nonlinear whole atmosphere GW parameterization to study the global climatology of wave activity and produced effects at altitudes up to the upper thermosphere. The numerical experiments were guided by the GW momentum fluxes and temperature variances as measured in 2010 by the SABER (Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry) instrument onboard NASA's TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics) satellite. This includes the latitudinal dependence and magnitude of GW activity in the lower stratosphere for the boreal summer season. The modeling results were compared to the SABER temperature and total absolute momentum flux and Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) data in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Simulations suggest that, in order to reproduce the observed circulation and wave activity in the middle atmosphere, GW fluxes that are smaller than observed fluxes have to be used at the source level in the lower atmosphere. This is because observations contain a broader spectrum of GWs, while parameterizations capture only a portion relevant to the middle and upper atmosphere dynamics. Accounting for the latitudinal variations of the source appreciably improves simulations.

TI  - A maximum bathymetric depth model to simulate satellite photon-counting lidar performance
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the development of photon-counting sensors, spaceborne photon-counting lidars have shown many advantages in mapping underwater topography. Although a space based lidar is normally a profiling system, the depth penetration and the vertical accuracy achieved with a bathymetric lidar is superior to imagery (that only provides relative depths). Therefore, many satellite derived bathymetry products use both active/passive spaceborne data to achieve spatial coverage as well as absolute depth measurements. Compared with shipborne and airborne bathymetric systems, satellite derived bathymetry data can have a global coverage, especially covering some remote areas where airborne/shipborne systems are hard or very expensive to reach. In this paper, a theoretical model is proposed to quantitatively analyze the maximum bathymetric depth of a satellite photon-counting lidar, which considers the system parameters, environmental effects, and the constraint of the SNR (signal to noise ratio). System parameters of ICESat-2 (Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite-2) as well as the MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction) datasets are used to provide systematic and environmental inputs to the model, and the ICESat-2 actual bathymetric data are used to verify the maximum depth estimated by the proposed model. In six different sites with different water qualities, solar angles and wind speeds, the theoretical maximum bathymetric depths agree well with the actually achieved ICESat-2 lidar depths, in terms of MAE (mean absolute error) of 0.50 m and the RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.60 m. The errors in all study areas are within 14% of the corresponding maximum depths. Additionally, the non-linear response of a photon-counting lidar, independent parameter impacts on the theoretical model, and the errors in the experimental process were quantitatively analyzed. In the future, this theoretical model can be used to evaluate the maximum bathymetric depth for a bathymetry investigation when applying system parameters and environmental parameters. In addition, it can be used to optimize the hardware parameters of a photon-counting lidar in its early design process.

TI  - The 32-year record-high surface melt in 2019/2020 on the northern George VI Ice Shelf, Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 2019/2020 austral summer, the surface melt duration and extent on the northern George VI Ice Shelf (GVIIS) was exceptional compared to the 31 previous summers of distinctly lower melt. This finding is based on analysis of near-continuous 41-year satellite microwave radiometer and scatterometer data, which are sensitive to meltwater on the ice shelf surface and in the near-surface snow. Using optical satellite imagery from Landsat 8 (2013 to 2020) and Sentinel-2 (2017 to 2020), record volumes of surface meltwater ponding were also observed on the northern GVIIS in 2019/2020, with 23% of the surface area covered by 0.62 km(3) of ponded meltwater on 19 January. These exceptional melt and surface ponding conditions in 2019/2020 were driven by sustained air temperatures >= 0 degrees C for anomalously long periods (55 to 90 h) from late November onwards, which limited meltwater refreezing. The sustained warm periods were likely driven by warm, low-speed (<= 7.5 m s(-1)) northwesterly and northeasterly winds and not by foehn wind conditions, which were only present for 9 h total in the 2019/2020 melt season. Increased surface ponding on ice shelves may threaten their stability through increased potential for hydrofracture initiation; a risk that may increase due to firn air content depletion in response to near-surface melting.

TI  - A nested drone-satellite approach to monitoring the ecological conditions of wetlands
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring wetlands is necessary in order to understand and protect their ecohydrological balance. In Ireland, traditionally wetland-monitoring is carried out by manual field visits which can be very time-consuming. To automate the process, this study extends the ability of remote sensing-based monitoring of wetlands by combining RGB image processing, machine learning algorithms, and satellite data analysis to create seasonal maps of vegetation communities within the wetlands. The methodology matches multispectral and broad coverage of open-source Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery with the high spatial granularity of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) or drone images. Single sensor drone imagery was captured, colour corrected and classified using random forest (RF) classifier for a subset of the wetland. The classified imagery was upsampled to satellite imagery scale to create training data for vegetation-segmentation in the entire wetland. The process was repeated for multiple seasons, and an annual map was created utilising the majority voting. The proposed framework has been evaluated on various wetlands across Ireland, with results presented herein for an ombrotrophic peatland complex, Clara Bog. The accuracy of the maps was checked utilising a set of area-based performance metric. The application of this method thereby reduces the number of field surveys typically required to assess the long-term ecological change of such wetland habitats. The performance of the proposed method demonstrates that the technique is a robust, quick, and cost-effective way to map wetland habitats seasonally and to explore their ecohydrological synergies.

TI  - The local wavelet-based organization index - Quantification, localization and classification of convective organization from radar and satellite data
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a revised local wavelet-based organization index (LW), which is applied to both synthetic fields and meteorological fields of precipitation and brightness temperature for different types of convective organization. The LW consists of three components that describe the scale (LWsc), quantify the intensity (LWin), and analyze the anisotropy (LWai) of the convection. It is based solely on 2D wavelet decomposition and does not require a clustering algorithm or thresholding. The great advantages of LW are that it localizes the organization in space, is a universally applicable measure of organization and can be calculated with little effort. A comparison with other organizational metrics shows that LW better describes the structure and organization of convection. We analyze the LW components in the vicinity of severe weather reports related to single-cell storms, supercells or multi-cell storms. Composites thereof reveal that large hail and heavy precipitation are particularly local events that lead to small-scale and very intense precipitation. Especially in the case of hail, LWai shows the structure of a hook echo, which is expected, since hail events are usually associated with supercells. In relation to wind gusts, precipitation is rather large-scale and linearly oriented, since strong wind gusts are often a consequence of linearly organized systems such as squall lines or derechos. The brightness temperature analysis provides similar results to those of the rain rates. Structures like the typical radar hook echo are not visible in the satellite data, but overshooting tops caused by strong updraughts are recognized as small-scale, intense regions. The three LW components are used to classify showers, thunderstorms and precipitation/hail events with the help of a neural network, where showers are mainly classified by their scale characteristics, and precipitation/hail events by their pronounced intensity.

TI  - Peri-implant radiographic bone level and associated factors in Spain
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PERIODONTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To evaluate radiographic bone level (RxBL) at dental implants and its associated factors in Spain.Material and methods This cross-sectional study was performed by a network of sentinel dentists from regions of Spain. RxBL was defined as the distance from the implant shoulder to the first clearly visible contact between the implant surface and the bone. Radiographic measurements were performed by two trained and experienced periodontists. Implant and patient data were also collected. Descriptive, bivariate, discriminative and multivariate analyses were done.Results A total of 49 sentinel dentists provided data 275 patients. Mean RxBL from 474 implants (5-13 years) was 1.87 mm (range: 0.00-13.17 mm). Statistically significant associations between RxBL and clinical output variables (bleeding on probing, oedema, plaque, probing depth, suppuration, keratinized tissue) were found. In the multiple regression analysis, statistically significant associations for RxBL were found for smoking habit, implant diameter, years of follow-up and type of prosthesis (p < 0.01).Conclusions Peri-implant RxBL ranged from 0 to 13.17 mm. It was significantly associated with clinical output variables and with some potentially predictor variables, at patient- (smoking >10 cigarettes/day) and implant- (diameter, years of follow-up, Toronto bridge) levels.

TI  - Experimental Approaches for Characterizing the Endocrine-Disrupting Effects of Environmental Chemicals in Fish
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Increasing industrial and agricultural activities have led to a disturbing increase of pollutant discharges into the environment. Most of these pollutants can induce short-term, sustained or delayed impacts on developmental, physiological, and behavioral processes that are often regulated by the endocrine system in vertebrates, including fish, thus they are termed endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Physiological impacts resulting from the exposure of these vertebrates to EDCs include abnormalities in growth and reproductive development, as many of the prevalent chemicals are capable of binding the receptors to sex steroid hormones. The approaches employed to investigate the action and impact of EDCs is largely dependent on the specific life history and habitat of each species, and the type of chemical that organisms are exposed to. Aquatic vertebrates, such as fish, are among the first organisms to be affected by waterborne EDCs, an attribute that has justified their wide-spread use as sentinel species. Many fish species are exposed to these chemicals in the wild, for either short or prolonged periods as larvae, adults, or both, thus, studies are typically designed to focus on either acute or chronic exposure at distinct developmental stages. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the approaches and experimental methods commonly used to characterize the effects of some of the environmentally prevalent and emerging EDCs, including 17 alpha-ethinylestradiol, nonylphenol, BPA, phthalates, and arsenic; and the pervasive and potential carriers of EDCs, microplastics, on reproduction and growth. In vivo and in vitro studies are designed and employed to elucidate the direct effects of EDCs at the organismal and cellular levels, respectively. In silico approaches, on the other hand, comprise computational methods that have been more recently applied with the potential to replace extensive in vitro screening of EDCs. These approaches are discussed in light of model species, age and duration of EDC exposure.

TI  - Mapping satellite-derived thermal parameters of canopy onset and assessing their temperature dependency for temperate forests in Korea
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Growing degree days (GDD) and chilling requirements (CR) of canopy phenological onset are popular thermal indicators showing forest adaptation to local temperature regimes. This study proposes a satellite-based approach for mapping the canopy-onset thermal traits and analyzing their controlling factors in temperate forests. GDD and CR from 2003 to 2017 were estimated with canopy onset dates and air temperature data retrieved from Moderate Resolution and Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Results revealed that GDD and CR showed distinct geographic patterns with latitude and altitude but with low inter-annual variations of less than 30% of the coefficient of variation. The satellite-based spatial patterns of GDD and CR were well explained by temperature with R-squares of 0.70 and 0.58, which were comparable to 0.63 and 0.59 from the field observation data, respectively. As well, satellite-derived sensitivities of GDD and CR to unit changes in temperature were +52.7 and - 21.3?CoC- 1, respectively, which were again comparable to the sensitivities from the field data (+50.9 and - 29.9?CoC- 1, respectively). The patterns and temperature dependency of thermal parameters seem to be relevant to species-level thermal acclimation and community-level plant composition changes with temperature.

TI  - Investigation of the Effect of the Dataset Size and Type in the Earthquake-Triggered Landslides Mapping: A Case Study for the 2018 Hokkaido Iburu Landslides
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid mapping of landslides that occur after an earthquake is important for rapid crisis management. In this study, experimental research was conducted on the size of the model area and the data types used in developing classifiers for the supervised classification approaches used in rapid landslide mapping. The Hokkaido Iburu earthquake zone that occurred on September 6, 2018, was selected as the study area. PlanetScope pre-event and post-event images and ALOS-PALSAR Digital Elevation Model (DEM) were used in the analysis processes. In this context, five model areas with different sizes and one test area were determined. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) was used as a landslide mapping approach. Random Forest classifier, which is a supervised classification algorithm, was performed in the mapping of image objects produced by the segmentation stage of OBIA. Two different data sets were created for landslide mapping: change-based dataset and post-event dataset. The change-based dataset is generated from change data such as the difference of normalized difference vegetation index (delta NDVI), change detection Image (CDI), princiable component analysis (PCA), and Independent component analysis (ICA) which are used in change detection applications. The post-event dataset was created from data generated from post-event image bands. When the obtained results were examined, higher accuracy results were obtained with the post-event dataset. Increasing the size of the model area, in other words, increasing the training data slightly increases the accuracy of landslide mapping. However, a model area that represents the region to be mapped in small sizes to make rapid decisions provides a 94% F-measure accuracy for earthquake-triggered landslide detection.

TI  - Timely poacher detection and localization using sentinel animal movement
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildlife crime is one of the most profitable illegal industries worldwide. Current actions to reduce it are far from effective and fail to prevent population declines of many endangered species, pressing the need for innovative anti-poaching solutions. Here, we propose and test a poacher early warning system that is based on the movement responses of non-targeted sentinel animals, which naturally respond to threats by fleeing and changing herd topology. We analyzed human-evasive movement patterns of 135 mammalian savanna herbivores of four different species, using an internet-of-things architecture with wearable sensors, wireless data transmission and machine learning algorithms. We show that the presence of human intruders can be accurately detected (86.1% accuracy) and localized (less than 500 m error in 54.2% of the experimentally staged intrusions) by algorithmically identifying characteristic changes in sentinel movement. These behavioral signatures include, among others, an increase in movement speed, energy expenditure, body acceleration, directional persistence and herd coherence, and a decrease in suitability of selected habitat. The key to successful identification of these signatures lies in identifying systematic deviations from normal behavior under similar conditions, such as season, time of day and habitat. We also show that the indirect costs of predation are not limited to vigilance, but also include (1) long, high-speed flights; (2) energetically costly flight paths; and (3) suboptimal habitat selection during flights. The combination of wireless biologging, predictive analytics and sentinel animal behavior can benefit wildlife conservation via early poacher detection, but also solve challenges related to surveillance, safety and health.

TI  - A novel method to quantify urban surface ecological poorness zone: A case study of several European cities
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A set of factors cause the Surface Ecological Status (SES) of urban areas to become largely different from the surrounding rural areas. Hence, the degree of poorness of SES in urban areas versus surrounding rural areas forms a zone, which is named Urban Surface Ecological Poorness Zone (USEPZ). The main objective of this study was to propose a new method to quantify USEPZ Intensity (USEPZI). To this end, Landsat-8 satellite images. water vapor products, and High Resolution Imperviousness Layer (HRIL) datasets of Budapest, Bucharest, Ciechanow, Hamburg, Lyon, Madrid, Porto, and Rome cities were used. Firstly, Single Channel (SC) algorithm, Tasseled cap transformation, and spectral indices were used to model the surface biophysical characteristics including Land Surface Temperature (1ST). Wetness, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI). Then, SES was modeled based on the combination of surface biophysical characteristics using Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI). Finally, the USEPZI was modeled bawd on the linear regression function obtained from RSEI-Impervious Surface Percentage (ISP) feature space. The spatial variability of the ISP, LST, NDVI, NDSI and Wetness of the selected cities was found to be heterogeneous. The coefficient of determination (R-2) between RSEI and ISP values for Budapest, Bucharest, Ciechanow, Hamburg, Lyon, Madrid, Porto, and Rome cities were obtained to be 0.99, 0.97, 0.98.0.99, 0.98,0.99.0.99, and 0.94, respectively. Also, the USEPZI values of these dties were 0.14.0.31, 0.41,0.26. 0.40,0.81, 0.44 and 0.46, respectively. Our findings show that the significant differences in their SES and USEPZI are due to the surface biophysical characteristics. The USEPZI in the selected cities with humid climate conditions was higher than the selected cities in dry climate conditions. Also, the use of the RSEI-ISP feature space is quite useful in modeling USEPZI of cities in different conditions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation and Comparison Actual Evapotranspiration of Sugarcane Using Separate and Fusion Satellite Images and Lysimeteric Data with Approach of Determining Water Use Efficiency
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimating evapotranspiration is an essential step towards the calculation of crops irrigation needs. One of the most widely used methods for this estimation is Surface Energy Balance Algorithm (SEBAL), a method based on remote sensing imagery. In the current study, fusion images of Landsat 8 and MODIS satellites using Gram-Schmidt algorithm were employed to calculate actual evapotranspiration of the Amir Kabir sugarcane argo-industry company, Khuzestan, Iran. Furthermore, the amount of sugarcane evapotranspiration was estimated using Landsat 8 images and SEBAL algorithm, and finally, the results were compared with lysimeteric data. The comparison of evapotranspiration from Landsat 8 and lysimeteric data showed a correlation higher than 0.96, as well as a comparison of evapotranspiration from the Landsat-MODIS fusion images having a suitable correlation equal to 0.88 with the lysimeteric data. In this research, the amount of dry matter produced in farming year 2016-2017 was calculated by using the Monteith model and satellite images. The average dry matter produced (biomass) of sugarcane in this period estimated using Landsat 8 images was 52.51ton/ha and 42.45ton/ha with fusion images. The average water use efficiency from the dry matter ratio produced by the actual evapotranspiration estimated from satellite data for Landsat 8 images and Landsat-MODIS fusion images was 5.98 and 5.95 kg/m(3), respectively. Also, the relationship between age and sugarcane varieties with yield and evapotranspiration rates calculated by the Monteith and SEBAL model indicated that the effect of the age of the sugarcane and varieties on its evapotranspiration rate is negligible. Finally, the relationship between the estimated evapotranspiration by Landsat 8 images and NDVI revealed that the extraction of NDVI values from images could be achieved with the proper accuracy of evapotranspiration.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coronavirus SARS-COV-2 infections continue to spread across the world, yet effective large-scale disease detection and prediction remain limited. COVID Control: A Johns Hopkins University Study, is a novel syndromic surveillance approach, which collects body temperature and COVID-like illness (CLI) symptoms across the US using a smartphone app and applies spatio-temporal clustering techniques and cross-correlation analysis to create maps of abnormal symptomatology incidence that are made publicly available. The results of the cross-correlation analysis identify optimal temporal lags between symptoms and a range of COVID-19 outcomes, with new taste/smell loss showing the highest correlations. We also identified temporal clusters of change in taste/smell entries and confirmed COVID-19 incidence in Baltimore City and County. Further, we utilized an extended simulated dataset to showcase our analytics in Maryland. The resulting clusters can serve as indicators of emerging COVID-19 outbreaks, and support syndromic surveillance as an early warning system for disease prevention and control.

TI  - Breast cancer treatment-related arm lymphoedema and morbidity: A 6-year experience in an Australian tertiary breast centre
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Recent surgical de-escalation of the axilla in breast cancer management has led to reduced number of immediate and delayed axillary lymph node dissections (ALND) after sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBs). We aim to assess the postoperative impact of SLNB versus immediate and delayed ALND on arm lymphoedema and morbidity.Methods A retrospective analysis from a prospectively collected institutional database was performed reviewing the rates of lymphoedema and arm morbidity in terms of shoulder restriction and patient-reported functional deficit in women undergoing axillary surgery for breast cancer between 2013 and 2018.Results In this 776 patient cohort (564 SLNBs, 192 immediate ALNDs and 20 delayed ALNDs), at 12 months after surgery, the results are as follows: lymphoedema rate: SLNB (4.62%), immediate ALND (19.51%), delayed ALND (15.00%); axillary cording rate: SLNB (3.08%), immediate ALND (10.65%), delayed ALND (5.00%); new functional deficit: SLNB (5.58%), immediate ALND (13.66%) and delayed ALND (20%); pain SLNB (14.02%), immediate ALND (15.97%), delayed ALND (17.65%); shoulder flexion/abduction restrictions: SLNB (8.14%/5.14%), immediate ALND (16.45%/15.79%) and delayed ALND (17.65%/20.00%). ALND was associated with increased risk of developing lymphoedema, shoulder dysfunction and development of more than one morbidity. No statistically significant difference in lymphoedema and morbidity outcome was observed between immediate and delayed ALND.Conclusion Immediate and delayed ALND have comparable outcomes, but both are associated with increased postoperative arm lymphoedema and morbidity outcomes compared to SLNB alone. Preoperative appropriate selection of patients for axillary surgery treatment may improve lymphoedema outcomes in breast cancer patients.

T2  - INDIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The locust has been devastating pest, which destructs the crops and pastures. Scientists discover the breeding habitats of locust based on soil surface water content (SWC) to devise preventive measures. Hence, accurate interpretation of SWC is vital to safeguard economic livelihood and ensure food security. Researchers usually adapt satellite data and manual/automatic colour-based image processing techniques to interpret SWC. However, satellites could not capture high-resolution images and ground information in densely vegetated areas. In addition, many of the ground surveying teams/farmers could not conduct colour analysis due to the lack of knowledge. Therefore, this manuscript introduces a newly developed web app to overcome the limitations of previously developed techniques. The steps involved in developing the new app were demonstrated to avoid the manual image analysis. Four series of experiments were conducted to quantify the moisture content using the newly developed app. The moisture content was also quantified using conventional manual image analysis technique to validate the newly developed app. The difference between the moisture contents obtained from the above-mentioned methods was found to be 1%-3%. This shows that the newly developed app has potential to identify the locust breeding habitats and guide the ground surveying teams to prevent locust swarm formation.

TI  - Analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics of land use and cover changes in Western Kenya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The western region of Kenya is experiencing remarkable land changes resulting from population growth and related impacts. The study used remote sensing and GIS techniques to analyze the land use/cover changes in the years 1995, 2001, 2010 and 2017. Multi-spectral Landsat (TM, ETM + and OLI) images were pre-processed and classified using maximum likelihood algorithm in ENVI version 5.4. The overall classification accuracies in all the images were more than 80%. The results revealed major conversions of each land use/land cover type in varying trends and magnitudes. Between 1995 and 2001, there was an increase in built-up areas by 71%, forest cover by 43%, farms by 5%; and decrease in grassland by 47%. By 2017, the built-up areas had increased by 225% and farms by 17%; the forestland, grassland and water reduced by 38, 10 and 11%, respectively. The observed changes are characterized by increased settlements and encroachment of sensitive ecosystems.

TI  - Using Landsat Time-Series to Monitor and Inform Seagrass Dynamics: A Case Study in the Tabusintac Estuary, New Brunswick, Canada
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent world-wide loss of seagrasses, which are critical components of coastal ecosystems, has ignited an effort among scientists and resource managers to develop effective monitoring tools. Although Landsat time-series is considered one of the most cost-effective options for monitoring landscapes, its application to monitor seagrasses remains scarce due to many factors including difficulties obtaining accurate ground-truth data and perceived limitations in mapping nearshore marine ecosystems. Here, we report on the use of archived Landsat multispectral imagery and the automatic adaptive signature generalization (AASG) to evaluate eelgrass (Zostera marina) distribution and abundance between 1984 and 2017, in an estuary located in northeastern New Brunswick, Canada. The AASG algorithm, a novel cost-efficient approach for satellite imagery time-series analysis that requires limited ground truth data, was used to produce fourteen maps, four of which had accuracies ranging from 75 to 85%. The results indicated that eelgrass meadows near the beach barrier were highly dynamic, exhibiting high abundance fluctuations between years and a conversion of dense eelgrass to medium-low eelgrass near the main coastline. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the AASG algorithm to map seagrass and advantages of including satellite time-series in monitoring programmes to investigate seagrass dynamics and long-term trends.

TI  - Aerosol optical properties of haze episodes in eastern China based on remote-sensing observations and WRF-Chem simulations
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability for remote-sensing sensors and global/regional models to describe aerosol optical properties (AOPs) is critical to reducing the uncertainty in aerosol radiative forcing associated with climate change, and improving model prediction accuracy. In this study, remote-sensing observations and WRF-Chem simulations were used to evaluate AOPs over Eastern China during a severe winter haze event, in terms of aerosol optical depth (AOD), Angstrom exponent (AE) and aerosol extinction profiles (AEP). This study also characterizes whether the inclusion of aerosol radiative feedbacks (ARFs) may improve the ability of WRF-Chem to acquire AOPs during haze episodes. Three simulation scenarios were considered: the non-radiation feedback (NRF), aerosol direct effect (ADE), as well as combined ADE and aerosol indirect effect (ADE + AIE). The results indicate that the satellite AOD products could represent the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of the haze event. The AOD retrieved by the MODIS C6.1 DB algorithm was highly consistent with ground-based observations. A comparison between simulations and observations demonstrated that WRF-Chem, including the ADE or ADE + ALE scheme, may improve AOPs simulation in heavily polluted areas. The most significant improvements occurred in the Sichuan basin (SB) and North China Plain (NCP) (AOD = 50-70%; AE = 10-20%). In particular, the ADE + AIE scheme was the most obvious for AOD improvement, followed by AE. The AEP was also qualitatively analyzed through simulations and observations, and the result showed that the model overestimates aerosol extinction coefficients in NCP. However, the model is still able to represent the entire AEP contour over East China. Similar to AOD and AE, the model can also improve AEP simulation by adding ADE or ADE + AIE scheme, especially in SB. In summary, it is found that the ability of WRF-Chem to simulate the AOPs was significantly enhanced, particularly for regions loading with heavy aerosol during haze events in Eastern China.

TI  - Evidence of multi-decadal behavior and ecosystem-level changes revealed by reconstructed lifetime stable isotope profiles of baleen whale earplugs
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological time series datasets provide an unparalleled opportunity to investigate regional and global changes in the marine environment. Baleen whales are long-lived sentinel species and an integral part of the marine ecosystem. Increasing anthropogenic terrestrial and marine activities alter ocean systems, and such alterations could change foraging and feeding behavior of baleen whales. In this study, we analyzed delta C-13 and delta N-1(5) of baleen whale earplugs from three different species (N = 6 earplugs, n= 337 laminae) to reconstruct the first continuous stable isotope profiles with a six-month resolution. Results of our study provide an unprecedented opportunity to assess behavioral as well as ecological changes. Abrupt shifts and temporal variability observed in delta C-13 and delta N-15 profiles could be indicative of behavior change such as shift in foraging location and/or trophic level in response to natural or anthropogenic disturbances. Additionally, five out of six individuals demonstrated long-term declining trends in delta C-13 profiles, which could suggest influence of emission of depleted (CO2)-C-13 from fossil fuel combustion referred to as the Suess effect. After adjusting the delta C-13 values of earplugs for the estimated Suess effect and re-evaluating delta C-13 profiles, significant decline in delta C-13 values as well as different rate of depletion suggest contribution of other sources that could impact delta C-13 values at the base of the food web.

TI  - Analysis of 3D cloud effects in OCO-2 XCO2 retrievals
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The presence of 3D cloud radiative effects in OCO-2 retrievals is demonstrated from an analysis of 2014-2019 OCO-2 XCO2 raw retrievals, bias-corrected XCO2bc data, ground-based Total Carbon Column Observation Network (TCCON) XCO2, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud and radiance fields. In approximate terms, 40% (quality flag - QF = 0, land or ocean) and 73% (QF = 1, land or ocean) of the observations are within 4 km of clouds. 3D radiative transfer calculations indicate that 3D cloud radiative perturbations at this cloud distance, for an isolated low-altitude cloud, are larger in absolute value than those due to a 1 ppm increase in CO2. OCO-2 measurements are therefore susceptible to 3D cloud effects. Four 3D cloud metrics, based upon MODIS radiance and cloud fields as well as stand-alone OCO-2 measurements, relate XCO2bc-TCCON averages to 3D cloud effects. This analysis indicates that the operational bias correction has a nonzero residual 3D cloud bias for both QF = 0 and QF = 1 data. XCO2bc-TCCON averages at small cloud distances differ from those at large cloud distances by -0.4 and -2.2 ppm for the QF = 0 and QF = 1 data over the ocean. Mitigation of 3D cloud biases with a table lookup technique, which utilizes the nearest cloud distance (Distkm) and spatial radiance heterogeneity (CSNoiseRatio) 3D metrics, reduces QF = 1 ocean and land XCO2bc-TCCON averages from 1 ppm to near similar to 0.2 ppm. The ocean QF = 1 XCO2bc-TCCON averages can be reduced to the 0.5 ppm level if 60% (70 %) of the QF = 1 data points are utilized by applying Distkm (CSNoiseRatio) metrics in a data screening process. Over land the QF = 1 XCO2bc-TCCON averages are reduced to the 0.5 (0.8) ppm level if 65% (63 %) of the data points are utilized by applying Diastkm (CSNoiseRatio) data screening. The addition of more terms to the linear regression equations used in the current bias correction processing without data screening, however, did not introduce an appreciable improvement in the standard deviations of the XCO2bc-TCCON statistics.

TI  - Association of habitual exercise with adults' mental health following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident: the Fukushima Health Management Survey
T2  - MENTAL HEALTH AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The Great East Japan Earthquake and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant accident in March 2011 impacted survivors' mental health. This study examined whether exercise habits and mental health conditions were associated, and whether the degree of the effect varied depending on time. Methods: A self-administered questionnaire was sent annually to former residents (born before April 1, 1998) in registered evacuation areas. Exercise habit was evaluated by participants' exercise frequency, and responses were categorized into "almost never," "once a week," and "twice a week and more." Data were tracked during three periods: fiscal year (FY) 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014. The association between baseline habitual exercise and new onset of psychological distress was assessed using the Japanese version of the Kessler 6-item Psychological Distress Scale and logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 1304 (5.7%) of 22,741, 1060 (4.7%) of 22,709, and 759 (3.6%) of 21,220 respondents had psychological distress in FY 2011-2012, 2012-2013, and 2013-2014, respectively. An association between exercise and psychological distress was observed in men in FY 2011-2012 (P for trend: 0.010) and in women in FY 2013-2014 (P for trend: 0.026). "Almost never" was associated with onset of psychological distress in men in FY 2011-2012 [odds ratio (OR): 1.317, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.054-1.645] and in women in FY 2013-2014 (OR: 1.296, 95% CI: 1.027-1.636). Conclusions: Exercise habit was associated with psychological distress, and its effect in time varied according to sex.

TI  - Seasonality of primary productivity affects coastal species more than its magnitude
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - While the importance of extreme conditions is recognised, patterns in species' abundances are often interpreted through average environmental conditions within their distributional range. For marine species with pelagic larvae, temperature and phytoplankton concentration are key variables. Along the south coast of South Africa, conspicuous spatial patterns in recruitment rates and the abundances of different mussel species exist, with focal areas characterized by large populations. We studied 15 years of sea surface temperature (SST) and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) satellite data, using spectral analyses to partition their temporal variability over ecologically relevant time periods, including seasonal (101 to 365 days) and intra-seasonal cycles (20 to 100 days). Adult cover and mussel recruitment were measured at 10 sites along the south coast and regression models showed that about 70% of the variability in recruitment and adult cover was explained by seasonal variability in chl-a, while mean annual chl-a and SST only explained 30% of the recruitment, with no significant effect for adult cover. SST and chl-a at two upwelling centres showed less predictable seasonal cycles during the second half of the study period with a significant cooling trend during austral autumn, coinciding with one of the mussel reproductive peaks. This likely reflects recent changes in the Agulhas Current, the world's largest western boundary current, which affects coastal ecosystems by driving upwelling. Similar mechanisms probably operate in other marine systems with the potential to affect the distribution patterns of key ecosystem engineers. We propose that variability in the characteristic timescales of environmental fluctuations can explain the spatial patterns of abundance of foundational species by affecting larval recruitment. This is especially important in a context of global and pervasive climate change, as shifts in the periodicity of environmental fluctuations appear to reflect large scale climatic teleconnections driven by anthropogenic forcing.

TI  - Influence of vegetation on occurrence and time distributions of regional new aerosol particle formation and growth
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence frequency of regional atmospheric new aerosol particle formation and consecutive growth events (f(NPF)) were studied with respect to vegetation activity, aerosol properties, air pollutants and meteorological data in Budapest over the time interval from 2008 to 2018. The data set evaluated contained results of in situ measurements on the land surface that were mostly performed at the Budapest platform for Aerosol Research and Training Laboratory, of satellite-based products recorded by MODIS on Terra and of modelled vegetation emission-related properties from an advanced regional biogeochemical model. The annual mean relative occurrence frequencies were considerable (with an overall mean of 21 %), remained at a constant level (with an overall SD of 5 %) and did not exhibit tendentious change over the years. The shape of the distributions of monthly mean f(NPF) exhibited large variability from year to year, while the overall average distribution already possessed a characteristic pattern. The structure of the new particle formation (NPF) occurrence distributions was compared to those of environmental variables including concentrations of gas-phase H2SO4, SO2, O-3, NO, NO2, CO, PM10 mass and NH3; particle numbers in the size fractions of 6-1000, 6-100 and 100-1000 nm; condensation sink; air temperature (T); relative humidity (RH); wind speed (WS); atmospheric pressure (P); global solar radiation (GRad); gross primary production (GPP) of vegetation; leaf area index (LAI); and stomatal conductance (SCT). There were no evident systematic similarities between f(NPF) on the one hand and all of the variables studied on the other hand, except for H2SO4 and perhaps NH3. The spring maximum in the NPF occurrence frequency distribution often overlapped with the time intervals of positive T anomaly in vegetated territories. The link between the potential heat stress exerted on plants in sultry summer intervals and the summer f(NPF) minimum could not be proven. The relevance of environmental variables was assessed by their ratios on NPF event days and on non-event days. The gas-phase H2SO4 concentration showed the largest monthly ratios, followed by O-3. The WS, biogenic precursor gases and SO2 can generally favour NPF events, although their influence seemed to be constrained. An association between the f(NPF) and vegetation growth dynamics was clearly identified.

TI  - Characterization of Noncontextuality in the Framework of Generalized Probabilistic Theories
T2  - PRX QUANTUM
M3  - Article
AB  - To make precise the sense in which the operational predictions of quantum theory conflict with a classical worldview, it is necessary to articulate a notion of classicality within an operational framework. A widely applicable notion of classicality of this sort is whether or not the predictions of a given operational theory can be explained by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model. We here explore what notion of classicality this implies for the generalized probabilistic theory (GPT) that arises from a given operational theory, focusing on prepare-measure scenarios. We first show that, when mapping an operational theory to a GPT by quotienting relative to operational equivalences, the constraint of explainability by a generalized-noncontextual ontological model is mapped to the constraint of explainability by an ontological model. We then show that, under the additional assumption that the ontic state space is of finite cardinality, this constraint on the GPT can be expressed as a geometric condition which we term simplex embeddability. Whereas the traditional notion of classicality for a GPT is that its state space be a simplex and its effect space be the dual of this simplex, simplex embeddability merely requires that its state space be embeddable in a simplex and its effect space in the dual of that simplex. We argue that simplex embeddability constitutes an intuitive and freestanding notion of classicality for GPTs. Our result also has applications to witnessing nonclassicality in prepare-measure experiments.

TI  - Evaluation of evapotranspiration deficit index for agricultural drought monitoring in North China
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a major natural hazard that causes significant economic loss across the world. Drought indexes derived from remote sensing data can provide dynamic information in real time, facilitating drought assessments. The evapotranspiration (ET) deficit index (ETDI) is derived from observations of ET and potential ET. ETDI is an indicator of agricultural drought. In this study, actual ET was modeled using the Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator with remote sensing data and ground-station observation data as input. We investigated the efficacy of ETDI to indicate regional agricultural drought in a major region of winter wheat production in Northern China. Spatiotemporal changes in ETDI agreed well with the standardized precipitation index (SPI) on a 5 month scale and with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). ETDI also agreed well with the composite index of yield reduction (CI), which represents the provincial percentage area of cropland subject to drought stress. CI performed better in agricultural regions where water was supplied by precipitation rather than irrigation. Changes in winter wheat yield due to meteorological events were highly correlated with ETDI, rather than SPI or PDSI, averaged across specific growth stages. Weather conditions had significant impacts in April (jointing and boot stages of winter wheat development) in Hebei province, in May (heading and grain-filling stages) in Shanxi province, and from January through April in other provinces. These results demonstrate that ETDI is a suitable index for indicating regional agricultural drought in order to inform drought mitigation activities.

TI  - Mapping regional forest management units: a road-based framework in Southeastern Coastal Plain and Piedmont
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Management practices are one of the most important factors affecting forest structure and function. Landowners in southern United States manage forests using appropriately sized areas, to meet management objectives that include economic return, sustainability, and esthetic enjoyment. Road networks spatially designate the socio-environmental elements for the forests, which represented and aggregated as forest management units. Road networks are widely used for managing forests by setting logging roads and firebreaks. We propose that common types of forest management are practiced in road-delineated units that can be determined by remote sensing satellite imagery coupled with crowd-sourced road network datasets. Satellite sensors do not always capture road-caused canopy openings, so it is difficult to delineate ecologically relevant units based only on satellite data. By integrating citizen-based road networks with the National Land Cover Database, we mapped road-delineated management units across the regional landscape and analyzed the size frequency distribution of management units. We found the road-delineated units smaller than 0.5 ha comprised 64% of the number of units, but only 0.98% of the total forest area. We also applied a statistical similarity test (Warren's Index) to access the equivalency of road-delineated units with forest disturbances by simulating a serious of neutral landscapes. The outputs showed that the whole southeastern U.S. has the probability of road-delineated unit of 0.44 and production forests overlapped significantly with disturbance areas with an average probability of 0.50.

TI  - Statistical analysis of cloud characteristics in Northwest China based on Fengyun satellite data
T2  - CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The northwest region in China located at arid and semiarid areas, atmospheric precipitation converted by the cloud is an important part of water resources, and if we fully utilize cloud for cloud-water conversion to alleviate the scarcity of water, thereby it is particularly important to analyze the macroscopic characteristics and the changing trends of clouds in the northwest region. In this paper, the 2016 Level 1 data of Fengyun Satellite has been calibrated, corrected, and processed, using the improved multi-spectral thresholding method to calculate cloud coverage and cloud classification data. The optical thickness inversion uses the SBDART (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) radiation transmission mode to establish a radiation look-up table with optical thickness as a function variable under different conditions of observation geometry, underlying surface type, and atmospheric environment. The results show that the coverage of clouds in the northwest region accounts for about 45%, and the cloud coverage changes with the seasons. The classification of clouds mainly consists of high clouds, low clouds, and cumulonimbus. The optical thickness of clouds is largely distributed between 10 and 25.

TI  - Block-level macadamia yield forecasting using spatio-temporal datasets
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Early crop yield forecasts provide valuable information for growers and industry to base decisions on. This work considers early forecasting of macadamia nut yield at the individual orchard block level with input variables derived from spatio-temporal datasets including remote sensing, weather and elevation. Yield data from 2012-2019, for 101 blocks belonging to 10 orchards, was obtained. We forecast yield on each test year from 2014-2019 using models trained on data from years prior to the test year. Forecasts are generated in January, for the coming harvest in March-September. A linear model using ridge regularized regression produced consistently good predictions compared with other machine learning algorithms including lasso, support vector regression and random forest. Adding meteorological variables offered little improvement over using only remote sensing variables. The 2019 forecast root mean square error at the block level was 0.8 t/ha, and mean absolute percentage error was 20.9%. When block level predictions were aggregated across the multiple orchards per region, production prediction errors were between 0-15% from 2016-2019. The ridge regression model can be easily implemented in GIS platforms to deliver block-level yield forecast maps to end users.

TI  - Linking data of ENSO, NDVI-MODIS and crops yield as a base of an early warning system for agriculture in Cordoba, Argentina
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - By influencing interannual rainfall variability in the Province of Cordoba, Argentina, El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) also impact on corn and soybean yields at the main rain-fed agricultural production departments. Spectral NDVI data not only capture the environmental impact on vegetation directly, but also can expose it spread all over a region at the same time. As support of an early warning system and decision-making for agriculture, the impact of ENSO on corn and soybean yields anomaly (YA) was analyzed between 2000 and 2017, by using different indicators: SOI, MEI and ONI over the 12 major production departments of Cordoba. Also, NDVI-MODIS data was assessed all over Rio Segundo (RS) territory in the center of Cordoba as a vegetation proxy to depict the agricultural activity in a broad sense. To check signal persistency, the relationship was assessed first using the indicators from July to October prior to the sowing date; and then once the growing season has finished, to show the effective ENSO impact on crops productivity.Persistence of ENSO signal was verified, so that the ENSO influence during the growing season quantified remains or intensifies when is compared to information in advance to the start of crop season. While for SOIGS and MEIGS the correlation with corn yield is significant (p < 0.05) in all Cordoba departments, it is always a little lower for ONIGS. Instead, for soybean only 4 departments show significant relationships when using ONIGS, 5 in the case of MEIGS and it increases to 6 when using SOIGS. The particular response of NDVI anomaly (AND) to ENSO was located and quantified for different indices and periods during the crop season. A consistent relationship was found between ENSO and the NDVI as an indicator of agricultural activity in RS territory but, in any case, the area fraction with a significant condition is quite small.The relationship with NDVI is stronger for SOI particularly when a more extended period is considered that include NDVI data of April and May, at the end of the rainy season. While before the beginning of the growing season SOIA-S and SOIS-O reach a significant relationship with the NDVI accumulated since November to May in 11% and 10% of Rio Segundo territory, respectively, the percentage increases to 19% when SOIGS is used. Finally, all this information was integrated in an unsupervised cartographic scheme that recognizes different responses of crops yield and NDVI to ENSO in the RS territory. Multiple regression models for corn and soybean yield prediction were developed from NDVI and ENSO indicators for each one of the identified productive sectors. Crops yield can be estimated before harvest with good accuracy, making use of the maximum NDVI value and SOI, both before (SOIA-S) and during the growing season (SOIA-S-O-N-D). As NDVI data capture the ENSO influence on agriculture as well as over crop productivity, its incorporation into a climate monitoring protocol must conforms the basis of an early warning system for a sustainable agriculture in the region.

TI  - Monitoring of land surface subsidence using persistent scatterer interferometry techniques and ground truth data in arid and semi-arid regions, the case of Remah, UAE
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is located in an arid desert climate with very limited water resources and scarce rainfall. Along with the fast development of the country, the water demand for agriculture, industrial, and domes-tic purposes increased and led to diminishing groundwater resources. In this study, we explore the land surface deformations due to groundwater overexploitation in the agricultural area of Remah by analyzing Sentinel-1 data between 2015 and 2019 with the novel Parallelized-Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (P-PSI) technique. The detected land surface deformations have been correlated to the recorded groundwater levels at nearby water wells. This study detected land surface deformations in a form of an extensive subsidence bowl (with 28.5 km in diameter) with a maximum subsidence rate of 40 mm/year anda standard deviation within the bowl of less than 2 mm/year. The detected subsidence was associated with a 12 m drop in the water table level within the study area. The Persistent Scatterers with the highest deformations rate were spatially correlated with the de-pression cone of the groundwater level. These findings provide useful insights in understanding the groundwater regime of the area and have an important role in assessing regional hazards and driving mitigation measures to-wards managing uncontrolled groundwater overexploitation for sustainable management of groundwater resources.(c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - A new measurement approach for validating satellite-based above-cloud aerosol optical depth
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - The retrieval of aerosol parameters from passive satellite instruments in cloudy scenes is challenging, partly because clouds and cloud-related processes may significantly modify aerosol optical depth (AOD) and particle size, a problem that is further compounded by 3D radiative processes. Recent advances in retrieval algorithms such as the "color ratio" method, which utilizes the measurements at a shorter (470 nm) and a longer (860 nm) wavelength, have demonstrated the simultaneous derivation of AOD and cloud optical depth (COD) for scenes in which absorbing aerosols are found to overlay low-level cloud decks. This study shows simultaneous retrievals of above-cloud aerosol optical depth (ACAOD) and aerosol-corrected cloud optical depth (COD) from airborne measurements of cloud-reflected and sky radiances using the color ratio method. These airborne measurements were taken over marine stratocumulus clouds with NASA's Cloud Absorption Radiometer (CAR) during the SAFARI 2000 field campaign offshore of Namibia. The ACAOD is partitioned between the AOD below-aircraft (AOD_cloudtop) and above-aircraft AOD (AOD_sky). The results show good agreement between AOD_sky and sun-photometer measurements of the above-aircraft AOD. The results also show that the use of aircraft-based sun-photometer measurements to validate satellite retrievals of the ACAOD is complicated by the lack of information on AOD below aircraft. Specifically, the CAR-retrieved AOD_cloudtop captures this "missing" aerosol layer caught between the aircraft and cloud top, which is required to quantify above-cloud aerosol loading and effectively validate satellite retrievals. In addition, the study finds a strong anticorrelation between the AOD_cloudtop and COD for cases in which COD < 10 and a weaker anticorrelation for COD > 10, which may be associated with the uncertainties in the color ratio method at lower AODs and CODs. The influence of 3D radiative effects on the retrievals is examined, and the results show that at cloud troughs, 3D effects increase retrieved ACAOD by about 3 %-11% and retrieved COD by about 25 %. The results show that the color ratio method has little sensitivity to 3D effects at overcast stratocumulus cloud decks. These results demonstrate a novel airborne measurement approach for assessing satellite retrievals of aerosols above clouds, thereby filling a major gap in global aerosol observations.

TI  - Monitoring and Assessment for the Susceptibility of Landslide Changes After the 2017 Ms 7.0 Jiuzhaigou Earthquake Using the Remote Sensing Technology
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the change of post-seismic landslides could provide valuable information for geological disaster treatment. The 2017 Jiuzhaigou Ms 7.0 earthquake has triggered a large number of landslides in the Jiuzhaigou United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Natural Heritage site, which provides a unique opportunity for monitoring the spatio-temporal characteristics and exploring the impact factors of post-seismic landslides change. In this study, the spatio-temporal characteristics of landslides and their post-seismic changes are analyzed using multi-source, multi-temporal, and multi-scale remote sensing data combining with the field study. The Support Vector Machine classification, visual interpretation, field investigation, and Geographic Information System technology are employed to extract landslides and analyze their spatial distribution patterns. Moreover, the Certainty Factor method is used to explore the susceptibility of landslides and to find key impact factors. Our results show that the net increase area of landslide is 1.2 km(2) until September 27th, 2019, which are induced by the expansion of coseismic landslide, the post-seismic landslide, and the expansion of vegetation degradation. Moreover, the area expansion of the coseismic and post-seismic landslides is mainly related to the increase of debris flow induced by the post-seismic torrential rainfalls. The highest net increase rate of post-seismic landslide change does not distribute on the regions with the highest density of coseismic landslides. The susceptibility of post-seismic landslide change is greatly influenced by slope, altitude, aspect, peak ground acceleration fault, and strata. It is higher in the coseismic landslide area with low susceptibility. This study also suggests that the potential landslides will most likely occur in the unstable slope region affected by the additional driving force. Therefore, great attention should be paid to identify and prevent the potential landslides on unstable slopes in addition to treatments of the sliding slopes. This study provides a good example for the monitoring and assessment of post-seismic landslides in mountainous regions with a steep slope and deep valley.

TI  - Mapping avalanches with satellites - evaluation of performance and completeness
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial distribution and size of avalanches are essential parameters for avalanche warning, avalanche documentation, mitigation measure design and hazard zonation. Despite its importance, this information is incomplete today and only available for limited areas and limited time periods. Manual avalanche mapping from satellite imagery has recently been applied to reduce this gap achieving promising results. However, their reliability and completeness have not yet been verified satisfactorily.In our study we attempt a full validation of the completeness of visually detected and mapped avalanches from optical SPOT 6, Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 imagery. We examine manually mapped avalanches from two avalanche periods in 2018 and 2019 for an area of approximately 180 km2 around Davos, Switzerland, relying on ground- and helicopter-based photographs as ground truth. For the quality assessment, we investigate the probability of detection (POD) and the positive predictive value (PPV). Additionally, we relate our results to conditions which potentially influence avalanche detection in the satellite imagery.We statistically confirm the high potential of SPOT for comprehensive avalanche mapping for selected periods (POD = 0.74, PPV = 0.88) as well as the reliability of Sentinel-1 (POD = 0.27, PPV = 0.87) for which the POD is reduced because mainly larger avalanches are mapped. Furthermore, we found that Sentinel-2 is unsuitable for the mapping of most avalanches due to its spatial resolution (POD = 0.06, PPV = 0.81). Because we could apply the same reference avalanche events for all three satellite mappings, our validation results are robust and comparable. We demonstrate that satellite-based avalanche mapping has the potential to fill the existing avalanche documentation gap over large areas, making alpine regions safer.

TI  - Greenland-wide inventory of ice marginal lakes using a multi-method approach
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice marginal lakes are a dynamic component of terrestrial meltwater storage at the margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Despite their significance to the sea level budget, local flood hazards and bigeochemical fluxes, there is a lack of Greenland-wide research into ice marginal lakes. Here, a detailed multi-sensor inventory of Greenland's ice marginal lakes is presented based on three wellestablished detection methods to form a unified remote sensing approach. The inventory consists of 3347 (+/- 8%) ice marginal lakes (> 0.05 km 2) detected for the year 2017. The greatest proportion of lakes lie around Greenland's ice caps and mountain glaciers, and the southwest margin of the ice sheet. Through comparison to previous studies, a similar to 75% increase in lake frequency is evident over the west margin of the ice sheet since 1985. This suggests it is becoming increasingly important to include ice marginal lakes in future sea level projections, where these lakes will form a dynamic storage of meltwater that can influence outlet glacier dynamics. Comparison to existing global glacial lake inventories demonstrate that up to 56% of ice marginal lakes could be unaccounted for in global estimates of ice marginal lake change, likely due to the reliance on a single lake detection method.

TI  - Applying planetary mapping methods to submarine environments: onshore-offshore geomorphology of Christiana-Santorini-Kolumbo Volcanic Group, Greece
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAPS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geologic maps are foundational products for natural hazard assessments but developing them for submarine areas is challenging due to a lack of physical access to the study area. In response, submarine geomorphologic maps are used to provide geologic context and spatial information on landforms and related geo-hazards for risk management. These maps are generated from remotely sensed data, e.g. digital elevation models (DEMs), which introduce unique hurdles to submarine mapping. To address this issue, we produced a workflow for applying planetary geologic mapping methods to submarine data. Using this, we created an onshore-offshore geomorphologic map of the Christiana-Santorini-Kolumbo Volcanic Group, Greece. This product can be used to enhance hazard assessments on Santorini, which is a tourist hot-spot at high risk for volcanically- and seismically-induced hazards. We present this workflow as a tool for generating uniform geomorphologic map products that will aid natural hazard assessments of submarine environments.

TI  - Inventory and changes of rock glacier creep speeds in Ile Alatau and Kungoy Ala-Too, northern Tien Shan, since the 1950s
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatio-temporal patterns related to the viscous creep in perennially frozen sediments of rock glaciers in cold mountains have rarely been studied outside the densely populated European Alps. This study investigates the spatial and temporal variability of rock glacier movement in the Ile Alatau and Kungoy Ala-Too mountain ranges, northern Tien Shan, a region with particularly large and fast rock glaciers. Over the study region of more than 3000 km(2), an inventory of slope movements was constructed using a large number of radar interferograms and high-resolution optical imagery. The inventory includes more than 900 landforms, of which around 550 were interpreted as rock glaciers. Out of the active rock glaciers inventoried, 45 are characterized by a rate of motion exceeding 100 cm/a. From these fast rock glaciers we selected six (Gorodetzky, Morenny, Archaly, Ordzhonikidze, Karakoram, and Kugalan Tash) and studied them in more detail using offset tracking between repeat aerial images and historical and modern high-resolution optical satellite data. Two of these rock glaciers showed a steady increase in decadal surface velocities from the 1950s onwards, with speeds being roughly 2 to 4 times higher in recent years compared to the 1950s and 1960s. Three rock glaciers showed similar accelerations over the last 1 to 2 decades but also phases of increased speeds in the 1960s. This development indicates a possible significant increase in current sediment and ice fluxes through rock glaciers and implies that their material transport in the region might gain geomorphodynamic importance relative to material transport by glaciers, assuming the latter decreases together with the regional glacier shrinkage. The study demonstrates how air and satellite image archives are exploited to construct one of the longest decennial times series of rock glacier speeds currently available. Our results are in line with findings from Europe about rock glacier speeds increasing with atmospheric warming and underline local variability of such an overall response.

TI  - The impact of impervious surface, vegetation, and soil areas on land surface temperatures in a semi-arid region using Landsat satellite images enriched with Ndaisi method data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surfaces are a significant issue of both urbanization and environmental assessment. However, it is a problem to classify impervious surface (IS) and soil areas as separate classes in land cover classification. The objectives of this study are to obtain impervious surface, vegetation, and soil areas clearly of an urban complex with a semi-arid climate and to better determine the relationships of IS, vegetation, and soil areas with land surface temperatures (LSTs). For this purpose, IS, vegetation, and soil areas in a semi-arid city of Turkey-Kayseri city were identified by using Normalized Difference Anthropogenic Impervious Surface Index (NDAISI) data and support vector machine (SVM) method together in the classification of different areas. Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images of 1987, 2000, and 2013 were used, respectively, in this study. Afterward, the effects of these areas on LSTs were analyzed. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between land cover areas and surface temperatures. To better demonstrate these relationships, besides common pixel-based and classical regional-based approaches, a new density-based regional analysis approach was proposed. This study is an innovative one in terms of detecting IS and indicating relationships between land cover areas and surface temperatures in semi-arid regions. Another innovation of the study is related to the results produced. The results showed that decreasing LST values were observed with increasing IS and vegetation cover values and increasing LST values were observed with increasing soil areas. The present findings may provide significant contributions to the literature and will facilitate the development of urban planning strategies in semi-arid regions.

AB  - Was Jesus crucified on the cross? Did Jesus die by crucifixion? This topic generates so much emotion and conflict in Christian-Islamic dialogue as many theories have developed to prove one side of the equation. While several methods can answer Islamic objections against the biblical belief, the evidential Apologetics is the best method to provide evidence for the Christian claims. Evidential Apologetics is one of the methods that seeks to prove the truthfulness of the Christian worldview by showing historical and scientific evidences. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to use the evidential method to answer three major objections that Muslims raise against the crucifixion of Jesus: Jesus was never crucified, the swoon theory, and the substitute theory. The paper will conclude that there are surmounted historical and scientific evidences that support the event of Jesus's crucifixion.

TI  - Is worldview education achieved in schools? A study of Finnish teachers' perceptions of worldview education as a component of basic education
T2  - JOURNAL OF BELIEFS & VALUES-STUDIES IN RELIGION & EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the concept of 'worldview' has resurfaced into the forefront of the international debate among scholars of religious education. With this study, we aim to contribute to the discussion with empirical material having a focus on worldview education in whole school education. The study deals with the Finnish teachers' perceptions of worldview education in basic education. Teachers (N = 110) responded to a questionnaire concerning their experiences on how they feel about worldview education, how they deal with it and where does worldview education take place in schools according to teachers. The questionnaire included both quantitative and qualitative sections. According to the results, it appears that teachers consider worldview education to be relatively important in schools and that they have a reasonably broad perception of worldview education, including aspects of value education, cultural encounters, and settlement of disputes. What is notable is that the teachers appear to associate worldview education not only with lessons; they also cite activities in the daily life of the school and outside the classrooms, especially celebrations, as incidents associated with worldview education.

TI  - Open-air grape classification and its application in parcel-level risk assessment of late frost in the eastern Helan Mountains
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern Helan Mountains are one of the most important plantings and production bases for high-quality grapes in China. In winter, grape root is prone to freezing damage owing to natural phenomenon such as early and late frost, and methods to assess disaster risk at the grape parcel level is one of the current research hotspots. However, there are two problems at present; first is the lack of grape parcel maps and second is that scale of disaster risk assessment is limited to the level of administrative divisions and grid systems. Therefore, according to the perennial characteristics of the grapes and clear texture of the open-air grape parcels based on public data sets (Sentinel-2A/B) and high-quality winery address information, combined with Google Earth engine (GEE) platform, Google Earth, and Ovitalmap, this study designs a collection scheme of open-air grape parcel samples and non-grape parcel samples, analyzes the environmental characteristics of the distribution of high-quality wineries, constructs a classification feature database in three aspects (time, terrain, and vegetation), uses the random forest classification method to classify open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains in 2019, and conducts a late frost disaster risk assessment of the open-air grape parcel. The results show that: (1) The high-quality wineries are mainly distributed in the elevation of 1106-1240 m, with the average slope of 0.82., the organic matter content of 10.79-14.27 g/kg, the P content of 24.87-37.58 mg/kg, the K content of 116-166 mg/kg, the pH 8.38-8.55, N content of 0.65-0.98 g/kg, annual average active accumulated temperature >= 10 degrees C of 3490-3590 degrees C, annual average rainfall of 189-201 mm, the annual average sunshine duration of 7.3-7.6 h, annual average air temperature of 8.8-9.4 degrees C, annual average temperature difference of 12.7-13.2 degrees C, annual average frost-free period at 263-270 d and annual average relative air Humidity of 50-54%. (2) The overall classification accuracy of open-air grape parcels reached 98.96% and the verification accuracy of ground truth parcel samples reached 87.89%. The open-air grape parcels in the eastern Helan Mountains are mainly distributed in Helan County, Xixia District, Yongning County, and Qingtongxia City. (3) The highest risk of late frost was found in Xixia District and the lowest risk in Yongning County. Helan County was higher than Qingtongxia City in the medium risk of late frost. The typical small area high risk includes Liangtian Town, the experimental field of Ningxia Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences in Zhenbeibao Town, Yuhuang Winery in Ganchengzi Village, and the State-run Warm Spring Farm in Helan County. Thus, the sample collection and augmentation scheme are feasible, the open-air grape classification accuracy is high and its result is consistent with field investigation, which can provide accurate parcel-level disaster risk assessment and provide decision support for agricultural departments and farmers.Y

TI  - Trends in cocaine use, markets and harms in Australia, 2003-2019
T2  - DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction This paper aims to describe cocaine use, markets and harms in Australia from 2003 to 2019.Methods Outcome indicators comprised prevalence of use from triennial household surveys; patterns of use from annual surveys of sentinel samples who use stimulants; and cocaine-related seizures, arrests, hospitalisations, deaths and treatment episodes. Bayesian autoregressive time-series analyses were conducted to estimate trend over time: Model 1, no change; Model 2, constant rate of change; and Model 3, change over time differing in rate after one change point.Results Past-year population prevalence of use increased over time. The percentage reporting recent use in sentinel samples increased by 6.1% (95% credible interval [CrI95%] 1.2%,16.9%; Model 3) per year from around 2017 (48%) until the end of the series (2019: 67%). There was a constant annual increase in number of seizures (count ratio: 1.1, CrI95% 1.1,1.2) and arrests (1.2, CrI95% 1.1,1.2), and percentage reporting cocaine as easy to obtain in the sentinel samples (percent increase 1.2%, CrI95% 0.5%,1.8%; Model 2). Cocaine-related hospitalisation rate increased from 5.1 to 15.6 per 100 000 people from around 2011-2012 to 2017-2018: an annual increase of 1.3 per 100 000 people (CrI95% 0.8,1.8; Model 3). While the death rate was low (0.23 cocaine-related deaths per 100 000 people in 2018; Model 2), treatment episodes increased from 3.2 to 5.9 per 100 000 people from around 2016-2017 to 2017-2018: an annual increase of 2.9 per 100 000 people (CrI95% 1.6,3.7; Model 3).Discussion and Conclusions Cocaine use, availability and harm have increased, concentrated in recent years, and accompanied by increased treatment engagement.

TI  - The Relationship Between Epidermal Mitotic Density, Atypical Mitotic Figure Density, Breslow Depth, Ulceration, and Dermal Mitotic Rate in Cutaneous Melanoma: A Retrospective Cohort Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Prognostic factors for melanoma include Breslow depth (BD), ulceration, and dermal mitotic rate (DMR). No studies have queried the effect of epidermal mitotic density (EMD) or atypical mitotic figure density (AMD) in an outcome-based assessment. Our objective was to determine if there is a relationship between EMD, AMD, BD, DMR, and ulceration and patient outcomes. This was a retrospective cohort study of 185 cases of thick and thin melanomas. Univariate and multivariate cause-specific regression analysis was performed. There was a positive correlation between EMD and BD (P = .0001). The difference between AMD in thick and thin melanomas was statistically significant. For every unit increase in EMD, patients had a 2.8-fold increase in the risk of distant metastasis; however, statistical significance was lost in the multivariate analysis. In adjusted analyses, ulceration, DMR, and BD were associated with outcomes. There were no statistically significant correlations between AMD and outcomes. This study is limited by its small sample size, diminution of the epidermis in some thick melanomas preventing EMD estimates, and reproducibility of mitotic figure counting. EMD and AMD do not seem to have any independent value in multivariate analyses for melanoma. Ulceration, BD, and DMR were significantly associated with outcomes and further solidify these known predictors of prognosis.

T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmosphere is a complex dynamical system. Here, we investigated the causal links between aerosols, water vapor, and clouds, using the convergent cross mapping (CCM) method, which is based on nonlinear state space reconstruction. We utilized remote sensing data of aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD), water vapor (WV), cloud cover (CC), cloud optical depth (COD), cloud effective radius-ice (CERI), and cloud effective radius-liquid (CERL) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) sensor over East Asia, for the period 2003-2018. Our analysis shows that there is a bidirectional forcing between AOD, CC, and COD which could be attributed to the invigoration effect of aerosols on clouds. In addition, there is a bidirectional forcing between AOD and WV and AOD and CERL, which could be attributed to the first indirect effect of aerosols on clouds, while there is no causality among AOD and CERI, probably because of strong coupling among aerosols and ice nuclei. Based on our analysis, we conclude that CCM method can effectively be used in all aerosol-cloud interactions' studies, searching for causality among the parameters.

TI  - Automatic atmospheric correction for shortwave hyperspectral remote sensing data using a time-dependent deep neural network
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction is an essential step in hyperspectral imaging and target detection from spectrometer remote sensing data. State-of-the-art atmospheric correction approaches either require extensive filed experiments or prior knowledge of atmospheric characteristics to improve the predicted accuracy, which are computational expensive and unsuitable for real time application. To take full advantages of remote sensing observation in quickly and reliably acquiring data for a large area, an automatic and efficient processing tool is required for atmospheric correction. In this paper, we propose a time-dependent neural network for automatic atmospheric correction and target detection using multi-scan hyperspectral data under different elevation angles. In addition to the total radiance, the collection day and time are also incorporated to improve the time-dependency of the network and represent the seasonal and diurnal characteristics of atmosphere and solar radiation. Results show that the proposed network has the capacity to accurately provide atmospheric characteristics and estimate precise reflectivity spectra with 95.72% averaged accuracy for different materials, including vegetation, sea ice, and ocean. Additional experiments are designed to investigate the network's temporal dependency and performance on missing data. The error analysis confirms that our proposed network is capable of estimating atmospheric characteristics under both seasonally and diurnally varying environments and handling the influence of missing data. Both the predicted results and error analysis are promising and demonstrate that our network has the ability of providing accurate atmospheric correction and target detection in real time.

TI  - Seasonal ice flow velocity variations of Polar Record Glacier, East Antarctica during 2016-2019 using Sentinel-1 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing-based investigation of ice flow dynamics of Polar Record Glacier (PRG) during December-April of 2016-2019 has been conducted in this work. Using offset tracking method on the Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, we estimated the glacier ice flow velocity. Ice flow velocity near the glacier terminus indicated higher velocity during January and subsequently showed lower values in December during 2016-2019. The maximum and minimum velocity of the glacier was found to be similar to 2.54 and 0.03 m/d for 2016-2017, similar to 2.49 and 0.03 m/d for 2017-2018, and similar to 2.47 and 0.03 m/d for 2018-2019. Results indicate that the maximum velocity occurred at the terminus of the glacier and minimum flow was detected on the ice sheet portion of the glacier. The average ice front position receded from similar to 900 m in 2016-2017 to similar to 650 m in 2017-2018 to similar to 200 m in 2018-2019. A slowdown near the glacier terminus is observed for the period 2018-2019, while the total glacier advancement was observed to be 28 km(2) from 877 km(2) to 905 km(2 )during the period of 2016-2019. The enhanced velocity at the terminus in the early winter (March and April) was attributed to ice-free water surrounding the PRG terminus which eliminated the buttressing effect.

TI  - Technical note: Emission mapping of key sectors in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, using satellite-derived urban land use data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Emission inventories are important for both simulating pollutant concentrations and designing emission mitigation policies. Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) is the biggest city in Vietnam but lacks an updated spatial emission inventory (EI). In this study, we propose a new approach to update and improve a comprehensive spatial EI for major short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) and greenhouse gases (GHGs) (SO2, NOx, CO, non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs), PM10, PM2.5, black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), NH3, CH4, N2O and CO2). Our originality is the use of satellite-derived urban land use morphological maps which allow spatial disaggregation of emissions. We investigated the possibility of using freely available coarse-resolution satellite-derived digital surface models (DSMs) to estimate building height. Building height is combined with urban built-up area classified from Landsat images and night-time light data to generate annual urban morphological maps. With outstanding advantages of these remote sensing data, our novel method is expected to make a major improvement in comparison with conventional allocation methodologies such as those based on population data. A comparable and consistent local emission inventory (EI) for HCMC has been prepared, including three key sectors, as a successor of previous EIs. It provides annual emissions of transportation, manufacturing industries, and construction and residential sectors at 1 km resolution. The target years are from 2009 to 2016. We consider both Scope 1, all direct emissions from the activities occurring within the city, and Scope 2, that is indirect emissions from electricity purchased. The transportation sector was found to be the most dominant emission sector in HCMC followed by manufacturing industries and residential area, responsible for over 682 Gg CO, 84.8 GgNO(x), 20.4 GgPM(10) and 22 000 GgCO(2) emitted in 2016. Due to a sharp rise in vehicle population, CO, NOx, SO2 and CO2 traffic emissions show increases of 80 %, 160 %, 150% and 103% respectively between 2009 and 2016. Among five vehicle types, motorcycles contributed around 95% to total CO emission, 14% to total NOx emission and 50%-60% to CO2 emission. Heavy-duty vehicles are the biggest emission source of NOx, SO2 and particulate matter (PM) while personal cars are the largest contributors to NMVOCs and CO2. Electricity consumption accounts for the majority of emissions from manufacturing industries and residential sectors. We also found that Scope 2 emissions from manufacturing industries and residential areas in 2016 increased by 87% and 45 %, respectively, in comparison with 2009. Spatial emission disaggregation reveals that emission hotspots are found in central business districts like Quan 1, Quan 4 and Quan 7, where emissions can be over 1900 times those estimated for suburban HCMC. Our estimates show relative agreement with several local inherent EIs, in terms of total amount of emission and sharing ratio among elements of EI. However, the big gap was observed when comparing with REASv2.1, a regional EI, which mainly applied national statistical data. This publication provides not only an approach for updating and improving the local EI but also a novel method of spatial allocation of emissions on the city scale using available data sources.

TI  - Prenatal particulate matter exposure and Intrauterine Fetal Death
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Intrauterine Fetal Death (IUFD) is a rare and tragic pregnancy complication. The main causes for IUFD are largely unknown. Particulate Matter (PM)2.5 exposure has been suggested as an IUFD risk factor.Objectives: To study the association between maternal PM2.5 levels and IUFD risk, to address ethnicity as a possible effect modifier, and to identify a prenatal period during which PM2.5 is most harmful regarding IUFD risk.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study, which included pregnant women at the Soroka University Medical Center between the years 2003?2017. Estimated PM2.5 levels were calculated per residence, using a hybrid model incorporating daily satellite remote sensing data at a 1 km spatial resolution. Multiple gestations, fetuses with congenital malformations or chromosomal abnormalities were excluded. Mean PM2.5 level was calculated per trimester, the entire pregnancy and the last gestational week. Analyses were also performed separately for the two ethnic groups in the study: Jews and Bedouin-Arabs. Multivariable analysis were applied to study the association between PM2.5 exposure at the different periods and IUFD risk.Results: The study included 87,887 pregnancies, 444 (0.5%) ended with IUFD. Mean PM2.5 levels ranged between 18.18 and 22.32 ?m. First trimester and entire pregnancy PM2.5 levels were significantly associated with increased IUFD risk among Jewish women only. In a multivariable model, for every 10 ?g/m3 unit increase in PM2.5 the risk for IUFD increases by 2.98 (95%CI 1.50?5.90) and by 3.61 (95%CI 1.32?9.85) during first trimester and the entire pregnancy, respectively, while adjusting for maternal age, smoking, socioeconomic score and season.Conclusions: In this retrospective cohort an association was found between PM2.5 levels and IUFD among Jewish women only. These results strengthen the importance of addressing this effect modifier when studying air pollution effects on human health.

TI  - Effects of biomass burning on chlorophyll-a concentration and particulate organic carbon in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean based on satellite observations and WRF-Chem model simulations: A case study
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the impact of aerosols on marine ecology has received increasing attention. However, the research on this aspect mainly focuses on the aspect of dust aerosols. As an important source of dissolved iron (Fe) and carbon in the ocean, biomass burning aerosol deposition has an extremely important impact on Marine ecosystem. In this study, a forest fire episode was investigated using satellite observations and the WRF-Chem model from 23 to 26 April 2014. Particular attention was paid to the biomass burning effects on the particulate organic carbon (POC) and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration in the subarctic North Pacific Ocean (SNPO). The geopotential height and CALIPSO results indicated that smoke (biomass burning) aerosols were transported from Northeast Asia to the SNPO in 2 days with the effect of a low-pressure system in Mongolia. The WRF-Chem model also confirmed that CO spread southeastward and reached the SNPO in two days. Wet deposition of smoke aerosols occurred over the research region (RR) (40?-50?N, 150?-160?E) in the SNPO from 25 to 26 April 2014, and both the Chl-a concentration and POC over the RR increased nearly five times one day after the deposition of smoke aerosols. These significant increases were one order of magnitude higher than those that occurred in response to the dust episode, and the time delay was also shorter. This result indicates that smoke aerosols emitted by biomass burning lead to an increase in phytoplankton and POC once deposited and dissolved in the surface ocean, biomass burning emissions may have a more important effect in marine productivity and even ocean carbon cycles for some high nutrient and low chlorophyll (HNLC) regions compared with dust aerosols.

TI  - Global-Aware Ranking Deep Metric Learning for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image retrieval (RSIR) is the process of searching and acquiring similar images to a query image in a large-scale remote sensing image database. Several recent studies encourage the discriminative feature space by developing loss functions under the deep metric learning paradigm. However, there are still some problems that have not been well resolved. The first is that for each category in the RSIR data set, the similarity among the samples within the category is different, so the samples and the number of samples that need to be learned should also be different. We propose intraclass space sample mining, which selects ``misplaced'' samples based on the distribution of samples, instead of artificially setting the boundary threshold of sample mining as usual. The second problem is the inconsistency between the loss reduction direction and the optimization direction. We propose the cost-sensitive loss (CSL) by penalizing the error samples in the candidate list. As a plug-in, CSL combined with other local losses can effectively improve retrieval accuracy. Finally, in view of the problem that the current loss is optimized based on local space and cannot distinguish different categories with high similarity, we propose a global-aware ranking loss (GRL) model. This is a global optimization model based on the feature space and retrieval candidate list. We have conducted comprehensive experiments on two public remote sensing data sets. Compared with the baseline, our proposed algorithm can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

TI  - An MRF-Based Multigranularity Edge-Preservation Optimization for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Semantic segmentation is one of the most important tasks in the field of remote sensing image processing. Many methods have been proposed to realize it at the pixel granularity or object granularity. Specifically, the pixel-based methods usually can effectively extract the detailed information and edges, and the object-based methods can keep the internal consistency of each land cover or land use. The Markov random field (MRF) model provides a statistical way to combine the advantages of both pixel and object granularities together. However, current MRF-based methods still face a problem, that is, how to ensure that the advantages of different granularities will complement each other, not that disadvantages will affect advantages. To solve this problem, a new multigranularity edge-preservation optimization is proposed in this letter. The proposed method first represents the image with a series of granularities from the object to the pixel by downsampling. Then, the MRF model is defined on each granularity. By defining an edge set for each granularity, during the process of downsampling, the proposed method can continuously correct edges while maintaining intraclass consistency. Experiments of Gaofen-2 and SPOT5 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, the proposed method can be also used as the postprocessing step for deep learning. The experiment of the Pavia University hyperspectral image illustrates it for an instance of DeepLab v3+.

M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are downslope mass movements, which implies the combination of natural complex processes and sometimes affect anthropic resources. Many researchers inventoried landslides in the Argentinian Andean Precordillera by using aerial photography, satellite images, geomorphological analyses and GPS measures. Those located in latitudes between 31 degrees S and 34 degrees S have been mainly linked to seismic activity. However, due to the inaccessibility of sites, permanent monitoring has proved difficult. In this contribution, we detect three active landslides occurring in the Andean Precordillera of San Juan province using Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR) based time series techniques and preliminary characterize its geomorphology. We use data provided by ESA's Sentinel 1 (C-Band SAR), Sentinel 2 (Optical) acquired between October 2014 and December 2018. The observed landslides are located at unstable hillsides oriented to the West and their deposits could potentially end in the San Juan River. As a result of the time series analysis, we interpreted that the three landslides seem to be reactivated by Illapel Mw 8.3 Earthquake (September 16th, 2015). In addition, one of them, has an acceleration at the beginning of 2016, linked to rapid snow melt.

TI  - Application of information fusion techniques and satellite products in the optimal redesign of rain gauge networks
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rain gauge networks are usually redesigned to improve the accuracy of spatial and temporal estimates and reduce the monitoring costs. In addition to the rain-gauge data, satellite-based data can be used for the optimal redesign of rainfall monitoring networks. Despite high spatial and temporal resolutions of products of meteorological satellites, they must be calibrated using ground-based data. In this paper, a new methodology is presented for an optimal redesign of rain-gauge networks. In this methodology, after the bias correction of some satellite-based rainfall products (i.e., PERSIANN-CCS, TRMM3B42RTV7, and CMORPH), they are combined using a Bayesian information fusion technique. The spatiotemporal rainfall maps, which are developed using the fusion model, are used in an optimization model. The optimization model provides the optimal locations of the rain-gauge stations, considering the objectives of minimizing both the monitoring cost and the average standard deviation of estimation errors. To illustrate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology, it is applied to the Khorasan Razavi Province in Iran. The results show that by using the satellite data and the Bayesian information fusion technique, the summation of standard deviations of estimation errors is significantly reduced from 18,787.9 to 778.28 mm.

TI  - The 2016 flood of Bihar, India: an analysis of its causes
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is common in the sub-Himalayan plains of the Indian state of Bihar. During the massive flood of the Ganga between 18 and 31 August 2016, 15 (out of 38) districts and 3459 villages of the state were affected. The flood inundated 6006 km(2) of area, harmed 8.82 million people, and caused damages worth US$ 73.99 million. To investigate the factors behind the event, we utilised SRTM elevation data and Landsat-8 OLI images to extract drainage networks and reservoirs of the region. Inundated area was delineated using MNDWI on MODIS data of 25-Aug-2016. Different hydrometeorological parameters employed in the study include percentage departure of monthly rainfall, discharge data of selected dams and barrages, and gauge data from six stations along a 526 km stretch of the Ganga: Buxar, Gandhi Ghat (Patna), Hathidah, Munger, Kahalgaon, and Manikchak Ghat. It was found that the flood was mainly caused by rapid release of water from the Bansagar Dam on the Son from 18 to 20-Aug-2016, as a tropical storm traversed through its upper catchment. Contributions from the Ganga's Himalayan tributaries and upstream of the flooded area were negligible. The flood peak (50.52 m), recorded at Gandhi Ghat on 21 August 2016, passed downstream, and reached Manikchak Ghat (25.78 m) on 27-28 August 2016. The upstream extension of flooding due to the highest recorded flood level of 26.66 m of the Ganga at Farakka can only reach up to 6 km above Kahalgaon. Therefore, impoundment of the Ganga by the Farakka Barrage cannot have any impact on inundation of the areas above that limit and did not cause the 2016 floods.

TI  - Contrasting seasonal patterns of relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity and their influence on breeding and winter bird richness patterns across the conterminous United States
T2  - ECOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental heterogeneity enhances species richness by creating niches and providing refugia. Spatial variation in climate has a particularly strong positive correlation with richness, but is often indirectly inferred from proxy variables, such as elevation and related topographic heterogeneity indices, or derived from interpolated coarse-grain weather station data. Our aim was to develop new remotely sensed metrics of relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity, compare them with proxy measures, and evaluate their performance in predicting species richness patterns. We analyzed Landsat 8's Thermal Infrared Sensor data, calculated two thermal metrics during summer and winter, and compared their seasonal spatial patterns with those of elevation and topographic heterogeneity. We fit generalized least squares models to evaluate each variable's effect in predicting seasonal bird richness using data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Generally speaking, neither elevation nor topographic heterogeneity were good proxies for temperature or thermal heterogeneity, respectively. Relative temperature had a non-linear relationship with elevation that was negatively quadratic in summer, but slightly positively quadratic in winter. Topographic heterogeneity had a stronger positive relationship with thermal heterogeneity in winter than in summer. The magnitude and direction of elevation-temperature and topographic heterogeneity-thermal heterogeneity relationships in each season also varied substantially across ecoregions. Remotely sensed metrics of relative temperature and thermal heterogeneity improved the predictive performance of species richness models, and both thermal variables had significant effects on bird richness that were independent of elevation and topographic heterogeneity. Thermal heterogeneity was positively related to total breeding bird richness, migrant breeding bird richness and resident bird richness, whereas topographic heterogeneity was negatively related to total breeding richness and unrelated to migrant or resident bird richness. Because thermal and topographic heterogeneity had contrasting seasonal patterns and effects on richness, they must be carefully contextualized when guiding conservation priorities.

TI  - Changes in black carbon emissions over Europe due to COVID-19 lockdowns
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Following the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and its spread to the rest of the world, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Without effective treatment in the initial pandemic phase, social distancing and mandatory quarantines were introduced as the only available preventative measure. In contrast to the detrimental societal impacts, air quality improved in all countries in which strict lockdowns were applied, due to lower pollutant emissions. Here we investigate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe on ambient black carbon (BC), which affects climate and damages health, using in situ observations from 17 European stations in a Bayesian inversion framework. BC emissions declined by 23 kt in Europe (20% in Italy, 40% in Germany, 34% in Spain, 22% in France) during lockdowns compared to the same period in the previous 5 years, which is partially attributed to COVID-19 measures. BC temporal variation in the countries enduring the most drastic restrictions showed the most distinct lockdown impacts. Increased particle light absorption in the beginning of the lockdown, confirmed by assimilated satellite and remote sensing data, suggests residential combustion was the dominant BC source. Accordingly, in central and Eastern Europe, which experienced lower than average temperatures, BC was elevated compared to the previous 5 years. Nevertheless, an average decrease of 11% was seen for the whole of Europe compared to the start of the lockdown period, with the highest peaks in France (42 %), Germany (21 %), UK (13 %), Spain (11 %) and Italy (8 %). Such a decrease was not seen in the previous years, which also confirms the impact of COVID-19 on the European emissions of BC.

T2  - Zhonghua zhong liu za zhi [Chinese journal of oncology]
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To compare the application effect of blue dye single tracer and blue dye combined with nuclide double tracer in sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) of breast cancer surgery. Methods: A total of 92 breast cancer patients in Shandong Cancer Hospital and Institute from November 2017 to October 2019 underwent methyleneblue dye combined with (99)Tc(m) sulfur colloid nuclide double tracer in SLNB, while other 92 cases in Jining First People Hospital underwent blue dye single tracer. The number of SLN detection, detection rate, accuracy rate, sensitivity, and false negative rate of the two groups were compared. The impacts of age, menstruation, tumor location, tumor size, clinical stage, pathological type, and estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal receptor 2 (HER-2), molecular typing, dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI)on the detection rate of SLN were analyzed. Results: The number of detection, detection rate, accuracy, sensitivity, and false negative rate of the blue dye single tracer group were 3.20±1.10, 90.22%, 93.48%, 95.24% and 4.76%, respectively; the double tracer group were 3.37±1.02, 92.39%, 95.65%, 95.65% and 4.35%, respectively, without significant difference (all P>0.05). In different age, menstrual condition, tumor location, clinical stage, pathological type, ER, PR, HER-2 expression and molecular typing, the detection rate of single tracer group and double tracer group had no significant difference (all P>0.05). However, in the tumor size of 2-5 cm and without DCE-MRI examination, the detection rate of single tracer group was significantly lower than that of double tracer group. Conclusion: The effect of blue dye single tracer in detecting SLN of breast cancer is equivalent to that of double tracer method, which is worthy of promotion and application in primary hospitals.

TI  - Multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain-based artificial neural network for modelling future land-specific carbon emission pattern and its influences on surface temperature
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable and accurate environmental state prediction can help in long-term sustainable planning and management. Enormous land-use/ land-cover (LULC) transformation has been increasing the carbon emissions (CEs) and land surface temperature (LST) around the world. The study aimed to (i) examine the influences of land specific CEs on LST dynamics and (ii) simulate future potential LULC, CEs and LST pattern of Khulna City Corporation. Landsat satellite images of the year 2000, 2010 and 2020 were used to derive LULC, LST and CEs pattern and change. The correlation between land-use indices (NDBI, NDVI, NDWI) and LST was examined to explore the impacts of LULC change on LST. Unplanned urbanization has increased 11.79 Km(2)(26.10%) buildup areas and 25,268 tons of CEs during 2000-2020. The calculated R-2 value indicates the strong positive correlation between CEs and LST. To simulate the future LULC, CEs and LST pattern for the year 2030 and 2040, multi-layer perceptron-Markov chain (MLP-MC)-based artificial neural network model was utilized with the accuracy rate of 94.12%, 99% and 98.48% for LULC, LST and CEs model, respectively. The simulation shows that by 2040, buildup area will increase to 87.33%, net CEs will increase by 19.82x 10(4)tons, and carbon absorptions will decrease by 23. 55 x 10(4)tons and 69.54% of the total study area's LST will be above 39 degrees C. Such predictions signify the necessity of implementing a sustainable urban development plan immediately for the sustainable, habitable and sound urban environment.

TI  - Rephotography, permanent plots and remote sensing data provide varying insights on vegetation change on subantarctic Macquarie Island, 1980-2015
T2  - AUSTRAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite its remoteness, the vegetation of Subantarctic Macquarie Island is amongst the most thoroughly surveyed and monitored in Australia. Eradication of invasive European rabbits was achieved in 2011, after a decline in introduced rabbit populations in the eighties and nineties and a resurgence in the early twenty-first century. The impacts of introduced rabbits and climate change on the vegetation of Macquarie Island are well-documented from long-term plots situated in some, but not all, of the vegetation types. Satellite data are sporadic, with substantial could-free coverage rare. The island has been well-photographed over many years, and several series of long-term photo-monitoring sites have been established over the past few decades. We compared insights on vegetation change derived from repeat landscape photography three years after myxoma virus was established, rabbit population resurgence and rabbits eradication, with plant species cover data from a set of long-term monitoring sites, and with spectral vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery covering the transition from high rabbit numbers to no rabbits. The repeat photography confirmed many well-documented vegetation trends, as well as providing an indication of previously unreported trends: stability of Acaena herbfield despite reduced disturbance; increase in cover of Pleurophyllum hookeri; increase in short grassland vegetation; and constancy in cover of Azorella macquariensis. Although subject to errors related to differences in sample size and resolution, the rephotography data gave the best information on spatial and temporal patterns of overall vegetation change. The plot data, where comparable, were not fully consistent with the rephotography data and are expensive to collect, requiring scientific expertise in the field and much time, while the sporadically available remote sensing data were effective in monitoring the revegetation/devegetation of ground and the recovery of Poa foliosa but we were unable to detect other changes.

TI  - Developing a spatially explicit modelling and evaluation framework for integrated carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation: Application in southern Finland
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The challenges posed by climate change and biodiversity loss are deeply interconnected. Successful co-managing of these tangled drivers requires innovative methods that can prioritize and target management actions against multiple criteria, while also enabling cost-effective land use planning and impact scenario assessment. This paper synthesises the development and application of an integratedmultidisciplinary modelling and evaluation framework for carbon and biodiversity in forest systems. By analysing and spatio-temporally modelling carbon processes and biodiversity elements, we determine an optimal solution for their co-management in the study landscape. We also describe how advanced Earth Observation measurements can be used to enhance mapping and monitoring of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. The scenarios used for the dynamic models were based on official Finnish policy goals for forest management and climate change mitigation. The development and testing of the system were executed in a large region in southern Finland (Kokemaenjoki basin, 27,024 km(2)) containing highly instrumented LTER (Long-Term Ecosystem Research) stations; these LTER data sources were complemented by fieldwork, remote sensing and national data bases. In the study area, estimated total net emissionswere currently 4.2 TgCO(2)eq a(-1), but modelling of forestrymeasures and anthropogenic emission reductions demonstrated that it would be possible to achieve the stated policy goal of carbon neutrality by low forest harvest intensity. We show how this policy-relevant information can be further utilized for optimal allocation of set-aside forest areas for nature conservation, which would significantly contribute to preserving both biodiversity and carbon values in the region. Biodiversity gain in the area could be increased without a loss of carbon-related benefits. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Emergent vulnerability to climate-driven disturbances in European forests
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest disturbance regimes are expected to intensify as Earth's climate changes. Quantifying forest vulnerability to disturbances and understanding the underlying mechanisms is crucial to develop mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, observational evidence is largely missing at regional to continental scales. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of European forests to fires, windthrows and insect outbreaks during the period 1979-2018 by integrating machine learning with disturbance data and satellite products. We show that about 33.4 billion tonnes of forest biomass could be seriously affected by these disturbances, with higher relative losses when exposed to windthrows (40%) and fires (34%) compared to insect outbreaks (26%). The spatial pattern in vulnerability is strongly controlled by the interplay between forest characteristics and background climate. Hotspot regions for vulnerability are located at the borders of the climate envelope, in both southern and northern Europe. There is a clear trend in overall forest vulnerability that is driven by a warming-induced reduction in plant defence mechanisms to insect outbreaks, especially at high latitudes. Natural disturbances imperil healthy and productive forests, but quantifying their effects at large scales is challenging. Here the authors apply machine learning to disturbance records and satellite data to quantify and map European forest vulnerability to fires, windthrows, and insect outbreaks through 1979-2018.

TI  - Validation of Oil Trajectory and Fate Modeling of the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Trajectory and fate modeling of the oil released during the Deepwater Horizon blowout was performed for April to September of 2010 using a variety of input data sets, including combinations of seven hydrodynamic and four wind models, to determine the inputs leading to the best agreement with observations and to evaluate their reliability for quantifying exposure of marine resources to floating and subsurface oil. Remote sensing (satellite imagery) data were used to estimate the amount and distribution of floating oil over time for comparison with the model's predictions. The model-predicted locations and amounts of shoreline oiling were compared to documentation of stranded oil by shoreline assessment teams. Surface floating oil trajectory and distribution was largely wind driven. However, trajectories varied with the hydrodynamic model used as input, and was closest to observations when using specific implementations of the HYbrid Coordinate Ocean Model modeled currents that accounted for both offshore and nearshore currents. Shoreline oiling distributions reflected the paths of the surface oil trajectories and were more accurate when westward flows near the Mississippi Delta were simulated. The modeled movements and amounts of oil floating over time were in good agreement with estimates from interpretation of remote sensing data, indicating initial oil droplet distributions and oil transport and fate processes produced oil distribution results reliable for evaluating environmental exposures in the water column and from floating oil at water surface. The model-estimated daily average water surface area affected by floating oil >1.0 g/m(2) was 6,720 km(2), within the range of uncertainty for the 11,200 km(2) estimate based on remote sensing. Modeled shoreline oiling extended over 2,600 km from the Apalachicola Bay area of Florida to Terrebonne Bay area of Louisiana, comparing well to the estimated 2,100 km oiled based on incomplete shoreline surveys.

As well established, individual-level factors, such as stress, smoking, drugs, and caffeine intake, reduce sleep duration and quality. However, studies of the effect of environmental risk factors, such as artificial light at night (ALAN) and noise, on sleep have been infrequent. Using records obtained from the 2017 Social Survey of Israel and combined with ALAN satellite data and various proxies for traffic noise, the present study aimed to determine how the combination of ALAN and traffic noise impact sleep duration and quality in urban areas. The increase of road density at the place of residence reduces average sleep duration by similar to 4.5% (similar to 18 min.) and increases the frequency of reported sleep difficulties by similar to 3.5%, all other factors held equal. Similarly, an increase in ALAN exposure reduces average sleep duration by similar to 3% (similar to 12 min) and increases the frequency of reported sleep difficulties by similar to 11%. The study also reveals a significant interaction between the two environmental risk factors in question, with the adverse impact of ALAN on sleep quality especially pronounced in high noise exposure areas.

TI  - Spinning ancient straw into contemporary gold: transforming folklore into supernatural crime fiction
T2  - NEW WRITING-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE PRACTICE AND THEORY OF CREATIVE WRITING
M3  - Article
AB  - Folktales inspire me, as a reader, an academic and as a novelist. That the story has come from an aural tradition makes me wonder about its hidden truths. My creative practice is concerned with the question of how to balance supernaturalism with realism in the contemporary thriller, when adapting a folktale, in this case, 'The Mermaid Wife', a Selkie tale from the isle of Unst. My artistic process begins by extrapolating from the not-said, finding chinks in the perspective and narration of the original tale in order to form the basis of the questions posed by my novel. In both of the folktales I have novelised, I began with the assumption that the male point of view was dominant, whereas in both of my novels I choose to shift the perspective to the feminist. I argue here that by doing this, the supernatural aspects - or even magic - in the original tales form part of their rational, pre-scientific worldview. In my novel, by contrast, the supernatural is transformed into a metaphor for the female experience. I recognise, nonetheless, that my reading of the folktale as 'male' and the novels as 'female' raises some troubling and difficult questions.

TI  - Potential of hotspot solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence for better tracking terrestrial photosynthesis
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) opens a new window for quantifying a key ecological variable, the terrestrial ecosystem gross primary production (GPP), because of the revealed strong SIF-GPP correlation. However, similar to many other remotely sensed metrics, SIF observations suffer from the sun-sensor geometry effects, which may have important impacts on the SIF-GPP relationship but remain poorly understood. Here we used remotely sensed SIF, globally distributed tower GPP data, and a mechanistic model to provide a systematic analysis. Our results reveal that leaf physiology, canopy structure, and sun-sensor geometries all affect the SIF-GPP relationship. In particular, we found that SIF observations in the sun-tracking hotspot direction can be a better proxy of GPP due to the similar responses of light use efficiency and SIF escaping probability in the hotspot direction to the increasing incoming solar radiation. Such conclusions are supported by a variety of modeling simulations and satellite observations over various plant function types, at different time scales and with satellite observational modes. This study demonstrates the potential and advantage of normalizing SIF observations to the hotspot direction for better global GPP estimations. This study also demonstrates the great potentials of current and future spaceborne sun-tracking satellite missions for a significant improvement in measuring and monitoring, at a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, the changes in terrestrial ecosystem GPP in response to anticipated changes in the Earth's environmental conditions.

TI  - Can internal mammary lymph nodes irradiation bring survival benefits for breast cancer patients? A systematic review and meta-analysis of 12,705 patients in 12 studies
T2  - RADIATION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Objective To evaluate the effect of prophylactic irradiation of internal mammary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients. Methods The computer searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of science, CNKI, Wanfang Medical Network, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database to find clinical studies on internal mammary lymph node irradiation (IMNI) in breast cancer. The quality of the included literature was evaluated according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Stata14 software was used for meta-analysis. Results A total of 12,705 patients in 12 articles were included for meta-analyzed. Compared with patients who unirradiated internal mammary lymph nodes (non-IMNI), the risk of death for patients after IMNI was reduced by 11% (HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79-1.00, P = 0.0470); DFS of group mixed N+ patients (high risk group) was significantly improved after IMNI (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.49-0.69, P < 0.001). Further subgroup analysis shows that compared with non-IMNI, DFS was significantly increased in N(1)or ypN(1) subgroup (HR 0.65, 95% CI 0.49-0.87, P = 0.003) and N(2)or ypN(2) subgroup (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.37-0.70, P < 0.001) after IMNI, but there was no statistical difference in DFS between the IMNI and non-IMNI groups in N-0 subgroup (HR 1.02 95% CI 0.87-1.20, P = 0.794) and N-3 or ypN(3) subgroup (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.49-1.45, P = 0.547). No serious incidents were reported in all the included studies, and most of the acute and late side effects were mild and tolerable. Conclusion Under modern radiotherapy techniques, IMNI can safely and effectively bring clinical benefits to N1-2 breast cancer patients, but its role in N-0, N-3 breast cancer patients remains to be further studied.

TI  - Passive Synthetic Aperture High-Precision Radiation Source Location by Single Satellite
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive localization is important because of its strong concealment and long detection distance. Space-borne passive radiation source location technologies have contradicting characteristics of wide coverage and high-precision position. Hence, accurate target identification is difficult to realize. A novel measurement that utilizes passive synthetic aperture is presented in this letter to measure the time of the satellite's passing zenith precisely. In the beam coverage duration, the radiation carrier Doppler component is extracted and accumulated to synthesize an equivalent large virtual satellite antenna azimuth aperture. Taking advantage of the linear Doppler rate, a local matched filter is designed to implement a 2-D search. Doppler rate and zero Doppler point correspond to the target range and azimuth locations, respectively. The corresponding subastral point position radiation source can then be determined. Practical experiment results from an unmanned aerial vehicle platform demonstrated the effectiveness, wide coverage, and high-precision meter scale of the proposed method. Satellite data were also utilized to verify the feasibility of the system.

TI  - Hindu-Muslim relations in Kashmir: A critical evaluation
T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - India was under British colonial rule for a good number of years with her plural ethno-religious background and identity, which was to become the basis of an unending conflict. Several pre-colonial and post-colonial conditioning antecedents have been marshalled to buttress the premise leading to the conclusion that the British colonial era laid the time bomb along ethno-religious contours which exploded in 1947 thereby giving rise to the balkanisation of India into two separate states, that is India and Pakistan. Two major religious groups that is Hindus and Muslims became the gladiators in India's partition. The Kashmir region of India, a town of religious confluence, has a history of conflicts that is perceived by different people as politico-religious and socio-economic. This article focuses on religion as a core tenet of every cultural worldview and its significance to both Hindus and Muslims, and how it has become the progressively vital central marker of identity and a smouldering keg of gun powder for conflict in Kashmir. Furthermore, this article contends that religion plays a key role in the conflict between Hindus and Muslims in Kashmir because of its significance and influence on both religions. India that is known as a mother to various religions cannot relegate the primary role of religion in their political and socio-economic affairs. Therefore, it is right to acknowledge politico-religious and socio-economic factors in the Hindu-Muslim conflict in the state of Kashmir. And, it will not be wrong to affirm that religion plays a key role in the conflict between Hindus and Muslims in Kashmir.Contribution: The article is a contribution in religious issues in India. It reveals how political power and sociopolitical antecedents are mostly recognised by religious scholars and historians as the reason for the fracas between Hindus and Muslims. It explains the influence and implication of religion in the Hindu-Muslim relations in Kashmir region.

TI  - Floodwater detection in urban areas using Sentinel-1 and WorldDEM data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an important tool for emergency flood incident management. At present, operational services are mainly aimed at flood mapping in rural areas, as mapping in urban areas is hampered by the complicated backscattering mechanisms occurring there. A method for detecting flooding at high resolution in urban areas that may contain dense housing is presented. This largely uses remotely sensed data sets that are readily available on a global basis, including open-access Sentinel-1 SAR data, the WorldDEM digital surface model (DSM), and open-accessWorld Settlement Footprint data to identify urban areas. The method is a change detection technique that locally estimates flood levels in urban areas. It searches for increased SAR backscatter in the post-flood image due to double scattering between water (rather than unflooded ground) and adjacent buildings, and reduced SAR backscatter in areas away from high slopes. Areas of urban flooding are detected by comparing an interpolated flood level surface to the DSM. The method was tested on two flood events that occurred in the UK during the storms of Winter 2019-2020. High urban flood detection accuracies were achieved for the event in moderate density housing. The accuracy was reduced for the event in dense housing, when street widths became comparable to the DSM resolution, though it would still be useful for incident management. The method has potential for operational use for detecting urban flooding in near real-time on a global basis. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Evaluating the distribution of priority benthic habitats through a remotely operated vehicle to support conservation measures off Linosa Island (Sicily Channel, Mediterranean Sea)
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Explorations of the Mediterranean deep sea using remotely operated vehicles have shown that the sea bed hosts rich habitats, supporting high biodiversity. However, there have been only a few studies dealing with the southern part of the basin, leading to limited protection and conservation efforts in this area.This study aimed to explore the sea bed off Linosa Island (Sicily Channel, southern Mediterranean Sea), which is considered a 'sentinel area' for alien species and global environmental changes owing to its geographic position, thus deserving special attention.Remotely operated vehicle surveys, carried out in 2016 and 2017, were analysed to provide the first ecological characterization of benthic assemblages at depths -19 - -384 m around Linosa Island.Communities were dominated by three priority habitats, amounting to 39% of the almost 5 km of the sea floor that was surveyed. These are represented in the euphotic zone by Posidonia oceanica meadows and, at greater depth, by newly discovered dense coral forests and extended rhodolith/maerl beds. Sixteen habitat-forming species included in the Red List of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (e.g. gorgonians Eunicella cavolini and Paramuricea clavata, and black corals Antipathella subpinnata and Leiopathes glaberrima) were recorded, as well as individuals of Sargassum sp. at -100 m depth.The volcanic island of Linosa represents a small, naturally preserved area, with very limited human pressure, hosting rich marine benthic biodiversity. Given the high species and habitat richness, we recommend its inclusion in the Special Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance project (United Nations Environment Programme) and suggest a redefinition of the existing marine protected area extension.

TI  - Assimilating aerosol optical properties related to size and absorption from POLDER/PARASOL with an ensemble data assimilation system
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - A data assimilation system for aerosol, based on an ensemble Kalman filter, has been developed for the ECHAM - Hamburg Aerosol Model (ECHAM-HAM) global aerosol model and applied to POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER)-derived observations of optical properties. The advantages of this assimilation system is that the ECHAM-HAM aerosol modal scheme carries both aerosol particle numbers and mass which are both used in the data assimilation system as state vectors, while POLDER retrievals in addition to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Angstrom exponent (AE) also provide information related to aerosol absorption like aerosol absorption optical depth (AAOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA). The developed scheme can simultaneously assimilate combinations of multiple variables (e.g., AOD, AE, SSA) to optimally estimate mass mixing ratio and number mixing ratio of different aerosol species. We investigate the added value of assimilating AE, AAOD and SSA, in addition to the commonly used AOD, by conducting multiple experiments where different combinations of retrieved properties are assimilated. Results are evaluated with (independent) POLDER, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) Dark Target, MODIS Deep Blue and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations. The experiment where POLDER AOD, AE and SSA are assimilated shows systematic improvement in mean error, mean absolute error and correlation for AOD, AE, AAOD and SSA compared to the experiment where only AOD is assimilated. The same experiment reduces the global ME against AERONET from 0.072 to 0.001 for AOD, from 0.273 to 0.009 for AE and from -0.012 to 0.002 for AAOD. Additionally, sensitivity experiments reveal the benefits of assimilating AE over AOD at a second wavelength or SSA over AAOD, possibly due to a simpler observation covariance matrix in the present data assimilation framework. We conclude that the currently available AE and SSA do positively impact data assimilation.

TI  - The Evolved Psychology of Psychedelic Set and Setting: Inferences Regarding the Roles of Shamanism and Entheogenic Ecopsychology
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PHARMACOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - This review illustrates the relevance of shamanism and its evolution under effects of psilocybin as a framework for identifying evolved aspects of psychedelic set and setting. Effects of 5HT2 psychedelics on serotonin, stress adaptation, visual systems and personality illustrate adaptive mechanisms through which psychedelics could have enhanced hominin evolution as an environmental factor influencing selection for features of our evolved psychology. Evolutionary psychology perspectives on ritual, shamanism and psychedelics provides bases for inferences regarding psychedelics' likely roles in hominin evolution as exogenous neurotransmitter sources through their effects in selection for innate dispositions for psychedelic set and setting. Psychedelics stimulate ancient brain structures and innate modular thought modules, especially self-awareness, other awareness, "mind reading," spatial and visual intelligences. The integration of these innate modules are also core features of shamanism. Cross-cultural research illustrates shamanism is an empirical phenomenon of foraging societies, with its ancient basis in collective hominid displays, ritual alterations of consciousness, and endogenous healing responses. Shamanic practices employed psychedelics and manipulated extrapharmacological effects through stimulation of serotonin and dopamine systems and augmenting processes of the reptilian and paleomammalian brains. Differences between chimpanzee maximal displays and shamanic rituals reveal a zone of proximal development in hominin evolution. The evolution of the mimetic capacity for enactment, dance, music, and imitation provided central capacities underlying shamanic performances. Other chimp-human differences in ritualized behaviors are directly related to psychedelic effects and their integration of innate modular thought processes. Psychedelics and other ritual alterations of consciousness stimulate these and other innate responses such as soul flight and death-and-rebirth experiences. These findings provided bases for making inferences regarding foundations of our evolved set, setting and psychology. Shamanic setting is eminently communal with singing, drumming, dancing and dramatic displays. Innate modular thought structures are prominent features of the set of shamanism, exemplified in animism, animal identities, perceptions of spirits, and psychological incorporation of spirit others. A shamanic-informed psychedelic therapy includes: a preparatory set with practices such as sexual abstinence, fasting and dream incubation; a set derived from innate modular cognitive capacities and their integration expressed in a relational animistic worldview; a focus on internal imagery manifesting a presentational intelligence; and spirit relations involving incorporation of animals as personal powers. Psychedelic research and treatment can adopt this shamanic biogenetic paradigm to optimize set, setting and ritual frameworks to enhance psychedelic effects.

T2  - OCEAN DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The input of mechanical power to the ocean due to the surface wind stress, in regions which correspond to different regimes of ocean dynamics, is considered using data from satellites observations. Its dependence on the coarse-graining range of the atmospheric and oceanic velocity in space from 0.5 to 10(circle) and time from 6 h to 40 days is determined. In the area of the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio extensions, the dependence of the power input on space-time coarse-graining varies over tenfold for the coarse-graining considered. It decreases over twofold for the Gulf Stream extension and threefold for the Kuroshio extension, when the coarse-graining length scale passes from a few degrees to 0.5(circle) at a temporal coarse-graining scale of a few days. It increases over threefold in the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio extensions when the coarse-graining passes from several days to 6 h at a spatial coarse-graining of a few degrees. The power input is found to increase monotonically with shorter coarse-graining in time. Its variation with coarse-graining in space has no definite sign. Results show that including the dynamics at scales below a few degrees reduces considerably the power input by air-sea interaction in regions of strongly nonlinear ocean currents. When the ocean velocities are not considered in the shear calculation, the power input is considerably (up to threefold) increased. The dependence of the power input on coarse-graining in space and time is close to being multiplicatively separable in all regions and for most of the coarse-graining domain considered.

TI  - Latest 30-m map of mature rubber plantations in Mainland Southeast Asia and Yunnan province of China: Spatial patterns and geographical characteristics
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the location, area and extent of rubber plantations is a prerequisite for assessing their ecological and environmental impacts. Mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) and Yunnan province (MSEA&YN) in China are globally important rubber-planting regions. Rubber cultivation in areas at moderate and low altitudes (<1000 m) within these regions has expanded rapidly in recent years. However, datasets of maps generated at a fine spatial resolution are still unavailable for MSEA&YN. Because of this, three relevant and important questions remain unanswered: what are the northernmost boundary for rubber production in these regions, what is the highest altitude at which rubber is produced, and how are the plantations distributed in (cross-) border regions? An approach of the phenology- and Landsat-based re-normalized vegetation index (RNVI), originally developed for Xishuangbanna in southern China, is used in this study to verify the feasibility of mapping mature rubber plantations in MSEA&YN using the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager data products acquired from January to April, 2013 to 2018. Characteristics of the vertical and horizontal distributions of mature rubber plantations in MSEA&YN, as well as national differences especially in the (cross-) borders, were examined using the generated map. The results showed that the RNVI method, although tailored to the northern edge of the tropics, is useful for detecting mature rubber plantations in MSEA&YN. The latest map of mature rubber plantations indicated that they occupied a total area of 7.69 x 10(6) ha, accounting for 3.32% of the study area. Spatial analyses showed three typical features of the distribution: new plantations at higher (over 1000 m) and lower (below 200 m) elevations, more cultivation in the borderlands (over a half within 60 km buffers), and their northward movement (as far as 25 degrees N). The results of this study have important implications for phenological methods verification in the tropics, and provide valuable information on mature rubber plantations in MSEA&YN.

TI  - Monitoring tidal flats boundaries through combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal flats are a critical habitat to support a large population of wildlife. It is the habitat of fish, shellfish, birds and mammals, providing the necessary material and energy for the survival and reproduction of a large number of biological populations. The monitoring of tidal flats boundaries is important for the regional biodiversity and coastal sustainability. Since the SAR data is hard to distinguish tidal flats and land part, the existing efforts of monitoring tidal flats is mainly based on optical data with low tide level. However, the effects of frequent cloud cover and foggy weather constraint its large-scale application for monitoring the position and extent of tidal flats. Here we presented a new method for monitoring tidal flats by combining Sentinel-1A with low tide level and optical Sentinel 2A images with high tide level, taking the Fuqing city in Southeast China as the study area. A spectral index integrating Sentinel-1 and Sentinel 2 and a simple threshold-based method were proposed, and we found it efficient for rapid tidal flats monitoring. The result showed that a combined use of Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A data has a great potential for extraction and monitoring tidal flats in the coastal zones. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Phenological corrections to a field-scale, ET-based crop stress indicator: An application to yield forecasting across the US Corn Belt
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil moisture deficiency is a major factor in determining crop yields in water-limited agricultural production regions. Evapotranspiration (ET), which consists of crop water use through transpiration and water loss through direct soil evaporation, is a good indicator of soil moisture availability and vegetation health. ET therefore has been an integral part of many yield estimation efforts. The Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) is an ET-based crop stress indicator that describes temporal anomalies in a normalized evapotranspiration metric as derived from satellite remote sensing. ESI has demonstrated the capacity to explain regional yield variability in water-limited regions. However, its performance in some regions where the vegetation cycle is intensively managed appears to be degraded due to interannual phenological variability. This investigation selected three study sites across the U.S. Corn Belt - Mead, NE, Ames, IA and Champaign, IL - to investigate the potential operational value of 30-m resolution, phenologically corrected ESI datasets for yield prediction. The analysis was conducted over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017, which included both drought and pluvial conditions as well as a broad range in yield values. Detrended yield anomalies for corn and soybean were correlated with ESI computed using annual ET curves temporally aligned based on (1) calendar date, (2) crop emergence date, and (3) a growing degree day (GDD) scaled time axis. Results showed that ESI has good correlations with yield anomalies at the county scale and that phenological corrections to the annual temporal alignment of the ET timeseries improve the correlation, especially when the time axis is defined by GDD rather than the calendar date. Peak correlations occur in the silking stage for corn and the reproductive stage for soybean ? phases when these crops are particularly sensitive to soil moisture deficiencies. Regression equations derived at the time of peak correlation were used to estimate yields at county scale using a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy. The ESI-based yield estimates agree well with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) county-level crop yield data, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.79 to 0.93 and percent root-mean-square errors of 5-8%. These results demonstrate that remotely sensed ET at high spatiotemporal resolution can convey valuable water stress information for forecasting crop yields across the Corn Belt if interannual phenological variability is considered.

AB  - This study proposes a new scattering vector parameterisation method for interpreting the coherent target scattering. This new scattering model, which has the same form as the alpha/beta model, consists of five polarimetric parameters including the normalisation factor. Validation is performed on ALOS-2/PALSAR data. In comparison with the current vector models, the new coherent scattering vector is superior in distinguishing targets with different physical scattering behaviours.

TI  - Estimation of anthropogenic heat flux and its coupling analysis with urban building characteristics - A case study of typical cities in the Yangtze River Delta, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The anthropogenic heat emitted into the atmosphere has increased significantly in urban areas with accumulated building and increased energy consumption. Carrying out anthropogenic heat flux (AHF) estimation and exploring the correlation between the AHF and building characteristics (density and height) helps reveal the urban climate's genetic mechanism. This study took Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou, the typical cities in the Yangtze River Delta region of China as case studies. The annual AHF of 2000, 2008, and 2016 based on the energy consumption inventory and multi-source remote sensing data was estimated. Besides, the monthly AHF by time dimension downscaling processing was obtained. The correlation between AHF and building characteristics was then analyzed by combining urban classification and building block data. The results showed that the AHF of typical cities increased significantly from 2000 to 2016, and the difference between the AHF of building area and the whole city was 12.69-20.36 W.m(-2). Monthly AHF had a stratification phenomenon in different building characteristics. Moreover, building characteristics' impact on monthly AHF in the winter was more evident than that in the summer. The AHF of the building growth region was higher than that of the non-growth region, and the differences were more significant in the winter months (1.94-2.23 W.m(-2)) than in summer months (0.59-0.94 W.m(-2)). Building density on AHF was more significant than building height, and its contribution was higher than 80% on average in typical cities. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Analysis of feasibility and advantages of multi-source image registration using regional features
T2  - ELECTRONICS LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic registration of multi-source remote sensing data is a challenging task due to the high non-linearity of radiometric differences among various data. Feature extraction is a key enabling technique in registration algorithm design. In this letter, we prove the feasibility of using extracted regional features for multi-source image registration. In particular, regional features can be extracted through pixel-level image classification, and existing off-the-shelf algorithms can be directly adopted. Experiment results demonstrate the robustness of the regional-feature-based registration method.

TI  - Trends in Factors Affecting Pregnancy Outcomes Among Women With Type 1 or Type 2 Diabetes of Childbearing Age (2004-2017)
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - AimTo describe trends in modifiable and non-modifiable unfavorable factors affecting pregnancy outcomes, over time (years 2004-2017), in women with diabetes of childbearing age from an English primary care perspective.MethodsWe identified women with diabetes aged 16-45 years from the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) network, an English primary care sentinel database. Repeated annual cross-sectional analyses (2004-2017) assessed the prevalence of unfavorable factors for pregnancy, such as obesity, poor glycaemic control, microalbuminuria, hypertension, use of medications for treating diabetes, and associated comorbidities not recommended for pregnancy.ResultsWe identified 3,218 women (61.5% with Type 2 diabetes) in 2004 and 6,657 (65.0% with Type 2 diabetes) in 2017. The proportion of women with ideal glycaemic control for conception (HbA1c<6.5%) increased over time, in patients with Type 1 diabetes from 9.0% (7.1%-11.0%) to 19.1% (17.2%-21.1%), and in those with Type 2 diabetes from 27.2% (24.6%-29.9%) to 35.4% (33.6%-37.1%). The proportion of women with Type 2 diabetes prescribed medications different from insulin and metformin rose from 22.3% (20.5%-24.2%) to 27.3% (26.0%-28.6%).In 2017, 14.0% (12.6%-15.4%) of women with Type 1 and 30.7% (29.3%-32.0%) with Type 2 diabetes were prescribed angiotensin-modulating antihypertensives or statins. We captured at least one unfavorable factor for pregnancy in 50.9% (48.8%-52.9%) of women with Type 1 diabetes and 70.7% (69.3%-72.0%) of women with Type 2 diabetes. Only one third of women with Type 1 diabetes (32.2%, 30.3%-34.0%) and a quarter of those with Type 2 diabetes (23.1%, 21.9%-24.4%) were prescribed hormonal contraception. Contraception was prescribed more frequently to women with unfavorable factors for pregnancy compared to those without, however, the difference was significant only for women with Type 1 diabetes.ConclusionsDespite significant improvements in general diabetes care, the majority of women with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes have unfavorable, although mostly modifiable, factors for the start of pregnancy. Good diabetes care for women of childbearing age should include taking into consideration a possible pregnancy.

TI  - A combination of climate, tree diversity and local human disturbance determine the stability of dry Afromontane forests
T2  - FOREST ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Anthropogenic disturbances are increasingly affecting the vitality of tropical dry forests. The future condition of this important biome will depend on its capability to resist and recover from these disturbances. So far, the temporal stability of dryland forests is rarely studied, even though identifying the important factors associated with the stability of the dryland forests could serve as a basis for forest management and restoration. Methodology In a degraded dry Afromontane forest in northern Ethiopia, we explored remote sensing derived indicators of forest stability, using MODIS satellite derived NDVI time series from 2001 to 2018. Resilience and resistance were measured using the anomalies (remainders) after time series decomposition into seasonality, trend and remainder components. Growth stability was calculated using the integral of the undecomposed NDVI data. These NDVI derived stability indicators were then related to environmental factors of climate, topography, soil, tree species diversity, and local human disturbance, obtained from a systematic grid of field inventory plots, using boosted regression trees in R. Results Resilience and resistance were adequately predicted by these factors with an R-2 of 0.67 and 0.48, respectively, but the model for growth stability was weaker. Precipitation of the wettest month, distance from settlements and slope were the most important factors associated with resilience, explaining 51% of the effect. Altitude, temperature seasonality and humus accumulation were the significant factors associated with the resistance of the forest, explaining 61% of the overall effect. A positive effect of tree diversity on resilience was also important, except that the impact of species evenness declined above a threshold value of 0.70, indicating that perfect evenness reduced the resilience of the forest. Precipitation of the wettest month was the most important factor explaining 43.52% of the growth stability variation. Conclusion A combination of climate, topographic factors and local human disturbance controlled the stability of the dry forest. Also tree diversity is an important stability component that should be considered in the management and restoration programs of such degraded forests. If local disturbances are alleviated the recovery time of dryland forests could be shortened, which is vital to maintain the ecosystem services these forests provide to local communities and global climate change.

TI  - Creation, Evolution, and "The New Cosmic Philosophy": William Todd Martin's Critique of Herbert Spencer
T2  - MODERN INTELLECTUAL HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the religious response of one neglected writer to the evolutionary philosophy of Herbert Spencer. William Todd Martin was a minister of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and in 1887 published The Evolution Hypothesis: A Criticism of the New Cosmic Philosophy. The work demonstrates the essentially contested nature of "evolution" and "creation" by showing how a self-confessed creationist could affirm an evolutionary understanding of the natural world and species transformation. Martin's approach reflected a transatlantic Presbyterian worldview that saw the harmony of science and religion on the basis of Calvinism, Baconianism and Scottish Common Sense philosophy. Martin's critique is also relevant to issues that continue to animate philosophers of science and religion, including the connections between mind and matter, morality and consciousness in a Darwinian framework, and the relationship between subjective conscious experience and evolutionary physicalism. Martin was able to anticipate these debates because his critique was essentially philosophical and theological rather than biological and biblicist.

TI  - Prometheus as Racial Allegory: The Sociological Poetics of W. E. B. Du Bois
T2  - JOURNAL OF AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - W. E. B. Du Bois often appropriated and deployed the metaphor of "Prometheus," drawing from Hesiod's Theogony, Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound, Goethe's poem "Prometheus," and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus. Throughout Du Bois's career, he employed this figure in order for the reader to better understand the racialized social order in general and White supremacy in specific. In what follows, I cover the eighteenth and nineteenth century use of the Prometheus metaphor in regard to critiques of racism and slavery. I then establish how Du Bois stepped into this tradition to advance a multifaceted critique of global White supremacy that continues to resonate today. Precisely, Du Bois rendered this character in six patterned forms: (1) as an embodiment of de jure and de facto segregation; (2) as newly conscious Black people that would soon revolt against White supremacy; (3) as the paradoxical capture and harm of White people by their own design; (4) as the prejudice, discrimination, and racism born of White supremacist politics; (5) as the struggle of Black folks against White supremacy; and (6) a Black-centered spiritual worldview of eventual liberation. Together, these six deployments signal the early manifestations of both critical race theory and Afrofuturism-two modes of inquiry that help us to reconsider not only the material repercussions of racial inequality but the pathways and roadblocks toward racial utopia.

TI  - An improved approach to estimate above-ground volume and biomass of desert shrub communities based on UAV RGB images
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Above-ground biomass (AGB) is an essential indicator for assessing ecosystem health and carbon storage in desert shrub-related research. Above-ground volume (AGV) of vegetation is a crucial parameter to estimate the AGB. In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing, the AGV and AGB are mainly estimated by vegetation feature metrics (for example, spectral indices, textural, and structural metrics). However, there is limited study on the AGV and AGB estimation in desert shrub communities by using UAV, and it is difficult to determine the contribution of these metrics to AGV models under eliminating the influence of background factors. Taking a typical desert shrub area in Inner Mongolia, China as an example, this study develops an improved approach to extracted three types of feature metrics simultaneously using UAV RGB (Red, Green, Blue) images. First, digital orthophoto map (DOM) and digital surface model (DSM) were created through the photogrammetric procedure based on UAV RGB images. Second, the digital terrain model (DTM) for canopy height calculation was generated based on DOM and DSM by object-oriented image binary classification and ground elevation interpolation. Here, we recommended the ENVI Landsat Gap-fill tool to interpolate the ground elevation of vegetation areas. Meanwhile, 21 spectral indices, eight textural metrics, and five structural metrics were extracted. Finally, singlevariable and multi-variable commonly used regression models were established based on these metrics and measured AGV with a leave-one-out cross-validation. Results showed that: (1) in the proposed model, the contribution of structural, textural, and spectral metric to shrub AGV models was 86.68, 7.08, and 6.24%, respectively. (2) The horizontal and vertical structural metrics, textural metrics, or spectral indices reflected the one-dimensional change of AGV, which had a saturation effect. (3) The canopy volume, combining the horizontal and vertical characteristics of vegetation canopy, could describe the overall change of AGV and played the most essential role in AGV modelling (R2 = 0.928, relative RMSE = 26.8%). The study findings provide a direct reference in determining suitable vegetation feature metrics for monitoring shrub AGV. The proposed approach for DTM generation and AGV estimation is more efficient, accurate and low-cost than before, and it can be a useful bridge between ground-based investigation and satellite remote sensing.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The canopy density of forests is highly influenced by population pressure which cause forest fragmentations, deforestations, forest degradation and also land reclamation for infrastructure and agriculture. This study was envisaged with the objective of mapping the forest canopy density with two different methods by using Landsat 8 OLI dataset of the year 2016 after mapping the vegetation indices. One of the two methods is the semi-expert FCD mapper model, while the other model is newly developed by us and consists of eight vegetation indices. After running the models, the results of both the models were compared. It was found that for the semi-expert FCD model, the three classes viz. high canopy density, moderate canopy and low canopy covered an area of 81,615.51 ha (40%), 84,474.72 ha (41%) and 38,844.18 ha (19%), respectively. And for the modified FCD model, the same classes covered 69,134.670 ha (37%), 84,062.250 ha (45%) and 32,529.150 ha (18%), respectively. It was observed that the difference between semi-expert FCD model and the modified FCD model's accuracy is about 1.75% and difference in Kappa statistics is 0.0362. Thus, the modified model is more accurate than the semi-expert FCD model and gives us more detailed canopy density map than the semi-expert FCD map.

TI  - Seasonal detection of coal overburden dump regions in unsupervised manner using landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images at jharia coal fields
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Classification and monitoring of surface mining areas have various research challenges. Surface mining produces various land classes such as, quarry, dump, overburden dump, reclamation area, etc. In the past, various land classes of surface mining areas are detected by supervised and semi-supervised machine learning techniques. It has been found challenging to detect such land classes using only spectral responses from satellite images. Coal Mine Index (CMI) detects coal quarry and coal dump region as a single land class. These regions have distinct properties as minerals stayed open in such regions. Though coal overburden dump regions also have higher mineral content than various land classes, they show similar spectral characteristics with few bare soil classes in particular with river beds. Hence, it is found more challenging to detect coal overburden regions in an unsupervised manner using spectral information. In this paper, a K-Means clustering in hierarchical fashion has been proposed using CMI values as feature space to detect coal overburden dump regions in automated manner. Yet, this procedure detects coal overburden dump and river beds as a single class. The method is further extended to distinguish river bed regions from coal overburden regions exploiting their distinctive spectral characteristics. The proposed method has average precision and recall of [76.43%,62.75%], and [70.37%,65.63%] for coal mine, and overburden dump regions, respectively.

TI  - Assessment of water presence and use at sand dams in Kenya
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Levels of water access provided by sand dams were assessed by measuring water presence and use in a repre-sentative sample of 97 dams in Kenya. Most dams were filled with sediment capable of holding water, with a 25% median reduction of water capacity due to siltation when using a high estimate for sediment specific yield. Multiple sediment cores taken from each dam indicated the presence of water in over half of sediment cores from 57% of dams. Although there is individual variation, generally dams in the region were therefore capable of accumulating water. Analysis of Landsat satellite images indicated that this did not translate into an average increase in vegetative greening and moisture indices at dam sites compared to controls sites. Observational data on activities at dams indicated variable levels of water use; only 43% of dams had active water harvesting present, and only 39% of dams had current agricultural activities adjacent to the sand dam site. Cross-sectional comparison of data did not indicate consistently higher levels of water harvesting or agricultural use at dams with more water. Results point towards a high level of community understanding of sand dam benefits, but a lower rate of actually realizing those benefits.

TI  - Satellite data and machine learning reveal the incidence of late frost defoliations on Iberian beech forests
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate warming is driving an advance of leaf unfolding date in temperate deciduous forests, promoting longer growing seasons and higher carbon gains. However, an earlier leaf phenology also increases the risk of late frost defoliation (LFD) events. Compiling the spatiotemporal patterns of defoliations caused by spring frost events is critical to unveil whether the balance between the current advance in leaf unfolding dates and the frequency of LFD occurrence is changing and represents a threaten for the future viability and persistence of deciduous forests. We combined satellite imagery with machine learning techniques to reconstruct the spatiotemporal patterns of LFD events for the 2003-2018 period in the Iberian range of European beech (Fagus sylvatica), at the drier distribution edge of the species. We used MODIS Vegetation Index Products to generate a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for each 250 x 250 m pixel in a total area of 1,013 km(2) (16,218 pixels). A semi-supervised approach was used to train a machine learning model, in which a binary classifier called Support Vector Machine with Global Alignment Kernel was used to differentiate between late frost and non-late frost pixels. We verified the obtained estimates with photointerpretation and existing beech tree-ring chronologies to iteratively improve the model. Then, we used the model output to identify topographical and climatic factors that determined the spatial incidence of LFD. During the study period, LFD was a low recurrence phenomenon that occurred every 15.2 yr on average and showed high spatiotemporal heterogeneity. Most LFD events were condensed in 5 yr and clustered in western forests (86.5% in one-fifth of the pixels) located at high elevation with lower than average precipitation. Elevation and longitude were the major LFD risk factors, followed by annual precipitation. The synergistic effects of increasing drought intensity and rising temperature combined with more frequent late frost events may determine the future performance and distribution of beech forests. This interaction might be critical at the beech drier range edge, where the concentration of LFD at high elevations could constrain beech altitudinal shifts and/or favor species with higher resistance to late frosts.

TI  - Integration of Texture and Spectral Response with AI Techniques for Buildings Footprint Identification Using High-Resolution Satellite Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid growth and advancement in the application of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) in several application domains helped many researchers to analyze a wide range of information from satellite imagery. Settlement information that includes building foot prints is a very essential parameter for different applications such as urban planning, environmental planning and disaster management. VGG-16 (Visual Geometry Group) conventional neural network (CNN) model is a popular model used to detect and classify the input images. In this study, a new approach was proposed by integration of VGG-16-CNN model with spectral and textural information of satellite images for identification of building foot prints. The model was trained and implemented to identify the building footprints using Worldview-3 high-resolution satellite image over part of Mumbai city of Maharashtra state, India. Classification accuracy in the proposed approach is observed to be nearly 94% as compared to 82% in case of single-shot detector (SSD) algorithm alone. Metric parameters such as F1 score of 0.957, intersection over union (IoU) of 94.86% and total error rate of 8.133% also indicated better performance of the proposed approach. Particularly, the approach is highly beneficial for urban development authorities as they need to monitor the large number of vacant lands spread across urban areas.

TI  - COVID-19's lockdown effect on air quality in Indian cities using air quality zonal modeling
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The complete lockdown due to COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the improvement of air quality across the countries particularly in developing countries including India. This study aims to assess the air quality by monitoring major atmospheric pollutants such as AOD, CO, PM2.5, NO2, O-3 and SO2 in 15 major cities of India using Air Quality Zonal Modeling. The study is based on two different data sources; (a) grid data (MODIS- Terra, MERRA-2, OMI and AIRS, Global Modeling and Assimilation Office, NASA) and (b) ground monitoring station data provided by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) / State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). The remotely sensed data demonstrated that the concentration of PM2.5 has declined by 14%, about 30% of NO2 in million-plus cities, 2.06% CO, SO2 within the range of 5 to 60%, whereas the concentration of O-3 has increased by 1 to 3% in majority of cities compared with pre lockdown. On the other hand, CPCB/SPCB data showed more than 40% decrease in PM2.5 and 47% decrease in PM10 in north Indian cities, more than 35% decrease in NO2 in metropolitan cities, more than 85% decrease in SO2 in Chennai and Nagpur and more than 17% increase in O-3 in five cities amid 43 days pandemic lockdown. The restrictions of anthropogenic activities have substantial effect on the emission of primary atmospheric pollutants.

TI  - Development of a Dual-Attention U-Net Model for Sea Ice and Open Water Classification on SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study develops a deep learning (DL) model to classify the sea ice and open water from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. We use the U-Net, a well-known fully convolutional network (FCN) for pixel-level segmentation, as the model backbone. We employ a DL-based feature extracting model, ResNet-34, as the encoder of the U-Net. To achieve high accuracy classifications, we integrate the dual-attention mechanism into the original U-Net to improve the feature representations, forming a dual-attention U-Net model (DAU-Net). The SAR images are obtained from Sentinel-1A. The dual-polarized information and the incident angle of SAR images are model inputs. We used 15 dual-polarized images acquired near the Bering Sea to train the model and employ the other three images to test the model. Experiments show that the DAU-Net could achieve pixel-level classification; the dual-attention mechanism can improve the classification accuracy. Compared with the original U-Net, DAU-Net improves the intersection over union (IoU) by 7.48.% points, 0.96.% points, and 0.83.% points on three test images. Compared with the recently published model DenseNetFCN, the three improvement IoU values of DAU-Net are 3.04.% points, 2.53.% points, and 2.26.% points, respectively.

TI  - Using NDVI for the assessment of canopy cover in agricultural crops within modelling research
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - The fraction of green canopy cover (CC) is an important feature commonly used to characterize crop growth and for calibration of crop and hydrological models. It is well accepted that there is a relation between CC and NDVI through linear or quadratic models, however a straight-forward empirical approach, to derive CC from NDVI observations, is still lacking. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of the NDVI-CC relationships with data collected from 19 different studies (N = 1397). Generic models are proposed here for 13 different agricultural crops, and the associated degree of uncertainty, together with the magnitude of error were quantified for each model (RMSE around 6-18% of CC). We observed that correlations are adequate for the majority of crops as R-2 values were above 75% for most cases, and coefficient estimates were significant for most of the linear and quadratic models. Extrapolation to conditions different than those found in the studies may require local validation, as obtained regressions are affected by non-sampling errors or sources of systematic error that need further investigation. In a case study with wheat, we tested the use of NDVI as a proxy to estimate CC and to calibrate the AquaCrop model. Simulation outcomes were validated with field data collected from three growing seasons and confirmed that the NDVI-CC relationship was useful for modelling research. We highlight that the overall applicability of these relationships to modelling is promising as the RMSE are in line with acceptable levels published in several sensitivity analyses.

TI  - Temporal and Spatial Variations in NDVI and Analysis of the Driving Factors in the Desertified Areas of Northern China From 1998 to 2015
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - China faces some of the most serious desertification in the world, leading to many problems. To solve them, large-scale ecological restoration projects were implemented. To assess their effectiveness, we analyzed normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) data derived from SPOT VEGETATION and gridded climate datasets from 1998 to 2015 to detect the degrees of desertification and the effects of human and climate drivers on vegetation dynamics. We found that NDVI of desertified areas generally decreased before 2000, then increased. The annual increase in NDVI was fixed dunes (0.0013) = semi-fixed dunes (0.0013) > semi-mobile dunes (0.0012) > gobi (gravel) desert (0.0011) > mobile dunes (0.0003) > saline-alkali land (0.0000). The proportions of the area of each desert type in which NDVI increased were fixed dunes (43.4%) > semi-mobile dunes (39.7%) > semi-fixed dunes (26.7%) > saline-alkali land (23.1%) > gobi desert (14.4%) > mobile dunes (12.5%). Thus, the vegetation response to the restoration efforts increased as the initial dune stability increased. The proportion of the area where desertification was dominated by temperature (1.8%) was far less than the area dominated by precipitation (14.1%). However, 67.6% of the change was driven by non-climatic factors. The effectiveness of the ecological restoration projects was significant in the Loess Plateau and in the Mu Us, Horqin, and Hulunbuir sandy lands. In contrast, there was little effect in the Badain Jaran, Ulan Buh, and Tengger deserts; in particular, vegetation cover has declined seriously in the Hunshandake Sandy Land and Alkin Desert Grassland. Thus, more or different ecological restoration must be implemented in these areas.

TI  - A geographic information-driven method and a new large scale dataset for remote sensing cloud/snow detection
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Geographic information such as the altitude, latitude, and longitude are common but fundamental meta-records in remote sensing image products. In this paper, it is shown that such a group of records provides important priors for cloud and snow detection in remote sensing imagery. The intuition comes from some common geographical knowledge, where many of them are important but are often overlooked. For example, it is generally known that snow is less likely to exist in low-latitude or low-altitude areas, and clouds in different geographic may have various visual appearances. Previous cloud and snow detection methods simply ignore the use of such information, and perform detection solely based on the image data (band reflectance). Due to the neglect of such priors, most of these methods are difficult to obtain satisfactory performance in complex scenarios (e.g., cloud-snow coexistence). In this paper, a novel neural network called "Geographic Information-driven Network (GeoInfoNet)" is proposed for cloud and snow detection. In addition to the use of the image data, the model integrates the geographic information at both training and detection phases. A "geographic information encoder" is specially designed, which encodes the altitude, latitude, and longitude of imagery to a set of auxiliary maps and then feeds them to the detection network. The proposed network can be trained in an end-to-end fashion with dense robust features extracted and fused. A new dataset called "Levir_CS" for cloud and snow detection is built, which contains 4,168 Gaofen-1 satellite images and corresponding geographical records, and is over 20x larger than other datasets in this field. On "Levir_CS", experiments show that the method achieves 90.74% intersection over union of cloud and 78.26% intersection over union of snow. It outperforms other state of the art cloud and snow detection methods with a large margin. Feature visualizations also show that the method learns some important priors which is close to the common sense. The proposed dataset and the code of GeoInfoNet are available in https://github.com/permanentCH5/GeoInfoNet.

TI  - Potential impact of flooding on schistosomiasis in Poyang Lake regions based on multi-source remote sensing images
T2  - PARASITES & VECTORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Flooding is considered to be one of the most important factors contributing to the rebound of Oncomelania hupensis, a small tropical freshwater snail and the only intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum, in endemic foci. The aim of this study was to assess the risk of intestinal schistosomiasis transmission impacted by flooding in the region around Poyang Lake using multi-source remote sensing images.Methods: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data collected by the Landsat 8 satellite were used as an ecological and geographical suitability indicator of O. hupensis habitats in the Poyang Lake region. The expansion of the water body due to flooding was estimated using dual-polarized threshold calculations based on dual-polarized synthetic aperture radar (SAR). The image data were captured from the Sentinel-1B satellite in May 2020 before the flood and in July 2020 during the flood. A spatial database of the distribution of snail habitats was created using the 2016 snail survey in Jiangxi Province. The potential spread of O. hupensis snails after the flood was predicted by an overlay analysis of the NDVI maps in the flood-affected areas around Poyang Lake. The risk of schistosomiasis transmission was classified based on O. hupensis snail density data and the related NDVI.Results: The surface area of Poyang Lake was approximately 2207 km(2) in May 2020 before the flood and 4403 km(2) in July 2020 during the period of peak flooding; this was estimated to be a 99.5% expansion of the water body due to flooding. After the flood, potential snail habitats were predicted to be concentrated in areas neighboring existing habitats in the marshlands of Poyang Lake. The areas with high risk of schistosomiasis transmission were predicted to be mainly distributed in Yongxiu, Xinjian, Yugan and Poyang (District) along the shores of Poyang Lake. By comparing the predictive results and actual snail distribution, we estimated the predictive accuracy of the model to be 87%, which meant the 87% of actual snail distribution was correctly identified as snail habitats in the model predictions.Conclusions: Data on water body expansion due to flooding and environmental factors pertaining to snail breeding may be rapidly extracted from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1B remote sensing images. Applying multi-source remote sensing data for the timely and effective assessment of potential schistosomiasis transmission risk caused by snail spread during flooding is feasible and will be of great significance for more precision control of schistosomiasis.

T2  - PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Advances in gamma imaging technology mean that is now technologically feasible to conduct stereoscopic gamma imaging in a hand-held unit. This paper derives an analytical model for stereoscopic pinhole imaging which can be used to predict performance for a wide range of camera configurations. Investigation of this concept through Monte Carlo and benchtop studies, for an example configuration, shows camera-source distance measurements with a mean deviation between calculated and actual distances of <5 mm for imaging distances of 50-250 mm. By combining this technique with stereoscopic optical imaging, we are then able to calculate the depth of a radioisotope source beneath a surface without any external positional tracking. This new hybrid technique has the potential to improve surgical localisation in procedures such as sentinel lymph node biopsy.

TI  - Introducing Theil-Sen estimator for sun glint correction of UAV data for coral mapping
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite wider applications for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in aquatic remote sensing, frequent sun glint in UAV acquisition often results in significant data gaps. Much research exists in the development of sun glint correction methods for airborne and satellite imagery to generate accurate coral habitat maps. Conversely, little is known about an appropriate glint correction method that can also be considered as data gap in UAV. This study compared glint correction methods for filling data gaps in UAV imagery acquired from the coral-dominated Pulau Bidong island in Peninsular Malaysia. This study proposed a simple seed pixel region growing technique that can be used in glint detection and mask development. It introduces the Theil-Sen regression glint correction (TSGC) for glint correction in UAV imagery and to achieve coral composition maps with thematic details, useful for sustainable coastal management. TSGC achieved a 25.6% greater coral classification accuracy compared to the uncorrected images.

TI  - Vulvar and vaginal melanomas: A retrospective study spanning 19 years from a tertiary center
T2  - JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY OBSTETRICS AND HUMAN REPRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Mucosal melanomas (MM) of the female genital tract are rare a. We aimed to study the prognostic factors of vulvar and vaginal locations of MM.Material and method: A multicenter, retrospective cohort study conducted between 01/01/2000 and 01/06/2019.Result: Of the 33 patients included 25 (75.8 %) had vulvar (VuM) and eight (24.2 %) vaginal melanomas (VaM). VaMs were deeper: median Breslow index: 17.5 mm [3.5-22] versus 4.3 mm [0.35-18] (p = 0.013). Average follow-up was 24.0 + 59.8 months. Twenty-six patients (78.8 %) experienced recurrence. Disease-free survival was 52.9 % at 1 year (64.7 % for VuM and 14.3 % for VaM) and 8.4 % at 3 years (11 % for VuM and 0% for VaM) (p = 0.002). Median time to the first recurrence was 9.01 months [C195 %: 2.07-56.71]. VaM recurred earlier than VuM (3.12 months [C195 %: 2.07-12.49] versus 17.72 [C195 %: 3.58-56.71], p = 0.011). VaM had a higher risk of recurrence (HR= 5.64 [C195 %: 2.01-15.82], p = 0.001) in multivariate analysis.Overall survival was 88.5 % at 1 year (100 % for VuM and 50 % for VaM), and 59.4 % at 3 years (69.3 % for VuM and 25 % for VaM). Women with VaM died earlier: median specific death occurrence of 8.76 months [C195 %: 6.54-24.72] versus 39.61 [C195 %: 21.89-209.21], p = 0.013 (HR= 5.08 [C195 %: 1.39-18.60], p = 0.014). A lesion size >3 cm was associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR = 8.45 [C195 %: 1.60-44.52], p = 0.012). In multivariate analysis, vaginal location remained an independent and predictive variable of a higher risk of specific death (HR =8.56 [C195 %: 1.95-37.64], p = 0.005).Conclusion: A vaginal location of MM is associated with a poorer prognosis than a vulvar location.

TI  - Integrating object-based image analysis and geographic information systems for waterbodies delineation on synthetic aperture radar data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Precise and regularly updated maps of surface water extent are essential for wetland management. Since it is often challenging to obtain water extent information through ground surveys due to accessibility, satellite remote sensing has become a critical and cost-effective tool for acquiring this information in a temporal context. The methods that are commonly used include supervised and unsupervised multispectral classification, density slicing of a single band and spectral indices. However, optical data are substantially affected by cloud cover and solar illumination, thus, radar data comprise an ideal option. This article presents a methodological framework for rapid delineation of waterbodies' boundaries. For that purpose, an object-based approach is implemented. Sentinel-1 data were obtained and the Mean-Shift segmentation algorithm was employed. The proposed methodology produced promising results achieving an overall accuracy of 98%, a producer's accuracy for waterbodies of 90% and a user's accuracy for waterbodies of 95%.

TI  - Soil erosion assessment using earth observation data in a trans-boundary river basin
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil erosion is a challenging environmental hazard that can be reduced by conservation practices. The study aimed to estimate the soil erosion rate using different digital elevation models (DEMs) data. We have applied the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) to assess soil erosion in the Ghaghara river basin. We have also estimated morphometric parameters to understand the susceptibility of sub-basin to soil loss. The estimated rates of soil erosion by RUSLE are 21.39, 18.31, 4.35, and 4.64 ton/ha/year for SRTM 30 m, ALOS 30 m, MERIT 90 m, and SRTM 90 m, respectively. In addition to this water retention curve of soil was estimated using Hydrus-1D model. Result show that a clay_loam soil has highest water holding capacity as 0.284 cm(3)/cm(3) and glacier (GLACIER-6998) has lowest as 0.22 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively in the basin. Further the basin hypsometry analysis was performed using Q-GIS, which indicate that sub-basins age from young to mature due to soil erosion. In last, the prioritized map was generated by the integration of RULSE, water holding capacity, and morphometry showed that the upper and middle portions of the basin need better conservation measures to control the excess soil erosion compared to the lower portion of the basin.

TI  - Time-traveling colors: Artisanal dreams and digital fabrication
T2  - COLOR RESEARCH AND APPLICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In the 15th century, the miniaturists of the Timurid court in Herat conceive colors that seem to be made of pure light, without weight and volume. Their luminous colors synthesize a unique worldview from the anti-materialistic teachings of Mani, the Sufi "world of imagination" and the alchemists' principles of transmutation. Five centuries later, our digital technologies seem to offer us such disembodied colors, which used to be the artistic dream of an artisanal culture. Pixels replace pigments, light-colors replace matter-colors. With the booming animation and game cultures, Tokyo becomes one of the first places that pixels invade in the 80s. A group of Japanese architects and artists seeks to express in their creations the ethereal dimension of the pixels' electronic light. Through a spatio-temporal leap, the miniatures, as a historical reference point, reveals the emerging chromatic trends in contemporary architecture and visual culture. Could the invention of pixels be after all, stemming from an ancestral aspiration of mankind based on the sensorial and intelligible duality of his nature?

TI  - New World camelids are sentinels for the presence of Borna disease virus
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Borna disease (BD), a frequently fatal neurologic disorder caused by Borna disease virus 1 (BoDV-1), has been observed for decades in horses, sheep, and other mammals in certain regions of Europe. The bicoloured white-toothed shrew (Crocidura leucodon) was identified as a persistently infected species involved in virus transmission. Recently, BoDV-1 attracted attention as a cause of fatal encephalitis in humans. Here, we report investigations on BoDV-1-infected llamas from a farm in a BD endemic area of Switzerland, and alpacas from holdings in a region of Germany where BD was last seen in the 1960s but not thereafter. All New World camelids showed apathy and abnormal behaviour, necessitating euthanasia. Histologically, severe non-suppurative meningoencephalitis with neuronal Joest-Degen inclusion bodies was observed. BoDV-1 was confirmed by immunohistology, RT-qPCR, and sequencing in selected animals. Analysis of the llama herd over 20 years showed that losses due to clinically suspected BD increased within the last decade. BoDV-1 whole-genome sequences from one Swiss llama and one German alpaca and-for comparison-from one Swiss horse and one German shrew were established. They represent the first published whole-genome sequences of BoDV-1 clusters 1B and 3, respectively. Our analysis suggests that New World camelids may have a role as a sentinel species for BoDV-1 infection, even when symptomatic cases are lacking in other animal species.

TI  - Different strategies in marking axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant medical treatment: a systematic review
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Background Marking of cytology-proven metastatic axillary lymph node in breast cancer patients before neoadjuvant treatment and its subsequent surgical retrieval have been shown to reduce the false-negative rate of sentinel lymph node biopsy. A systematic review was performed to evaluate different strategies in nodal marking and localization. Methods PubMed, Embase, EBSCOhost, and the Cochrane library literature databases were searched systematically to address the identification rate and retrieval rate of marked axillary lymph nodes. Studies were eligible if they performed nodal marking before neoadjuvant treatment, followed by selective extirpation of these marked axillary lymph nodes in definitive surgery Results Fifteen studies with a total of 703 patients were included. Index axillary lymph nodes were marked by clips or tattooed prior to the commencement of neoadjuvant treatment. In our pooled analysis, eighty-eight percent of the clipped nodes and ninety-seven percent of the tattooed nodes were successfully retrieved. Among these patients, seventy-seven percent of these marked axillary lymph nodes were also sentinel lymph nodes. Conclusion Marking and selectively removing cytology-proven metastatic axillary lymph nodes after neoadjuvant treatment is feasible. An acceptably high nodal retrieval rate could be achieved using various methods of nodal marking and localization techniques.

TI  - Environmental exposomics and lung cancer risk assessment in the Philadelphia metropolitan area using ZIP code-level hazard indices
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To illustrate methods for assessing environmental exposures associated with lung cancer risk, we investigated anthropogenic based air pollutant data in a major metropolitan area using United States-Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) (1987-2017), and PM2.5 (1998-2016) and NO2 (1996-2012) concentrations from NASA satellite data. We studied chemicals reported according to the following five exposome features: (1) International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) cancer grouping; (2) priority EPA polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); (3) component of diesel exhaust; (4) status as a volatile organic compound (VOC); and (5) evidence of lung carcinogenesis. Published articles from PubChem were tallied for occurrences of 10 key characteristics of cancer-causing agents on those chemicals. Zone Improvement Plan (ZIP) codes with higher exposures were identified in two ways: (1) combined mean exposure from all features, and (2) hazard index derived through a multi-step multi-criteria decision analysis (MMCDA) process. VOCs, IARC Group 1 carcinogens consisted 82.3% and 11.5% of the reported TRI emissions, respectively. ZIP codes along major highways tended to have greater exposure. The MMCDA approach yielded hazard indices based on imputed toxicity, occurrence, and persistence for risk assessment. Despite many studies describing environmental exposures and lung cancer risk, this study develops a method to integrate these exposures into population-based exposure estimates that could be incorporated into future lung cancer screening trials and benefit public health surveillance of lung cancer incidence. Our methodology may be applied to probe other hazardous exposures for other cancers.

TI  - Wolf (Canis lupus) as canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV-1) sentinel for the endangered cantabrian brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos)
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Canine adenovirus type 1 (CAdV-1) causes infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) and has recently been described as a cause of death among endangered populations of European brown bear (Ursus arctos arctos) in the Cantabrian mountain range in Asturias, Spain. Sympatric wild and domestic carnivores can act as reservoirs of the virus and likely spread it into the environment and subsequently transmit it to brown bears. The present work investigates the prevalence and geo-temporal distribution of CAdV-1 among free-ranging wolves (Canis lupus) in Asturias from 2009 to 2018, during which three fatal cases of ICH were reported among brown bears in the region. A total of 149 wolves were analysed in this study, of which 21 (14%) were found to have CAdV-1 DNA based on real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of spleen samples. Prevalence of the virus was similar between males and females. All but one of the 20 CAdV-1-positive animals of estimable age were younger than 2 years, and only one of the 46 adult animals (>2 years) tested positive. Prevalence was highest in the western area of Asturias and during 2010 and 2011. Our results confirm that CAdV-1 is circulating in Asturian free-ranging wolves, supporting their possible role as virus reservoirs and sentinels in the region of this emerging disease in brown bears.

TI  - Winter wheat planted area monitoring and yield modeling using MODIS data in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and timely crop areas monitoring and yield modeling are of great significance for food security and sustainability of agro-ecosystems. This study provides a rapid and robust method for planted area monitoring and yield modeling of winter wheat based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data from 2001 to 2016 in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China. Statistical data at the prefecture level are used for accuracy assessment of MODIS-derived winter wheat planted area and yield. The results show that the overall accuracy of estimated winter wheat planted area is 96.5% from 2001 to 2016. Besides, the winter wheat planted area presents an increasing trend in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, especially from 2009 to 2013. In terms of yield modeling, the coefficients of determination (R-2) between the estimated yield and statistical data are all higher than 0.86, and the relative errors (RE) are <5%. The models can accurately estimate yield, with adequate NDVI data, before the harvesting dates. The rapid and robust method has the potential to be applied to winter wheat planted area monitoring and yield modeling in other regions.

TI  - Vertical accuracy assessment of open source digital elevation models under varying elevation and land cover in Western Ghats of India
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The selection of suitable DEM from available open-source DEMs like SRTM, ALOS World 3D, CARTOSAT-1, ASTER-GDEM, TanDEM-X which are acquired through different techniques is difficult without prior guidelines, especially on the rugged mountainous terrain. Therefore, this article aimed to evaluate the role of land cover and altitude on the vertical accuracy of open-source DEMs with near to ground measurements taken by Ice Cloud and Land Elevation (ICESat) Geoscience Laser Altimetry System (GLAS) in and around Western Ghats (WG) of India. The SRTM (30 m) DEM outperformed other DEMs at the scale of WG and in the dense vegetation cover with least performance by ASTER DEM (30 m). The vertical accuracy of DEM is varying with different elevation ranges and land cover conditions and is found to be better than the vertical accuracy specified by the mission. The overestimation of elevation in low terrain relief area, and underestimation on higher elevation with steep terrain is substantive in all the DEMs. The role of land cover and altitude is significant on the elevation and slope more than the aspect and roughness. Good performance by 90-m resolution DEM over 30-m resolution DEMs proves the potential of InSAR in elevation measurement in vegetated areas with low cost and high accuracy. These results help in the selection of pertinent DEM for any geo-climatical applications and in development of merged DEM based on the terrain relief and land cover of the region.

TI  - Outdoor light at night and risk of coronary heart disease among older adults: a prospective cohort study
T2  - EUROPEAN HEART JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Aims We estimated the association between outdoor light at night at the residence and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) within a prospective cohort of older adults in Hong Kong.Methods and results Over a median of 11years of follow-up, we identified 3772 incident CHD hospitalizations and 1695 CHD deaths. Annual levels of outdoor light at night at participants' residential addresses were estimated using time-varying satellite data for a composite of persistent night-time illumination at similar to 1km(2) scale. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the association between outdoor light at night at the residence and risk of CHD. The association between light at night and incident CHD hospitalization and mortality exhibited a monotonic exposure-response function. An interquartile range (IQR) (60.0 nW/cm(2)/sr) increase in outdoor light at night was associated with an HR of 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03, 1.18) for CHD hospitalizations and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.22) for CHD deaths after adjusting for both individual and area-level risk factors. The association did not vary across strata of hypothesized risk factors.Conclusion Among older adults, outdoor light at night at the residence was associated with a higher risk of CHD hospitalizations and deaths. We caution against causal interpretation of these novel findings. Future studies with more detailed information on exposure, individual adaptive behaviours, and potential mediators are warranted to further examine the relationship between light at night and CHD risk.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Assessment of documented adherence to critical actions in paediatric emergency care at a district-level public hospital in South Africa
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: The provision of high-quality care is vital to improve child health and survival rates. A simple, practice-based tool was recently developed to evaluate the quality of paediatric emergency care in resource-limited settings in Africa. This study used the practice-based tool to describe the documented adherence to critical actions in paediatric emergency care at an urban district-level hospital in South Africa and assess its relation to clinical outcomes.Methods: This study is a retrospective observational study covering a 19-month period (September 2017 to March 2019). Patients <13 years old, presenting to the emergency centre with one of six sentinel presentations (seizure, altered mental status, diarrhoea, fever, respiratory distress and polytrauma) were eligible for inclusion. In the patients' files, critical actions specific for each presentation were checked for completion. Post-hoc, a seventh group 'multiple diagnoses' was created for patients with more than one sentinel disease. The action completion rate was tested for association with clinical outcomes.Results: In total, 388 patients were included (median age 1.1 years, IQR 0.3-3.6). The action completion rate varied from 63% (polytrauma) to 90% (respiratory distress). Participants with >= 75% action completion rate were younger (p < 0.001), presented with high acuity (p < 0.001), were more likely to be admitted (adjusted OR 2.2, 95%CI: 1.2-4.1), and had a hospital stay >= 4 days (adjusted OR 3.4, 95%CI: 1.5-7.9).Conclusion: A high completion rate was associated with young age, a high patient acuity, hospital admission, length of hospital stay >= 4 days, and the specific sentinel presentation. Future research should determine whether or not documented care corresponds with the quality of delivered care and the predictive value regarding clinical outcome.

TI  - A novel way to calculate shortwave black carbon direct radiative effect
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Black carbon (BC) aerosol has a strong radiative forcing effect and significantly affects human beings and the environment. Therefore, it is important to quantitatively calculate its direct radiative effect (BC DRE) at the surface (SFC) and the top of the atmosphere (TOA). Current studies mainly use empirical formula methods or broadband methods to calculate BC DRE. However, these two methods do not consider the differences of sky diffuse light ratios in different wavelength bands. To overcome this problem, a new scheme named the multiband synthetic method is proposed to calculate blue sky albedo at MODIS narrow bands, and then, the blue sky albedo at the whole shortwave band is synthesized with these separate narrowband blue sky albedos. Based on BC concentration measured in Xuzhou over two years (from May 2014 to July 2016), aerosol optical depth (AOD) and microphysical parameters provided by AERONET, and the black sky albedo (BSA) and white sky albedo (WSA) provided by Google Earth Engine (GEE) products, shortwave BC DRE was calculated numerically with the use of the 6S radiative transfer model. The range of BC DRE computed by the multiband synthetic method at the TOA and SFC are 0.84 +/- 0.08 to 3.27 +/- 1.01W/m(2) and -14.57 +/- 4.53 to -4.31 +/- 0.36W/m(2). The shortwave BC DRE calculated by the multiband synthetic method was higher than that calculated with the broadband method and empirical formula method by 0.11% to 0.36% (at the SFC), 0.14% to 1.4% (at the SFC) and 3.4% to 10.1% (at the TOA), 5.5% to 15.8% (at the TOA), respectively. The BC DREs calculated by these three methods have small differences at the SFC. However, the difference was large at the TOA. The results of this study suggest that it is important to consider the differences between different narrow bands when calculating the broadband shortwave blue sky albedo. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Long-term spatiotemporal variability in high Andean wetlands in northern Chile
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High Andean wetlands of the elevated plateaus of the Andes Mountains of Chile, Argentina, Peru and Bolivia are true oases that sustain life in this arid region. Despite their ecological value, they have been rarely studied and are vulnerable to climate change and human activities that require groundwater resources. One such activity that may be intensified in the near future is mining for nonmetallic minerals such as lithium, whose worldwide demand is expected to increase with the rise of electric vehicles that need batteries. To determine a baseline of the natural dynamics of these systems, which allows sustainable management, it is essential to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of these wetlands. In this artide, we studied the temporal and spatial dynamics of high Andean wetlands of Chile, with the aim of identifying the key processes that govern their dynamics. To do this, we used time series of Landsat data from 1984 to 2019 to study 10 high Andean wetlands. Furthermore, to characterize the climate variability in these systems, we studied the long-term relation between the changes in water and vegetation areas with rainfall and evaporation variability. It was found that the groundwater reservoir plays a key role in sustaining the high Andean wetlands. Wet years with a period of occurrence of 20-30 years are the years in which the groundwater reservoirs are actually recharged, and in between wet years, the groundwater reservoirs gradually release the water that sustains the aquatic ecosystems. Hence, groundwater exploitation should be carefully designed from a long-term perspective, as groundwater levels could take decades to recover. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Correlating the field water balance derived crop coefficient (Kc) and canopy reflectance-based NDVI for irrigated sugarcane
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies of crop coefficients as a function of vegetation indices are reported less often for sugarcane than other crops because of the variation in crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and spectral response over the long growth period. In this study, the possibility of correlating crop coefficient (Kc) and ground based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of a sugarcane crop was investigated based on 2 years field experiments conducted in 2015 and 2016 in semi-arid India. The Kc values for the full crop season were determined by the field water balance method and ground NDVI was estimated from spectral reflectance measurements using a field spectro-radiometer. The sugarcane Kc values for the tillering (development stage), grand growth (mid-season) and maturity stages (end season) were 0.70, 1.20 and 0.78, respectively. The results found that the Kc was 16.6% less than that suggested by FAO-56. The sugarcane NDVI ranged from 0.48 to 0.69 at the tillering stage and 0.69 to 0.93 in the grand growth stage. Unlike other crops, sugarcane NDVI at the maturity stage did not reduce from 0.85 even at harvest due to the continued production of fresh green leaves at the top of the plant. Regression equations were developed to estimate the seasonal distribution of Kc with NDVI as the dependent variables and ratio of days (t/T) after planting (t) to the total crop period (T) as the independent variable. The relationship between crop Kc and NDVI was characterized with 2nd order polynomial regression but correlation was moderately strong (r = 0.75, n = 315). Stronger correlations between Kc and NDVI were obtained by splitting growth period into the growth phase (r = 0.98, n = 245) and decline phase (r = 0.99, n = 70). The estimated Kc will be helpful for correcting irrigation scheduling of sugarcane in semi-arid conditions. The Kc-NDVI relationships for sugarcane investigated in this study are important for potential real time irrigation water management in the future.

Taking advantage of spectral and spatial enhancement in Landsat OLI images, a machine learning based kNN algorithm was applied to derive AGB maps of a pristine forest of Pinus kesiya in 2014 and 2019 via allometric models of the pine and inventory data. AGB productivity of the study site was derived and examined for diagnosing the pristine pine forest development. The radiance of the Landsat image was first restored and then normalized by the FLAASH model, a radiation transfer model-based algorithm used to derive surface reflectance image, and finally a pansharpening technique was applied to improve the spatial resolution while retaining the spectral resolution of the reflectance image. Results showed that the pansharpened surface reflectance image was able to derive AGB maps with a satisfactory accuracy of root mean square percentage error, RMSPE = 15%, which shows significant improvement on the performance of AGB estimation using the raw image (RMSPE = 56%) and non-pansharpened surface reflectance image (RMSPE = 48%). The loss of AGB stocks is mainly caused by landslide, forest fire, and agricultural expansion, particularly the use of fire for land preparation for cropping. Land covers other than pine stands have complicated the edge of the pristine pine forest. The non-forest cover types surrounded the forest enlarged the boundary of the forest and made the pristine forest slightly fragmented. The results also showed that the AGB loss/gain of a forest parcel is negatively/positively related to the size of the parcel. Appropriate forest land zoning and community-based forest management for the surrounding non-pristine pine forest could have the benefit of mitigating the degradation of the pristine pine forest and improving the biomass stocks for better REDD achievements.

TI  - Individual and collective leadership for deliberate transformations: Insights from Indigenous leadership
T2  - LEADERSHIP
M3  - Article
AB  - Deliberately transforming society toward equitable and sustainable futures requires leadership. But what kind of leadership? While the dominant understanding of leadership often centers on the individual, the concept of collective leadership is receiving increased attention. Yet, the relationship between individual and collective leadership remains elusive and has been given limited attention in the transformation literature. In this study, I explore how leadership is understood and enacted in an Alaska Native community engaged in transforming community systems toward enhanced sustainability. I draw on Indigenous leadership research, organized through four interrelated analytical lenses: the individual leader, leadership through culture, leadership through process, and leadership through integration. I find that leadership in the community can be seen as something simultaneously individual and collective and argue that an Indigenous relational ontology makes it possible to imagine leadership as an "individual-collective simultaneity." In the discussion, I highlight the connections to emerging theories and approaches within "mainstream" leadership research, pointing to the potential for bridging disciplines and paradigms. For leadership and transformation researchers to engage in this bridging work, we must reflect on and reconsider our assumptions as to what agency for transformation is, with important implications for how we work to support transformations. While "ontological bridge building" creates tensions, it is through holding and working through these creative tensions that we can start to see pathways toward equitable and sustainable futures.

TI  - Evaluation of the river Padma morphological transition in the central Bangladesh using GIS and remote sensing techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Since decades, the characteristics of the major tributaries and distributary channels and their dynamics over time have got significant scientific interests. Recently, thanks to Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System(GIS), new studies focused on evaluating the river dynamics at the reach scale appeared, covering also remote regions worldwide. This study provides an overview of the morphological changes of the River Padma, Bangladesh, during the last four decades. The River Padma was very dynamic and constantly changed its position, planform, and other morphological properties because of variation in flow, sedimentation, and boundary condition. Five sets of geo referenced Landsat images from 1979 to 2019 were scrutinized using ERDAS Imagine and ArcGIS to visualize the erosion, accretion, bank line migration, bar growth, as well as changes in planform, and channel bed elevation. The results indicated that bank and channel positions, as well as central bars along with geometry, changed dramatically over time, and the River Padma turned into sinuous-braided from straight-wandering planform. From 1989 to 1999, heavy discharge during the monsoon season eroded around 283 km(2) land along 100 km reach. This study also revealed that the average width of the River Padma increased about 3.5 km and the overall bar area increased by 40%. This study demonstrated that the right bank of the River Padma was more unstable than the left bank during the last four decades. The findings of this study might help to prepare better management strategies for agricultural land, homestead as well as inland navigation projects across the floodplain.

TI  - The confounding effect of snow cover on assessing spring phenology from space: A new look at trends on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Tibetan Plateau is the highest and largest plateau in the world, hosting unique alpine grassland and having a much higher snow cover than any other region at the same latitude, thus representing a "climate change hot-spot". Land surface phenology characterizes the timing of vegetation seasonality at the per-pixel level using remote sensing systems. The impact of seasonal snow cover variations on land surface phenology has drawn much attention; however, there is still no consensus on how the remote sensing estimated start of season (SOS) is biased by the presence of preseason snow cover. Here, we analyzed SOS assessments from time series of satellite derived vegetation indices and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SW) during 2003-2016 for the Tibetan Plateau. We evaluated satellite-based SOS with field observations and gross primary production (GPP) from eddy covariance for both snow-free and snow covered sites. SOS derived from SIF was highly correlated with field data (R-2 = 0.83) and also the normalized difference phenology index (NDPI) performed well for both snow free (R-2 = 0.77) and snow covered sites (R-2 = 0.73). On the contrary, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) correlates only weakly with field data (R-2 = 035 for snow free and R-2 = 0.15 for snow covered sites). We further found that an earlier end of the snow season caused an earlier estimate of SOS for the Tibetan Plateau from NDVI as compared to NDPI. Our research therefore adds new evidence to the ongoing debate supporting the view that the claimed advance in land surface SOS over the Tibetan Plateau is an artifact from snow cover changes. These findings improve our understanding of the impact of snow on land surface phenology in alpine ecosystems, which can further improve remote sensing based land surface phenology assessments in snow-influenced ecosystems.

TI  - Hostile emotions: An exploratory study of far-right online commenters and their emotional connection to traditional and alternative news media
T2  - JOURNALISM
M3  - Article
AB  - In this article, we explore media use through the perspective of emotions. We specifically focus on a contested group of media users, namely those who engage in uncivil online behaviour and have had one or several comments deleted by moderators due to xenophobic and racist content. Our point of departure is that the informants represent a particularly engaged yet controversial audience. Based on theoretical perspectives on 'hostile emotions' like anger and fear and how the news media function as 'emotional regimes', we explore how the informants talk about their worldview and how it affects their media choices. We argue that political fear constitutes a powerful part of the informants' narratives, which again influences their media use. Even though they are highly sceptical and suspicious, the participants in the study seek information from a wide selection of traditional and alternative sources where their worldview is both contested and confirmed. Furthermore, the strong fear expressed by informants constitute an important element of the anger they feel towards the established news media. This particular anger is structured around the notion of objective reporting that they consider highly provocative, both factually and emotionally, as it does not match how they experience the world around them.

TI  - Management of lymph node metastasis via local chemotherapy can prevent distant metastasis and improve survival in mice
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE
M3  - Article
AB  - Management of lymph node metastasis (LNM) by conventional modalities such as radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy exhibit limited LNM selectivity and therefore can cause off-target adverse events. While development of LNM-specific drug delivery systems has tremendous potential to provide a safer treatment modality and improve cancer treatment, precise assessment of therapeutic efficacy and implications has been challenging due to lack of a suitable preclinical model. Here, we established an experimental LNM model in mice by directly seeding cancer cells into a lymph node (LN), which developed spontaneous LNM-borne distant metastasis (DM) in the absence of a primary tumor. In the model, early, but not late, management of LNM before thereof tumor cells systemically disseminated could confer significant survival benefit, which suggests that time to LNM management is critical. Systematic comparative assessment of various local drug delivery systems revealed that a micellar formulation could achieve highly LNM-specific delivery of a chemotherapeutic agent, which was superior to systemic chemotherapy, effective at a very low dose, and safe. This study suggests not only that the experimental LNM model provides a useful preclinical model to study LNM management and its therapeutic implications but also that micelles are a promising drug delivery system for LNM management via local administration.

TI  - Greening trends and their relationship with agricultural land abandonment across Poland
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Substantial land surface greening has been observed globally over the last few decades. This greening has been primarily attributed to climate change and CO2 concentrations, but recent research studies have emphasized the large role of human land use in this process, especially agricultural land abandonment (ALA). The aim of this study was to investigate whether long-term gradual greening of agricultural land can aid in mapping abandoned land across Poland. Trend estimation and temporal segmentation were applied to the 1986-2019 annual Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series to detect periods of long-term greening and to assess its relationship with actual information on ALA. The results show that long-term greening is widespread in Poland (covering up to 60% of its territory), regardless of former and current land uses, most of which has stemmed from modifications within stable land use classes (as they cover 91% of Poland). The highest greening rates and intensities were observed due to conversions from agricultural to non-agricultural land use, which strongly suggests land abandonment and the proceeding succession. However, some proportion of managed agricultural land has also experienced high-intensity greening, and a large proportion of abandoned agricultural land is not greening intensively. Thus, setting an exact greening intensity threshold allowing to clearly distinguish the status of land was not possible. This study also presents the consistency of the Landsat annual time series and its good performance for long-term greening detection, indicating that temporal segmentation may better capture ALA patterns than trend estimation

TI  - Monitoring the COVID-19-affected Indonesian seaweed industry using remote sensing data
T2  - MARINE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Indonesian seaweed industry has rapidly expanded over the last twenty years and now contributes to the livelihoods of 267,000 coastal households. Policy makers need accurate information from which to base policy that improves the livelihoods of smallholder farmers without further straining natural resource limits. The sustained growth of the sector necessitates means for reporting and monitoring the sector, particularly in the context of COVID-19. This paper uses newly available, high resolution, high frequency satellite data from April 2017 to December 2020 to identify seaweed farming plots and to map the seasonal changes in the industry. This is overlaid with data on environmental factors, prices, and official production statistics to reveal a range of insights into the industry which are obscured by official annual data, such as the seasonality of production and the change in activity since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper evaluates the usefulness of this data for monitoring the industry and informing strategic policy decisions.

TI  - Towards the progress of ecological restoration and economic development in China's Loess Plateau and strategy for more sustainable development
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China's Loess Plateau ( LP) is one of the most typical regions with serious soil erosion. Its ecological restoration, economic development, and social progress arc directly related to realizing China's national sustainable development goals (SDGs). With intensive field investigations, comprehensive analyses of statistical data, remote sensing data, and local monitoring data, this current research explored the achievements in local ecological restoration and economic development, discussed the main problems faced by the LP, and assessed the sustainable development status of the LP. Moreover, drawing from a 3C system approach (classification-coordination-collaboration), this research proposed the sustainable development strategies for more sustainable LP. We found that the LP's ecological restoration and economic development made remarkable achievements since 2000. However, the environment was still fragile and regional development was still lagging behind. In rea Uzi ng SDGs, further improvements on clean water and sanitation, decent work and economic growth, industry, innovation and infrastructure, reduced inequalities, and climate action are needed. Coordinated and collaborated efforts are expected from multiple hierarchical levels including household, watershed, region, and nation in developing LP. Specifically, human-environment interactions should be highlighted at the household level, upstreamdownstream interactions that are catering to the particular characteristics of the LP is encouraged at the watershed level, and regional and urban-rural interactions shall play an increasingly important role at the regional level. While at the national level, the central government should carry out a systematic overarching design. To better realize the goal of more sustainable LP, this research calls for (1) forming an actor-network consists of multi stakeholders, including the central government, local government, watershed, families, ecosystem and environment. enterprises, NGOs, and scientists, and (2) paying attention to ecosystem management, ecological restoration, industrial structure optimization, ecological agriculture, rural infrastructure, and ecological civilization construction in the future development.

TI  - <i>Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim</i> mapping with multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images: The importance of different features and consistency of results
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Zanthoxylum bungeanum Maxim (ZBM) is an important woody species in large parts of Asia, which provides oils and medicinal materials. Timely and accurate mapping of its spatial distribution and planting area is of great significance to local economy and ecology. As a special tree species planted in the Grain for Green Program of China, Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture (Linxia) in Gansu Province of China has vigorously developed ZBM cultivation since the launch of the program. However, lacking the accurate ZBM planting information hinders the assessment of the benefits and losses of the program to local people. Therefore, this study investigated the potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) to accurately map ZBM in the study area in 2019. We first investigated the classification accuracies of four alternative Random Forest (RF) classifications using either alone or in combination, spectral bands, vegetation indices (VIs), and topographical variables. The importance of the three categories of features was examined based on the mean decrease accuracy (MDA) metric. The classification results with the most important features were further assessed for their consistency by considering the voting rates of 800 trees based on testing samples. Results show that the sole use of the spectral bands (40 input features) already achieves a satisfactory classification accuracy of 95.43%. Adding extra VIs and topographical variables further improves the results, but only to a small extent. However, certain VIs and topographic variables are far more effective in classification compared with the original spectral bands, especially the Red Edge Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI705) and Normalized Difference Yellow Index (NDYI). The classification accuracy achieves nearly 95% when using only the top 15 most important features. The desirable periods for differencing of ZBM and other land cover types are fruit coloring and ripening periods. The final map shows that the ZBM planting in Linxia is mainly distributed along the Yellow River and around the Liujiaxia reservoir. The total mapped acreages of ZBM is 51,601 ha, covering 9.51% of the study area. 99% of ZBM tends to grow between 1500 and 2400 m altitude, and 67% of ZBM are planted in areas with slopes between 5 and 25.. Voting rates show that the percentages of classification results with strong and good consistency are generally over 70% for all land cover types, proving the derived land cover map's high credibility, including ZBM. Altogether, our results demonstrate the high potential of multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images in accurate mapping of ZBM, which can serve as a reference for other specialty crops or tree species.Y

TI  - Recession of Gya Glacier and the 2014 glacial lake outburst flood in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh, India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study assessed spatiotemporal changes at Gya Glacier, the associated development of a proglacial lake, and reconstructed the 2014 outburst flood that struck Gya Village in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh, India. This study analyzed and for the first time modeled a Glacial Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) event in the Trans-Himalayan region of Ladakh. Glacier and glacial lakes changes were quantified using remote sensing data supplemented with field observations. Glacier ice-thickness and glacier-bed overdeepenings were modeled using a shear-stress based model, GlabTop (Glacier-bed Topography). The reconstruction of the 2014 GLOF and the potential hazard assessment of Gya Lake were carried out using the hydrodynamic model HEC-RAS; results were validated against ground-collected data. Temporal evaluation of satellite data revealed a 45.6% loss in the total glacier area between 1969 and 2019. The earliest snow-free image available for the region shows that a progladal lake existed as early as 1969 with an area of 3.06 ha. The lake has expanded to similar to 11 ha in 2019. Results from the GlabTop model suggest that the lake could grow further up to 12 ha in the future. Field-based geomorphic indicators suggest that the 2014 GLOF event resulted from a piping failure of the frontal moraine destroying numerous agricultural fields, some buildings, downstream infrastructure, and eroded natural channel embankments. The reconstruction of the event revealed that 25% of the lake waters drained out with a peak discharge of 470 m(3) s(-1) , inundating an area of similar to 4 km(2) around Gya Village. However, a complete breaching of the terminal moraine could result in an event that would be 5.5 times larger than the 2014 GLOF. Therefore, this study could be useful not only in planning disaster-resilient infrastructure around proglacial lake environments in the cold-arid Ladakh but also in framing mitigation plans to reduce risk for vulnerable downstream communities.

TI  - Geospatial landslide inventory of India-an insight into occurrence and exposure on a national scale
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - India ranks first in the world in terms of fatal landslides. Large vulnerable area (0.42 million km(2)), high population density and monsoon rainfall make India's landslide management and mitigation task difficult. Therefore, an understanding of landslide occurrences and exposure of socio-economic parameters on a national scale is essential to prioritise landslide mitigation efforts. In this paper, a database of 45,334 landslides (polygons) in India mapped by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) during the 1998-2018 period was compiled and catalogued in a WebGIS platform. High-resolution satellite data such as IRS PAN+LISS-III, Resourcesat LISS-IV Mx, Cartosat, WorldView, Pleiades and GeoEye were used to map landslides as small as 12 m(2) to as big as 1,390,350 m(2). GIS analysis using the landslide inventory revealed interesting results about control, exposure and pattern of landslide occurrences in India. The Northwest Himalayas contribute 66.5% of landslides in India, followed by the Northeast Himalayas (18.8%) and the Western Ghats (14.7%). The Greater Himalayan sequence consisting of high-grade metamorphic rocks has a considerable control (32%), and the Main Central Thrust is the major regional structure controlling (12%) landslides in India. In the Northeast Himalayas, the size of landslides and the slope gradient controlling landslide occurrence are less in comparison to the Northwest Himalayas and the Western Ghats. Landslides in the Western Ghats are triggered with a lesser amount of rainfall than the Himalayan regions. Exposure analysis using four key socio-economic parameters in the 145 hilly districts shows that Rudraprayag district is most affected by landslides in India. The understanding derived using the landslide database on a national scale will help to prioritise and strengthen landslide disaster risk reduction strategies in India.

TI  - Coexistence of regression and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes is associated with more favorable survival in melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF CANCER RESEARCH AND CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Melanoma is one of the highly immunogenic malignancies, and histological regression (HR) and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) represent early signs of activation of the immune system against primary melanoma. In this study we aimed to investigate the potential roles of HR and TILs on survival, as combined or separately.Methods A total of 916 cutaneous melanomas were analyzed retrospectively.Results Only minority of the lesions had HR (25.1%) and they were associated with males (p = 0.002), axial localization (p = 0.0001), non-nodular histopathology (p = 0.0001), thin Breslow depth (p = 0.01) and nevus-associated melanoma (p = 0.03). Those with TILs (48.4%) were found in association with lower Clark levels (p = 0.003), thin tumor thicknesses (p = 0.001), lower mitotic rates (p = 0.02), BRAF mutation (p = 0.03), absence of neurotropism (p = 0.03), involvement of lymph node (p = 0.0001) and relapse of disease (p = 0.04). A significant relationship was found between HR and TILs (p = 0.01). TILs were independently associated with favorable RFS (p = 0.02), whereas no relationship was observed between HR and RFS (p = 0.2). A marked favorable survival advantage was noted in the group with HR (+)/TILs (+) compared to other groups with HR (-)/TILs (-) (p = 0.007), only HR (+) and only TILs (+). Both HR (p = 0.05) and TILs (p = 0.04) were correlated with favorable OS rates. Moreover, HR (+) /TILs (+) patients had more favorable OS than other groups with HR (-)/TILs (-) (p = 0.002), only HR (+) and only TILs (+).Conclusion Only HR (+) and only TILs (+) subgroups separately were found to be associated with favorable survivals in melanoma. Furthermore, coexistence of HR and TILs, HR (+)/TILs (+) subgroup, had more favorable survival rates compared to only HR (+) and only TILs (+) subgroups.

TI  - Fatigue crack growth behavior of Ti-6Al-4V alloy fabricated via laser metal deposition: Effects of building orientation and heat treatment
T2  - JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work studied the effect of building orientations and post-process heat treatments on the fatigue crack growth behavior of Ti-6Al-4V manufactured by laser metal deposition. The fatigue crack growth rate experiments were carried out in three sampling directions (YZ, ZY, XY) in order to evaluate the anisotropy. In addition, the heat-treated samples (YZ, ZY, XY) were used for comparison, which were heat-treated under the vacuum at 900. for 2 h followed by air cooling and 550. for 4 h followed by air cooling. The results showed that the Delta K-T values before and after heat treatment were 13.6 and 15 MPa.m(1/2), respectively. In the hypo-transitional region, the effect of columnar grains orientation and uniaxial residual stress led to anisotropy in fatigue crack growth rate for as-built specimens. This effect is significantly attenuated after the post-process heat treatment. The coarsened alpha laths effectively changed the crack propagation behavior and improve the fatigue crack growth resistance of the material. In the hyper-transitional region, the fatigue crack growth was controlled by the inherent fatigue crack growth resistance rather than the microstructure, resulting in negligible differences in all fatigue crack growth rate curves.

TI  - Detecting shrub recovery in sagebrush steppe: comparing Landsat-derived maps with field data on historical wildfires
T2  - FIRE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The need for basic information on spatial distribution and abundance of plant species for research and management in semiarid ecosystems is frequently unmet. This need is particularly acute in the large areas impacted by megafires in sagebrush steppe ecosystems, which require frequently updated information about increases in exotic annual invaders or recovery of desirable perennials. Remote sensing provides one avenue for obtaining this information. We considered how a vegetation model based on Landsat satellite imagery (30 m pixel resolution; annual images from 1985 to 2018) known as the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) "Back-in-Time" fractional component time-series, compared with field-based vegetation measurements. The comparisons focused on detection thresholds of post-fire emergence of fire-intolerant Artemisia L. species, primarily A. tridentata Nutt. (big sagebrush). Sagebrushes are scarce after fire and their paucity over vast burn areas creates challenges for detection by remote sensing. Measurements were made extensively across the Great Basin, USA, on eight burn scars encompassing similar to 500 000 ha with 80 plots sampled, and intensively on a single 113 000 ha burned area where we sampled 1454 plots.Results: Estimates of sagebrush cover from the NLCD were, as a mean, 6.5% greater than field-based estimates, and variance around this mean was high. The contrast between sagebrush cover measurements in field data and NLCD data in burned landscapes was considerable given that maximum cover values of sagebrush were similar to 35% in the field. It took approximately four to six years after the fire for NLCD to detect consistent, reliable signs of sagebrush recovery, and sagebrush cover estimated by NLCD ranged from 3 to 13% (equating to 0 to 7% in field estimates) at these times. The stabilization of cover and presence four to six years after fire contrasted with previous field-based studies that observed fluctuations over longer time periods.Conclusions: While results of this study indicated that further improvement of remote sensing applications would be necessary to assess initial sagebrush recovery patterns, they also showed that Landsat satellite imagery detects the influence of burns and that the NLCD data tend to show faster rates of recovery relative to field observations.

TI  - Strengthening Pacific voices through Talanoa participatory action research
T2  - ALTERNATIVE-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDIGENOUS PEOPLES
M3  - Article
AB  - Approaches to health and social research and development in the Pacific are dominated by Eurocentric frameworks that fail to reflect the region's ethnic diversity and inherent cultural knowledge and belief systems. We aimed to advance innovative, indigenous methodology with a focus on youth voice and transformative approaches that contribute to a decolonising and sustainable model of development. Talanoa-a Pacific framework for communicating and connecting-and participatory action research were adapted to create a unique Pacific "action cycle" focused on providing opportunities to (a) hear from fruit and vegetable young entrepreneurs and (b) foster healthy and sustainable food systems among young entrepreneurs in Suva, Fiji. A Fijian worldview helped to centralise Fijian concepts of knowledge enquiry and research. This article describes the way in which Pacific Talanoa can be incorporated within a Fijian epistemological paradigm for research and development undertaken in the Fijian context.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution and classification of utilization of urban bare lots in low-slope hilly regions
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban bare lots are persistent phenomena in urban landscapes in the course of urbanization. In the present study, we examined the spatio-temporal distribution of urban bare lots in low-slope hilly areas, and to assess the major pathways by which they are generated and later re-transformed for exploitation. We extracted land use and land cover (LULC) change information and analyzed spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of urban bare lots using Landsat TM/OLI series remote sensing images. Subsequently, we proposed an index system for their evaluation and classification, and identified five types of urban bare lots. Urban bare lot quantity and distribution are closely correlated with human activity intensity. Stakeholders should consider the multiple effects of location, topography, landscape index, transportation, service facilities, and urban planning in urban bare lot classification activities for renovation and re-transformation.

TI  - Interstitial multicatheter HDR-brachytherapy as accelerated partial breast irradiation after second breast-conserving surgery for locally recurrent breast cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Our aim was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of interstitial multicatheter high dose rate brachytherapy (imHDR-BRT) as accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) after second breast-conserving surgery (BCS) in patients with ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR). Between January 2010 and December 2019, 20 patients with IBTR who refused salvage mastectomy (sMT) were treated with second BCS and post-operative imHDR-BRT as APBI. All patients had undergone primary BCS followed by adjuvant external beam radiotherapy. Median imHDR-BRT dose was 32 Gy delivered in twice-daily fractions of 4 Gy. Five-year IBTR-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS) as well as toxicity and cosmesis were evaluated in the present retrospective analysis. Median age at recurrence and median time from the first diagnosis to IBTR was 65.1 years and 12.2 years, respectively. After a median follow-up of 69.9 months, two patients developed a second local recurrence resulting in 5-year IBTR free-survival of 86.8%. Five-year DMFS and 5-year OS were 84.6% and 92.3%, respectively. Grade 1-2 fibrosis was noted in 60% of the patients with no grade 3 or higher toxicity. Two (10%) cases of asymptomatic fat necrosis were documented. Cosmetic outcome was classified as excellent in 6 (37.5%), good in 6 (37.5%), fair in 3 (18.75%) and poor in 1 (6.25%) patient, respectively. We conclude that imHDR-BRT as APBI re-irradiation is effective and safe for IBTR and should be considered in appropriately selected patients.

TI  - Shotgun lipidomics and mass spectrometry imaging unveil diversity and dynamics in <i>Gammarus fossarum</i> lipid composition
T2  - ISCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel species are playing an indispensable role in monitoring environmental pollution in aquatic ecosystems. Many pollutants found in water prove to be endocrine disrupting chemicals that could cause disruptions in lipid homeostasis in aquatic species. A comprehensive profiling of the lipidome of these species is thus an essential step toward understanding the mechanism of toxicity induced by pollutants. Both the composition and spatial distribution of lipids in freshwater crustacean Gammarus fossarum were extensively examined herein. The baseline lipidome of gammarids of different sex and reproductive stages was established by high throughput shotgun lipidomics. Spatial lipid mapping by high resolution mass spectrometry imaging led to the discovery of sulfate-based lipids in hepato-pancreas and their accumulation in mature oocytes. A diverse and dynamic lipid composition in G. fossarum was uncovered, which deepens our understanding of the biochemical changes during development and which could serve as a reference for future ecotoxicological studies.

TI  - Basin scale spatiotemporal analysis of shoreline change in the Black Sea
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we carried out a basin-scale long-term shoreline change analysis for the Black Sea coastline. The study consists of 28 subsections with 78943 transects along the coastline. A total number of 96 Landsat satellite images, between 1972 and 2018 are used for the analysis. The average conditions are characterized by erosion with a mean value of shoreline change in the Black Sea of -0.17 m/year, while 23% of the coastline has eroded for more than 1 m/year in the last 40+ years. The results depict that different mechanisms and processes driven by the river sediment loads (e.g. Danube and Kizilirmak Deltas), anthropogenic effects (e.g. Southeastern Black Sea coast of Turkey), and entrapment of coastal sediments are active throughout the coastline and are influencing the long-term shoreline dynamics. It is shown that, at a multi-annual scale, the erosional hotspots are generally located along the low-lying sandy coastal areas of Yesilirmak, Danube, and Kizilirmak River Deltas, together with the barriers and spits from the Northwestern Crimea and Southwestern Black Sea shores. Hence, 21% of the widest beaches of the Black Sea eroded for more than 1 m/year in the last 40+ years. The total length of the Black Sea coastline is estimated as 4987 km based on the analysis of the most recent satellite images.

TI  - Endometrial cancer: A society of gynecologic oncology evidence-based review and recommendations
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction. In 2014, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology's Clinical Practice Committee published a clinical update reviewing the treatment of women with endometrial cancer. At that time, there had been significant advances in the diagnosis, work-up, surgical management, and available treatment options allowing for more optimal care of affected women. Despite these advances, the incidence of endometrial cancer as well as the deaths attributable to the disease have continued to rise; from 1987 to 2014 there has been a 75% increase in cases and almost 300% increase in endometrial cancer deaths. Fortunately, since then, there has been progress in the treatment of patients with endometrial cancer with increased utilization of molecular pathology, greater understanding of genetic predisposition, enhanced methods for lymph node assessment, a broader understanding of the efficacy of radiation and chemotherapy, and a more efficient approach to survivorship and surveillance. The purpose of this document is to present a comprehensive review of this progress.Manuscript development process. The authors reviewed the available evidence, contributed to the development of this manuscript, provided critical review of the guidelines, and finalized the manuscript recommendations. The review was also presented to and approved by the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO) Clinical Practice Committee, SGO Publications Committee, and the SGO board members prior to submission for publication.The recommendations for this manuscript were developed by a panel of gynecologic oncologists who were members of the SGO Clinical Practice and Education Committees. Panelists reviewed and considered evidence from current uterine cancer literature. The terminology used in these guidelines was adopted from the ASCCP management guidelines [1] using a two-part rating system to grade the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence (Table 1). The rating for each recommendation is given in parentheses. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Geomagnetic Virtual Observatories: monitoring geomagnetic secular variation with the Swarm satellites
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - We present geomagnetic main field and secular variation time series, at 300 equal-area distributed locations and at 490 km altitude, derived from magnetic field measurements collected by the three Swarm satellites. These Geomagnetic Virtual Observatory (GVO) series provide a convenient means to globally monitor and analyze long-term variations of the geomagnetic field from low-Earth orbit. The series are obtained by robust fits of local Cartesian potential field models to along-track and East-West sums and differences of Swarm satellite data collected within a radius of 700 km of the GVO locations during either 1-monthly or 4-monthly time windows. We describe two GVO data products: (1) 'Observed Field' GVO time series, where all observed sources contribute to the estimated values, without any data selection or correction, and (2) 'Core Field' GVO time series, where additional data selection is carried out, then de-noising schemes and epoch-by-epoch spherical harmonic analysis are applied to reduce contamination by magnetospheric and ionospheric signals. Secular variation series are provided as annual differences of the Core Field GVOs. We present examples of the resulting Swarm GVO series, assessing their quality through comparisons with ground observatories and geomagnetic field models. In benchmark comparisons with six high-quality mid-to-low latitude ground observatories we find the secular variation of the Core Field GVO field intensities, calculated using annual differences, agrees to an rms of 1.8 nT/yr and 1.2 nT/yr for the 1-monthly and 4-monthly versions, respectively. Regular sampling in space and time, and the availability of data error estimates, makes the GVO series well suited for users wishing to perform data assimilation studies of core dynamics, or to study long-period magnetospheric and ionospheric signals and their induced counterparts. The Swarm GVO time series will be regularly updated, approximately every four months, allowing ready access to the latest secular variation data from the Swarm satellites.

TI  - Developing National Genotype-Independent Indicators for Recent <i>Mycobacterium Tuberculosis</i> Transmission Using Pediatric Cases-United States, 2011-2017
T2  - PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionPediatric tuberculosis (TB) cases are sentinel events for Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in communities because children, by definition, must have been infected relatively recently. However, these events are not consistently identified by genotype-dependent surveillance alerting methods because many pediatric TB cases are not culture-positive, a prerequisite for genotyping.MethodsWe developed 3 potential indicators of ongoing TB transmission based on identifying counties in the United States with relatively high pediatric (aged <15 years) TB incidence: (1) a case proportion indicator: an above-average proportion of pediatric TB cases among all TB cases; (2) a case rate indicator: an above-average pediatric TB case rate; and (3) a statistical model indicator: a statistical model based on a significant increase in pediatric TB cases from the previous 8-quarter moving average.ResultsOf the 249 US counties reporting >= 2 pediatric TB cases during 2009-2017, 240 and 249 counties were identified by the case proportion and case rate indicators, respectively. The statistical model indicator identified 40 counties with a significant increase in the number of pediatric TB cases. We compared results from the 3 indicators with an independently generated list of 91 likely transmission events involving >= 2 pediatric cases (ie, known TB outbreaks or case clusters with reported epidemiologic links). All counties with likely transmission events involving multiple pediatric cases were identified by >= 1 indicator; 23 were identified by all 3 indicators.Practice ImplicationsThis retrospective analysis demonstrates the feasibility of using routine TB surveillance data to identify counties where ongoing TB transmission might be occurring, even in the absence of available genotyping data.

TI  - Satellite-based drought analysis in the Zambezi River Basin: Was the 2019 drought the most extreme in several decades as locally perceived?
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Study region: The study area is the river basin upstream of the Kariba dam located in the Zambezi River at the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe.Study focus: During the dry season of 2019 in Sub-Saharan Africa, extremely low water levels occurred in the Zambezi. According to news media, locals perceived this drought as the worst in several decades. We analyzed the 2019 drought in the Zambezi River Basin upstream of the Kariba dam to determine whether it indeed was the longest, most intense, and severe drought, in terms of precipitation, total water storage and reservoir water level observations over recent decades.New hydrological insights for the region: Data analysis indicates that the 2019 drought indeed had the lowest basin-averaged annual rainfall, most severe local rainfall deficit in the north of the basin, and lowest reservoir level since 1995. However, the rainfall deficit was more severe in 2002, both basin-wide and locally in the south of the basin. The total storage deficit was more severe in 2004, both basin-wide and locally in the central part of the basin. However, as the available storage data did not cover the entire deficit for 2019, its final duration and severity remain unknown. Therefore, it depends on the drought characteristic, hydrological variable, and location within the basin, whether the 2019 drought was indeed the most extreme over recent decades.

TI  - Forecasting anthracnose-twister disease using weather based parameters: geographically weighted regression focus
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to identify the environmental factors that may influence the onion anthracnose-twister disease incidence and severity. In this study, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) analysis was used to identify the dominant environmental factors that might influence the occurrence of Anthracnose-twister disease of onion using Geographic Information System approach. The onion disease records were acquired from the Institute of Climate Change and Environmental Management. The weather parameters such as relative humidity, cumulative rainfall and temperature were acquired from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration website while the river parameters were generated from Sentinel-2 images. This study has identified the 'distance to river' and 'rainfall' factor as the two (2) important factors that may influence the occurrence of the disease. The predictive surface map generated from GWR model was able to predict the occurrence of the disease in onion field by as much as 86% in the study area. The results of the study can be used to forecast the occurrence of anthracnose-twister disease in the onion fields the future.

TI  - Land use land cover dynamics and fragmentation-induced changes in woody plant community structure in a mining landscape, Ghana
T2  - TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE
M3  - Article
AB  - The study assessed the dynamics of mining land use land cover changes and consequent fragmentation impacts on woody plant community structure in the Ahafo Region, Ghana. Landsat images were utilised to determine land use and cover changes using a supervised classification method. Plant community structure was determined within 60 (20 x 20 m) plots that were randomly laid in equal numbers in fragmented and intact forests. Our findings showed that the mining landscape experienced a substantial land use/cover change between 2003 and 2018, with considerable forest cover loss at the expense of increasing cover of plantation, settlement/bare surface, mine site, and waterbody. Woody plant species diversity was significantly lower in the fragmented forest around the mine. Likewise, fragmentation caused a shift in plant species composition in the fragmented forest, whose composition was less homogenised compared to the intact forest. Plant abundance did not differ significantly between the two forests, but it was invasive and cultivated tree species that increased the total abundance of woody plants in the fragmented forests. The mining landscape was dominated by an invasive alien species, Broussonetia papyrifera which poses an ecological threat to native species. In conclusion, our findings suggest that mining contributed to intense land use/cover dynamics and fragmentation that impaired woody plant community structure around the mine. There is the need to accord priority to management intervention that would seek to manage and conserve the remaining forest fragments and its biodiversity in the mining landscape.

TI  - Multiple stressors determine river ecological status at the European scale: Towards an integrated understanding of river status deterioration
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The biota of European rivers are affected by a wide range of stressors impairing water quality and hydro-morphology. Only about 40% of Europe's rivers reach 'good ecological status', a target set by the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) and indicated by the biota. It is yet unknown how the different stressors in concert impact ecological status and how the relationship between stressors and status differs between river types. We linked the intensity of seven stressors to recently measured ecological status data for more than 50,000 sub-catchment units (covering almost 80% of Europe's surface area), which were distributed among 12 broad river types. Stressor data were either derived from remote sensing data (extent of urban and agricultural land use in the riparian zone) or modelled (alteration of mean annual flow and of base flow, total phosphorous load, total nitrogen load and mixture toxic pressure, a composite metric for toxic substances), while data on ecological status were taken from national statutory reporting of the second WFD River Basin Management Plans for the years 2010-2015. We used Boosted Regression Trees to link ecological status to stressor intensities. The stressors explained on average 61% of deviance in ecological status for the 12 individual river types, with all seven stressors contributing considerably to this explanation. On average, 39.4% of the deviance was explained by altered hydro-morphology (morphology: 23.2%; hydrology: 16.2%), 34.4% by nutrient enrichment and 26.2% by toxic substances. More than half of the total deviance was explained by stressor interaction, with nutrient enrichment and toxic substances interacting most frequently and strongly. Our results underline that the biota of all European river types are determined by co-occurring and interacting multiple stressors, lending support to the conclusion that fundamental management strategies at the catchment scale are required to reach the ambitious objective of good ecological status of surface waters.

TI  - Improving estimates of PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentration and chemical composition by application of High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) and Creating Aerosol Types from chemistry (CATCH) algorithm
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Improved characterization of ambient PM2.5 mass concentration and chemical speciation is a topic of interest in air quality and climate sciences. Over the past decades, considerable efforts have been made to improve groundlevel PM2.5 using remotely sensed data. Here we present two new approaches for estimating atmospheric PM2.5 and chemical composition based on the High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL)-retrieved aerosol extinction values and types and Creating Aerosol Types from Chemistry (CATCH)-derived aerosol chemical composition. The first methodology (CMAQ-HSRL-CH) improves EPA's Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) predictions by applying variable scaling factors derived using remotely-sensed information about aerosol vertical distribution and types and the CATCH algorithm. The second methodology (HSRL-CH) does not require regional model runs and can provide atmospheric PM2.5 mass concentration and chemical speciation using only the remotely sensed data and the CATCH algorithm. The resulting PM2.5 concentrations and chemical speciation derived for NASA DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from COlumn and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) Baltimore-Washington, D.C. Corridor (BWC) Campaign are compared to surface measurements from EPA's Air Quality Systems (AQS) network. The analysis shows that the CMAQ-HSRLCH method leads to considerable improvement of CMAQ's predicted PM2.5 concentrations (R-2 value increased from 0.37 to 0.63, the root mean square error (RMSE) was reduced from 11.9 to 7.2 mu g m(-3), and the normalized mean bias (NMB) was lowered from -46.0 to 4.6%). The HSRL-CH method showed statistics (R-2 = 0.75, RMSE = 8.6 mu gm(-3), and NMB = 24.0%), which were better than the CMAQ prediction of PM2.5 alone and analogous to CMAQ-HSRL-CH. In addition to mass concentration, HSRL-CH can also provide aerosol chemical composition without specific model simulations. We expect that the HSRL-CH method will be able to make reliable estimates of PM2.5 concentration and chemical composition where HSRL data are available.

TI  - Validation and analysis of Terra and Aqua MODIS, and SNPP VIIRS vegetation indices under zero vegetation conditions: A case study using Railroad Valley Playa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spectral vegetation index (VI) time series data from coarse resolution satellite sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), have been utilized in studying vegetation dynamics. Numerous studies have evaluated how well VI products capture variations in vegetation biophysical or physiological conditions. Equally important is to evaluate VI products over "zero vegetation" surfaces consisting of soils, litters, and/or rocks, as they define the lower bound for vegetation detection. VIs, however, vary over zero vegetation surfaces as a function of soil moisture content and surface roughness. In this study, we evaluated the behavior of VIs from Terra MODIS (T-MODIS), Aqua MODIS (A-MODIS), and Suomi-National Polar-orbiting Partnership Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (S-VIIRS) at Railroad Valley Playa, Nevada for a period from April 2013 to September 2019. The playa is a dried lakebed devoid of vegetation throughout the year. Long-term in situ reflectance measurements acquired over the 1 km-by-1 km Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) located on the playa were obtained from the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) portal and used as a reference. Three VIs were analyzed, including the normalized difference VI (NDVI), enhanced VI (EVI), and two-band EVI (EVI2). RadCaTS NDVI, EVI, and EVI2 of the playa surface increased and decreased occasionally for the time period examined in this study, and the satellite NDVIs, EVIs, and EVI2s had comparable temporal signatures to the RadCaTS counterparts. T-MODIS and A-MODIS NDVI and EVI2 values were comparable to the RadCaTS counterparts, whereas T-MODIS and A-MODIS EVI values were lower than the RadCaTS counterparts by similar to 0.006 and -0.01 EVI units, respectively. All the three VIs of S-VIIRS were consistently higher than their RadCaTS counterparts by-0.008 VI units, due to the higher near-infrared (NIR) reflectances of S-VIIRS than the RadCaTS NIR reflectance. The red and NIR, and red and blue reflectances each formed linear relationships (i.e., soil lines) for each of the three sensors. Variations in reflectance due to surface conditions and observation geometries all appeared as variations along these soil lines. The satellite red-NIR soil lines were comparable to the RadCaTS counterparts, whereas the satellite red-blue soil lines had steeper slopes than the RadCaTS counterparts due to a negative bias in the satellite blue reflectances. This translated into the T-MODIS and A-MODIS EVI behaviors different from those depicted by RadCaTS EVI, and the satellite NDVI and EVI2 behaving more comparably with the RadCaTS counterparts and across the three sensors than the satellite EVI.

TI  - An approach for building rooftop border extraction from very high-resolution satellite images
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The development of a new Very High-Resolution (VHR) satellite sensor provides opportunities for mapping more details. The building extraction process is a challenging problem due to the misclassification between buildings and similar spectral objects. The main aim of this study is to introduce an approach to building rooftops border extraction. In this approach, a new index to highlight building areas using the capabilities of the WorldView-2 eight-bands VHR satellite images is presented. The developed index is then integrated into a complete approach to extract borders between buildings and their corresponding shadows. The building's rooftops boundaries are determined using a novel algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to five study areas and compared with three recent approaches for building extraction. The results of the comparison have illustrated that the proposed approach achieves the highest overall accuracy (average of 92.20%) and has the ability for detecting building rooftops separated from their facades.

TI  - Divergent Mast Cell Responses Modulate Antiviral Immunity During Influenza Virus Infection
T2  - FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR AND INFECTION MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Influenza A virus (IAV) is a respiratory pathogen that infects millions of people each year. Both seasonal and pandemic strains of IAV are capable of causing severe respiratory disease with a high risk of respiratory failure and opportunistic secondary infection. A strong inflammatory cytokine response is a hallmark of severe IAV infection. The widespread tissue damage and edema in the lung during severe influenza is largely attributed to an overexuberant production of inflammatory cytokines and cell killing by resident and infiltrating leukocytes. Mast cells (MCs) are a sentinel hematopoietic cell type situated at mucosal sites, including the lung. Poised to react immediately upon detecting infection, MCs produce a vast array of immune modulating molecules, including inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and proteases. As such, MCs have been implicated as a source of the immunopathology observed in severe influenza. However, a growing body of evidence indicates that MCs play an essential role not only in inducing an inflammatory response but in suppressing inflammation as well. MC-derived immune suppressive cytokines are essential to the resolution of a number of viral infections and other immune insults. Absence of MCs prolongs infection, exacerbates tissue damage, and contributes to dissemination of the pathogen to other tissues. Production of cytokines such as IL-10 and IL-6 by MCs is essential for mitigating the inflammation and tissue damage caused by innate and adaptive immune cells alike. The two opposing functions of MCs-one pro-inflammatory and one anti-inflammatory-distinguish MCs as master regulators of immunity at the site of infection. Amongst the first cells to respond to infection or injury, MCs persist for the duration of the infection, modulating the recruitment, activation, and eventual suppression of other immune cells. In this review, we will discuss the immune modulatory roles of MCs over the course of viral infection and propose that the immune suppressive mediators produced by MCs are vital to minimizing immunopathology during influenza infection.

TI  - Spring phenology outweighed climate change in determining autumn phenology on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - As the third pole of the Earth, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is highly sensitive to climate change. Phenological changes in spring (i.e., the start of the growing season, SOS) over the TP are of much debate, while our understanding on the variation of autumn phenology (i.e., the end of the growing season, EOS) is still lacking. Given the significance of tracing the latest variation of EOS induced by the ongoing global change, we used the currently longest time series (1982-2018) of the normalized difference vegetation index of the Long Term Data Record from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR LTDR NDVI) and investigated the responses of EOS to biological and climatic factors. We found that the EOS showed an insignificantly delayed trend at an average rate of 0.14 days center dot decade(-1) on the TP. This variation was found for all vegetation types except for alpine sparse vegetation. We further showed that spring SOS had the largest contribution to the interannual variations in EOS, where 46.5% of the vegetated areas showed significantly positive correlations between SOS and EOS (p < .05). Temperature (26.5%) and precipitation (18.8%) also had significant positive impacts on EOS, while the contribution of radiation was negative (11.3%). These correlations were regulated by local hydrothermal conditions, especially for precipitation gradients. Using the longest satellite data currently available, with the state-of-art data processing, we demonstrated a weakly delaying trend of EOS and the controlling role of spring phenology on the interannual variability of EOS, which is of great significance to improve our comprehension of the interactions between vegetation dynamics and climate change in the future.

TI  - Chagas disease in urban and peri?urban environment in the Amazon: Sentinel hosts, vectors, and the environment
T2  - ACTA TROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Chagas disease is an anthropozoonosis, caused by a flagellated protozoan, Trypanosoma cruzi, in which the enzootic cycle occurs between mammals and triatomines. Two dogs with a history of sudden death were necropsied at the Federal University of Par?a (UFPA). One dog had a pale area in the myocardium, which on histopathological examination showed a T. cruzi amastigote nest; immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis characterized it as acute Chagas disease (ACD). The second dog showed no macroscopic changes. Microscopically, a few cardiomyocytes were replaced by adipocytes, and IHC result was negative for T. cruzi. However, results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the cardiac tissue of both dogs was positive for T. cruzi DNA. After that, an epidemiological study was conducted in the region. For this study, we selected four areas in Castanhal. One of the four areas (Area 1) is where one of the dogs lived. The other three areas were chosen because they were recently deforested for housing. Blood samples were collected from dogs, cats, wild small mammals (marsupials and rodents), and the digestive tract of triatomines. Nested PCR was performed on all the blood samples and the triatomine digestive tracts. In Area 1, T. cruzi DNA was detected in 50% (12/24) of the tested dogs, in the only tested cat (1/1), 50% (1/2) of the tested marsupials (Didelphis marsupials), and 100% of the captured triatomines (Rhodnius pictipes) (2/2). In Area 2, T. cruzi DNA was not detected in any of the 11 (0/11) dogs and two marsupials tested (0/2), and no triatomines were found in this area. In Area 3, T. cruzi DNA was detected in 42.25% (30/71) of the dogs, in 66,6% (2/3) of the cats, the only captured marsupial (D. marsupialis) (1/1), and all three triatomines (3/3) (R. pictipes) tested. In Area 4, the two dogs tested were negative (0/2), 25% (1/4) of the captured marsupials (D. marsupialis) was positive, and no triatomine was captured in this area. The data demonstrate the importance of detecting T. cruzi in dogs, cats, small rodents, and marsupials in the Amazon metropolitan areas, where ecotopes carry reservoirs and vectors capable of participating in the Chagas disease cycle. The proximity between humans and T. cruzi vectors in these places might contribute to increased disease transmission risk and maintenance of agents. It was noted that high-standard condominiums, previously thought to reduce the risk for this disease, presented a new epidemiological risk. The presence of T. cruzi DNA in a dog who, a year earlier had tested negative, when another dog in the same house died of ACD, shows that the transmission cycle is present and active, with a high possibility of disease transmission to animals and humans.

TI  - David Medalla: Dreams of Sculpture
T2  - OXFORD ART JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - David Medalla (b. 1942) is perhaps best known as a pioneer of bio-kinetic sculpture and the co-founder of Signals London (1964-1966), a gallery that was instrumental to the British reception of postwar Latin American art. For Medalla and his colleagues, new developments in technology promised not only a shift in sculptural techniques and materials, but also a radical redefinition of art's imaginative integration into entirely new ecosystems, from the microscopic to the intergalactic. However, as with the most compelling articulations of futurism during the decade, Medalla's vision tampered the utopic charge of science fiction with a keen awareness of the material realities of the so-called 'developing' world from which he hailed. His projects concerned not only perceptual capacity, but also an ideological worldview: how to bridge the creative scientific outlook that marvelled at new universes in nature with the instrumental approach to nature that drove developmentalist models of Third World progress? If Medalla deserves critical attention today, it is because he envisioned the technological turn in sculpture to be vital to re-enchanting the material world, activating energies of the imagination that cut across vibrant matter and sentient mind.

TI  - Viral etiology and seasonal trends of pediatric acute febrile illness in southern Puerto Rico; a seven-year review
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundAcute febrile illness (AFI) is an important cause for seeking health care among children. Knowledge of the most common etiologic agents of AFI and its seasonality is limited in most tropical regions.Methodology/Principal findingsTo describe the viral etiology of AFI in pediatric patients (<= 18 years) recruited through a sentinel enhanced dengue surveillance system (SEDSS) in Southern Puerto Rico, we analyzed data for patients enrolled from 2012 to May 2018. To identify seasonal patterns, we applied time-series analyses to monthly arboviral and respiratory infection case data. We calculated coherence and phase differences for paired time-series to quantify the association between each time series.A viral pathogen was found in 47% of the 14,738 patients. Influenza A virus was the most common pathogen detected (26%). The incidence of Zika and dengue virus etiologies increased with age. Arboviral infections peaked between June and September throughout the times-series. Respiratory infections have seasonal peaks occurring in the fall and winter months of each year, though patterns vary by individual respiratory pathogen.Conclusions/SignificanceDistinct seasonal patterns and differences in relative frequency by age groups seen in this study can guide clinical and laboratory assessment in pediatric patients with AFI in Puerto Rico.

TI  - Land use optimization through bridging multiobjective optimization and multicriteria decision-making models (case study: Tilabad Watershed, Golestan Province, Iran)
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCE MODELING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to present an efficient methodology for land use optimization based on minimization of runoff and sediment and maximization of economic benefits, occupational opportunities, and land use suitability in the Tilabad watershed in northeast of Iran. The land use map of the area was prepared using the Landsat satellite images and field surveys. The amounts of runoff and sediment were estimated via SWAT model. The TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making (MCDM) approach was applied on the results of the multiobjective optimization (MOO) based on non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA II) to choose the final optimal solution among the Pareto solutions front generated by MOO. The results indicated that the area of agriculture and rangelands should decrease, and the area of forests should increase to achieve the defined objectives. Overall, results indicated that integration of MOO and MCDM provides an efficient procedure for land use optimization in a complex watershed.Recommendations for Resource ManagersThe optimization of land use allocation across a complex watershed requires the combined application of several models and techniques to achieve a sustainable decision-making process.By optimization of land use patterns according to the final solution, the surface runoff and sediment load of the watershed will decline, while the economic profit and land use suitability will improve.Despite using a maximization objective function, the land-based job opportunities might decrease across a watershed by optimization of land use allocation, but this can be considered as an opportunity for provision of manpower to other socioeconomic sectors.

TI  - Estimating Changes in Forest Attributes and Enhancing Growth Projections: a Review of Existing Approaches and Future Directions Using Airborne 3D Point Cloud Data
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of Review The increasing availability of three-dimensional point clouds, including both airborne laser scanning and digital aerial photogrammetry, allow for the derivation of forest inventory information with a high level of attribute accuracy and spatial detail. When available at two points in time, point cloud datasets offer a rich source of information for detailed analysis of change in forest structure. Recent Findings Existing research across a broad range of forest types has demonstrated that those analyses can be performed using different approaches, levels of detail, or source data. By reviewing the relevant findings, we highlight the potential that bi- and multi-temporal point clouds have for enhanced analysis of forest growth. We divide the existing approaches into two broad categories- - approaches that focus on estimating change based on predictions of two or more forest inventory attributes over time, and approaches for forecasting forest inventory attributes. We describe how point clouds acquired at two or more points in time can be used for both categories of analysis by comparing input airborne datasets, before discussing the methods that were used, and resulting accuracies. To conclude, we outline outstanding research gaps that require further investigation, including the need for an improved understanding of which three-dimensional datasets can be applied using certain methods. We also discuss the likely implications of these datasets on the expected outcomes, improvements in tree-to-tree matching and analysis, integration with growth simulators, and ultimately, the development of growth models driven entirely with point cloud data.

T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, in order to further study the mechanical behavior of T-shaped stiffened concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns, numerical programs of eccentrically compressive T-shaped stiffened CFST columns were developed to calculate moment M-phi curvature curves of cross section and column. The calculated curves with the numerical programs agree well with the experimental results. A parametric analysis was carried out to calculate M-N correlation curves of cross section and column to investigate influence of concrete strength f(ck), steel yielding strength f(y), steel tube thickness t, slenderness ratio lambda, and loading angle theta. On the basis of parametric analysis, simplified resistance models of T-shaped CFST section and column were proposed and verified by the numerical analysis results. The simplified resistance models are reliable to predict the mechanical behavior for engineering application.

TI  - Voiding recovery after radical parametrectomy in cervical cancer patients: An international prospective multicentre trial - SENTIX
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Voiding dysfunctions represent a leading morbidity after radical hysterectomy performed in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. The aim of this study was to perform ad hoc analysis of factors influencing voiding recovery in SENTIX (SENTinel lymph node biopsy in cervIX cancer) trial.METHODS: The SENTIX trial (47 sites, 18 countries) is a prospective study on sentinel lymph node biopsy without pelvic lymphadenectomy in patients with early-stage cervical cancer. Overall, the data of 300 patients were analysed. Voiding recovery was defined as the number of days from surgery to bladder catheter/epicystostomy removal or to post-voiding urine residuum <= 50 mL.RESULTS: The median voiding recovery time was three days (5th-95th percentile: 0-21): 235 (78.3%) patients recovered in <7 days and 293 (97.7%) in 30 days. Only seven (2.3%) patients recovered after 0.001) significantly influenced voiding recovery 7 days post-surgery. Type-B parametrectomy was associated with a higher risk of delayed voiding recovery than type-C1 (OR = 4.69; p = 0.023 vs. OR = 3.62; p = 0.052, respectively), followed by type-C2 (OR = 5.84; p = 0.011). Both previous pregnancy and type C2 parametrectomy indepen-dently prolonged time to voiding recovery by two days.CONCLUSIONS: Time to voiding recovery is significantly related to previous pregnancy and type of parametrectomy but it is not influenced by surgical approach (open vs minimally invasive), age, or BMI. Type B parametrectomy, without direct visualisation of nerves, was associated with longer recovery than nerve-sparing type C1.Importantly, voiding dysfunctions after radical surgery are temporary, and the majority of the patients recover in less than 30 days, including patients after C2 parametrectomy.

TI  - Use of noise reduction filters on stereo images for improving the accuracy and quality of the digital elevation model
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, there has been increasing attention to the digital elevation model (DEM) because of its ability to learn the Earth's surface's topography. Freely accessible DEMs such as the Cartosat-1, shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM), light detection and ranging, and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer DEM, contain large vertical errors. The errors are aggravated over multifaceted geography and cannot rectify microgeographic deviations in the moderately flat landscape. As high-accuracy DEMs have limited availability, dated low-accuracy DEMs are still used in various models, specifically in the data-sparse areas. However, it is necessary to enhance the quality of these DEMs before their use in the geomorphometric analysis. We aim to investigate the effect of noise reduction filters on DEM's accuracy and quality. The noise reduction filters such as weighted average filter, median filter, sharpen filter, Lee sigma filter, and local sigma filter are used for noise reduction in the stereo images. The quality and accuracy of the generated DEMs are further improved by selecting an optimum number of tie points in the image matching process. The effects are assessed by correlating the surface profiles for the final DEM obtained and SRTM DEM as a reference with a resolution of 1 arc sec.

TI  - The Risk of Subclinical Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema by the Extent of Axillary Surgery and Regional Node Irradiation: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RADIATION ONCOLOGY BIOLOGY PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: To compare the risk of subclinical breast cancer-related lymphedema (sBCRL) using bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) or tape measure (TM) by the extent of axillary surgery and regional nodal irradiation (RNI).Methods and Materials: Patients were randomized to surveillance with TM or BIS. A BIS >= 6.5 L-Dex units or TM volume change >= 5 and <10% above presurgical baselines "triggered" sBCRL. The incidence of sBCRL by sentinel node biopsy or axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) with or without RNI was examined for 484 patients. Radiation was categorized as "limited RNI" (axilla level I/II only) or "extensive RNI" (axilla level III or supraclavicular fossa with or without level I/II).Results: At a median follow-up of 20.5 months, 109 of 498 patients (21.9%) triggered sBCRL (BIS 13.5% vs TM 25.6%; P < .001). In patients not receiving RNI, BIS triggered 12.9% of patients undergoing SNB and 25.0% undergoing ALND (P = .18). Extensive RNI significantly increased triggering with BIS versus no RNI after sentinel node biopsy (SNB; 33.3% vs 12.9%; P = .03) but not ALND (30.8% vs 25.0%; P = .69). Triggering by TM was greater than 25% for most subgroups and was inferior to BIS in discriminating the risk of sBCRL by utilization of RNI or axillary surgery.Conclusions: The lower triggering rates with BIS and its better discrimination of the risk of sBCRL by receipt and type of RNI compared with TM support its use for posttreatment surveillance to detect sBCRL and to initiate early intervention. The risk of sBCRL increased with more extensive axillary treatment. Patients having ALND or extensive RNI require close surveillance for BCRL. Longer follow-up is required to determine rates of progression to clinical lymphedema. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Quantifying spatial patterns of urbanization: growth types, rates, and changes in Addis Ababa City from 1990 to 2020
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban patterns have shown that shifts in the social, economic, and geographical features of an area result in metropolitan growth, planned or otherwise. Rapid urbanization takes a toll on the ecological makeup of the environment and the wellbeing of humans at multiple levels. Thus, this study was drafted to quantify urban growth rates, types, and changes, with regards to urbanization patterns from 1990 to 2020. It tries to evaluate whether Addis Ababa's urban expansion conforms to the diffusion-coalescence theory using remote sensing data. The Spatio-temporal pattern and changing aspects of the built-up land were examined using urban growth types, spatial metrics, and a gradient method. The last decade evidenced the most pronounced growth within a buffer distance of 10 to 22 km from the city center. Edge expansion was the most dominant form of growth across all three decades with more than 61% of new development each. Infill and outlying growth showed decadal variability with an alternating dominance. The Spatio-temporal investigation confirmed that the urban class and growth types remained consistent. The team concluded that diffusion and coalescence are two simultaneously occurring phases of urban growth rather than two dichotomous successive phases. Spatio-temporal patterns and the dynamic behavior of spatial metrics are instrumental in comprehending the urban growth process and cycle. Moreover, the results can aid in assessing the land use planning policy as well as to guide future land use planning.

TI  - Assessment of the agricultural water budget in southern Iran using Sentinel-2 to Landsat-8 datasets
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is a first attempt to compute the total water needs of an agricultural plain with remote sensing and ground data in Iran. The cropping areas were mapped with Sentinels-2 images, based on NDVI profiles classification. This model was validated and 85% of the areas were correctly classified. Second, the crop water needs were computed using PYSEBAL and Landsat-8 images. Crop evapotranspiration (ETseason) and Irrigation Requirements (IRseason) were calculated for each crop and then validated by comparing IR collected in the field from farmers with computed IRPYSEBAL on 5 plots. IRPYSEBAL underestimated the reality with an average of 10% while the overestimation average was 17%. The second validation was the comparison of Daily ET from FAO-56 method and Daily ET PYSEBAL showed a RMSE of 0.67 mm/day and MAE of 0.52 mm/day, which assesses the accuracy of PYSEBAL. ETseason varies according to weather parameters in the plain and IRseason according to different irrigation practices. The most water demanding crops were identified: rice (IR: 1427 mm) and corn (669). The total water balance of Marvdasht was negative in 2018 with 0.2859 km(3) of extracted groundwater for irrigation for only 0.098 km(3) of available water for aquifers recharge.

TI  - ICESat-2 and the Trees Around the GLOBE student research campaign: Looking at Earth's tree height, one tree at a time
T2  - ACTA ASTRONAUTICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The NASA Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 or ICESat-2 launched on September 15, 2018 from the Vandenberg Air Force Base aboard the last Delta II rocket. ICESat-2 is designed to map the height of our planet by counting the laser photons leaving and returning to the satellite. Although its primary science objective is to measure the height of Earth's ice, it is able to measure other 3-dimensional objects on Earth, like mountains, buildings, oceans, lakes, trees, etc. The GLOBE Program is an international program of students, educators, scientists, and citizen scientists that allows participants to take measurements in their local environments, in order to see the big picture of how our planet is changing over time. One of the GLOBE measurements is tree height. Students, as part of the Trees Around the GLOBE Student Research Campaign, have been collecting tree height data and comparing it to ICESat-2 tree height data. The Trees Around the GLOBE Student Research Campaign commenced on September 15, 2018 in conjunction with NASA's ICESat-2 satellite launch. This campaign is a student research campaign focusing on tree height. Tree height is not just a measurement, it is a gateway to understanding many things about the environment. The structure of tree canopies and the 3D arrangement of individual trees has a huge effect on how ecosystems function and cycle through carbon, water, and nutrients. As part of the NASA GLOBE Observer Citizen Science Program, a new Trees tool allows citizen scientists to measure tree height using their mobile device. From this, there is an increasingly robust dataset that will allow scientists to use as satellite data comparisons and in potential professional research. Scientists from the ICESat-2 Mission periodically review the tree height data collected by the GLOBE community throughout this campaign and beyond.

TI  - Influence of the BB temperature on the on-orbit radiometric calibration for the medium resolution spectral imager
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - As one key imaging sensor carried on the fengyun-3C (FY-3C), the medium resolution spectral imager (MERSI) is capable of making continuous global observations for a broad range of scientific studies of the earth and ocean together with the atmosphere and land. In order to acquire the on-orbit radiometric data with good accuracy and stability, the errors of the calibration coefficients a0 and a1 caused by the BB temperature offset are analyzed in detail. For the BB temperature changing by 0.1 K, the calibration coefficient errors delta a0 and delta a1 are in a range of [0.001, 0.015] and [8 x 10-6, 9 x 10-6]. To verify the effectiveness of the calibration coefficient, the earth reversed irradiance and temperature obtained by the calibration coefficients and earth gray value are compared with the theoretical irradiance and temperature, and the absolute variation of the earth irradiance is 0.01 Wm-2sr-1am-1 while the relative error is about 0.16 %. Besides, the earth equivalent temperature difference is 0.10 K, whose relative error is 0.04 %. This research provides a theoretical and practical guidance for the satellite data assimilations along with the quantitative remote sensing applications.

TI  - Long-term water stress and drought assessment of Mediterranean oak savanna vegetation using thermal remote sensing
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a devastating natural hazard that is difficult to define, detect and quantify. The increased availability of both meteorological and remotely sensed data provides an opportunity to develop new methods to identify drought conditions and characterize how drought changes over space and time. In this paper, we applied the surface energy balance model, SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System), for the period 2001-2018, to estimate evapotranspiration and other energy fluxes over the dehesa area of the Iberian Peninsula, with a monthly temporal resolution and 0.05 degrees pixel size. A satisfactory agreement was found between the fluxes modeled and the measurements obtained for 3 years by two flux towers located over representative sites (RMSD = 21 Wm(-2) and R-2 = 0.76, on average, for all energy fluxes and both sites). The estimations of the convective fluxes (LE and H) showed higher deviations, with RMSD = 26 W m(-2) on average, than Rn and G, with RMSD = 15 W m(-2). At both sites, annual evapotranspiration (ET) was very close to total precipitation, with the exception of a few wet years in which intense precipitation events that produced high runoff were observed. The analysis of the anomalies of the ratio of ET to reference ET (ETo) was used as an indicator of agricultural drought on monthly and annual scales. The hydrological years 2004/2005 and 2011/2012 stood out for their negative values. The first one was the most severe of the series, with the highest impact observed on vegetation coverage and grain production. On a monthly scale, this event was also the longest and most intense, with peak negative values in January-February and April-May 2005, explaining its great impact on cereal production (up to 45% reduction). During the drier events, the changes in the grasslands' and oak trees' ground cover allowed for a separate analysis of the strategies adopted by the two strata to cope with water stress. These results indicate that the drought events characterized for the period did not cause any permanent damage to the vegetation of dehesa systems. The approach tested has proven useful for providing insight into the characteristics of drought events over this ecosystem and will be helpful to identify areas of interest for future studies at finer resolutions.

TI  - High-Resolution Maps of Material Stocks in Buildings and Infrastructures in Austria and Germany
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamics of societal material stocks such as buildings and infrastructures and their spatial patterns drive surging resource use and emissions. Two main types of data are currently used to map stocks, night-time lights (NTL) from Earth-observing (EO) satellites and cadastral information. We present an alternative approach for broad-scale material stock mapping based on freely available high-resolution EO imagery and OpenStreetMap data. Maps of built-up surface area, building height, and building types were derived from optical Sentinel-2 and radar Sentinel-1 satellite data to map patterns of material stocks for Austria and Germany. Using material intensity factors, we calculated the mass of different types of buildings and infrastructures, distinguishing eight types of materials, at 10 m spatial resolution. The total mass of buildings and infrastructures in 2018 amounted to similar to 5 Gt in Austria and similar to 38 Gt in Germany (AT: similar to 540 t/cap, DE: , similar to 450 t/cap). Cross-checks with independent data sources at various scales suggested that the method may yield more complete results than other data sources but could not rule out possible overestimations. The method yields thematic differentiations not possible with NTL, avoids the use of costly cadastral data, and is suitable for mapping larger areas and tracing trends over time.

TI  - VIIRS Environmental Data Record and Deep Blue aerosol products: validation, comparison, and spatiotemporal variations from 2013 to 2018 in China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, the Deep Blue (DB) algorithm has been successfully applied to the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to expend the long-term aerosol records over land in conjunction with the Environmental Data Record (EDR) product. However, the overall accuracy and uncertainty of VIIRS DB and EDR Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products are still unclear in China, in particular, due to the sparse distribution of ground observation stations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate and compare VIIRS EDR and DB AOD retrievals against ground measurements collected from both Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) and Chinese Sun-sky radiometer Observation Network (SONET) in China from 2013 to 2018. Results suggest that both EDR and DB products have a significant refinement after quality assurance (QA) controlling. DB (QA = Best) performs best with high correction (R = 0.92), and up to 80.32% of AOD matches falling within the expected error (EE), while approximately 46% of EDR (QA = Best) AOD retrievals are overestimated. However, EDR has a higher retrieval frequency than DB over most regions of China, except for the arid and semi-arid areas such as the Northwest. Generally, despite some exceptions, both EDR and DB products perform relatively poorly in summer for all statistics. Furthermore, the error analysis explains that DB is less sensitive to varying air pollution levels, diverse aerosol types, and different surface conditions, while the pattern of EDR is complicated. In addition, due to the common algorithmic heritage, both VIIRS EDR and MODIS DT products only show good matching over dark surfaces, while VIIRS DB and MODIS DB algorithms have good performance over both dark and bright surfaces. Finally, both EDR and DB products have shown significant downward AOD trends equal to-0.0008 per year (p < 0.01) in China during the last past six years, especially for three typical urban agglomerations. These evaluation results are expected to provide appropriate guidance for the application of VIIRS aerosol products in China.

TI  - The evaluation of damped Newton variational ocean wind retrieval method
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper researches on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) ocean wind retrieval approach, evaluates the method of Damped Newton VARiational method (DNVAR) and the direct method (DIRECT) using two years' real SAR data and different background winds. Experiments are carried out using SENTINEL-1 SAR information as observation, National Data Buoy Center (NDBC) buoy data as in-situ data, Global Forecast System (GFS), Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT), WindSAT, and Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) wind products as background data. Thousands of match-ups are extracted. Results show that DNVAR can improve the wind field accuracy when the background data is ASCAT and CCMP. Especially, DNVAR wind speed results are much better than the official product of SENTINEL-1 wind data. The background data is crucial to the wind field retrieval results, so high accuracy of background data could lead to high accuracy results. (C) 2021 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier B.V.

M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to estimate areal extent of the mangrove forest cover in the eastern Sundarban of Bangladesh from 1989 to 2019 to understand mangrove dynamic over the last 30 years. Freely available Landsat TM of 1989, 2014, and L8 OLI imagery were used to generate land use/land cover (LU/LC) map for the study area using maximum likelihood (MaxLike) algorithm. Results of previous investigations among different scientists and researchers were used to develop a conceptual background and also included in this paper to find out the causes that relate to forest cover change in the study area. Study results show that the vegetation cover of Sharankhola range in Sundarban has decreased by 0.44% over last 30 years (from 1989 to 2019). Water body has increased (1.30%) with the decrease in vegetation cover. Classified map of 2014 and 2019 shows that 2.66% vegetation cover of the study area was lost in 2014 based on 1989 while 2.22% vegetation cover was gained in 2019 based on 2014. The overall accuracy of Landsat TM (1989), TM (2014), and L8 OLI (2019) were 80%, 82.85%, and 84.28%, respectively. Its accuracy would increase if it is supplemented by extensive ground verification data and hybrid satellite data of different spectral and spatial resolution.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Controlling Reactivity-Real-Space Imaging of a Surface Metal Carbene
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Metal carbenes are key intermediates in a plethora of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalytic processes. However, despite their importance to heterogeneous catalysis, the influence of surface attachment on carbene reactivity has not yet been explored. Here, we reveal the interactions of fluorenylidene (FY), an archetypical aromatic carbene of extreme reactivity, with a Ag(111) surface. For the first time, the interaction of a highly reactive carbene with a metal surface could be studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). FY chemisorbs on Ag(111) with an estimated desorption energy of 3 eV, forming a surface bound silver-carbene complex. The surface interaction leads to a switching of the electronic ground state of FY from triplet to singlet, and to controlled chemical reactivity. This atomistic understanding of the interplay between carbenes and metal surfaces opens the way for the development of novel classes of catalytic systems based on surface metal carbenes.

TI  - High-performance altimeter Doppler processing for measuring sea level height under varying sea state conditions
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes an innovative method for processing nadir altimeter data acquired in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode, enhancing the system performances over open ocean. Similarly to the current SAR data processing scheme, the so-called LR-RMC (Low Resolution with Range Migration Correction) method, originally designed by Phalippou and Demeester (2011), includes Doppler beam forming, Doppler shift correction and range correction. In LR-RMC, however, an alternative and less complex averaging (stacking) operation is used so that all the Doppler beams produced in a radar cycle (4 bursts of 64 beams for the open-burst Sentinel-3-mode altimeter) are incoherently combined to form a multi-beam echo. In that manner, contrarily to the narrow-band SAR technique, the LRRMC processing enlarges the effective footprint to average out the effects of surface waves and particularly those from small submesoscale structures (<1 km) that are known to impact SAR-mode performances. On the other hand, the number of averaged beams is as high as in current SAR-mode processing, thus providing a noise reduction at least equally good. The LR-RMC method has the added benefit of reducing the incoherent integration time with respect to the SAR-mode processing (50 ms compared to 2.5 s) limiting possible surface movement effects. By processing one year of Sentinel-3A SRAL SAR-mode data using the LR-RMC method, it is shown that the swell impact on the SAR altimeter performances is totally removed and that an improvement of 10-50% is obtained in the measurement noise of the sea surface height and significant wave height with respect to SAR mode. Additionally, observational capabilities over the middle scales are enhanced potentially allowing the ocean mesoscale features to be retrieved and observations assimilated more usefully in ocean models.

TI  - Exposure to ambient particulate matter and biomass burning during pregnancy: associations with birth weight in Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPOSURE SCIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background There is a growing evidence that exposure to ambient particulate air pollution during pregnancy is associated with adverse birth outcomes, including reduced birth weight (BW). The objective of this study was to quantify associations between BW and exposure to particulate matter (PM) and biomass burning during pregnancy in Thailand.Methods We collected hourly ambient air pollutant data from ground-based monitors (PM with diameter of <10 mu m [PM10], Ozone [O-3], and nitrogen dioxide [NO2]), biomass burning from satellite remote sensing data, and individual birth weight data during 2015-2018. We performed a semi-ecological analysis to evaluate the association between mean trimester exposure to air pollutants and biomass burning with BW and low-birth weight (LBW) (<2500 g), adjusting for gestation age, sex, previous pregnancies, mother's age, heat index, season, year, gaseous pollutant concentrations, and province. We examined potential effect modification of PM10 and biomass burning exposures by sex.Results There were 83,931 eligible births with a mean pregnancy PM10 exposure of 39.7 mu g/m(3) (standard deviation [SD] = 7.7). The entire pregnancy exposure was associated with reduced BW both for PM10 (-6.81 g per 10 mu g/m(3) increase in PM10 [95% CI = -12.52 to -1.10]) and biomass burning (-6.34 g per 1 SD increase in fires/km(2) [95% CI = -11.35 to -1.34]) only after adjustment for NO2. In contrast with these findings, a reduced odds ratio (OR) of LBW was associated with PM10 exposure only in trimesters one and two, with no relationship across the entire pregnancy period. Associations with biomass burning were limited to increased ORs of LBW with exposure in trimester three, but only for male births.Conclusion Based on our results, we encourage further investigation of air pollution, biomass burning and BW in Thailand and other low-income and middle-income countries.

TI  - Subsidence in Como historic centre (northern Italy): Assessment of building vulnerability combining hydrogeological and stratigraphic features, Cosmo-SkyMed InSAR and damage data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Como historic centre, located at the SW branch of Lake Como (northern Italy), is prone to subside because of a thick sequence of late Pleistocene to Holocene glacio-lacustrine, palustrine and alluvial sediments in the subsoil. After the 1950s, the combination of natural causes and anthropogenic activities amplified subsidence-induced differential settlements at building foundation depths, resulting in damage on the superstructures. This work presents the first subsidence vulnerability analysis of the historic buildings in Como city centre by combining hydrogeological and stratigraphic features, in situ damage investigations, and remote sensing Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data acquired by Cosmo-SkyMed mission. First, the relationships between local hydrogeological features and vertical displacements retrieved by SAR Interferometry (InSAR) analysis were qualitatively assessed. This highlighted that cumulative vertical InSAR-derived settlements have a stronger linear correlation with the groundwater level rather than the thickness of compressible soil units at the city scale. The largest vertical displacements are located in the NW sector of the city centre and along the shore of Lake Como, where they remark the pre-Roman shoreline. Then, the cause-effect relationships between building damage severity and Subsidence-Related Intensity (SRI) parameters were investigated using a probabilistic approach based on empirical fragility curves. To this aim, two InSAR-derived SRI parameters were tested for both masonry and reinforced concrete buildings: differential settlements and relative rotations. The former resulted to relate better to distinct damage levels in Como historic centre. The analyses performed can contribute to the management of the inestimable architectural and cultural heritage of Como historic centre.

TI  - Automatic detection of surface-water bodies from Sentinel-1 images for effective mosquito larvae control
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface-water body maps are imperative for effective mosquito larvae control. This study aims to select a method for the automatic and regular mapping of surface-water bodies in rice fields and wetlands using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. Four methods were adapted and developed for automated application: the Otsu valley-emphasis algorithm, a classification method based on the textural feature of entropy, a method using K-means unsupervised classification, and a method using the Haralick' s textural feature of dissimilarity and fuzzy-rules classification. The results were assessed using field data collected during the mosquito breeding periods of 2018 and 2019 in the region of Central Macedonia (Greece). The Otsu valley-emphasis technique provides the highest overall accuracy (0.835). The accuracy is higher at the beginning of the summer (0.948) than at the end of the rice-growing season due to higher density of vegetation. Results using this method were further assessed during the main larvicide application period. The presence of vegetation, built-up areas, floating algae in rice-paddies, salt-crust formations in wetlands, and water depth, were found to affect the performance of the algorithm. A WebGIS platform was designed for the visualization of the produced water maps along with other data related to mosquito-larvae presence. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Monitoring Acid Mine Drainage's Effects on Surface Water in the Kizel Coal Basin with Sentinel-2 Satellite Images
T2  - MINE WATER AND THE ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mining in the Kizel coal basin (Perm Region, Russia) ceased 20 years ago; however, AMD with high levels of total iron (Fe-total) and trace elements still affects the rivers. In this study, we attempted to estimate inter-annual and seasonal variability of AMD-related surface water contamination using Sentinel-2 images from 2016 to 2019. The acid mine water index (AMWI), which is a normalized difference of spectral reflectance in the red and blue bands, was calculated from Sentinel-2 images. We compared the AMWI values with measured Fe-total concentrations in the surface water. A statistically significant (at a 0.05 significance level) Spearman's rank correlation between AMWI and Fe-total concentration was found for 5 out of 7 surface water sampling points. We found that surface water contamination reaches a seasonal maximum in July, 1-1.5 months after the end of the snowmelt high water period. Excessive summer rainfalls also contributes to increased contamination, causing contamination to possibly spread more than 200 km from the AMD sources. In contrast, arid summer conditions were associated with a substantially decreased AMD discharge and Fe-total concentrations in the surface water. The main uncertainties in our results are associated with the effect of contaminated bottom and bank sediments and suspended sediments on the spectral characteristics of the water surface, and the relatively coarse (10 m) spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 images. However, despite the data and method limitations, our results show that Sentinel-2 images have substantial potential for monitoring AMD-related contamination of surface water.

TI  - Modeling satellite battery aging for an operational satellite simulator
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - During the satellite's operations, simulation tools perform an important role in ensuring the space mission success. In this sense, the models implemented in the context of an operational satellite simulator that enables analysis of health status and maintenance during operations shall reflect the current satellite behavior with high fidelity. Moreover, it is complicated to obtain all analytical models of a satellite's disciplines, considering its aging. This paper proposes an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to reproduce the battery voltage behavior of a large sun-synchronous remote sensing satellite, the CBERS-4, currently in operation. Using the genetic algorithm to find the best network architecture of ANN, the neural model for this application presented an error of less than 1%, demonstrating its feasibility to obtain a high fidelity model for an operational simulator enabling extend analyses. The paper addresses advanced techniques aligned with the space industry's future, increasing the ability to analyze a large amount of data and improve the space system's operation. (C) 2021 COSPAR.

TI  - Tropopause-penetrating convection in the extratropics: A satellite-based investigation for the year 2018
T2  - QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropopause-penetrating convection (or "overshooting convection" [OC]) is defined as a meso-to-microscale stratosphere-troposphere exchange process caused by deep convection. OC plays an important role in stratosphere-troposphere exchange and in producing turbulence. Compared with the tropics, the characteristics of OC in the extratropics are poorly understood. To this end, a high-resolution and objective satellite-based OC identification and classification algorithm was developed. In the algorithm, a machine learning method was utilized to derive tropopause height directly from satellite observations to ensure a high level of consistency between tropopause and cloud top height variations. By studying the climatology of OCs, including geographic distribution, vertical extent, and seasonal and diurnal variation, as well as their linkage with turbulence in the extratropics in 2018 based on Fengyun-4A geostationary meteorological satellite data, it was found that most OCs in the extratropics have relatively shallow vertical extents and are more likely to occur over complex topography within the cyclonic curvature side of subtropical jets near the exit region, with a total frequency lower than 0.2%. They showed significant seasonal and diurnal variation. OCs in the Northern Hemisphere occurred most frequently during spring and summer and peak in the afternoon, while those in the Southern Hemisphere were more likely to occur in winter and spring, and with the highest likelihood in the early morning. Typical synoptic conditions for the occurrence of OCs in the mid-high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in the summer months included low-level easterly flows, increased moisture symmetric instability, upper cold trough (or cold vortex), and a subtropical westerly jet. Under this large-scale flow pattern, moderate-to-greater turbulence was often found to occur within or about 200 km away from the core convective area. The stronger the penetrating convection, the greater the probability of moderate-to-greater turbulence.

TI  - <i>In Situ</i> Voltammetric Sensor of Potentially Bioavailable Inorganic Mercury in Marine Aquatic Systems Based on Gel-Integrated Nanostructured Gold-Based Microelectrode Arrays
T2  - ACS SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The development and field validation of newly designed nanostructured gold-plated gel-integrated microelectrode (Au-GIME) arrays applied to the direct in situ square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) quantification of the potentially bioavailable inorganic mercury (Hg(II)) species in the coastal area are presented. The Au-GIME consists of arrays of 100-500 interconnected iridium (Ir)-based microdisks that are electroplated with renewable Au nanoparticles (AuNPs) or Au nanofilaments (AuNFs) and covered with an agarose gel. The gel protects the sensor surface from fouling and ensures that mass transport of analytes toward the sensor surface is by pure diffusion only and therefore independent of the ill-controlled convective conditions of the media. The responses of these sensors to direct SWASV measurements of inorganic Hg(II) at near-neutral pH were investigated first in synthetic media and then in UV-irradiated marine samples. The analytical responses were found to be correlated to the number of interconnected microelectrodes and the morphology of the nanostructured Au deposits and independent of the media composition for chloride concentration >= 0.2 M (salinity S >= 13) and pH ranging from 7 to 8.5. The AuNF-GIMEs have detection and quantification limits at a low pM level, fulfilling the requirement of sentinel tools for realtime monitoring of the dynamic fraction of Hg(II) in coastal area. The AuNF-GIMEs were incorporated in an in-house advanced multichannel sensing probe for remote in situ high-resolution trace metal monitoring. Field evaluation and validation were successfully performed as a part of a field study in Arcachon Bay (France), from which environmental data are presented. This work marks the first time that an autonomous electrochemical sensing probe successfully measures Hg(II) and its hourly temporal variation in situ without chemical modification of the sample.

TI  - Analyzing Land Cover Dynamics Using Hierarchical Classification in Binzhou City, China
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on multi-temporal Landsat images from 1996 to 2014, a hierarchical strategy for land use classification has been presented. The land use dynamic index, conversion matrix and spatial center have been used to quantitatively analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of land cover in Binzhou urban area. Per results, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of hierarchical classification method have been found to be 93.82% and 0.92, respectively, indicating that the method used for land cover classification was feasible. Per findings from the urban area under study, during 1996 to 2014, the cropland area decreased constantly, forestland and water body area decreased at first and then increased, while the built-up land area increased constantly. The major pattern emerging from the land cover change was represented by the conversions of cropland to built-up land. As a result of hydraulic and landscape engineering, gains in forestland and water body were more than the corresponding losses. The area gained by forestland reached peak in the period of 2005 to 2009, while the area gained by water body peaked in the period of 2001 to 2005. Moreover, spatial centers of cropland and built-up land had been located on the southwest side and the east side of the city square, respectively. Per findings, spatial center of cropland was moving away from the City Square in southwestern direction by about 634.30 m, while the built-up land extended to the west, and the spatial center of the built-up land moved towards the southwest as well by about 1575.84 m. The movement of built-up land spatial center was closely related to the development and construction of west urban area.

TI  - Global positive gross primary productivity extremes and climate contributions during 1982-2016
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) quantifies the photosynthetic uptake of carbon by the terrestrial ecosystem. Positive GPP extremes represent the potential capacity of the terrestrial ecosystem to uptake carbon dioxide. Studying the positive GPP extreme is vital for the global carbon cycle and mitigation of global warming. With increasing climate extreme events, many kinds of research focus on studying negative GPP and the negative impact of climatic extremes on GPP. There is still a lack of research on positive GPP extremes and whether climatic extremes could be beneficial to global carbon uptake. In this study, we used daily Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) to simulate GPP of the global terrestrial ecosystem during 1982-2016 and combined TRENDY models to detect positive GPP extremes and investigate the effects of climate extremes on GPP. We found the results of the TRENDY models have large differences in some areas of the globe, and the BEPS model driven by remote sensing data could be more suitable for simulating the long-term time series of global terrestrial GPP. Compared to other plant functional types, grasslands contributed the most to positive GPP extremes, accounting for approximately 41.6% (TRENDY) and 34.8% (BEPS) of the global positive GPP extremes. The probabilities of positive GPP extremes caused by positive precipitation extremes were significantly higher than those caused by temperature and radiation in most areas of the globe, indicating that sufficient precipitation (not a flood) would boost the carbon uptake ability of the global terrestrial ecosystem to form positive GPP extremes. On the contrary, the partial correlation coefficients between temperature and GPP were negative in most areas of globe, suggesting that global warming will not be conducive to carbon uptake of the terrestrial ecosystem. This study may provide new knowledge on the global positive GPP extremes. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The proposed approach operationalizes this idea of filtering into a geographical interpretation model that combines three different strands of research: ontologies of land use in geographical information science; local spatial contextual analysis of remote sensing data; and agency- and actor-sensitive functional time-space analysis of farming. This approach includes the use of satellite images and makes it possible to infer land-use changes as reactions to long-term policy changes, thus demonstrating how landscape configuration and land use are changing. The model is assessed by applying it to a case study in western ostergotland in central Sweden.

TI  - How love of nature promotes green consumer behaviors: The mediating role of biospheric values, ecological worldview, and personal norms
T2  - PSYCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies have pointed out the importance of emotional affiliation with nature in fostering environmentalism, but the mechanisms through which such emotional motives influence pro-environmental behaviors are still unclear. To address this issue, this study introduced love of nature into the value-belief-norm model as an emotional basis. The model was examined in predicting high-cost and low-cost green consumer behaviors (GCBs) in selected undergraduate student populations in eastern China. Using data from an online survey (N = 291), this study found personal norms positively predicted both high-cost and low-cost GCBs. Ecological worldview positively predicted low-cost GCBs and its effect was larger than that of personal norms. Love of nature had positive effects on biospheric values and personal norms. The relationships between love of nature and the two types of GCBs were mediated mainly by personal norms, ecological worldview, and biospheric values. The results supported the argument that emotional affiliation to nature offers an essential basis for a moral concern that guides GCBs. The findings also suggest moral concerns may be more salient for difficult and inconvenient GCBs.

TI  - Estimating fractional snow cover from passive microwave brightness temperature data using MODIS snow cover product over North America
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic characteristics of seasonal snow cover are critical for hydrology management, the climate system, and the ecosystem functions. Optical satellite remote sensing has proven to be an effective tool for monitoring global and regional variations in snow cover. However, accurately capturing the characteristics of snow dynamics at a finer spatiotemporal resolution continues to be problematic as observations from optical satellite sensors are greatly impacted by clouds and solar illumination. Traditional methods of mapping snow cover from passive microwave data only provide binary information at a spatial resolution of 25 km. This innovative study applies the random forest regression technique to enhanced-resolution passive microwave brightness temperature data (6.25 km) to estimate fractional snow cover over North America in winter months (January and February). Many influential factors, including land cover, topography, and location information, were incorporated into the retrieval models. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) snow cover products between 2008 and 2017 were used to create the reference fractional snow cover data as the "true" observations in this study. Although over-estimating and underestimating around two extreme values of fractional snow cover, the proposed retrieval algorithm outperformed the other three approaches (linear regression, artificial neural networks, and multivariate adaptive regression splines) using independent test data for all land cover classes with higher accuracy and no out-of-range estimated values. The method enabled the evaluation of the estimated fractional snow cover using independent datasets, in which the root mean square error of evaluation results ranged from 0.189 to 0.221. The snow cover detection capability of the proposed algorithm was validated using meteorological station observations with more than 310 000 records. We found that binary snow cover obtained from the estimated fractional snow cover was in good agreement with ground measurements (kappa: 0.67). There was significant improvement in the accuracy of snow cover identification using our algorithm; the overall accuracy increased by 18% (from 0.71 to 0.84), and the omission error was reduced by 71% (from 0.48 to 0.14) when the threshold of fractional snow cover was 0.3. The experimental results show that passive microwave brightness temperature data may potentially be used to estimate fractional snow cover directly in that this retrieval strategy offers a competitive advantage in snow cover detection.

TI  - Response of surface runoff to land use and land cover change and its impact on Daihai Lake shrinkage in Inner Mongolia, China
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Daihai Lake (DL), the third largest inland lake in Inner Mongolia, has shrunk severely given the conditions of no significant decrease in annual precipitation. On the basis of field surveys and Landsat remote sensing images, this study analyzed land use and land cover (LULC) changes in six periods of the DL watershed area during 1986-2019. Then, with the combination of the LULC results and the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number method, we discussed the change characteristics and influence factors of the surface runoff in the watershed and the reason for DL shrinkage. From 1986 to 2019, the water area of DL decreased rapidly at a rate of -2.22 km(2)/year, and the area of farmland and grassland in the watershed changed strongly along the opposite trend. The surface runoff in the DL watershed was reduced by approximately 513.6 million m(3) during the last 34 years. In addition to local rainfall, groundwater is also an important water supply to the lake and accounts for a greater proportion. The average recharge rate of groundwater to the lake is approximately 64.55 million m(3) per year in the past 34 years. The area change of the DL is related to the runoff reduction, huge evaporation, and lake water use in thermoelectric power generation. The local precipitation cannot enter the groundwater in DLW. Large-scale exploitation of external groundwater for agricultural irrigation and industrial production is another important cause of lake degradation.

TI  - High frequency of the Duffy-negative genotype and absence of <i>Plasmodium vivax</i> infections in Ghana
T2  - MALARIA JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundRecent studies from different malaria-endemic regions including western Africa have now shown that Plasmodium vivax can infect red blood cells (RBCs) and cause clinical disease in Duffy-negative people, though the Duffy-negative phenotype was thought to confer complete refractoriness against blood invasion with P. vivax. The actual prevalence of P. vivax in local populations in Ghana is unknown and little information is available about the distribution of Duffy genotypes. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of P. vivax in both asymptomatic and symptomatic outpatients and the distribution of Duffy genotypes in Ghana.MethodsDNA was extracted from dried blood spots (DBS) collected from 952 subjects (845 malaria patients and 107 asymptomatic persons) from nine locations in Ghana. Plasmodium species identification was carried out by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the small-subunit (SSU) rRNA genes. For P. vivax detection, a second PCR of the central region of the Pvcsp gene was carried out. Duffy blood group genotyping was performed by allele-specific PCR to detect the presence of the FYES allele.ResultsNo cases of P. vivax were detected in any of the samples by both PCR methods used. Majority of infections (542, 94.8%) in the malaria patient samples were due to P. falciparum with only 1 infection (0.0017%) due to Plasmodium malariae, and 2 infections (0.0034%) due to Plasmodium ovale. No case of mixed infection was identified. Of the samples tested for the FYES allele from all the sites, 90.5% (862/952) had the FYES allele. All positive samples were genotyped as FY*B-33/FY*B-33 (Duffy-negative homozygous) and therefore classified as Fy(a-b-).ConclusionsNo cases of P. vivax were detected by both PCRs and majority of the subjects tested carried the FYES allele. The lack of P. vivax infections observed can be attributed to the high frequency of the FYES allele that silences erythroid expression of the Duffy. These results provide insights on the host susceptibility for P. vivax infections that had not been investigated in Ghana before.

TI  - A CatBoost approach with wavelet decomposition to improve satellite-derived high-resolution PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimates in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - High-resolution data of fine particulate matters (PM2.5) are of great interest for air pollution prevention and control. However, due to the uneven spatial distribution of ground stations, satellite acquisition cycle, and cloud/rain, high-resolution products cannot be provided on a complete spatio-temporal scale. To provide a full daily PM2.5 product in recent years at 1-km grid of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, here we apply a state-ofthe-art machine learning approach, CatBoost, to (1) reconstruct satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD) data; and to (2) estimate gridded PM2.5 from station measurements combining elevation, meteorological factors, and the reconstructed AOD data. Compared with existing approaches, CatBoost substantially improved the performance of AOD reconstruction by similar to 16%. We further show that a wavelet decomposition procedure on the station-based PM2.5 and input variables is helpful to improve the estimation accuracy. Overall, the approach has a good performance in estimating PM2.5 with a cross-validation R-2 of 0.88 and root-mean-squared error of 17.79 mu g/m(3). From the new dataset, population-weighted PM2.5 revealed heterogeneous spatial distribution of exposure in different areas, consistently higher in the Southern and Eastern BTH and lower in Beijing and Northern BTH. In recent years, both AOD and PM2.5 in the BTH region had notable interannual decreases, which can be attributed to the emission reduction efforts and interannual natural variabilities.

TI  - Selective Extirpation of Tattooed Lymph Node in Combination with Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in the Management of Node-Positive Breast Cancer Patients after Neoadjuvant Systemic Therapy
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Axillary dissection has little diagnostic and therapeutic benefit in node-positive breast cancer patients in whom axillary disease has been completely eradicated after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (ypN0). We sought to assess the efficacy of an algorithm used for the identification of the ypN0 patient consisting of intraoperative evaluation of sentinel and tattooed (initially positive) lymph nodes. Methods: Included were T1 and T2 breast cancer patients with 1-3 positive axillary lymph nodes marked with carbon who were referred for neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by a surgery. Axillary dissection was performed only in the patients with residual axillary disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy on ultrasound or with metastases described in the sentinel or tattooed lymph nodes either intraoperatively or in the final histology. Results: Out of 62 initially included node-positive patients, 15 (24%) were spared axillary dissection. The detection rate of tattooed lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 81%. The ypN0 patients were identified with 91% sensitivity and 38% specificity using ultrasound and intraoperative assessment of both sentinel and tattooed lymph node according to the final histology. Discussion/Conclusion: Lymph node marking with carbon dye is a useful and cost-effective method, which can be successfully implemented in order to reduce the number of patients undergoing axillary dissection. Low specificity of the presented algorithm was caused mostly by the overestimation of residual axillary disease on ultrasound.

TI  - Molecular detection of influenza A viruses and H5 subtype among migratory Amur falcons (Falco amurensis) and captive birds of prey
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza A viruses (IAVs) and Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) are major human and animal health threats with geographic differences in prevalence, characteristics and host populations. Currently, there is sparse information on IAVs and NDVs in avian species in South Africa. Because raptors feed on live wild birds which are the reservoir hosts of IAVs and NDVs, we considered them a good sentinel for surveillance. Therefore, in addition to other resident birds of prey, migratory Amur falcons (Falco amurensis) were screened for IAVs and NDVs. Oropharyngeal and cloacal samples were collected from raptor species at three sampling sites in KwaZulu-Natal Province and samples were screened for IAVs and NDVs using molecular and virus isolation methods. IAV-positive samples were further screened for the presence of H5, H7 and H9 viruses. A total of 14 samples from 11 birds (45.8% of all sampled birds) were IAV positive with C-t lower than 36 in duplicate tests. Five out of 24 birds (20.8%) were positive for IAV RNA in duplicate testing, albeit at low concentrations. Among raptor samples, three out of 24 birds (12.5%) were positive for IAVs with viral RNA detected in both cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs. One IAV-positive sample was also positive for H5 subtype (4.1%); all other samples were H5, H7 and H9 negative. Besides, all samples were NDV negative. Overall, our results support the development of more intensive and expanded influenza and other emerging virus studies in raptor species.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph-Node Biopsy in Early-Stage Cervical Cancer: The 4-Year Follow-Up Results of the Senticol 2 Trial
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionSenticol 2 is a randomized multicenter trial in the treatment of early-stage cervical cancer patients. The aim of the Senticol 2 study was to compare the effect of sentinel-lymph-node biopsy (SLNB) to that of SLNB + pelvic lymphadenectomy (PLND), and to determine the postoperative lymphatic morbidity in the two groups. Here, we report a secondary objective of this study: the follow up.Material and MethodsIn the Senticol 2 trial, patients underwent a laparoscopy with a sentinel-node-detection procedure and were randomized into two groups, namely: Group A, in which participants received SLNB, and Group B, in which participants received SLNB + PLND. Patients with an intra-operative macroscopically suspicious lymph node, were given a frozen-section evaluation and were randomized only if the results were negative. All of the patients received follow up with a clinical examination at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery, and then every 3-4 months after that. The median follow up was 51 months (4 years and 3 months).ResultsDisease-free survival after 4 years for the SLNB group and the SLNB + PLND group were 89.51% and 93.1% (p = 0.53), respectively. The only statistical factor associated with recurrence in the univariate analysis was the adjuvant radiotherapy. No other factors, including the age of the patients, histological type, tumor size, lymph vascular space invasion (LVSI), and positive nodal status, were significant in the univariate or multivariate analyses. The overall survival rates after 4 years in the SLNB and SLNB + PLND groups were 95.2% and 96% (p = 0.97), with five and four deaths, respectively. The univariate and multivariate analyses did not find any prognostic factors.ConclusionsThis randomized study confirmed the results of the Senticol 1 study and supports the sentinel lymph node (SLN) technique as a safe technique for use in patients with early-stage cervical cancer treated with SLNB only. Disease-free survival after 4 years was similar in patients treated with SLN biopsy and patients who underwent a lymphadenectomy.

TI  - Land use change simulation and spatial analysis of ecosystem service value in Shijiazhuang under multi-scenarios
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Simulating changes in the value of ecosystem services caused by land use changes in large cities under multiple scenarios is of great significance for cities to formulate land use policies and improve ecosystem services. Take Shijiazhuang, which is in the process of rapid urbanization, as an example. Based on the remote sensing image data and statistical yearbook of 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018 as the basic data to analyze and estimate the 30 years of land use and ecosystem service value changes in Shijiazhuang. According to this, the CA-Markov model was used to simulate the land use change in Shijiazhuang under three scenarios in 2030 and estimate the value of ecosystem services under each scenario, using grid tools to visually express the spatial distribution of ecosystem service values and the degree of agglomeration under three scenarios. The results indicate that the most obvious feature of land use change in Shijiazhuang from 1988 to 2018 was that the farmland area decreased year by year, the built-up expanded rapidly, the farmland area decreased by 86,874.75 hm(2) in 30 years, and the built-up increased by 154,711.90 hm(2). In 1988, 1998, 2008, and 2018, the ecosystem service value of Shijiazhuang was 32.578 billion yuan, 32.799 billion yuan, 29.944 billion yuan, and 31.251 billion yuan respectively. In 2030, under three scenarios of natural development, farmland protection, and ecological protection, the value of ecosystem services is 331.111 billion yuan, 33.670 billion yuan, and 33.891 billion yuan in order. The hot spots are mainly concentrated in the northwest and southwest of Shijiazhuang, and cold spots are concentrated in the eastern cities, counties, and districts. Based on changes in land use brought about by urban expansion, simulating the value of ecosystem services under multiple scenarios in the future, providing scientific guidance for building urban ecological networks, and realizing sustainable urban ecological development.

TI  - Positive and negative behavioural intentions towards immigrants: A question of ethnic categorisation or worldview conflict?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Anti-immigrant attitudes are often explained in terms of ethnic boundaries in which a categorical distinction between the ethnic ingroup and immigrant outgroup is made. However, these attitudes might also result from contrasting cultural worldviews. We examined the importance of ethnic categorisation and perceived cultural worldview difference in explaining behavioural intentions towards immigrants. Using an experimental survey design with a national sample of ethnic Dutch respondents (N = 832), we studied two positive and two negative behavioural intentions towards either immigrants with a contrasting cultural worldview or co-ethnics with such as worldview. Our findings indicate similar behavioural intentions towards both target groups. Furthermore, except for "the intention to learn" there were no differences in behavioural intentions towards both target groups for respondents with lower and higher authoritarian dispositions. Overall, this pattern of findings is theoretically most in line with a worldview conflict perspective rather than an ethnic boundary perspective.

TI  - Spectral Response Function-Guided Deep Optimization-Driven Network for Spectral Super-Resolution
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral images (HSIs) are crucial for many research works. Spectral super-resolution (SSR) is a method used to obtain high-spatial-resolution (HR) HSIs from HR multispectral images. Traditional SSR methods include model-driven algorithms and deep learning. By unfolding a variational method, this article proposes an optimization-driven convolutional neural network (CNN) with a deep spatial-spectral prior, resulting in physically interpretable networks. Unlike the fully data-driven CNN, auxiliary spectral response function (SRF) is utilized to guide CNNs to group the bands with spectral relevance. In addition, the channel attention module (CAM) and the reformulated spectral angle mapper loss function are applied to achieve an effective reconstruction model. Finally, experiments on two types of data sets, including natural and remote sensing images, demonstrate the spectral enhancement effect of the proposed method, and also, the classification results on the remote sensing data set verified the validity of the information enhanced by the proposed method.

T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - River bank erosion, accretion and lateral channel migration are important geomorphological processes, which attract a great deal of attention of river engineering scientists in many parts of the world. The present study assesses the morphological characteristics of parts of the lower section of River Niger, where field data are scarce and difficult to access for security and cost implications. Multi-date (1990, 2002 and 2017) Landsat imageries were used for the study, the imageries were corrected for geometric and radiometric errors, classified and analysed for changes in major land cover classes within the river channel, to assess river planform, riverbank pattern, channel width, bankline migration and centreline using ArcGIS software. The results revealed a decrease in water body and riparian vegetation by 27.64% and 9.77%, respectively, between 1990 and 2017. Sediment yield, however, increased by 75.61%. In addition, the river channel exhibited significant spatial changes within the study period; centreline at left flange shifted eastwards by about 1347.3 m at the upper section but westward at the lower section by 123.1 m. The bankline shifted prominently eastwards at right flange and westwards at the right flange. The study concluded that the studied channel had actually undergone some critical morphological changes greatly affected by erosion and accretion processes that are easily captured with remote sensed imageries.

T2  - PEDIATRICS AND NEONATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Despite the increased survival opportunities for extremely preterm infants, their long-term cognitive outcomes remain poor, with increased incidence of cognitive impairments in childhood and reduced opportunities to attend higher education in young adulthood compared to their term-born peers. Given that a considerable fraction of preterm infants develop cognitive impairments even without apparent sentinel events at birth and cerebral lesions on MRI assessed at term equivalent age, future strategies to improve the outcome may need to address cerebral dysfunction, which cannot be explained by the classical understanding of the injury cascade triggered by hypoxia-ischaemia around birth. Developmental care has been proposed to minimize neurodevelopmental impairments related to preterm birth. However, considerable modes of cares, environmental settings and procedures provided by the developmental care of current style appear to offer little benefit to the sound development of infants. Although it is obvious that advanced life support and neuroprotective treatments fall far short in compensating for the burden of preterm birth, researchers need to make further effort to fill the knowledge gap in the cerebral function of foetuses and newborn infants before establishing evidence-based developmental care. Clinicians need to develop an ability to translate the findings from basic and translational studies incorporating their potential biases and limitations. Care for newborn infants needs to be reassessed, including but not limited to developmental care, in the context that any sensory input and motor reaction of preterm infants may ultimately affect their cognitive functioning.

AB  - This article discusses the performance I Promise You That Tonight created by artists Tom Cassani and Peader Kirk. The article is written from a practitioner's perspective and discusses strategies of both stage magic and live art used in the show as a means to create multiple, simultaneous realities for an audience. Theoretical perspectives from postcolonial and post-developmental thought are used to work through the ontological impact of these co-present realities in performance, in particular, Arturo Escobar's concept of Pluriversal Politics (2020). The discussion is focused on the main act of the performance, walking barefoot on broken glass. The article aims to highlight how methods of trickery can enable a range of complementary conceptions of an event to emerge. We explore this in reference to both a contemporary and historical positioning of magic and its theatrical and narrative methods. Beginning with the notion that in a post-truth world access to a universal, objective scientific worldview is contested, we discuss truth and reality in relation to a possible space where a range of world models might work together in complementarity: a pluriverse. This article argues that the use of magic and live art in I Promise You That Tonight conjures up such a pluriversal opportunity. The article proposes that stage magic inverts the theatrical suspension of disbelief into an expectation of deception (even a desire to be deceived). Staging the irrational and impossible to point to the risks of credulity or, conversely, staging something that is in fact completely real but which the audience's sense of reality tells them can only be an illusion, like walking on broken glass and not being cut. We conclude by suggesting that I Promise You That Tonight constitutes a practical research into pluriversal performance through a purposeful inversion of the tropes of magical performance.

TI  - Performance of water vapour retrieval from MODIS and ECMWF and their validation with ground based GPS measurements over Varanasi
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Water vapour is highly variable over tropical region and sensitive to weather condition, monsoon onset, green house effect, and pollution level in Ganga River. In the present study, variability in water vapour derived from Global Positioning System (GPS) over Varanasi (25 degrees 20 ' N, 82 degrees 59 ' E) during the period 2007-2010 has been studied. The GPS-derived water vapour (WV) has been compared with those retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and ECMWF. The GPS-WV data concurrent to MODIS and ECMWF timing has been correlated to perform further analysis. To study the accuracy of water vapour retrieved from the MODIS and ECMWF, root mean square error (RMSE), absolute error (AE), correlation and standard deviation in it are computed with respect to GPS-derived water vapour. Analysis shows an annual correlation R-2 = 86%, RMSE = 9.5 mm and AE (MODIS-GPS) = 7.0 mm in MODIS retrieval and annual correlation R-2 = 86%, RMSE = 6.1 mm and AE (ECMWF-GPS) = 2.4 mm in ECMWF reanalysis retrieval. Correlation of ECMWF and MODIS datasets with the GPS datasets are found to vary significantly with seasons. The correlation is high during monsoon season and low during spring season. Water vapour is found to be an indicator for the onset of monsoon.

TI  - Integration of Sentinel-1 and ALOS/PALSAR-2 SAR datasets for mapping active landslides along the Jinsha River corridor, China
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide hazards along the Jinsha River corridor pose serious threats to the lives and property of local residents and can affect the safety of hydropower facilities because of the large size, number, strong activity, and disaster chain characteristics that occur following such events (such as a landslide creating a dammed lake which fails and leads to flooding), thus attracting widespread attention in both China and the rest of the world. As there is currently no complete landslide inventory map that covers the entire Jinsha River corridor, in this study the Sentinel-1 and ALOS/PALSAR-2 datasets were employed to detect and map active landslides along the entire Jinsha River corridor. Complex geomorphological conditions, such as the humid climate, dense vegetation, and steep terrain, pose great challenges to conventional InSAR-based landslide mapping methods, which can lead to a high probability of mis-judgements and omissions of landslides. Therefore, we propose a new InSAR-based procedure that can be used to conduct large-area landslide mapping through the integration of surface deformation and geomorphological features. More than 360 SAR images covering the Jinsha River corridor were processed and more than 900 active landslides were detected and mapped over the entire Jinsha River corridor for the first time. In particular, several large-scale landslides with a length and/or width of >1 km were found. Our results show that the landslides over the Jinsha River corridor are mainly located in three high earthquake-prone areas and reservoir areas, and that the landslides are mainly distributed at elevations of 1500-2000 m a.s.l. and have slope angles of 15-25 degrees. Moreover, the deformation time series results indicate that the heavy rainfall in the summer and the rapid decline of water level in the Jinsha River might be two significant factors that accelerate the deformation of active landslides and reactivate unstable slopes. The findings in this research can be directly applied to landslide hazard mitigation and prevention along the entire Jinsha River corridor. In particular, the proposed procedure can be used for the efficient and systematic mapping of active landslides in other regions with similarly complex geomorphological conditions.

TI  - Deriving Centimeter-Level Coseismic Deformation and Fault Geometries of Small-To-Moderate Earthquakes From Time-Series Sentinel-1 SAR Images
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-to-moderate earthquakes (e.g. <= M(w)5.5) occur much more frequently than large ones (e.g. >M(w)6.0), yet are difficult to study with InSAR due to their weak surface deformation that are severely contaminated by atmospheric delays. Here we propose a stacking method using time-series SAR images that can effectively suppress atmospheric phase screens and extract weak coseismic deformation in centimeter to sub-centimeter level. Using this method, we successfully derive coseismic surface deformations for three small-to-moderate (M-w similar to 5) earthquakes in Tibet Plateau and Tienshan region from time-series Sentinel-1 SAR images, with peak line-of-sight deformation ranging from 5-6 mm to 13 mm. We also propose a strategy to downsample interferograms with weak deformation signal based on quadtree mesh obtained from preliminary slip model. With the downsampled datasets, we invert for the centroid locations, fault geometries and slips of these events. Our results demonstrate the potential of using time-series InSAR images to enrich earthquake catalog with geodetic observations for further study of earthquake cycle and active tectonics.

T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Evaluate the effect of heavy metals (HM) on sentinel organisms such as vascular plants represent a model to estimate toxic hazard due to environmental pollution. In the present study, the plant Robinsonecio gerberifolius was used to evaluate the toxic effects of the HM contained in the leaves of plants that were exposed to 4 different sites in Mexico city and its metropolitan area, during the rainy and dry seasons in the period 2017-2019. The comet assay to evaluate genotoxicity revealed an increase with respect to control (p < 0.05), in 2nd and 8th week of exposure, in all 4 study sites and in both seasons, more significant in the rainy period. An increase in the induction of oxidative stress was also observed in the exposed leaves from the 4 study sites when compared with the control; in some cases, the increases were significant (p < 0.05). In general, alpha- and ss-carotenoids were increased at 8th week of exposure, in all plants exposed in both seasons, while miR398 increased in plants exposed in 2 study sites (p < 0.05). Finally, toxic HM like aluminum, vanadium, and cadmium, increased significantly in the rainy season, while lead increased in the dry season. We conclude that R. gerberifolius can be considered a sentinel plant for evaluating the presence and general toxic effects caused by the presence of toxic HM that have been documented in the atmosphere of Mexico City and its metropolitan area.

TI  - Evaluation of a satellite-based cyanobacteria bloom detection algorithm using field-measured microcystin data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread occurrence of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CyanoHABs) and the associated health effects from potential cyanotoxin exposure has led to a need for systematic and frequent screening and monitoring of lakes that are used as recreational and drinking water sources. Remote sensing-based methods are often used for synoptic and frequent monitoring of CyanoHABs. In this study, one such algorithm - a sub-component of the Cyanobacteria Index called the CIcyano, was validated for effectiveness in identifying lakes with toxinproducing blooms in 11 states across the contiguous United States over 11 bloom seasons (2005-2011, 2016-2019). Amatchup data setwas created using satellite data fromMEdiumResolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) and Ocean Land Colour Imager (OLCI), and nearshore, field-measured Microcystins (MCs) data as a proxy of CyanoHAB presence. While the satellite sensors cannot detect toxins, MCs are used as the indicator of health risk, and as a confirmation of cyanoHAB presence. MCs are also the most common laboratory measurement made by managers during CyanoHABs. Algorithm performance was evaluated by its ability to detect CyanoHAB `Presence' or 'Absence', where the bloom is confirmed by the presence of the MCs. With same-day matchups, the overall accuracy of CyanoHAB detection was found to be 84% with precision and recall of 87 and 90% for bloom detection. Overall accuracy was expected to be between 77% and 87% (95% confidence) based on a bootstrapping simulation. These findings demonstrate that CIcyano has utility for synoptic and routine monitoring of potentially toxic cyanoHABs in lakes across the United States. (c) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - A long-term spatiotemporal analysis of biocrusts across a diverse arid environment: The case of the Israeli-Egyptian sandfield
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatiotemporal data can be analyzed using spatial, time-series, and machine learning algorithms to extract regional biocrust trends. Analyzing the spatial trends of biocrusts through time, using satellite imagery, may improve the quantification and understanding of their change drivers. The current work strives to develop a unique framework for analyzing spatiotemporal trends of the spectral Crust Index (CI), thus identifying the drivers of the biocrusts' spatial and temporal patterns. To fulfill this goal, CI maps, derived from 31 annual Landsat images, were analyzed by applying advanced statistical and machine learning algorithms. A comprehensive overview of biocrusts' spatiotemporal patterns was achieved using an integrative approach, including a long-term analysis, using the Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical test, and a short-term analysis, using a rolling MK with a window size of five years. Additionally, temporal clustering, using the partition around medoids (PAM) algorithm, was applied to model the spatial multi-annual dynamics of the CI. A Granger Causality test was then applied to quantify the relations between CI dynamics and precipitation. The findings show that 88.7% of pixels experienced a significant negative change, and only 0.5% experienced a significant positive change. A strong association was found in temporal trends among all clusters (0.67 <= r <= 0.8), signifying a regional effect due to precipitation levels (p < 0.05 for most clusters). The biocrust dynamics were also locally affected by anthropogenic factors (0.58 > CI > 0.64 and 0.64 > CI > 0.71 for strongly and weakly affected regions, respectively). A spatiotemporal analysis of a series of spaceborne images may improve conservation management by evaluating biocrust development in drylands. The suggested framework may also by applied to various disciplines related to quantifying spatial and temporal trends. (C) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - The Lymphatic Drain of Below-Knee Malignant Melanoma: Is the Popliteal Fossa a Ghost Station?
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy is fundamental in the staging of primary cutaneous melanoma (PCL), but reported lymphoscintigraphic patterns are very heterogeneous. In this systematic review, we evaluated the role of the popliteal station in below-knee PCL. A systematic search of literature through was conducted on the electronic databases PubMed, SCOPUS, and Web of Science (WOS) to identify eligible studies. A total of 22 studies (n=5673 patients) were included. During the analysis of the included articles, it was not possible to classify patients into the 3 Menes popliteal drainage pattern, obtained by lymphoscintigraphy. The analysis of lymphatic drainage in patients undergoing lymphoscintigraphy for melanoma of the lower extremities below the knee was reported in 5637 patients and the type of lymphatic popliteal drainage was reported only in 5.64% (320 patients). The rate of popliteal lymph nodes melanoma metastases was 1.49%: they were located exclusively at the popliteal level in 0.60%, at the popliteal and inguinal levels in 0.39%, at the popliteal and iliac level in 0.02%, and at the groin level in 0.48%. In conclusion, the most common lymphoscintigraphic pattern is represented by popliteal nodes in-transit or interval nodes, so metastases from below-knee melanomas commonly transit through popliteal nodes stations and arrive to inguinal nodes stations. The popliteal nodes are the primary station in about 5.64% of cases. Larger studies are needed to corroborate these findings.

TI  - Impacts of cutting frequency and position to tree line on herbage accumulation in silvopastoral grassland reveal potential for grassland conservation based on land use and cover information
T2  - ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In agricultural grassland, high herbage utilisation efficiency (HEFF), which is the proportion of gross live-green herbage production that is utilised before entering senescence, is ensured by frequent defoliation. The decision upon which defoliation frequency to apply depends on the farming intensity. Assuming a reduced total herbage accumulation near trees in silvopastoral systems, frequent defoliations with high HEFF become less worthwhile-at least in specific spatial configurations. This makes an extensive management near trees an interesting option because it promotes other grassland-related ecosystem services such as biodiversity. The present study first analysed the interaction between defoliation frequency and position to trees on the total, dead and live herbage accumulation and the HEFF at two silvopastoral sites with short-rotation coppices in Germany. In addition, the total grassland-tree interface in Germany was assessed from land use and land cover maps of Germany based on satellite data to approximate the potential of grassland extensification near trees. The total herbage accumulation near trees declined by up to 41% but the HEFF was not affected by the position. Consequently, any intensification is not paid-off by adequate productivity and herbage quality in terms of HEFF and tree-related losses in herbage accumulation are expected up to a distance of 4.5-6 m. Applying a 4.5 m border on satellite data, we found that up to 4.4% (approximately 2200 km(2)) of the total grassland area in Germany is at a tree interface and potentially suitable for extensification. These findings indicate substantial potential for biodiversity conservation in grasslands with low trade-off for high-quality yield.

TI  - Climatic versus Anthropogenic Controls of Decadal Trends (1983-2017) in Algal Blooms in Lakes and Reservoirs across China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The proliferation of algal blooms (ABs) in lakes and reservoirs (L&Rs) poses a threat to water quality and the ecological health of aquatic communities. With global climate change, there is a concern that the frequency and geographical expansion of ABs in L&Rs could increase. China has experienced rapid economic growth and major land-use changes over the last several decades and therefore provides an excellent context for such an analysis. About 289,600 Landsat images were used to examine the spatiotemporal distribution of ABs in L&Rs (>1 km(2)) across China (1983-2017). Results showed significant changes in the temporal slope of the sum of normalized area (0.26), frequency (2.28), duration (6.14), and early outbreak (-3.48) of AB events in L&Rs across China. Specifically, AB-impacted water bodies expanded longitudinally, and the time range of AB observation has expanded starting in the 2000s. Spearman correlation and random forest regression analyses further indicated that, among climatic factors, wind speed and temperature contributed the most to AB expansion. Overall, anthropogenic forces have overridden the imprints of climatic factors on the temporal evolution of ABs in China's L&Rs and therefore could inform policy decisions for the management of these resources.

TI  - Visual impairment, severe visual impairment, and blindness in children in Britain (BCVIS2): a national observational study
T2  - LANCET CHILD & ADOLESCENT HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The WHO VISION 2020 global initiative against blindness, launched in 2000, prioritised childhood visual disability by aiming to end avoidable childhood blindness by 2020. However, progress has been hampered by the global paucity of epidemiological data concerning childhood visual disability. The British Childhood Visual Impairment and Blindness Study 2 (BCVIS2) was done to address this evidence gap.Methods BCVIS2 was a prospective UK-wide, cross-sectional, observational study to establish an inception cohort of children newly diagnosed with visual impairment. Opthalmologists and paediatricians reported cases from 89 hospitals and community centres across the UK. We included children aged 18 years or younger who were newly diagnosed with any condition causing impaired visual acuity to a level of 0.5 logMAR or worse (worse than 6/18 Snellen) in each eye, or equivalent vision as assessed by standard qualitative measures, between Oct 1, 2015, and Nov 1, 2016. Eligible children were notified simultaneously but independently by their managing ophthalmologists and paediatricians via the two national active surveillance schemes, the British Ophthalmological Surveillance Unit and the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit. Standardised detailed demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical data about detection, management, and treatment were collected at diagnosis and 1 year later. We calculated incidence estimates and relative rates by key sociodemographic factors. We did descriptive analyses of underlying ophthalmic disorders and non-ophthalmic comorbidities.Findings 61 (7%) of 845 eligible children initially notified were ineligible at follow-up because of improved vision after treatment. Thus, the study sample comprised 784 children with permanent newly-diagnosed all-cause visual impairment, severe visual impairment, or blindness. 559 (72%) of 778 children had clinically significant non-ophthalmic impairments or conditions. 28 (4%) of 784 children died within a year after diagnosis of visual disability (all had underlying systemic disorders). Incidence of visual disability in the first year of life was 5.19 per 10 000 children (95% CI 4.71-5.72), almost ten times higher than among 1-to-4-year-olds and between 20 times and 100 times higher than in the older age groups. The overall cumulative incidence (or lifetime risk) of visual impairment, severe visual impairment, or blindness was 10.03 per 10 000 children (9.35-10.76). Incidence rates were higher for those from any ethnic minority group, the lowest quintile of socioeconomic status, and those born preterm or with low birthweight. 345 (44%) of 784 children had a single affected anatomical site. Disorders of the brain and visual pathways affected 378 (48%) of 784 children.Interpretation BCVIS2 provides a contemporary snapshot of the heterogeneity, multi-morbidity, and vulnerability associated with childhood visual disability in a high-income country. These findings could facilitate developing and delivering health care and planning of interventional research. Our findings highlight the importance of including childhood visual disability as a sentinel event and metric in global child health initiatives. Copyright (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Data on distant metastasis and survival after locoregional recurrence following nipple-sparing mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Nipple-spring mastectomy (NSM) with immediate breast reconstruction is being increasingly used in the treatment of breast cancer [1]. However, there are limited available data on the prognostic implications of locoregional recurrence (LRR) following this surgical procedure. This article is a supplementary resource of the original research article by Wu ZY et al. entitled "Locoregional Recurrence Following Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy with Immediate Breast Reconstruction: Patterns and Prognostic Significance"[2] and presents data regarding the subsequent distant metastasis following the first LRR, as well as the prognoses for isolated local recurrences according to the site of recurrence after NSM and immediate breast reconstruction for primary breast cancer. Data from a total of 1,696 patients with primary breast cancer who underwent NSM with immediate reconstruction from March 2003 to December 2016 at the Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, were retrospectively reviewed. An LRR as the first event was found to have developed in 172 patients. Among these, 117 cases (6.9%) involved isolated local recurrence, including 52 cases (3.1%) of nipple-areola complex recurrence, 41 cases (2.4%) of skin/subcutaneous recurrence, and 24 cases (1.4%) of chest wall recurrence. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and the log-rank test were performed to compare the subgroups of local recurrence. In 172 patients with LRR, subsequent distant metastases were observed in 30 cases (17.4%). Our data may be helpful for conducting further in-depth investigations on salvage treatment options in patients with LRR following NSM and immediate breast reconstruction. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

TI  - New global aerosol fine-mode fraction data over land derived from MODIS satellite retrievals
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The space-borne measured fine-mode aerosol optical depth (fAOD) is a gross index of column-integrated anthropogenic particulate pollutants, especially over the populated land. The fAOD is the product of the AOD and the fine-mode fraction (FMF). While there exist numerous global AOD products derived from many different satellite sensors, there have been much fewer, if any, global FMF products with a quality good enough to understand their spatiotemporal variations. This is key to understanding the global distribution and spatiotemporal variations of air pollutants, as well as their impacts on global environmental and climate changes. Modifying our newly developed retrieval algorithm to the latest global-scale Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol product (Collection 6.1), a global 10-year FMF product is generated and analyzed here. We first validate the product through comparisons with the FMF derived from Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) measurements. Among our 169,313 samples, the satellite-derived FMFs agreed with the AERONET spectral deconvolution algorithm (SDA)retrieved FMFs with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.22. Analyzed using this new product are the global patterns and interannual and seasonal variations of the FMF over land. In general, the FMF is large (>0.80) over Mexico, Myanmar, Laos, southern China, and Africa and less than 0.5 in the Sahelian and Sudanian zones of northern Africa. Seasonally, higher FMF values occur in summer and autumn. The linear trend in the satellite-derived and AERONET FMFs for different countries was explored. The upward trend in the FMFs was particularly strong over Australia since 2008. This study provides a new global view of changes in FMFs using a new satellite product that could help improve our understanding of air pollution around the world. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - High-Resolution Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification by Merging Multilevel Features of Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid development of remote sensing technologies has yielded a large amount of high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) data. However, effectively extracting information from these large datasets is a significant challenge. In this study, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network was extended for HRRS image classification by establishing an integrated structure including three branches of a pruned DenseNet, a decoder, and an encoder (PDDE-Net). PDDE-Net initially combines deep-level features extracted from the pruned DenseNet with middle-level features extracted from the designed encoder. Subsequently, the designed decoder branch extracts the merged features to obtain more feature expressions. In addition, the earlystop strategy is used to prevent overfitting during the training process. Experiments performed on an aerial image dataset demonstrated that the proposed network can achieve favorable overall accuracy and Kappa values of 90% and 0.897, respectively. Further, under the condition of imbalanced data, two merging methods-concatenation and summation-were applied to test the sensitivity of the integrated PDDE-Net to the feature size. The results on the remote sensing image classification benchmark datasets revealed little difference between the two merging methods, both of which exhibited accuracies greater than 95%. Moreover, the integrated PDDE-Net was tested on hyperspectral remote sensing data, and it achieved a high classification accuracy comparable to those of other advanced methods, which also demonstrated the generalizability of the proposed model.

TI  - Did water-saving irrigation protect water resources over the past 40 years? A global analysis based on water accounting framework
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-saving technologies have long been seen as an effective method to reduce irrigation water use and alleviate regional water shortage. However, growing reports of more severe water shortage and increasing application of water-saving technologies across the world have necessitated reassessment of agricultural water-saving. This study develops a simple method based on satellite-based ET partitions to estimate water withdrawal, water consumption and return flow from the 1980s to 2010s, and quantifies water-savings across globe and four hot spot irrigated areas at both field and regional scales based on water accounting framework. The results show that global irrigation water flows keep increasing from the 1980s to 2010s, with over 50% increase from the expansion in irrigated lands. While water-saving technologies are found mainly applied in originally old irrigated lands, traditional flooding irrigation is still dominant in newly-developed irrigated lands. Non-beneficial water consumption (soil evaporation) is effectively reduced by water-saving technologies, but return flow has increased at the same time. At field scale, water-saving technologies fail to save water because the accumulated increased return flow is more than the accumulated decreased non-beneficial water consumption. At regional scale, however, water is saved because the return flow percolated to fresh aquifers is seen as beneficial rather than loss. At the same time, the accumulated increase of beneficial water consumption (crop transpiration) exceeds regional water savings, which explains the paradox between wide application of water-saving technologies and more severe regional water shortage. This study provides key new evidence for the paradox of irrigation efficiency and helps reconsidering water-saving technologies and their impacts on regional water resources.

TI  - Investigation of biological accumulation and eco-genotoxicity of bismuth oxide nanoparticle in fresh water snail <i>Lymnaea luteola</i>
T2  - JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Bismuth is one of the significant heavy metals widely used in agricultural industry. Freshwater snails are sentinel organism models for aquatic ecosystem pollution. In the present study, we designed to understand the mechanism of bismuth oxide nanoparticle (Bi(2)O(3)NPs) toxicity on Lymnaea luteola (L. luteola) by using different biomarkers. The LC50 - 96 h of Bi(2)O(3)NPs was found 72.6 mu g/ml for L. luteola and based on LC50 - 96 h of Bi(2)O(3)NPs three concentrations sub lethal I similar to 18.15 mu g/ml, sub lethal II similar to 36.30 mu g/ml, and sub lethal III similar to 48.4 mu g/ml were selected for further study. The snails were exposed to above sub lethal concentrations of NPs for 7 days and specimens were harvested at 1, 3 and 7 days for assessment oxidative stress, apoptosis and eco genotoxicity. In general, Bi(2)O(3)NPs showed significant (p 0.05, 0.01) ecotoxic effect on snails in both concentrations and time of exposure. The generation ROS were maximum at sublethal III at day 7. After exposure to sublethal concentrations of Bi(2)O(3)NPs for day 1, 3 and 7 significantly elevated malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) levels with simultaneous decline in glutathione (GSH) in pancreatic gland tissues of treated snails. Moreover, Bi(2)O(3)NPs elicited a significant percentage of apoptotic/necrotic heamocyte cells hemolymph of exposed snails. A parallel tendency was seen for the fragmentation of DNA as determined in terms of the percentage of tail DNA and olive tail moment in pancreatic gland tissue of exposed snails. This study highlights the toxic perturbation of Bi(2)O(3)NPs in water bodies and may be useful to monitor the application and disposal of NPs. (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Mapping paddy rice using Landsat time series data in the Ganfu Plain irrigation system, Southern China, from 1988-2017
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial pattern and temporal variation of paddy rice fields based on remote sensing have strong effects on the allocation of agricultural water resources on a regional scale. Free Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat) data have been successfully used to map paddy rice. However, due to frequent clouds and a temporal gap of 16 days, the shortage of Landsat data availability poses a great challenge to long-term paddy rice mapping. This study proposed a decision tree algorithm based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to map multi-season paddy rice in southern China. The study area is located in the Ganfu Plain Irrigation System (GFPIS), where double-cropping rice (early and late rice) and single-cropping rice (middle rice) are mixed. First, we explored the effects of the number and temporal distribution of Landsat images on the classification accuracy. With available cloud-free images in 2017, ten image combinations were set up to map rice fields using the proposed algorithm separately. Then, the algorithm was applied to map historical paddy rice planting in this study area. The results indicated that with a cropland mask, a single-date image in early rice growing season can map the total early rice with an overall accuracy varying from 82.02% to 93.26%, and the accuracy was mainly influenced by the temporal distribution of the images. In addition, through post-processing, multi-temporal images could be used to recognize early rice only, late rice only, double-cropping rice and middle rice with an overall accuracy ranging from 71.83% to 85.81%. In contrast, images in the early or late growing season without obvious vegetation characteristics may result in confusion. Two peak growing season images with obvious differences in the vegetation index played a key role in detecting different rice cropping types. In addition, when the EVI of rice was within a certain range, one or more images could achieve a similar overall accuracy. The total area of middle rice and late rice remained constant before 2001, but it changed from 10.72 x 10(4) ha in 2001 to 7.55 x 10(4) ha in 2017. Additionally, there was a twofold increase in the mapped middle rice area.

TI  - Optimizing the observation time for bare arable land to determine mean diurnal albedo in relation to roughness
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is assumed that the approximation of the albedo values of the Earth's surface components using satellite data obtained at the optimal time (T (o)) when these areas' albedo reach mean diurnal values (alpha (d)), rather than these instantaneous values, allows Earth's overall climate change to be modelled with greater accuracy. The T (o) values were investigated using examples of arable land areas in the 33 most extensive agricultural regions of the world, on given days of the year when the largest sections of these land areas become bare after major crops were planted under conventional tillage. This study is based on processed data obtained from nearly 900 soil reflectance spectra, representing 24 major soil groupings on 6 continents, assuming that these soils, which were either shaped by a plough (Pd) or smoothing harrow (Hs), were air-dried. It was found that in the morning the T (o), expressed in solar local time, was expected to be earlier for rough bare soil surfaces than smooth ones. In the afternoon this relationship was reversed. The differences in the T (o) values that resulted from the different surface roughness of the same soils (formed by Pd and Hs) were 5-10 minutes. Deviations of about 5-20 minutes from T (o) in the observations of the studied land areas generated errors of +/- 2% in the approximations of their alpha (d) values.

TI  - Assessment of the Effect of Urban Agriculture on Achieving a Localized Food System Centered on Chicago, IL Using Robust Optimization
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, nonrobust (average yield) and robust (varying yield) optimization techniques were applied to find the minimum radius required from the center of Chicago, Illinois, United States (U.S.) and land area by type to meet the population's nutritional needs given yield data for conventional and urban agricultural products. Twenty-eight nutrients were considered, and land type availability was defined using satellite data. No mix of food items were able to satisfy the vitamin D, vitamin B-12, and calcium needs within a radius up to 650 km. With vitamin D fortification, radii between 175 and 185 km (nonrobust) and 205 and 220 km (robust) were found across scenarios. The inclusion of urban agriculture reduced the radius by 10-15 km and increased the diversity of foods in the solution. When vitamin B-12 was supplemented, the radii could be reduced to 105-120 km (nonrobust) and 115-130 km (robust). This work demonstrates the need to include a full list of nutrients when evaluating the feasibility of localizing food systems. Key nutrient fortification or supplementation may significantly reduce the land area required to meet the nutritional needs of a population.

TI  - An assessment of the MOD17A2 gross primary production product in the Caatinga biome, Brazil
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Studying the dynamics of gross primary production (GPP) in seasonally dry tropical forests is of fundamental importance to understand the carbon dioxide (CO2) balance in this ecosystem, helping mitigate its potential impacts at the regional and global levels. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the accuracy of GPP estimated via remote sensing in the Caatinga biome. A set of observed data retrieved from micrometeorological towers equipped with eddy covariance systems were used to validate remote sensing data. The set was measured in a preserved Caatinga fragment. Remotely sensed GPP data was retrieved from the MOD17A2 version 6.0 product of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor onboard the Terra satellite. The validation of MOD17A2 GPP estimates was carried out through the comparison with micrometeorological data measured in situ. In the Caatinga site the comparison between the two GPP data types showed a moderate correlation with Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) = 0.65 and coefficient of determination (R (2)) = 0.43 and the product performed better in representing GPP in the Caatinga during the dry season. Results showed that although the MOD17A2 product represents the annual behaviour of GPP, the algorithm could be improved in order to provide GPP information that is more similar to surface measured data over these land covers.

TI  - Correlation between the dynamics and spatial configuration of the circumarctic latitudinal forest-tundra ecotone
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study uses the MOderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) data to investigate the relationship between the dynamics of the circumarctic latitudinal forest-tundra ecotones (FTEs) and its spatial configuration. This study also explores the extent to which the Google Earth Engine (GEE) can enable efficient, large-scale and multi-temporal examination of the circumarctic FTE. FTE dynamics is represented by latitudinal interface movement over the 2000 to 2015 period. To represent spatial configuration of the latitudinal FTEs, we propose a continuous measurement of fragmentation derived from window spectral analysis, which builds on the theory of FTE 'forms' - a discrete categorization of altitudinal FTEs primarily based on vegetation fragmentation. Additionally, continentality of the FTEs is calculated to investigate the impact of water variability. Statistical relationship between these variables are analysed in evenly divided longitudinal bands in the circumarctic region containing FTEs. More fragmented latitudinal FTEs are found to be more likely to shift northward in the study period, and FTEs in more continental areas are mostly more fragmented. These empirical results show that similar linkages exist between circumarctic latitudinal FTE fragmentation and dynamics to those found in altitudinal FTEs. This can potentially contribute to the optimization of future climate modelling as well as modelling of vegetation reactions to climate change. The GEE platform enables the examination of latitudinal FTEs through efficient circumarctic-scale vegetation data assimilation and processing, and the methodological framework allows for future incorporation of additional variables of interest into the analysis.

TI  - Modeling and Monitoring Wheat Crop Yield Using Geospatial Techniques: A Case Study of Potohar Region, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In countries like Pakistan, whose economy greatly depends on agriculture and predominantly crop production, the estimation of crop yield before harvesting is very important. Remote sensing allows early estimation of crop yield before harvesting. The objective of the study is to evaluate the possibility of MODIS-derived vegetation indices using GIS and RS to estimate pre-harvest wheat yield in the Potohar region, Pakistan. Two MODIS products MOD15A2H and MOD13A1 for the period 2009-2018 were used for the derivation of LAI and indices. Wheat yield data of each district for the study period were obtained from the agriculture statistics of Pakistan. Model was run using 16-days composite MODIS vegetation indices as independent variable and crop yield data as the dependent variable. To check the ability and accuracy of the model RMSE, MAE and MBE were calculated. Overall, the percentage average difference between the actual and predicted yield was within -1.986%. Average RMSE and MAE values ranged from 34.28 to 76.50 kg/ha and 108.09 to 129.99 kg/ha, respectively. The MBE value ranged from 7.20 to 62.80 kg/ha. The results concluded that accurate wheat yield predication can be made almost 2 months before harvesting using geospatial techniques along with the statistical modeling approach.

TI  - Automatic Impervious Surface Area Detection Using Image Texture Analysis and Neural Computing Models with Advanced Optimizers
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Up-to-date information regarding impervious surface is valuable for urban planning and management. The objective of this study is to develop neural computing models used for automatic impervious surface area detection at a regional scale. To achieve this task, advanced optimizers of adaptive moment estimation (Adam), a variation of Adam called Adamax, Nesterov-accelerated adaptive moment estimation (Nadam), Adam with decoupled weight decay (AdamW), and a new exponential moving average variant (AMSGrad) are used to train the artificial neural network models employed for impervious surface detection. These advanced optimizers are benchmarked with the conventional gradient descent with momentum (GDM). Remotely sensed images collected from Sentinel-2 satellite for the study area of Da Nang city (Vietnam) are used to construct and verify the proposed approach. Moreover, texture descriptors including statistical measurements of color channels and binary gradient contour are employed to extract useful features for the neural computing model-based pattern recognition. Experimental result supported by statistical test points out that the Nadam optimizer-based neural computing model has achieved the most desired predictive accuracy for the data collected in the studied region with classification accuracy rate of 97.331%, precision = 0.961, recall = 0.984, negative predictive value = 0.985, and F1 score = 0.972. Therefore, the model developed in this study can be a helpful tool for decision-makers in the task of urban land-use planning and management.

TI  - Global-scale changes in the area of atoll islands during the 21st century
T2  - ANTHROPOCENE
M3  - Article
AB  - The long-term persistence of atoll islands is under threat due to continued sea level rise driven by anthropogenic climate change. One widely discussed potential impact of sea level rise is the widespread, chronic erosion of atoll islands. Despite concerns of erosion driven by sea level rise, no published evidence exists of pervasive erosion of atoll islands at a global scale. Existing studies of atoll island change have been based on small, temporally sparse samples of islands on a limited number of atolls. As a result, the global response of atoll islands coincident with sea level rise remains uncertain. Using rich collections of Landsat imagery, this study analyses changes in land area on 221 atolls in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Results show that, between 2000 and 2017, the total land area on these atolls has increased by 61.74 km(2) (6.1 %) from 1007.60 km(2) to 1069.35 km(2). Most of the change in land area resulted from island building within the Maldives and on atolls in the South China Sea. Since 2000, the Maldives have added 37.50 km(2) of land area, while 16.57 km(2) of new islands have appeared within the South China Seas Spratly and Paracel chains. Understanding the extent of land area change at the global scale improves insights into the variation in responses, and how the manipulation of land is shaping the potential habitability trajectory for some atoll communities. Results highlight the anthropogenic imprint on the size of atoll islands, thereby providing a better understanding of variations in the future trajectories of human settlement and adaptation within atoll settings.

TI  - Assessment of retracked sea levels from Sentinel-3A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode altimetry over the marginal seas at Southeast Asia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the assessment of altimetric data from Sentinel-3A satellite operating in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mode for sea level research studies and applications over the largest archipelagos at Southeast Asia. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments are conducted by analysing the physical shapes of waveforms, comparing with quasi-independent geoidal height data and independent tide gauge measurements. The results identified the percentage of ocean like and non-ocean like waveforms are 91% and 9%, respectively. Off 9% of non-ocean like waveforms, the generic class is multi-peak (7%) followed by the quasi-specular waveforms (2%) observed near the coastline (< 10 km). Ocean like waveforms typically appear beyond 500 m from the coastline. When comparing with geoidal heights and tide gauge measurements, the performance of sea levels from several retrackers are assessed. The SAMOSA+ (SAR Altimetry Mode Studies and Applications) retracker outperforms other retrackers (i.e. sub-waveform and modified threshold retrackers with 30%, 20%, and 10%). That is, the standard deviation of differences against geoidal heights, and the temporal correlation against tide gauges are superior in most cases. In terms of root mean square error (RMSE), all retrackers are ranging with RMSE <= 20 cm in all cases. It can be concluded that in general, the SAMOSA+ retracked sea levels are accurate over the complicated regions at the Southeast Asia.

TI  - A Coupled Numerical Modeling Study of a Sea Fog Case After the Passage of Typhoon Muifa Over the Yellow Sea in 2011
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing data revealed a widespread sea fog event over the central/southern Yellow Sea (YS), following Typhoon Muifa passage in August 2011. Despite the importance of sea fog prediction for coastal safety, improving accuracy remains a challenging issue. By analyzing results from air-sea coupled and uncoupled simulations, this study aims to investigate how the air-sea coupling improves the sea fog formation and duration and examine atmospheric responses to spatiotemporally varying sea surface temperature (SST) over the YS. Unlike the uncoupled model, the SST simulated by the coupled model dramatically decreased and maintained its low temperature for more than a week after the typhoon passed over the YS, showing better agreement with the observations. The sharp SST decrease over the YS cools the air temperature at low-level atmosphere and enhances horizontal convergence in the moisture flux over the cooler ocean, which provides favorable conditions for sea fog formation. The long-lasting oceanic cooling stabilizes the atmospheric boundary layer and suppresses atmospheric vertical mixing, delaying the dissipation of sea fog for more than a week. This study highlights that air-sea coupling can improve the sea fog simulation by providing more realistic oceanic conditions.

TI  - Radiometric normalization of Landsat thermal imagery for detection of tundra land cover changes: experience from West Siberia
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The potentiality and specificity of using multitemporal stacks of thermal infrared (TIR) satellite scenes for modelling changes in tundra land cover and predicting geohazards in areas under development are studied using the example of two areas in northern West Siberia. The study aims at developing and testing a method for relative radiometric normalization of Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat) TIR images applied to estimate changes in land surface temperature (LST) in the tundra with regard to the high-latitude climate conditions. The suggested normalization method (RNUC) differs from other similar approaches in the use of unsupervised classification to determine pseudo-invariant features where master and slave images are spectrally identical. The error in LST contrasts is minimized iteratively by choosing the optimal number of land-cover classes and linear regression coefficients by cross-validation. The normalization procedure ensures error reduction by a factor of two to four, which is evidence of its high performance. The results of processing and analysis of 19 pairs of Landsat thermal images at the sites of the Marre-Sale and Urengoy oil and gas-condensate fields using the RNUC method showed that the relative error of LST contrast normalization could be in the range of approximately 3% to 10%. Based on the time series of normalized values of LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) of sites with pyrogenic damage in the area of the Urengoy oil and gas-condensate field, it is shown that the process of stabilization of the tundra cover is characterized by a negative correlation of these parameters and lasts 25 to 28 years. A positive correlation between LST and NDVI characterizes a different type of landscape transformation; in particular, it may be an increase in the thickness of secondary vegetation cover or a change in the hydrological conditions.

TI  - Tropospheric Ozone Variability Over Hong Kong Based on Recent 20 years (2000-2019) Ozonesonde Observation
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent 20 years (2000-2019) ozonesonde profiles recorded at the Hong Kong Observatory are analyzed to study the Tropospheric Ozone (TropO(3)) variability over Hong Kong, South China. The TropO(3) profiles are described without the constraints of traditional monthly averages; they are clustered based on a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) to explore the short-term variability, and separated into two 10-year periods to investigate the long-term variability based on pooled statistical analysis. The roles of precursor emissions, dynamic transport, and photochemical formation in multiple-timescale TropO(3) variability are further evaluated with the aid of meteorological and satellite data, surface observation, emission inventory, and backward trajectory analysis. The results suggest that TropO(3) over Hong Kong has a seasonal and vertical distribution featuring a widely recognized spring maximum. The SOM-based clustering analysis emphasizes a strong dependence of short-term variability in TropO(3) profile patterns on cross-latitude transport conditions, including rich-O-3 transport from midlatitude region and poor-O-3 transport from tropics. However, high O-3 levels throughout the troposphere (usually in early spring) are largely due to the combination of stratospheric intrusion and biomass burning. During the whole study period, the O-3 concentrations have increased substantially in the lower troposphere. Springtime wildfire-related emissions over the upwind Indochina Peninsula are responsible for the lower free-tropospheric O-3 increases. In contrast, the boundary-layer O-3 uptrends with a larger increasing rate near the surface are mostly attributed to the reduced NO titration effect due to the sharp reduction of NOx emissions.

TI  - A date pit induced aorto-oesophageal fistula: a case report and concise literature review
T2  - OXFORD MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Review
AB  - Aorto-oesophageal fistula (AEF) is rare and fatal without intervention. Having consumed a date pit 2 weeks prior, the patient in this case presented with the 'Chiari' triad of chest pain, sentinel arterial upper gastro-intestinal haemorrhage and exsanguination after an asymptomatic interval. Following resuscitation, the patient was managed with a Blakemore tube with both oesophageal and gastric balloons inflated to systemic pressures. An aortic stent graft was planned but the patient died on the operating table. AEFs can be treated surgically with either open or endovascular repair. Open repair is highly risky and involves combined replacement/bypass of the thoracic aorta along with resection/repair of the involved oesophagus. Endovascular repair can prevent fatal exsanguination and increase the likelihood of survival but is associated with a significant rate of secondary infection, recurrence of fistula, mediastinitis and sepsis. Further studies are required to inform on management.

TI  - Spatio-temporal variation of oasis landscape pattern in arid area: Human or natural driving?
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The eco-environment of the arid area is constantly fragile global-wide. The study on the spatial and temporal variation of its landscape pattern can quickly identify the driving factors, which is an effective analysis method of ecological conservation in the arid area. In this study, Jinghe County, Xinjiang, in Northwestern China, is chosen as a case study of understanding the major driving force of the oasis landscape. Landsat satellite images of 1994, 2007, and 2017 are used as the basic data sources for analysis. The moving window method, transition matrix, and factor analysis are selected as the main technical means for this paper to reveal the temporal and spatial variation of landscape pattern in Jinghe County, and to quantitatively describe its driving factors. The results of the analysis show that: (1) The landscape pattern of Jinghe County has changed dramatically, especially the construction land and farmland. Both show an increase of 351.29% and 269.01% respectively between 1994 and 2017. Farmland increased the most, with the proportion of 6.45% in Jinghe County, and expanded along with the ?triangle? three sides. The area of forest land increased slightly, the area of grassland and unused land decreased, and the area of water did not change significantly. (2) The dominant obvious regional differences of landscape types in Jinghe County are mainly manifested in farmland and forest land. Taking the unused land as the boundary, the biodiversity of farmland decreased, and the aggregation degree deepened, while the fragmentation degree of forest land increased. (3) The spatial?temporal variation of landscape patterns in Jinghe County is the result of the combination of natural and human factors, but the correlation between human factors and the change of landscape area is significantly greater than that of natural factors. Thus, human factors are the main driving force of landscape pattern change in Jinghe County. The scientific management and planning of the intensity of human activities in Jinghe County should be the focus of ecological environment restoration and protection.

TI  - Co-seismic landslide mapping using Sentinel-2 10-m fused NIR narrow, red-edge, and SWIR bands
T2  - LANDSLIDES
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate and timely inventory for major landslides triggered by seismic events is essential for hazard assessment and risk governance. Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) data have been increasingly used for co-seismic landslide mapping in recent years. However, there have been few studies exploring the full use of Sentinel-2 near infrared (NIR) narrow, red-edge, and short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands for landslide mapping. In this study, Sentinel-2 10-m fused NIR narrow, red-edge-1, SWIR-1, and SWIR-2 bands were incorporated into the change detection-based Markov random field (CDMRF) that considers the spectral, spatial, and contextual information of landslides. The effectiveness of the developed method was proved in mapping co-seismic landslides triggered by two major earthquakes in the Yarlung Tsangpo Grand Canyon, China, in 2017 and Hokkaido, Japan, in 2018. The results demonstrated that the mapping performances with the fused Sentinel-2 bands were significantly improved for both seismic events. Such improvement is mainly attributed to the more abundant spectral information provided by the fused Sentinel-2 red-edge, NIR narrow, and SWIR bands. The novelties of this study are (1) the preliminary attempt to use the Sentinel-2 10-m fused bands for landslide mapping, and (2) the synergy of Sentinel-2 red-edge, NIR narrow, and SWIR bands for more reliable landslide mapping.

TI  - A Database of Laboratory Analogue Models of Caldera Collapse Testing the Role of Inherited Structures
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Since caldera collapse deformation is extremely difficult to study in real time - due to the high deformation rates that characterize this process and the difficult access to the caldera structures-analogue modeling has been widely used during past decades to integrate field data and, more recently, remote-sensing data (e.g., InSAR). However, the relationships between caldera collapse and inherited discontinuities, such as inherited crustal faults, remain poorly investigated. We therefore provide a new dataset of analogue models that aims to specifically address this issue and that can be potentially compared with literature and natural case studies worldwide. We present a dataset of 13 analogue models of caldera collapse investigating the interactions between caldera collapse processes and inherited crustal discontinuities. The dataset is composed of raw data and elaborations that can be used to qualitatively visualize and/or quantitatively analyze model deformation through the use of top-view photos, digital elevation models (DEM) and digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV).

TI  - Small, sparse, but substantial: techniques for segmenting small agricultural fields using sparse ground data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent thrust on digital agriculture (DA) has renewed significant research interest in the automated delineation of agricultural fields. Most prior work addressing this problem has focused on detecting medium to large fields, while there is strong evidence that around 40% of the fields worldwide and 70% of the fields in Asia and Africa are small. The lack of adequate labelled images for small fields, huge variations in their colour, texture, and shape, and faint boundary lines separating them make it difficult to develop an end-to-end learning model for detecting such fields. Hence, in this paper, we present a multi-stage approach that uses a combination of machine learning and image processing techniques. In the first stage, we leverage state-of-the-art edge-detection algorithms such as holistically nested edge detection (HED) to extract first-level contours and polygons. In the second stage, we propose image-processing techniques to identify polygons that are non-fields, over-segmentations, or noise and eliminate them. The next stage tackles under-segmentations using a combination of a novel 'cut-point' based technique and localized second-level edge detection to obtain individual parcels. Since a few small, non-cropped but vegetated or constructed pockets can be interspersed in areas that are predominantly croplands, in the final stage, we train a classifier for identifying each parcel from the previous stage as an agricultural field or not. In an evaluation using high-resolution 1.19 m imagery sourced from DigitalGlobe, we show that our approach has a high F-Score of 0.84 in areas with large fields and reasonable accuracy with an F-Score of 0.73 in areas with small fields, which is encouraging. We also apply our techniques without any additional specialized processing to coarser resolution open satellite imagery and find the approach to be reasonable for delineating large fields with such imagery.

TI  - Continuous Multitrack Assimilation of Sentinel-1 Precipitable Water Vapor Maps for Numerical Weather Prediction: How Far Can We Go With Current InSAR Data?
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study assesses the viability of including water vapor data from Interferometry Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) in the initialization of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, using already available Sentinel-1 A and B products. Despite the limitations resulting from the 6-day return period of images produced by the 2-satellite system, it is found that for a sufficiently large domain designed to contain a set of images every 12 h (at varying locations), the impact on model performance is beneficial or at least neutral. The proposed methodology is tested in 24 consecutive 12 h forecasts, covering two cycles of the Sentinel-1 system and 214 images, for a domain containing Iberia. A statistical analysis of the forecast precipitable water vapor (PWV) against independent GNSS observations concluded for relevant improvements in the different scores, especially during a consecutive 3-day period where the standard initial data were less accurate. An analysis of the rain forecasts against gridded remote sensing observations further indicates an overall improvement in the grid-point distribution of different precipitation classes throughout the simulation, even when the mean impact of PWV assimilation was not significant. It is suggested that current InSAR data are already a useful source of NWP data and will only become more relevant as new systems are put into operation.

TI  - Impact of physical process on propagating oil spills in the Caspian Sea
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to inspect the oil spill propagation in the Caspian Sea using Sentinel-1 data as well as wind and observation data. Detection processes clearly show that although the north and middle basin are the main sources of oil pollution, the southern basin would be the final destination of these oil slicks. Comparison of oil spill clusters in the southern and on the Apsheron indicates that the size of these clusters decreases under the physical process of the southern basin like eddies. Further, the mixed layer is estimated at 25-35 m in the southern basin. After applying the analytical formulas, the eddy diffusivity profile is plotted, leading to an estimate of nearly 5 x 10(-4) m(2)/s on the surface water. The droplet oil diameters are calculated which vary from 150 mu m to 250 mu m based on an analytical model in a steady-state mode.

TI  - Microplastics in Sea Turtles, Marine Mammals and Humans: A One Environmental Health Perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Microplastics are ubiquitous pollutants in the marine environment and a health concern. They are generated directly for commercial purposes or indirectly from the breakdown of larger plastics. Examining a toxicological profile for microplastics is a challenge due to their large variety of physico-chemical properties and toxicological behavior. In addition to their concentration, other parameters such as polymer type, size, shape and color are important to consider in their potential toxicity. Microplastics can adsorb pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) or metals on their surface and are likely to contain plastic additives that add to their toxicity. The observations of microplastics in seafood increased concern for potential human exposure. Since literature considering microplastics in humans is scarce, using a One Environmental Health approach can help better inform about potential human exposures. Marine mammals and sea turtles are long-lived sentinel species regularly used for biomonitoring the health status of the ocean and share trophic chain and habitat with humans. This review considers the available research regarding microplastic and plastic fiber exposures in humans, marine mammals and turtles. Overall, across the literature, the concentration of microplastics, size, color, shape and polymer types found in GI tract and feces from sea turtles, marine mammals and humans are similar, showing that they might be exposed to the same microplastics profile. Additionally, even if ingestion is a major route of exposure due to contaminated food and water, dermal and inhalation studies in humans have provided data showing that these exposures are also health concerns and more effort on these routes of exposures is needed. In vitro studies looked at a variety of endpoints showing that microplastics can induce immune response, oxidative stress, cytotoxicity, alter membrane integrity and cause differential expression of genes. However, these studies only considered three polymer types and short-term exposures, whereas, due to physiological relevance, prolonged exposures might be more informative.

TI  - Assessing the Influence of COVID-19 on the Shortwave Radiative Fluxes Over the East Asian Marginal Seas
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to a widespread reduction in aerosol emissions. Using satellite observations and climate model simulations, we study the underlying mechanisms of the large decreases in solar clear-sky reflection (3.8 W m(-2) or 7%) and aerosol optical depth (0.16 W m(-2) or 32%) observed over the East Asian Marginal Seas in March 2020. By separating the impacts from meteorology and emissions in the model simulations, we find that about one-third of the clear-sky anomalies can be attributed to pandemic-related emission reductions, and the rest to weather variability and long-term emission trends. The model is skillful at reproducing the observed interannual variations in solar all-sky reflection, but no COVID-19 signal is discerned. The current observational and modeling capabilities will be critical for monitoring, understanding, and predicting the radiative forcing and climate impacts of the ongoing crisis.Plain Language Summary Satellite data showed large reductions in reflected sunlight and aerosol optical depth over clear (cloudless) sky off the East Asian coast in March 2020. Although these changes are consistent with a sharp cut in aerosol emissions due to the lockdown put in place to curb the spread of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), one cannot rule out possible roles played by weather conditions such as winds and humidity. We use a climate model forced with past known weather to isolate the latter factor, and to describe the difference from the observation to the former. The main finding is that the pandemic-related emission reductions are responsible for about one-third of the observed signal. The model can largely reproduce the year-to-year variations in all-sky reflection, but no influence of COVID-19 is detected.

TI  - Nonlinear Modeling of Subsidence From a Decade of InSAR Time Series
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a model of ground subsidence due to soil consolidation within coastal reclaimed land constructed in early 2001, in Busan, South Korea. We estimate 42 cm of maximum subsidence during the period of interferometric synthetic aperture radar observations, and a maximum of 1 m or more subsidence, since the end of the construction phase of the reclamation project. A hyperbolic model was used to relate the three independent time series and to estimate the nonlinear behavior of subsidence. The model estimates a maximum subsidence rate and acceleration of -5.7 cm/year and 1.1 cm/year(2), respectively. The decomposition of vertical and east-west horizontal motion using the Sentinel-1 dataset indicates relatively weak partial horizontal displacement as well as substantial vertical deformation overall. The long-term time series analysis indicates ongoing ground subsidence, although almost two decades have passed since the completion of reclamation.Plain Language Summary Ground subsidence is a process that may threaten human lives and property, and it often occurs owing to the compaction of alluvial sediments as a result of groundwater extraction or soil consolidation. In particular, coastal reclaimed land composed of soft materials such as sand or soil, rather than massive rock, is vulnerable to subsidence. We used three data sets comprising interferometric radar images from two satellites to monitor ground subsidence over time in Busan, South Korea, from 2007 to 2019. We noted not only vertical surface displacement in the overall area, which was expected, but also local displacement in the horizontal direction in specific areas. A hyperbolic model was used to estimate the vertical movement over time due to subsidence, instead of a constant subsidence model. The model results indicate ongoing ground subsidence in the study area, although almost 20 years have passed since the completion of reclamation.

TI  - Global maps of Forel-Ule index, hue angle and Secchi disk depth derived from 21 years of monthly ESA Ocean Colour Climate Change Initiative data
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - We document the development and public release of a new dataset (1997-2018), consisting of global maps of the Forel-Ule index, hue angle and Secchi disk depth. Source data come from the European Space Agency (ESA) Ocean Colour (OC) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), which is providing merged multi-sensor data from the mid-resolution sensors in operation at a specific time from 1997 to the present day. Multi-sensor satellite datasets are advantageous tools for ecological studies because they increase the probabilities of cloud-free data over a given region as data from multiple satellites whose overpass times differ by a few hours are combined. Moreover, data-merging from heritage and present satellites can expand the duration of the time series indefinitely, which allows the calculation of significant trends. Additionally, data are remapped consistently and analysis-ready for scientists. Also, the products described in this article have the exclusive advantage of being linkable to in situ historic observations and thus enabling the construction of very long time series. Monthly data are presented at a spatial resolution of similar to 4km at the Equator and are available at PANGAEA (https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.904266; Pitarch et al., 2019a). Two smaller and easier-to-handle test datasets have been produced from the former: a global dataset at 1 degrees spatial resolution and another one for the North Atlantic at 0.25 degrees resolution. The computer code for the generation of the Forel-Ule index, hue angle and Secchi disk depth from a given remote-sensing reflectance is also shared at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4439646 (Pitarch et al., 2021) and can be easily set in loop mode for batch calculations.

TI  - Estimates of lava discharge rate of 2018 Kilauea Volcano, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai eruption using multi-sensor satellite and laboratory measurements
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2018 lower East Rift Zone eruption (LERZ) at Kilauea Volcano, HawaiModified Letter Turned Commai, was the largest event of the last 200 years at the LERZ. Here, we present a lava discharge rate estimation of this eruption by combining a joint analysis of multi-sensor infrared (IR) satellite remote sensing imagery of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) with laboratory measurements of lava properties. The time-averaged discharge rate (TADR) based estimation of the erupted lava volume resulted in circa 9.24 x 10(8) +/- 4.62 x 10(8) m(3) for the subaerial part of the 2018 LERZ eruption. The lava effusion at the LERZ began on 3 May 2018, with relatively low mean output rates of 2.82 +/- 1.41 m(3) s(-1), which then almost doubled after 12 May to 4.94 +/- 2.47 m(3) s(-1), increased after 19 May to 64.97 +/- 32.48 m(3) s(-1) and from 28 May onwards until beginning of August 2018 up to 137.67 +/- 68.83 m(3) s(-1).

TI  - PolInSAR decorrelation-based decomposition modelling of spaceborne multifrequency SAR data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The characterization of ground targets from a remotely sensed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image is addressed by polarimetric decomposition. The polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) decomposition measures the contribution of total backscatter from different scattering mechanisms using SAR images. The ambiguities present in the retrieval of scattering are the major problems associated with the model-based decomposition which could be reduced with a combination of interferometric coherence and PolSAR backscatter. The objective of this study is to improve the polarimetric decomposition model for identifying the scattering mechanisms based on the Polarimetric SAR Interferometry (PolInSAR) coherence for natural and manmade features. In this paper, we have proposed a model-based polarimetric decomposition using PolInSAR decorrelation. The PolInSAR decorrelation is exploited here to distinguish the time-varying and invariant scatterers present in the ground. The volume scattering power was calculated using the proposed decorrelation parameter which is the combination of PolInSAR coherence and decorrelation. The proposed algorithm has been tested on spaceborne multifrequency SAR datasets consisting of X-band TerraSAR-X and TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-X), C-band Radarsat-2, and phased array L-band synthetic aperture radar-2 (PALSAR-2) data of advanced land observing satellite-2 (ALOS-2) PolInSAR data for the Dehradun region, India. The results show that there is a remarkable reduction in the ambiguities present in the identification of the scattering mechanism from the SAR image by using the proposed decorrelation-based decomposition model. Moreover, the algorithm is tested on X-band TerraSAR-X and TanDEM-X data of the Haridwar area and Rudrapur area, Uttarakhand, India to analyse the potential of the proposed decomposition technique in representing different manmade and natural features.

TI  - Qualitative Precipitation Estimation from Satellite Data Based on Distributed Domain-Specific Architecture
T2  - MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the qualitative precipitation estimation (QPE) based on data from the Himawari satellite and distributed-domain specific architecture. The QPE process consists of receiving and managing the raw data from the satellite every 10 minutes and calculating the rain-temperature relationship. The aim of this research is to decrease the QPE processing time by using distributed domain-specific architecture (DDSA), with 9 small computing boards are connected to a gigabit switch. Instead of using a high-performance PC, this distributed embedded system is also suitable for processing interval data receiving from the satellite every 10 minutes. The experimental results show that the proposed fast-satellite data processing algorithm is optimal for QPE processing on the DDSA platform, requiring 115.53 seconds processing time and low power consumption.

TI  - Integrating a Forward Feature Selection algorithm, Random Forest, and Cellular Automata to extrapolate urban growth in the Tehran-Karaj Region of Iran
T2  - COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper couples a Forward Feature Selection algorithm with Random Forest (FFS-RF) to create a transition index map, which then guides the spatial allocation for the extrapolation of urban growth using a Cellular Automata model. We used Landsat imagery to generate land cover maps at the years 1998, 2008, and 2018 for the Tehran-Karaj Region (TKR) in Iran. The FFS-RF considered the independent variables of slope, altitude, and distances from urban, crop, greenery, barren, and roads. The FFS-RF revealed temporal non-stationary of drivers from 1998-2008 to 2008-2018. The FFS-RF detected that altitude and distance from greenery were the most important drivers of urban growth during 1998-2008, then distances from crop and barren were the most important drivers during 2008-2018. We used the Total Operating Characteristic to evaluate the transition index maps. Validation during 2008-2018 showed that FFS-RF produced a transition index map that had predictive power no better than an allocation of urban growth near existing urban. Simulation to 2060 extrapolated that Tehran, Karaj, and their adjacent cities will interconnect spatially to form a gigantic city-region.

TI  - A burned area mapping method for the FY-3D MERSI based on the single-temporal L1 data and multi-temporal daily active fire products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire occurs throughout the world, resulting in global ecology, society, and economic impacts. Burned areas are important for fire monitoring. In order to develop the capability of the Fengyun (FY) satellite to detect burned areas, a burned area mapping method based on the Fengyun-3D satellite (FY-3D) Medium Resolution Spectral Imager (MERSI) L1 data and daily active fire products is presented in this paper. Referring to other methods based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), active fires based on daily active fire products are selected and clustered as burned samples. Two indices are used as spectral features of burned areas based on the single temporal FY-3D MERSI 250-m post-fire data. By taking advantage of spatial and spectral features for land cover in each burned cluster, burned samples are extended to identify burned areas by a region growing algorithm. The method is applied in two study areas and the result is compared with the Collection 6 MODIS burned area products (MCD64A1) based on the reference values obtained by the human-machine interface for validation. The results show that this method has a relatively high correspondence with the reference values, and its accuracy is higher than that of the MCD64A1. Certainly, this method inevitably has some limitations. But overall, the method can be used to extract burned areas by using the FY-3D MERSI data quickly and precisely, especially over large areas.

TI  - Semi-automated Workflow for Mapping the Extent and Elevation Profile of Intertidal Zone of Parts of Gulf of Kutch, India, Using Landsat Time Series Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mapping the topography of intertidal zones through in situ methods has many challenges associated with it and airborne techniques for determining the elevation profile are expensive. High temporal and spatial coverage provided by satellite remote sensing makes it highly efficient in assessing the extent and profile of intertidal zone even in remote and inaccessible areas. In this study, a semi-automated and scalable methodology is presented for generating the digital elevation model of the intertidal zone of Gulf of Kutch, India, thus bridging the existing gaps between terrestrial and marine elevation datasets. Time series multispectral data from the Landsat series are explored in the tidal height realm, and a median composting approach is used with NDWI and subsequent thresholding to effectively determine the extent of the intertidal zone. The median composite is used to handle the presence of noise or artefacts, thus ensuring the use of high-quality data and eradicating the problems associated with single-scene approaches previously used for such analysis. Using the capabilities of cloud-based computing platforms and openly accessible satellite data, this study aims to map the extent and 3D distribution of intertidal flats in a hostile coastal environment.

TI  - Quantitative assessment of grassland foliar moisture parameters as an inference on rangeland condition in the mesic rangelands of southern Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding Grass Water Content (GWC) is critical in assessing rangelands health as well as utilization rates and patterns. Spatial explicit information on grassland ecology, particularly in southern Africa remains rudimentary due to the lack of affordable data primary sources and robust user-friendly data processing algorithms. These are required to enable efficient and routine monitoring and assessment of GWC to inform policy and management. The Sentinel 2 Multispectral Instrument (MSI) in conjunction with environmental variables acquired at moderately high resolution, provide an attractive primary data source for determining grassland water content at landscape scale. This study, therefore, evaluated the utility of Sentinel 2 MSI data (e.g. Red-Edge (RE) and the Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) bands and environmental variables) in estimating GWC, herein referred to as Canopy Water Content (CWC), Dry Moisture Content (DMC), Canopy Storage Capacity (CSC), and Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) in the Mesic rangelands of southern Africa. The results illustrated that both the RE and SWIR bands were critical in characterizing GWC variables in rangelands. Further, the best models for estimating CWC, DMC, CSC and LMFC yielded a relative root-mean-square error (rRMSE) of 20.8%, 19.5%, 9.3% and 18.5%, respectively. The most optimal variables for characterizing these plant selected variables included RE and SWIR bands centred at 740 nm (B6), 783 nm (B7), 1610 nm (B11) and 2190 nm (B12) as well as their derivatives in concert with environmental variables such as Topographic Wetness Index, maximum curvature and aspect. These findings are critical towards developing a robust, efficient and spatially explicit monitoring framework for southern African rangelands.

TI  - An assessment of snow-glacier melt runoff under climate change scenarios in the Himalayan basin
T2  - STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a coupled and improved snow-glacier runoff modeling framework has been presented, which aims to separate the snowmelt runoff from glaciated and non-glaciated areas. To fulfil the above objective, the two hydrological models such as the conceptual Glacier-hydrological Model (GSM-SOCONT) and Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) have been used over the Teesta river Himalayan catchments. The temperature index model (TIM) based degree-day approach (DDA) in GSM-SOCONT model has been modified and radiation components were added. The R-2 values computed between observed and modeled discharge (1991-2005) was improved from 0.55 to 0.63 after adding the radiation components. Initially, SWAT model has been used for the simulation, calibration, and optimization of the various snowmelt hydrology parameters. Then, SWAT model based optimized parameters and outcomes were used as inputs to set up the GSM-SOCONT model. After simulating/separating snow melts from glaciated and non-glaciated areas, the optimized snow-glacier parameters from the improved GSM-SOCONT (1991-2005) were re-input to the SWAT for the projection of snowmelt scenarios (2008-2100) utilizing the downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) Global Circulation Models (GCMs) datasets. The snow water equivalent (SWE) reconstructed for the year 2005 from the MODIS satellite snow covers (i.e. ranges from 80 to 138 mm) found comparable to the SWAT generated SWE (i.e. ranges from 86 to 115 mm). Based on the future projections of snowmelt, the earlier snow-melting or shifts have been observed in extreme high and low elevation areas of the Sikkim Himalaya.

TI  - A High Resolution, Three-Dimensional View of the D-28 Calving Event From Amery Ice Shelf With ICESat-2 and Satellite Imagery
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tabular calving events occur from Antarctica's large ice shelves only every few decades, and are preceded by rift propagation. We used high-resolution imagery and ICESat-2 data to determine the propagation rates for the three active rifts on Amery Ice Shelf (AIS; T1, T2, and E3) and observe the calving of D-28 on September 25, 2019 along T1. AIS front advance accelerated downstream of T1 in the years before calving, possibly increasing stress at the rift tip. T1 experienced significant acceleration for 12 days before calving, coinciding with a jump in propagation of E3. ICESat-2's high resolution and repeat acquisitions every 91 days allowed for analysis of the ice front before and after calving, and rift detection where it was not visible in imagery as a similar to 1 m surface depression, suggesting that it propagates as a basal fracture. Our results show that ICESat-2 can provide process-scale information about iceberg calving.

TI  - Long-term remote sensing of total suspended matter using Landsat series sensors in Hulun Lake, China
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The water clarity of many inland water bodies in the Inner Mongolian Plateau of China is under threat due to intensifying land use pressures and climate variability. Total suspended matter (TSM), one of the main factors determining water clarity, is a parameter that can be remotely derived. Two data-gathering expeditions were conducted in Hulun Lake, the largest inland lake of this plateau, in 2013 and 2015. Based on the in situ TSM data, we evaluated commonly used TSM algorithms that can be applied to Landsat images. The algorithm using the single near infrared (NIR) band had the best performance. Time series of TSM maps of Hulun Lake from 1986 to 2017 were obtained applying this algorithm to 258 cloudless Landsat images and the relationship of TSM to water level, water area, precipitation, and wind speed were analysed. We found that annual mean TSM was negatively correlated with water level and water area, with R (2) of 0.46 and 0.60, respectively; TSM was positively correlated with precipitation and wind speed, with R (2) of 0.32 and 0.34, respectively.

TI  - Estimating winter wheat yield by assimilation of remote sensing data with a four-dimensional variation algorithm considering anisotropic background error and time window
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - To further improve the yield estimation accuracy of regional winter wheat, based on En4DVar algorithm, an anisotropic background error and time window four-dimensional variation (ABT-4DVar) algorithm was constructed by introducing a variation time window. Based on a comparison with the simulated crop yield without data assimilation at a single point scale and in a typical test area, the effectiveness and feasibility of the constructed ABT-4DVar algorithm were effectively verified. On this basis, using the official statistics as verification data, the ABT-4DVar algorithm was applied to a winter wheat yield estimation system by assimilating remotely sensed LAI into the WOFOST (WOrld FOod STudies) crop growth model at a regional scale. The yield estimation results of winter wheat in Hengshui city showed that the RE between the average estimated yield and official statistics was 3.18%, and the REs between the average estimated yields and the official statistics of the 11 counties were all within 14.80%. The yield estimation results of winter wheat in Hengshui city indicated that the ABT-4DVar algorithm had good performance in regional yield estimation and that the assimilation algorithm could provide technology for crop growth evaluation and yield simulation.

TI  - A novel approach of evaluating favorable areas for shale gas exploration based on regional geological survey and remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF NATURAL GAS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The periphery of the Huangling Massif is one of the principal prospecting regions of the Lower Cambrian shale gas resources in South China. The geological setting and ground surface conditions are complicated within this area, and the petroleum geological data is limited due to the low degree of exploration. A novel approach based on the regional geological survey and remote sensing data was proposed. The favorable areas for gas exploration targeting the Lower Cambrian Niutitang Shale within the periphery of the Huangling Massif were evaluated by using this approach. Seven key indicators, including the depositional facies and current burial state of the shale strata, density of the exposed faults, dip angle of exposed strata, elevation and slope of the current ground surface, and land utilization, were selected. An evaluation criterion of these indicators was established to facilitate the classification of the study area into four ratings: favorable, low-risk, high-risk, and unfavorable. The overall evaluation of the seven indicators suggested a favorable area of 386.02 km(2), a low-risk area of 1784.81 km(2), and a high-risk area of 1689.97 km(2), accounting for 0.91%, 4.21%, and 3.99% of the whole area, respectively. These results achieved a high level of compliance with the actual exploration discoveries and eliminated over 90% of the total area unsuitable for exploration and production. It is demonstrated that this novel approach can be effectively adopted in the comprehensive evaluation of the favorable area for shale gas exploration with a low degree of prospecting.

TI  - Assessing urbanization's contribution to warming in mainland China using satellite-estimated air temperature data
T2  - PROGRESS IN PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY-EARTH AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The global surface air temperature (Ta) has increased significantly in the past several decades. However, it remains disputable how much effect rapid urbanization has had on warming trends in mainland China. In this study, a gridded Ta dataset was created using satellite data. Then, a series of satellite-based methods to evaluate the contribution of urbanization to warming were developed. Subsequently, the contribution of urbanization to warming during 2001-2018 was estimated. The national average Ta was found to have increased significantly (0.23 degrees C/decade) in mainland China. At the national scale, the contribution of urbanization to warming was negligible (less than 1%) since built-up areas account for only approximately 2.66% of the area of China. At the regional scale, the contribution of urbanization was also small in most areas and was even negative in some areas. At the local scale, the contributions of urbanization to warming were 53.18%, 54.30% and 47.25% for the mean, maximum and minimum Ta, respectively, averaged for 31 major cities. This study demonstrated that the contribution of urbanization to warming was significant at the local scale, while the contribution of urbanization to large-scale warming was limited. The contribution of urbanization was underestimated at the local scale but overestimated at the national and regional scales by many previous studies due to the sparse and uneven distribution of meteorological stations.

TI  - Laboratory and field studies supporting augmentation biological control of oriental fruit moth, <i>Grapholita molesta</i> (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), using <i>Trichogramma dendrolimi</i> (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)
T2  - PEST MANAGEMENT SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND Oriental fruit moth, Grapholita molesta (Busck) (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) is a cosmopolitan pests of fruit trees in temperate regions. Control of G. molesta is challenging because larvae feed in concealed locations and have evolved resistance to many pesticides. We compared three commercially available species of Trichogramma for efficacy against G. molesta in the laboratory assays and tested releases of the promising species in a pear orchard.RESULTS Laboratory assays indicated that Trichogramma dendrolimi parasitized G. molesta at the highest rate. Parasitoids took longer to oviposit in older host eggs, and fewer eggs were parasitized when they were more than 3 days old. Field tests produced ca 60% cumulative parasitism of sentinel G. molesta eggs with one release of Trichogramma dendrolimi, with most parasitism occurring within 24 h. Female wasps dispersed up to 12 m from release points with a bias toward upwind movement.CONCLUSION We calculated that, for each generation of G. molesta, 900 000 wasps per hectare, in three releases 3 days apart, each distributed among release points 10 m apart, would reduce fruit damage by half in an orchard where 50% of fruit would otherwise be damaged. Although augmentation of Trichogramma dendrolimi is a viable tactic for reducing G. molesta populations and fruit damage, it will require integration with other compatible control tactics in order to provide commercially acceptable levels of control in orchards experiencing significant pest pressure.

TI  - Protecting the patches from the footprints: examining the land use factors associated with forest patches in Atewa range forest reserve
T2  - BMC ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundLand use practices are noted to contribute to changes in forest landscape composition. However, whereas studies have reported the intermix of land uses and forest patches and measured the direct impacts of land uses on forest patches, little is known regarding the spatially-explicit association between the most recent forest patches and land use footprints in protected areas. In this study, we use methods from GIS, remote sensing, and statistics to model the spatial relationship between footprints of land uses and patches of forest cover by drawing on geospatial data from the Atewa range forest reserve (ARFR).ResultsThe study finds that forest patches that are within 1 km from agricultural land use footprints (AOR=86.625, C.I. 18.057-415.563, P=0.000), logging sites (AOR=55.909, C.I. 12.032-259.804, P=0.000), mine sites (53.571, C.I. 11.287-254.255, P=0.000), access roads (AOR=24.169, C.I. 5.544-105.357, P=0.000), and human settlement footprints (AOR=7.172, C.I. 1.969-26.128, P=0.003) are significantly more likely to be less than the mean patch area (375,431.87 m(2)=37.54 ha) of forest cover. A ROC statistic of 0.995 achieved in this study suggests a high predictive power of the proposed model.ConclusionThe study findings suggest that to ensure sustainable land uses and ecological integrity, there is a need for land use policies and land management strategies that ensure responsible livelihood activities as well as further restrictions on logging and mining in the globally significant biodiversity area.

TI  - Megathrust Slip Behavior for Great Earthquakes Along the Sumatra-Andaman Subduction Zone Mapped From Satellite GOCE Gravity Field Derivatives
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last two decades, space geodesy allowed mapping accurately rupture areas, slip distribution, and seismic coupling by obtaining refined inversion models and greatly improving the study of great megathrust earthquakes. A better understanding of these phenomena involving large areas of hundreds of square kilometers came from the last gravity satellite mission that allowed detecting mass transfer through the Earth interior. In this work, we performed direct modeling of satellite GOCE (Gravity Field and Steady-State Ocean Circulation Explorer) derived gravity gradients up to degree/order N = 200 of the harmonic expansion and then corrected this by the effect of topography. Cutting off the model up to this degree/order allows inferring mass heterogeneities located at an approximate depth of 31 km, just along the plate interface where most (but not all) significant slip occurs. Then, we compared the vertical gravity gradient to well-constrained coseismic slip models for three of the last major earthquakes along the Sunda interface. We analyzed seismic rupture behavior for recent and for historical earthquakes along this subduction margin and the relationship of the degree of interseismic coupling using the gravity signal. From this, we found that strong slip patches occurred along minima gravity gradient lobes and that the maximum vertical displacements were related quantitatively to the gravity-derived signal. The degree of interseismic coupling also presents a good correspondence to the vertical gravity gradient, showing an inverse relationship, with low degrees of coupling over regions of relatively higher density. This along-strike segmentation of the gravity signal agrees with the along-strike seismic segmentation observed from recent and historical earthquakes. The thermally controlled down-dip ending of the locked fault zone along central Sumatra also presented an inverse relationship with the density structure along the forearc inferred using our modeling. From this work, we inferred different mass heterogeneities related to persistent tectonic features along the megathrust and along the marine forearc, which may control strain accumulation and release along the megathrust. Combining these data with geodetical and seismological data could possibly delimit and monitor areas with a higher potential seismic hazard around the world.

TI  - Modelling potential density of natural regeneration of European oak species (<i>Quercus robur</i> L., <i>Quercus petraea</i> (Matt.) Liebl.) depending on the distance to the potential seed source: Methodological approach for modelling dispersal from inventory data at forest enterprise level
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of natural oak regeneration from admixed oaks and neighbouring oak stands provides an interesting alternative to cost-intensive artificial oak regeneration when aiming for forest conversion of pure coniferous stands. In this study analysis of forest inventory data is done on how far and in what density natural regeneration of both Pedunculate and Sessile oak occurs in coniferous stands.In order to investigate as exclusively as possible the effect of distance to the seed source on the regeneration density of both oaks, the regeneration potential was determined by using quantile regression. By applying a .995th quantile, reducing factors on seedling density, e.g. desiccation, browsing, pathogens or limited resource availability, were excluded as much as possible. Thus, the effect of zoochorus vectors on effective dispersal could be quantified.The regeneration potential was determined based on data from the forest inventory of the Saxony state forest enterprise, Germany, including 2357 sample plots. Remote sensing data, including the location of oaks in the overstorey, were used to determine the distance to the nearest potential seed source. The results of the present study demonstrate that the highest regeneration densities are not found in the immediate vicinity of the nearest seed source, but at distances between 60 and 140 m to it, i.e. the maximum of seedling density per area unit is in some distance to the trees trunk. In the present study, dispersal distances of established regeneration up to 1565 m were detected. From a distance of 1570-2300 m on, there was no oak regeneration.The results prove that acorns are taken from the seed source and that, in addition to barochorus dispersal, the zoochorus dispersal is of great importance for the succession of coniferous stands. The position of potential seed sources is therefore an important information for silvicultural planning, in order to estimate potential oak regeneration densities.

TI  - Monitoring and predicting regional land use and land cover changes in an estuarine landscape of India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Deciphering land use and land cover (LULC) change patterns, identifying the variables that act as the major driving forces of change, and predicting possible changes are necessary tools of decision support for policymakers. Estuarine landscapes world over are under extreme pressure of developmental activities because of their resources. The developmental activities lead to unforeseen changes in the traditional land use practices, making it necessary for investigation of the possible outcomes. The present study aims to study the changing pattern of LULC in the East Godavari River Estuarine Ecosystem (EGREE) landscape during 1977-2015 using temporal satellite data and to predict the possible LULC changes by 2029. Cellular Automata-Markov model (CAMM) with and without the multi-criteria evaluator (MCE) and the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models were used for future LULC prediction. Between 1977 and 2015, mangroves were converted to aquaculture (5.81 km(2)) on the landward side and were also lost to submergence at the seaward side (15 km(2)). All of the coastal scrub (69 km(2)) was lost to beach clearing. Over this period, the aquaculture area rose to 177 km(2). The CAMM with MCE was found to yield better predictions. A further rise was predicted in aquaculture (16%), built-up (30%), and Casuarina plantations (28%) by 2029. The study highlighted the LULC change patterns in EGREE, an important estuarine landscape of India. The information generated in this study can act as baseline information for the stakeholders and policy makers in decision-making of developmental projects, land acquisition, and diversion of agricultural land to non-agricultural purposes.

TI  - Mapping the spatiotemporal variability of salinity in the hypersaline Lake Urmia using Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatiotemporal dynamic of salinity concentration (SC) in saline lakes is strongly dependent on the rate of water flow into the lake, water circulation, wind speed, evaporation rate, and the phenomenon of salt precipitation and dissolution. Although in-situ observations most reliably quantify water quality metrics, the spatiotemporal distribution of such data are typically limited and cannot be readily extrapolated for either long-term projections or extensive areas. Alternatively, remotely sensed imagery has facilitated less expensive and a stronger ability to estimate water quality over a wide range of spatiotemporal resolutions. This study introduces an adaptive learning model that leverages in-situ measurements, satellite imagery, and machine learning algorithms to estimate the spatiotemporal changes of water surface SC in saline lakes. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework by using high-resolution Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellite data in the Lake Urmia (LU), where 130 points were sampled in April and July 2019 for the model calibration and validation purposes. The results showed that Artificial Neural Network (ANN) yields the most accurate relationship between SC and water surface reflectance (R-2 = 0.94; NRMSE = 6.9%; MAE = 12.3 ppt) as compared to Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models. A sharp distinction in SC between the LU's northern and southern parts was observed during high flows due to the limitation on north-south water mixing imposed by the lake's middle causeway. Nevertheless, the impact of causeway on water circulation at the other seasons is minimum. A hysteretic relationship was also found between the lake water volume and the lake-averaged SC due to the distinct role of bed-salt dissolution and high evaporation rate at different seasons. A tight agreement between the SC variations in the southern part and the whole lake proved that the southern part dominantly controls SC dynamics in the whole lake.

TI  - Improvement in tropospheric moisture retrievals from VIIRS through the use of infrared absorption bands constructed from VIIRS and CrIS data fusion
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - An operational data product available for both the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (S-NPP) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-20 (NOAA-20) platforms provides high-spatial-resolution infrared (IR) absorption band radiances for Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) based on a VIIRS and Crosstrack Infrared Sounder (CrIS) data fusion method. This study investigates the use of these IR radiances, centered at 4.5, 6.7, 7.3, 9.7, 13.3, 13.6, 13.9, and 14.2 pm, to construct atmospheric moisture products (e.g., total precipitable water and upper tropospheric humidity) and to evaluate their accuracy. Total precipitable water (TPW) and upper tropospheric humidity (UTH) retrieved from hyperspectral sounder CrIS measurements are provided at the associated VIIRS sensor's high spatial resolution (750 m) and are compared subsequently to collocated operational Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and S-NPP VIIRS moisture products. This study suggests that the use of VIIRS IR absorption band radiances will provide continuity with Aqua MODIS moisture products.

TI  - Integrating Multi-Source Data for Rice Yield Prediction across China using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and reliable yield prediction at a large scale is imperative and prerequisite to prevent climate risk and ensure food security, especially with climate change and increasing extreme climate events. In this study, integrating the publicly available data (i.e., satellite vegetation indexes, meteorological indexes, and soil properties) within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, we developed one Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, one machine learning (Random Forest, RF), and one deep learning (Long Short-Term Memory Networks, LSTM) model to predict rice yield at county-level across China. For satellite data, we compared the contiguous solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), a newly emerging satellite retrieval, with a traditional vegetation index (enhanced vegetation index, EVI). The results showed that LSTM (with R-2 ranging from 0.77 to 0.87, RMSE from 298.11 to 724kg/ha) and RF (with R-2 ranging from 0.76 to 0.82, RMSE from 366 to 723.3 kg/ha) models outperformed LASSO (with R-2 ranging from 0.33 to 0.42, RMSE from 633.46 kg/ha to 1231.39 kg/ha) in yield prediction; and LSTM was better than RF. Besides, ESI (combining EVI and SIF together) could slightly improve the model performance compared with only using EVI or SIF as the single input, primarily due to the ability of satellite-based SIF in capturing extra information on drought and heat stress. Furthermore, we also explored the potential for timely rice yield prediction, and concluded that the optimal prediction could be achieved with approximately two/one-month leading-time before single/double rice maturity. Our findings demonstrated a scalable, simple and inexpensive methods for timely predicting rice yield over a large area with publicly available multi-source data, which can potentially be applied to areas with sparsely observed data and worldwide for estimating crop yields.

TI  - When Cannabis Use Goes Wrong: Mental Health Side Effects of Cannabis Use That Present to Emergency Services
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY
M3  - Review
AB  - Cannabis use is a modifiable risk factor for the development and exacerbation of mental illness. The strongest evidence of risk is for the development of a psychotic disorder, associated with early and consistent use in youth and young adults. Cannabis-related mental health adverse events precipitating Emergency Department (ED) or Emergency Medical Services presentations can include anxiety, suicidal thoughts, psychotic or attenuated psychotic symptoms, and can account for 25-30% of cannabis-related ED visits. Up to 50% of patients with cannabis-related psychotic symptoms presenting to the ED requiring hospitalization will go on to develop schizophrenia. With the legalization of cannabis in various jurisdiction and the subsequent emerging focus of research in this area, our understanding of who (e.g., age groups and risk factors) are presenting with cannabis-related adverse mental health events in an emergency situation is starting to become clearer. However, for years we have heard in popular culture that cannabis use is less harmful or no more harmful than alcohol use; however, this does not appear to be the case for everyone. It is evident that these ED presentations should be considered another aspect of potentially harmful outcomes that need to be included in knowledge mobilization. In the absence of a clear understanding of the risk factors for mental health adverse events with cannabis use it can be instructive to examine what characteristics are seen with new presentations of mental illness both in emergency departments (ED) and early intervention services for mental illness. In this narrative review, we will discuss what is currently known about cannabis-related mental illness presentations to the ED, discussing risk variables and outcomes both prior to and after legalization, including our experiences following cannabis legalization in Canada. We will also discuss what is known about cannabis-related ED adverse events based on gender or biological sex. We also touch on the differences in magnitude between the impact of alcohol and cannabis on emergency mental health services to fairly present the differences in service demand with the understanding that these two recreational substances may impact different populations of individuals at risk for adverse events.

TI  - Degradation of the Brazilian Cerrado: Interactions with human disturbance and environmental variables
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado is considered the most biodiverse savanna in the world, as well as the second largest Brazilian Biome. In recent decades, primarily due to agricultural expansion and wildfires, this biome has been severely degraded, losing nearly 50% of its original vegetation. This study aims to evaluate the degradation dynamics of the Cerrado vegetation as a function of human activity and climate variability. Products related to vegetation index (MOD13Q1) and an imaging spectroradiometer with moderate resolution from 2001 to 2018 were used to calculate the vegetation degradation index (VDI), which considers the vegetation cover as a function of human actions (deforestation, forest fires, agriculture, and farming). Rain and air temperature data were obtained from the Conventional Weather Station of Janu ' aria-Minas Gerais. Fire foci data were calculated using the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer MODIS MCD14DL product sensor (TERRA/AQUA). Specifically, this study focused on the degradation of the vegetation in the Pandeiros River EPA (environmental protection area) that has increased due to the variability of climatic conditions, forest fires, and agricultural activities. The dry season provided greater sensitivity for the evaluation of the vegetation degradation process of the Pandeiros River EPA. The negative effects observed from the variation of climatic conditions and anthropogenic actions on the vegetation dynamics of the Pandeiros River EPA demand greater attention from administrative bodies on strategies for the conservation, preservation, and management of natural resources of conservation areas.

TI  - Current distribution and potential expansion of the harmful benthic dinoflagellate <i>Ostreopsis</i> cf. <i>siamensis</i> towards the warming waters of the Bay of Biscay, North-East Atlantic
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In a future scenario of increasing temperatures in North-Atlantic waters, the risk associated with the expansion of the harmful, benthic dinoflagellate Ostreopsis cf. siamensis has to be evaluated and monitored. Microscopy observations and spatio-temporal surveys of environmental DNA (eDNA) were associated with Lagrangian particle dispersal simulations to: (i) establish the current colonization of the species in the Bay of Biscay, (ii) assess the spatial connectivity among sampling zones that explain this distribution, and (iii) identify the sentinel zones to monitor future expansion. Throughout a sampling campaign carried out in August to September 2018, microscope analysis showed that the species develops in the south-east of the bay where optimal temperatures foster blooms. Quantitative PCR analyses revealed its presence across almost the whole bay to the western English Channel. An eDNA time-series collected on plastic samplers showed that the species occurs in the bay from April to September. Due to the water circulation, colonization of the whole bay from the southern blooming zones is explained by inter-site connectivity. Key areas in the middle of the bay permit continuous dispersal connectivity towards the north. These key areas are proposed as sentinel zones to monitor O. cf. siamensis invasions towards the presumably warming water of the North-East Atlantic.

TI  - Monitoring of flood water propagation based on microwave and optical imagery
T2  - QUATERNARY INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The economy of northern part of Bangladesh mainly depends upon agriculture based production. Flood disasters in Dinajpur along the Punarbhaba, Atrai Rivers result in significant loss of life and economic damage. This paper finds the optimum technique to use microwave (Sentinel-1A) and optical (Landsat-8) imagery alternatively along with GIS for fast and effective flood mapping, semi-real-time monitoring and analyzing the propagation of flood water in a flood prone area. Since flooded areas usually are covered by dense clouds, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage over optical data by operating at wavelengths not hampered by cloud cover or a lack of illumination. It has capability to continuous observation of flood events for producing rapid, accurate and cost effective flood mapping. This characteristic makes SAR a potential alternative to optical sensors. The focal steps in flood monitoring using optical satellite data are: identifying water bodies efficiently; disregarding some cloud influences; and, monitoring the flood process dynamically. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of using freely available time series of Copernicus Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat-8 imagery. This study also assess the TRMM data for precipitation measurement in the study area for hydrological analyses of watersheds. The SAR images were first calibrated, geometrically corrected and filtered. Afterward, to extract the inundated areas from the SAR images threshold method was applied. In threshold method and MNDWI index was used to separate the open water and nonwater (land) areas from the images. This research proposed the combination model of SAR and optical data that describes how we can get water extraction result with higher accuracy during flood using optical and microwave data. The results showed that the VH of SAR backscattering coefficient achieved higher accuracy than VV of SAR backscattering coefficient, and the combination model provides the highest accuracy of flood water extraction. The highest number of populations are affected by flood that is around 827822 in 2017. Therefore, the findings of this study will help to require initiative to scale back the flood hazard impact and increase the pliability within the process of flood management. This study proposed a method to automatically generate periodic surface water at 10 m resolution, which may contribute to monitoring surface water in a timely manner. This has also played a significant role in the monitoring and early warning of emerging major natural disasters at home and abroad.

TI  - Functional trait-based layers - an aquaculture siting tool for the Mediterranean Sea
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture, the current fastest-growing food sector, is one of the major opportunities that could be reaped to cope with the increased demand for proteins from the sea and simultaneously generate economic growth while ensuring sustainable use of natural resources. The number of tools and approaches suggested to promote the selection of suitable areas focusing mostly on the management of potential conflicting uses at sea is rapidly increasing. However, to date, there is a lack of information regarding spatial planning according to a trait-based approach encompassing the functional and biological data of farmed species; a gap that may lead to selecting unsuitable areas for farming. To fill this gap, our study builds on a functional trait-based mechanistic approach based on the Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) theory allowing to generated species and site-specific predictions of aquaculture performances and the related environmental impact. We applied this approach to a commercial species farmed in the Mediterranean Sea, namely, the European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax). We used three seeding sizes (1.5, 2, 2.5 g) to run model simulations and answer a crucial question for farm management, i.e. the selection of the best seeding size. A sensitivity analysis coupled with our simulations allowed to spatially represent the performance growth and environmental impact per seeding size across Mediterranean countries. The accuracy of the model's outcome was strengthened by using high-resolution satellite data over a wide area of investigation (c.a. 302,000 km(2)). The novel informative obtained layers combine both the modelling of aqua culture performance and related environmental impact to fill a lacking perspective within both AZAs (Allocated Zones for Aquaculture) and AZEs (Allowable Zones of Effect) concepts. Our approach allowed discriminating the best zones for European sea bass aquaculture at country level for each of the tested seeding sizes. High-resolution predictions of aquaculture performances and impact were provided for each of the nineteen Mediterranean coastal countries, zooming at Exclusive Economic Zone scale (EEZ). We highlighted pole-ward negative patterns with the best values in the Southern basin; Libya, Tunisia and Egypt in particular. Our spatial contextualization through high resolution mapped outcomes represents an effective and salient tool for stakeholders and policy makers, based on the translation of complex computational modelling results into easy-to-read maps. The highlighted patterns may provide scientific evidence for proactive capacity-building programmes at country level in the future.

TI  - Effects of urban environmental conditions and landscape structure on taxonomic and functional groups of insects
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Insects are a particularly sensitive group to urbanization, and they are also highly dependent on structural, compositional, and environmental characteristics of the landscape as well as its scale. The identification of the landscape variables and scale which influence this group are necessary for the development of sustainable landscape planning in the face of climate change and environmental degradation. Here we aim to determine the most important spatial scale for the diversity of taxonomic and functional groups of insects, testing the hypothesis that the importance of environmental and landscape structure-composition variables on insect diversity and functional groups vary with the spatial scale. Finally, we selected the scale with the highest proportion of explained variance for the total, analyzing the correlations of landscape variables with each group. We collected insects in 15 non-overlapped landscapes, classifying them according to their order and functional groups. We generated 6 concentric circles from a focal patch per landscape, using remote sensing data to characterize landscape environmental and structural-composition variables from 200 to 1200 m. Finally, we tested the hypothesis by using the Variable Importance for the Projection and R-2 from Partial Least Square Regressions metrics. We identified that the importance of landscape diversity varied across the different scales. We found that 600 m was the scale with the highest explained variance for orders and functional groups in the total set. The scale at diversity of orders and functional groups reached the highest explained variance diversity that varied among groups. Parasitoids, predators, and phytophages responded to smaller scales, while pollinators and micophages to, and saproxylics to larger scales. Urban area and temperature were negatively associated with total diversity, while variables linked with vegetation quality presented a positive correlation. The generated results may contribute to improve the understanding of the urban ecology of insects, aiming to contribute with sustainable urban planning and conservation.

TI  - The role of culture on the link between worldviews on nature and psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldviews about human's relationship with the natural world play an important role in psychological health. However, very little is currently known regarding the way worldviews about nature are linked with psychological health during a severe natural disaster and how this link may differ according to cultural context. In this study, we measured individual differences in worldviews about nature and psychological health during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic within two different cultural contexts (Japan and United States). We found that across Japanese and American cultural contexts, holding a harmony-with-nature worldview was positively associated with improved psychological health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also found that culture moderated the link between mastery-over-nature worldviews and negative affect. Americans showed a stronger link between mastery-over-nature worldviews and negative affect than Japanese. These findings support the biophilia hypothesis and contribute to theories differentiating Japanese and American cultural contexts based on naive dialecticism and susceptibility to cognitive dissonance.

TI  - Comparison of satellite-based models for estimating gross primary productivity in agroecosystems
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based gross primary productivity(GPP) models have been widely used for simulating carbon exchanges of terrestrial ecosystems. However, the performances of various GPP models in agroecosystems have been rarely explored. In this study, we calibrated the model parameters and compared the performances of seven light use efficiency (LUE-GPP) models and five vegetation-index (VI-GPP) models for simulating daily GPP of agro-ecosystems over 106 crop growing seasons, and examined the effects of model structure on model performance. The simulations were carried out based on 19 eddy covariance (EC) sites from the global flux network and vegetation indices obtained from MoDIS. The calibrated potential LUE (epsilon(max)) for C-4 crop (summer maize, 2.59 +/- 0.94 g C MJ(-1)) was higher than that for C-3 crops (1.42 +/- 0.58 g C MJ(-)(1)) in any LUE-GPP models. The performances of models differed across the crops. Generally, all models performed better for C-3 crops than C-4 crops, and for winter crops (winter wheat Triticion aestivum L, rape-Bra.ssira napes L, and winter barley-llardeurn vulgare L) than summer crops (summer make-Zea mays L, potato :Solarium tuberosum L, rice-Otyza saliva L. and soybean-Glycine max (L.) Merr.). Cloudiness index-LUE (CI-LUE) model outperformed the other LUE-GPP models, and vegetation index (VEI) model outperformed the other VI-GPP models. LUE-GPP models demonstrated better performance than VI-GPP models due to the inclusion of water stress (W-s) and temperature stress (T-s). A comparison of the model structures showed that models only considering the effects of W-s produced smaller errors than those only considering the effects of T-s in simulating GPP. W-s algorithms generated the larger variations in LUE-GPP models compared to those of T-s especially during the drought period. All models obtained higher R-2 and smaller errors using the minimum method (Min (T-s, W-s)) than using the multiplication method (T-s x W-s) to integrate the effects of T-s and W-s on GPP, which suggested that the minimum method was better than the multiplication method to integrate T-s and W, on LUE. These results showed that satellite-based models with calibrated crop-specific parameters have the potential to serve as the basis for estimation of agroecosystem GPP, and can provide direction for future model structure optimization.

TI  - Inventory of Forest Attributes to Support the Integration of Non-provisioning Ecosystem Services and Biodiversity into Forest Planning-from Collecting Data to Providing Information
T2  - CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review Our review provides an overview of forest attributes measurable by forest inventory that may support the integration of non-provisioning ecosystem services (ES) and biodiversity into forest planning. The review identifies appropriate forest attributes to quantify the opportunity for recreation, biodiversity promotion and carbon storage, and describes new criteria that future forest inventories may include. As a source of information, we analyse recent papers on forest inventory and ES to show if and how they address these criteria. We further discuss how mapping ES could benefit from such new criteria and conclude with three case studies illustrating the importance of selected criteria delivered by forest inventory. Recent Findings Recent studies on forest inventory focus mainly on carbon storage and biodiversity promotion, while very few studies address the opportunity of recreation. Field sampling still dominates the data collection, despite the fact that airborne laser scanning (ALS) has much improved the precision of large-scale estimates of the level of forest ES provision. However, recent inventory studies have hardly addressed criteria such as visible distance in stands, presence of open water bodies and soil damages (important for the opportunity of recreation) and naturalness (here understood as the similarity of the forest to its natural state) and habitat trees and natural clearings (important for biodiversity promotion). The problem of quantifying carbon stock changes with appropriate precision has not been addressed. In addition, the reviewed studies have hardly explored the potential of inventory information to support mapping of the demand for ES. We identify challenges with estimating a number of criteria associated with rare events, relevant for both the opportunity of recreation and biodiversity promotion. These include deadwood, rare species and habitat trees. Such rare events require innovative inventory technology, such as point-transect sampling or ALS. The ALS technology needs relatively open canopies, to achieve reliable estimates for deadwood or understorey vegetation. For the opportunity of recreation, the diversity among forest stands (possibly quantified by geoinformatics) and information on the presence of open water bodies (provided by RADAR, ALS data or use of existing maps) may be important. Naturalness is a crucial criterion for native biodiversity promotion but hard to quantify and assess until now. Tree species identification would be crucial for this criterion, which is still a challenge for remote sensing techniques. Estimating carbon storage may build on biomass estimates from terrestrial samples or on remotely sensed data, but major problems exist with the precision of estimates for carbon stock changes. Recent approaches for mapping the supply side of forest ES are promising, while providing so far uncommon structural information by revised inventory concepts could be helpful also for mapping the demand for ES. We conclude that future studies must find holistic inventory management systems to couple various inventory technologies in support of the integration of non-provisioning ES and biodiversity into forest planning.

TI  - Evaluation of four image fusion NDVI products against in-situ spectral-measurements over a heterogeneous rice paddy landscape
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite image fusion methods that improve spatial and temporal resolution have significant potential to advance understanding of ecosystem dynamics in space and time. However, systematic evaluations of image fusion methods against in situ spectral data are lacking. Here, we used a suite of in situ spectral data collected at 60 elementary sampling units (10 x 10 m) covering 15 Landsat pixel (30 x 30 m) plots and one Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) pixel (250 x 250 m) throughout the entire growing season in a heterogeneous rice paddy landscape to evaluate four state-of-the-art image fusion NDVI products. They include the Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM), Flexible Spatiotemporal DAta Fusion (FSDAF), SaTellite dAta IntegRation (STAIR), and the CubeSat Enabled Spatio-Temporal Enhancement Method (CESTEM); the former three blended Landsat and MODIS data, whereas the latter combined CubeSats, Landsat, and MODIS observations. All fusion products showed strong linear relationships against in situ data when combining all spatial and temporal observations (R-2: 0.73 to 0.93) although there were partly negative biases (-1% to -9%). These biases resulted from forcing data to image fusion algorithms, such as Landsat (-4%) and MODIS (-7%). Performance difference between fusion methods were considerably larger for spatial than for temporal variation. Furthermore, Landsat NDVI explained only 17-22% of spatial variation against in situ spectral data, which can be translated into weak performance of image fusion products to predict spatial variability in NDVI. Image fusion products that relied on spatial interpolation showed large biases (-15% to -30%) for a vegetation plot surrounded by mixed land cover plots. Our results highlight key sources of uncertainty and will be instrumental in improving satellite image fusion methods to monitor land surface phenology in space and time.

TI  - Extreme waves induced by cyclone Nargis at Myanmar coast: numerical modeling versus satellite observations
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The deltaic coast of Myanmar was severely hit by tropical cyclone Nargis in May 2008. In the present study, a top-down numerical simulation approach using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN) models was conducted to study the meteorological and offshore wave characteristics of cyclone Nargis near the coast of Myanmar. The WRF simulation results agree well with the observed data from the India Meteorological Department. SWAN simulation results were compared with the WaveWatch 3 model by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and validated against available measurement data from satellites. The model results show relatively good agreement, and hindcast with satellites data (significant wave height only) shows a correlation coefficient value of 0.89. The SWAN and satellite comparisons also show better fit for high wave conditions. The resulted maximum significant wave height of 7.3 m by SWAN is considerably higher in energy than the seasonal waves normally prevalent at Myanmar's deltaic coast. The possibility of high energy waves due to cyclones should be considered during the design and operation of coastal and offshore projects in the area, particularly given the risks that climate change can intensify cyclones in the future. Since Myanmar lacks a dense network of in-situ observational stations, the methodology used in the current study presents the potential application of various numerical techniques and satellite data to estimate extreme wave conditions near the Myanmar coast.

TI  - Tungsten skarn mineral resource assessment of the Great Basin region of western Nevada and eastern California
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION
M3  - Article
AB  - A new quantitative mineral resource assessment for tungsten, a critical mineral commodity with highly concentrated production and a moderate risk of global supply disruption, was conducted for the Great Basin region of western Nevada and eastern California. This assessment was part of a larger effort focusing on three regions in the United States and represents the first study of domestic tungsten resources and mineral potential in over twenty years. By integrating geology, bedrock and stream sediment geochemistry, geophysics, and remote sensing data with recently developed software tools and analyses, estimates of undiscovered tungsten skarn deposits in permissive tracts are combined with grade and tonnage distributions of known deposits to generate probabilistic estimates of undiscovered resources. Identified resources in the Great Basin region total 168 thousand metric tons (kt) of tungsten trioxide (WO3), including 116 kt of past production and 52 kt remaining in place. Consistent with the historic significance of the Great Basin region as a past producer containing a large portion of U.S. identified resources, undiscovered resources are likely to occur adjacent to known deposits and prospects and at unexplored depths. Undiscovered deposits are estimated to contain median resources of 940 kt of WO3 with a 90% probability of at least 420 kt and a 10% probability of at least 1.7 million metric tons (Mt), of which 240 kt to 1.1 Mt may be economic to extract. Based on a 20-year average price, median recoverable undiscovered resources are estimated at 570 kt WO3 equivalent with a net present value of $3 billion U.S. dollars. The methods, data, results, and economic significance of the assessment contribute to a scientific understanding of a critical mineral resource with direct implications for policy and land management decisions.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes in desertified land in rare earth mining areas under different disturbance conditions
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Special mining methods and red soil lead to large-scale land degradation and desertification in ion-type rare earth (RE) mining areas. Therefore, it is crucial for ecological management and restoration of mining areas to accurately understand the evolution process of desertification. In this study, remote sensing Landsat images from 1986 to 2019 were used to extract desertified land information from the Lingbei mining areas, Dingnan County, Ganzhou, China. To improve the reliability of the experiment, samples selected from Google images were used for verification to compare the accuracy of the desertification difference index (DDI) model and random forest (RF) algorithm for extracting land desertification information. The results showed that compared with the DDI model, the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of the RF model based on multiple features were improved by 7% and 9.37%, respectively, indicating its higher applicability. Spatiotemporal change analysis of desertification in the mining area showed that the total area of desertification in the mining area increased most rapidly during 1986-1994 and reached 60.75 km(2). The area of desertified land increased continuously from 1994 to 2004 and reached a maximum of 143.08 km(2) in 2004. The area of desertified land decreased by 50.27 km(2), but the severe desertified land (SDL) area increased by 1.69 km(2) during 2004-2011. The area of desertified land gradually declined and stabilized from 2011 to 2019. Analysis of the desertification process in mining areas under different disturbance conditions showed that the desertified land disturbed by RE mining was most severely damaged. There is still an area of 16.77 km(2) in the process of restoration, of which 2.24 km(2) belongs to the SDL level. Moderate desertified land (MDL) and light desertified land (LDL) have not been completely contained and require the attention of the relevant departments to ensure their timely reclamation.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variations of land use and vegetation cover in Southwest China from 2000 to 2015
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Southwestern China is an important ecologically resource area and ecologically fragile area in China, which plays an important role in the national project of " Clear Waters and Green Mountains". Based on land use data set with a 1 km spatial resolution and combined with land use transfer matrix, we analyzed the characteristics and driving forces of land use change in Southwest China from 2000 to 2015. Based on the MODIS remote sensing index, we calculated the vegetation coverage in Southwest China using the dimidiate pixel model, and analyzed the changes of the normalized vegetation index ( NDVI) and vegetation coverage. Results showed that the main land types were woodland, cropland and grassland. The built-up land area increased by 5874 km2 (55.8%), the cropland area decreased by 6211 km2, and grassland decreased by 2099 km2. From 2000 to 2015, the area that had been changed to built-up land was the largest, mainly from cropland ( contributed 68.2%), woodland ( contributed 19.2%) and grassland ( contributed 13.1%). The transformed areas were mostly close to urban area. The area and rate for the transformation of cropland were 7079 km2 and 2.2% respectively, accounting for 46.0% of all the transferred out areas. Most of the woodland were transformed from grassland (61.8%), mainly distributed in central and southern Guizhou and western Yunnan. Both NDVI and vegetation coverage were significantly increased, indicating that the whole region was greening. NDVI of both natural vegetation and cropland increased significantly, while the NDVI of areas with expanded build-up land decreased. Therefore, natural vegetation and cropland dominated the vegetation change in this region. Results of the residual analysis showed that both climate change and human activities contributed significantly to the greening trend.

AB  - We introduce an automated aerosol type classification method, called Source Classification Analysis (SCAN). SCAN is based on predefined and characterized aerosol source regions, the time that the air parcel spends above each geographical region, and a number of additional criteria. The output of SCAN is compared with two independent aerosol classification methods, which use the intensive optical parameters from lidar data: (1) the Mahalanobis distance automatic aerosol type classification (MD) and (2) a neural network aerosol typing algorithm (NATALI). In this paper, data from the European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) have been used. A total of 97 free tropospheric aerosol layers from four typical EARLINET stations (i.e., Bucharest, Kuopio, Leipzig, and Potenza) in the period 2014-2018 were classified based on a 3 beta + 2 alpha + 1 delta lidar configuration. We found that SCAN, as a method independent of optical properties, is not affected by overlapping optical values of different aerosol types. Furthermore, SCAN has no limitations concerning its ability to classify different aerosol mixtures. Additionally, it is a valuable tool to classify aerosol layers based on even single (elastic) lidar signals in the case of lidar stations that cannot provide a full data (3 beta + 2 alpha + 1 delta) of aerosol optical properties; therefore, it can work independently of the capabilities of a lidar system. Finally, our results show that NATALI has a lower percentage of unclassified layers (4 %), while MD has a higher percentage of unclassified layers (50 %) and a lower percentage of cases classified as aerosol mixtures (5 %).

TI  - Automatic river planform identification by a logical-heuristic algorithm
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A solution is provided to automatically identify river reaches based on their planform typologies via a holistic synthesis of multi-dimensional, quali-quantitative information. Inspired by fuzzy logics, an algorithm is proposed which appraises the degree of fit of a range of archetypes based on formal criteria, applied over a discretized version of the river. The algorithm is fed by the values of a set of indicators relevant to the formal criteria. Indicators are determined from interpretation of remotely sensed data for each discrete "slice". To ensure a spatially holistic view, the local indicators are first integrated over a variable significant length, thereby guaranteeing contextualization at the appropriate scale. For each indicator a specific Value Function (VF) translates its objective value into a partial fitness judgment; these judgments are then integrated within a multiattribute VF. The locally highest scoring VF determines the corresponding planform choice in each slice. As a by-product, the stretch (collection of consecutive slices) corresponding to that planform archetype is identified. Implementation of the algorithm for the Baker River in Chile shows promising results. The approach ensures self-consistency and repeatability of outputs. Beyond an initial subjective assessment of input criteria based on expert judgment, the method can be fully automated. As such it can support systematic, large scale river analyses and monitoring applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - The current evidence for the use of minimally-invasive surgery in endometrial cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of the present study is to review the current available data regarding the use of minimally-invasive surgery in endometrial cancer patients and investigate the feasibility and safety of it for cancer control. We also reviewed the current understanding of sentinel lymph node mapping and the use of robotic surgery in endometrial cancer. Studies have consistently demonstrated better short-term outcomes of minimally-invasive surgery in endometrial cancer compared to laparotomy such as less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and fewer wound complications. Large randomized clinical trials and meta-analyses also suggest the feasibility and safety of minimally-invasive surgery in terms of oncologic outcomes especially in patients with early stage disease. Although evidence for advanced stage disease and patients with high risk for recurrence are still lacking, the current available data seem to support the use of minimally-invasive surgery for those patient groups as well. A large body of literature supports the role of sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer with a high sensitivity and a low false negative rate, as well as a favorable negative predictive value. Studies also show that robotic surgery is a safe and effective alternative to conventional laparoscopicsurgery for endometrial cancer staging but further long-term data are required. Further prospective studies with long-term follow-up are warranted to evaluate the feasibility and safety of minimally-invasive surgery especially in patients with advanced stage disease and high risk for recurrence. However, the current available data support the use of minimally-invasive surgery in all patient groups of endometrial cancer.

TI  - A new hybrid equilibrium optimized SysFor based geospatial data mining for tropical storm-induced flash flood susceptible mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flash flood is one of the most dangerous hydrologic and natural phenomena and is considered as the top ranking of such events among various natural disasters due to their fast onset characteristics and the proportion of individual fatalities. Mapping the probability of flash flood events remains challenges because of its complexity and rapid onset of precipitation. Thus, this study aims to propose a state-of-the-art data mining approach based on a hybrid equilibrium optimized SysFor, namely, the HE-SysFor model, for spatial prediction of flash floods. A tropical storm region located in the Northwest areas of Vietnam is selected as a case study. For this purpose, 1866 flash-flooded locations and ten indicators were used. The results show that the proposed HE-SysFor model yielded the highest predictive performance (total accuracy = 93.8%, Kappa index = 0.875, F1-score = 0.939, and AUC = 0.975) and produced the better performance than those of the C4.5 decision tree (C4.5), the radial basis function-based support vector machine (SVM-RBF), the logistic regression (LReg), and deep learning neural network (DeepLNN) models in both the training and the testing phases. Among the ten indicators, elevation, slope, and land cover are the most important. It is concluded that the proposed model provides an alternative tool and may help for effectively monitoring flash floods in tropical areas and robust policies for decision making in mitigating the flash flood impacts.

TI  - CD4<SUP>+</SUP> and CD8<SUP>+</SUP> T cells in sentinel nodes exhibit distinct pattern of PD-1, CD69, and HLA-DR expression compared to tumor tissue in oral squamous cell carcinoma
T2  - CANCER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Anticancer immunotherapies have revolutionized cancer management, yet the effect of systemic anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) treatment is predominantly studied in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Its impact on PD-1 expressing cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) is not well understood and yet to be explored. Thus, further research aiming for better understanding of the PD-1 pathway not only in tumor tissue but also in TDLNs is warranted. In this study, we investigated the expression of PD-1, CD69, and HLA-DR on CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells by flow cytometry analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), TDLNs, and tumor samples from patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Our data showed that both helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes in OSCC tissue were highly activated and expressed high level of PD-1 (over 70% positivity). Lymphocytes in TDLNs and peripheral blood expressed significantly lower levels of PD-1 and other activation markers compared to TILs. Moreover, we demonstrated that a significant fraction of PD-1 negative TILs expressed high levels of human leukocyte antigen - DR isotype and CD69. In contrast, PD-1 negative cells in TDLNs and PBMCs scarcely expressed the aforementioned activation markers. Furthermore, we proved that patients with a high percentage of CD3(+) PD-1(+) cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes had significantly lower disease-free and overall survival rates (log-rank test P = .0272 and P = .0276, respectively). Taken together, we proved that flow cytometry of lymph nodes in OSCC is feasible and may be used to investigate whether PD-1 levels in TDLNs correspond with survival and potentially with response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Such knowledge may ultimately help guide anti-PD-1 treatment.

TI  - Estimation of forest aboveground biomass using combination of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-1A data with random forest regression algorithm in Himalayan Foothills
T2  - TROPICAL ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) plays an indispensable role in the terrestrial carbon cycle and its dynamics. It also provides baseline data for developing sustainable management strategies in the region. In the present study, a decision-tree based random forest (RF) algorithm was used to estimate AGB for the different forest types in Doon valley, situated in the Himalayan foothills of India. Fifty-one spectral and textural variables were initially extracted using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and Sentinel-1A, which were further reduced to twenty optimum variables using the recursive feature elimination (RFE) method. These optimum variables were finally used to map AGB. Results showed that the spatial distribution of AGB ranged from 46.36 to 596.15 Mg ha(-1) with good correlation (R-2 = 0.87, RMSEr = 18.7%, RMSE = 62.56 Mg ha(-1)) between the observed and predicted AGB. This study validated the synergistic use of remote sensing, field data, and RF algorithm to precisely predict the spatial distribution of AGB.

TI  - Monitoring oil spill in Norilsk, Russia using satellite data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies the oil spill, which occurred in the Norilsk and Taimyr region of Russia due to the collapse of the fuel tank at the power station on May 29, 2020. We monitored the snow, ice, water, vegetation and wetland of the region using data from the Multi-Spectral Instruments (MSI) of Sentinel-2 satellite. We analyzed the spectral band absorptions of Sentinel-2 data acquired before, during and after the incident, developed true and false-color composites (FCC), decorrelated spectral bands and used the indices, i.e. Snow Water Index (SWI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results of decorrelated spectral bands 3, 8, and 11 of Sentinel-2 well confirmed the results of SWI, NDWI, NDVI, and FCC images showing the intensive snow and ice melt between May 21 and 31, 2020. We used Sentinel-2 results, field photographs, analysis of the 1980-2020 daily air temperature and precipitation data, permafrost observations and modeling to explore the hypothesis that either the long-term dynamics of the frozen ground, changing climate and environmental factors, or abnormal weather conditions may have caused or contributed to the collapse of the oil tank.

TI  - Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter and dementia incidence: A cohort study in Hong Kong
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent studies suggested that long-term exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was related to a higher risk of dementia incidence or hospitalizations in western populations, but the evidence is limited in Asian cities. Here we explored the link between long-term PM2.5 exposure and dementia incidence in the Hong Kong population and whether it varied by population sub-group. We utilized a Hong Kong Chinese cohort of 66,820 people aged >= 65 years who were voluntarily enrolled during 1998-2001 and were followed up to 2011. Prevalent dementia cases were excluded based on the face-to-face interview at baseline. We ascertained the first occurrence of hospitalization for all-cause dementia and major subtypes during the follow-up period. We assessed PM2.5 concentrations using a satellite data-based model with a 1 x 1 km(2) resolution on the residential address. Cox proportional hazards models were adopted to estimate associations of annual mean PM2.5 exposure with dementia incidence, adjusting for potential confounders. We identified 1183 incident cases of all-cause dementia during the follow-up period, of which 655 (55.4%) were cases of Alzheimer's disease, and 334 (28.2%) were those of vascular dementia. We found a positive association between annual mean PPM2.5 exposure and all-cause dementia incidence in the fully adjusted model. The estimated hazard ratio was 1.06 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.13) per every 3.8 mu g/m(3) increase in annual mean PM2.5 exposure. And the estimated HRs for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia were 1.03 (95% CI: 0.94,1.12) and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.98,1.22), respectively. We did not find effect modifications by age, sex, BMI, hypertension, diabetes, or heart disease on the associations. Results suggest that long-term exposure to PM2.5 is associated with a higher risk of dementia incidence in the Asian population. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Chlorophyll-a Algorithm for Landsat-8 Based on Mixture Density Networks
T2  - FRONTIERS IN REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Retrieval of aquatic biogeochemical variables, such as the near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) in inland and coastal waters via remote observations, has long been regarded as a challenging task. This manuscript applies Mixture Density Networks (MDN) that use the visible spectral bands available by the Operational Land Imager (OLI) aboard Landsat-8 to estimate Chla. We utilize a database of co-located in situ radiometric and Chla measurements (N = 4,354), referred to as Type A data, to train and test an MDN model (MDNA). This algorithm's performance, having been proven for other satellite missions, is further evaluated against other widely used machine learning models (e.g., support vector machines), as well as other domain-specific solutions (OC3), and shown to offer significant advancements in the field. Our performance assessment using a held-out test data set suggests that a 49% (median) accuracy with near-zero bias can be achieved via the MDNA model, offering improvements of 20 to 100% in retrievals with respect to other models. The sensitivity of the MDNA model and benchmarking methods to uncertainties from atmospheric correction (AC) methods, is further quantified through a semi-global matchup dataset (N = 3,337), referred to as Type B data. To tackle the increased uncertainties, alternative MDN models (MDNB) are developed through various features of the Type B data (e.g., Rayleigh-corrected reflectance spectra & rho;s). Using held-out data, along with spatial and temporal analyses, we demonstrate that these alternative models show promise in enhancing the retrieval accuracy adversely influenced by the AC process. Results lend support for the adoption of MDNB models for regional and potentially global processing of OLI imagery, until a more robust AC method is developed.

TI  - Changing air pollution scenario during COVID-19: Redefining the hotspot regions over India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study investigates the air pollution pattern over India during the COVID-19 lockdown period (24 March-31 May 2020), pre-lockdown (1-23 March 2020) and the same periods from 2019 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra aerosol optical depth (AOD) with level 2 (10 km x 10 km) and level 3 (1 degrees x 1 degrees gridded) collection 6.1 Dark Target Deep Blue (DT-DB) aerosol product the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 and SO2 data with a spatial resolution of 7 km x 3.5 km. We also use long-term average (2000-2017) of AOD for March-May to identify existing hotspot regions and to compare the variations observed in 2019 and 2020. The aim of the present work is to identify the pollution hotspot regions in India that existed during the lockdown and understanding the future projection scenarios reported by previous studies in light of the present findings. We have incorporated Menn-Kendall trend analysis to understand the AOD trends over India and percentage change in AOD, NO2 and SO2 to identify air pollution pattern changes during the lockdown. The results indicate higher air pollution levels over eastern India over the coal-fired power plants clusters. By considering the earlier projected studies, our results suggest that eastern India will have higher levels of air pollution, making it a new hotspot region for air pollution with highest magnitudes.

T2  - VIRUS RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cherry rusty mottle-associated virus (CRMaV), which belongs the genus Robigovirus of the family Betaflexiviridae, is strongly associated with cherry rusty mottle disease of sweet cherry, Prunus avium. Here, we report on the successful development of an Agrobacterium-based inoculation system for a cloned CRMaV cDNA construct. Agroinoculation of virus-free cherry rootstock ?Krymsk6? [P. cerasus x (P. cerasus x P. maackii)] resulted in the development of chlorotic yellow mottle symptoms on systemic leaves beginning at 50 days post inoculation. The presence of CRMaV in ?Krymsk6? agro-inoculated plants was confirmed by RT-PCR and ELISA. Subsequently, CRMaV from agro-inoculated ?Krymsk6? was graft-transmissible onto virus-free sweet cherry rootstock P. avium ?Mazzard? as evidenced by the production of typical cherry rusty mottle symptoms beginning at 35 days post grafting, and further confirmed by western blotting and RT-PCR. These results showed conclusively that CRMaV is the causal agent of cherry rusty mottle disease in sweet cherry. The reverse genetic system presented in this study can be used as a tool to investigate the molecular biology of CRMaV and also a template for infectious clone development for other viruses in the genus Robigovirus.

TI  - Inversion reflectance by apple tree canopy ground and unmanned aerial vehicle integrated remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF PLANT RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To obtain accurate spatially continuous reflectance from Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing, UAV data needs to be integrated with the data on the ground. Here, we tested accuracy of two methods to inverse reflectance, Ground-UAV-Linear Spectral Mixture Model (G-UAV-LSMM) and Minimum Noise Fraction-Pixel Purity Index-Linear Spectral Mixture Model (MNF-PPI-LSMM). At wavelengths of 550, 660, 735 and 790 nm, which were obtained by UAV multispectral observations, we calculated the canopy abundance based on the two methods to acquire the inversion reflectance. The correlation of the inversion and measured reflectance values was stronger in G-UAV-LSMM than MNF-PPI-LSMM. We conclude that G-UAV-LSMM is the better model to obtain the canopy inversion reflectance.

TI  - An automated early-season method to map winter wheat using time-series Sentinel-2 data: A case study of Shandong, China
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Timely and accurate information on winter wheat distribution and planting area is of great significance to food security, policy-making, and ecological function evaluation. However, several problems exist in the traditional winter wheat mapping approaches using remote sensing data, such as the limited spatial resolution of the remote sensing image data, the utilization of full-season remote sensing data, and the heavy dependence on training data. In this context, we propose a method based on the Sentinel-2 time series data with a 10-m spatial resolution to map winter wheat in Shandong, China. This is a novel, easy-to-operate, and effective mapping method, which is called the automated early-season method to map winter wheat using the Sentinel-2 data (AEMMS). The model is based on the assumption that the biomass accumulated by winter crops (mainly consisting of winter wheat and garlic in Shandong province) is gradually increasing and other vegetation is gradually decreasing in the early season phenological window phase. In addition, winter wheat is the crop that accumulates the most biomass among all the winter crops in Shandong province, and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) value of winter wheat is generally higher than that of garlic. We designe five phenological metrics and a series of classification rules for winter wheat discrimination. The AEMMS method has the following advantages: (1) it achieves high spatial resolution winter wheat mapping with a 10-m spatial resolution; (2) it is an early-season mapping method, which provides winter wheat maps nearly 5 months before harvest; and (3) it is automatic and needs no training sample data. The AEMMS method was applied in Shandong, China, to discriminate winter wheat for the 2017?2018 season. Winter wheat areas were derived in all 17 of the municipal administrative regions of Shandong province, and a strong correlation was observed between the derived winter wheat areas and the official statistics, with the coefficient of determination reaching 0.8973. A high mapping accuracy was also achieved in Jiaxiang County using the AEMMS method, with an overall accuracy of 97.80% and a kappa coefficient of 0.9368.

TI  - Capturing urban heat island formation in a subtropical city of China based on Landsat images: implications for sustainable urban development
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover change is the main driving force of urban expansion which influences human-environment interactions. Generally, the formation of urban heat islands (UHIs) can be referred to as a negative "by-product" of urbanization. In the context of rapid urbanization, the present paper aims to capture the landscape changes and three patterns of urban expansion (i.e., infill, extension, and leapfrog), and provide a better understanding of the formation of the surface urban heat island (SUHI) in Dongguan, China, during the past 20+ years. Urban land increased from 28.87 x 10(3) ha in 1994 to 78.89 x 10(3) ha in 2005 and 101.05 x 10(3) ha in 2015, with a compound annual urban growth rate of 9.57% (1994-2005) and 2.51% (2005-2015), respectively. Based on the mean land surface temperature difference (Delta mean LST) between urban land (UL) and green space (GS), the SUHI intensity (SUHII) increased from 1.46 degrees C in 1994 to 2.32 degrees C in 2005 and 3.83 degrees C in 2015 in Dongguan. Overall, the Delta mean LST of urban areas increased from 2.61 degrees C (1994-2005) to 4.78 degrees C (2005-2015). The Delta mean LST between the city center and its surrounding areas decreased from 1994 to 2015, and the Delta mean LST between the city center and the suburbs gradually increased, primarily in 2015. In particular, both dense urban and the infill pattern of urban expansion had high mean LSTs in Dongguan, thus having negative impacts on sustainable urban development. The limited green space and open land should be strictly controlled or prohibited for transformation in urban areas. Particularly in dense regions, green roofs, green areas, and urban renewal actions could be considered for mitigating the urban heat island effect.

TI  - A large-scale 2005-2012 flood map record derived from ENVISAT-ASAR data: United Kingdom as a test case
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) are adequate sensors for mapping water bodies from space as they can be used to acquire data of equal quality both day and night and practically regardless of weather conditions. Furthermore, the global coverage of SAR data provides an opportunity to generate global scale flood records that are essential for improving our understanding of flood risks worldwide and of how these risks are changing over time. In this study, we introduce an automatic change-detection based method that allows global-scale flood records to be generated using the readily and freely available ENVISAT-ASAR data collection. It consists of the following three steps: (i) flood image identification; (ii) reference image selection; (iii) floodwater detection. As a test case, this study uses all available ENVISAT-ASAR images from eight different orbital tracks that were acquired over the United Kingdom over the period 2005?2012. Due to a lack of large-scale ground truth data, the evaluation of the results is carried out using different data sources. First, subsets of the flood maps over the Severn River basin are evaluated using a flood extent map that was manually digitized from very high-resolution aerial imagery. According to our results, the overall accuracy of both flood maps? subsets is higher than 85% while the user accuracy of the flood class is above 88%. Next, for the regions and images without available ground truth data, a visual inspection is carried out using simulations generated by the hydraulic model LISFLOOD-FP, as well as LANDSAT 7 ETM+ images obtained with a 30 m spatial resolution. Meanwhile, by comparing the acquisition dates of identified flood SAR images, the LISFLOOD-FP model results and optical data, a good agreement has been found. The experimental results over the United Kingdom indicate that the proposed method has strong potential for the generation of a global flood data record from the ENVISAT-ASAR archive.

TI  - Spatiotemporal ecological vulnerability analysis with statistical correlation based on satellite remote sensing in Samara, Russia
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the present global situation, when everywhere ecology is degraded due to the extreme exhaustion of natural resources. Therefore spatiotemporal ecological vulnerability analysis is necessary for the current situation for sustainable development with protection of fragile eco-environment. Remote sensing is a unique tool to provide complete and continuous land surface information at different scales, which can use for eco-environment analysis. A methodology constructed on the principal component analysis (PCA) to identify satellite remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) for ecological vulnerability analysis and distribution based on four land surface parameters (dryness, greenness, temperature and moisture) by using Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI/TIRS data in the Samara region Russia. The results were verified by the following four methods: location-based, categorization based, correlation-based and city center to outwards distance-based comparisons. Results indicate that ecological condition was improved from 2010 to 2015 as RSEI increased from 0.79 to 0.98 and from 2015 to 2020 the ecological condition was degraded as RSEI decreased from 0.98 to 0.82 but overall it was improved in this decade. RSEI distribution curve shows moderate to good and excellent ecological conditions and degraded ecological condition was basically characterized by high human interference and socioeconomic activities in the study area. Such a technique is a baseline for highly accurate ecological conditions mapping, monitoring and can use for decision making, management and sustainable development.

TI  - Representativeness of Eddy-Covariance flux footprints for areas surrounding AmeriFlux sites
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Large datasets of greenhouse gas and energy surface-atmosphere fluxes measured with the eddy-covariance technique (e.g., FLUXNET2015, AmeriFlux BASE) are widely used to benchmark models and remote-sensing products. This study addresses one of the major challenges facing model-data integration: To what spatial extent do flux measurements taken at individual eddy-covariance sites reflect model- or satellite-based grid cells? We evaluate flux footprints-the temporally dynamic source areas that contribute to measured fluxes-and the representativeness of these footprints for target areas (e.g., within 250-3000 m radii around flux towers) that are often used in flux-data synthesis and modeling studies. We examine the land-cover composition and vegetation characteristics, represented here by the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), in the flux footprints and target areas across 214 AmeriFlux sites, and evaluate potential biases as a consequence of the footprint-to-target-area mismatch. Monthly 80% footprint climatologies vary across sites and through time ranging four orders of magnitude from 10(3) to 10(7) m(2) due to the measurement heights, underlying vegetation- and ground-surface characteristics, wind directions, and turbulent state of the atmosphere. Few eddy-covariance sites are located in a truly homogeneous landscape. Thus, the common model-data integration approaches that use a fixed-extent target area across sites introduce biases on the order of 4%-20% for EVI and 6%-20% for the dominant land cover percentage. These biases are site-specific functions of measurement heights, target area extents, and land-surface characteristics. We advocate that flux datasets need to be used with footprint awareness, especially in research and applications that benchmark against models and data products with explicit spatial information. We propose a simple representativeness index based on our evaluations that can be used as a guide to identify site-periods suitable for specific applications and to provide general guidance for data use.

TI  - Classification of Crops and Crop Rotation Using Remote Sensing and GIS-Based Approach: A Case Study of Doddakawalande Hobli, Nanjangudu Taluk
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about agricultural activities and spatial land use data is one of the key input parameter for the agricultural modelling. To access and manage crop information accurately, crop rotation and production risk reduction is additionally needed. Production risk can be reduced by adopting is related to multiple interaction between phenological information and crops management techniques. We address these issues by integrating remote sensing (RS) and Geographical Information System through three different methods (1). Differentiation of major crop types on an annual basis using village database, (2). Classification of RS data for a time periods (May to December), which are able to differentiate the certain stages of crops and (3). Combination of multispectral multi-temporal classification results in a sequential way for analysis strategy. Crop mapping for three different seasons were mapped for three consecutive years (2016-2018) by smoothing and integrating into a single vector layer for mapping of crop rotations. The use of phonological database in our classification method shows an improvement in a classification results. The obtained database shows information about the crop rotation which is extremely heterogeneous and contains large amount of crop sequences.

TI  - Water use efficiency in terrestrial ecosystem over East Asia: Effects of climate regimes and land cover types
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water use efficiency (WUE) is an environmental factor to account for the metabolism of terrestrial ecosystems using various climate systems and vegetation types. It is estimated by the ratio of gross primary productivity (GPP) to evapotranspiration (ET), the largest carbon and water fluxes with respect to plant respiration. In this study, the WUE was calculated using GPP and ET from the community land model version 4.0 (CLM4.0), inclusive of the prognostic carbon-nitrogen model in the community earth system model (CESM). The estimated WUE in East Asia was analyzed for climate zones, land cover types, and water- and energy-limited zones, with aridity index (AI). Spatial variations from 2001 to 2015 in annual WUE gradually increased as latitude decreased, though small year-to-year differences appeared between monthly GPP and ET. Monthly WUE was lower in summer than fall because the water loss rate in summer was higher than the carbon assimilation increase. The WUE under arid conditions (AI<0.5) was lower than under humid conditions. The GPP, ET, and WUE were higher in the forest, savannas, cropland, and permanent wetland with dense vegetation or abundant water resources than in other land cover types. The WUE was lower in water-limited zones than in energy-limited zones due to the low amount of water to use for the physical processes of GPP and ET. Based on this study, we identified general spatial and temporal variations of carbon fluxes in East Asia with various climate zones and land cover types. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Enabling LTE Services Under Interference from Mobile Satellite Service System
T2  - WIRELESS PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to meet the ever-increasing demand for the throughput of 5G mobile communications, more and more frequency bands are defined for the LTE system. However, some parts of the bands have been used by satellite services. When an LTE system in one country is within the footprint of a satellite service owned by another country, to prevent the interference from the satellite services, the LTE system will avoid using the overlapped frequency bands. In order to make use of the overlapped LTE bands, a Downlink Only Frame Structure (DOFS) approach is proposed in this paper. It treats the interfered band as a secondary carrier of a licensed primary carrier and employs a standard frame structure to transmit only downlink traffic on the band. The feasibility of the proposed DOFS approach is evaluated by both considering practical implementation parameters and using a popular commercial simulation tool at an interfered spot. The results reveal that, for most part of the evaluated zone, the SINR is good enough for 64QAM modulation.

TI  - Analyzing shoreline dynamicity and the associated socioecological risk along the Southern Odisha Coast of India using remote sensing-based and statistical approaches
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone is an extremely volatile environment and is constantly changing. We assessed short- and long-term shoreline changes in the Ganjam district of Odisha on the eastern coast of India from 1990 to 2019 using Landsat satellite imagery and the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) tool in a geographic information system. In addition, we have also projected the likely future coastline position for the 2030-2040 period and the possible impact on the socioecology of the shoreline. In this study, we used the endpoint rate (EPR) analysis, weighted linear regression (WLR) analysis, and trigonometric functions to analyze the shoreline from 1990 to 2019 and also forecasted for year 2030 and 2040. The shoreline of the Ganjam coastal zone is one of the most biologically productive ecosystems in the world, and it is well-known due to the breeding and mass nesting grounds of olive ridley turtles and the economically connected ports, famous beaches, and cyclone-prone areas. During the study period (1990-2019), the average erosion and accretion rates in the Ganjam shoreline were -2.58 m/year and 11.63 m/year, respectively. The rate of shoreline erosion increased during years of cyclone landfall, which was revealed during the short-term shoreline analysis of the periods from 1995 to 2000 (1999 super cyclone) and 2015 to 2019 (2019 category - IV cyclone Fani). The short- to long-term analyses of the shoreline assisted in identifying erosion (Ramyapatna, Podampetta) and accretion (southern part of Gopalpur port, spits along the Bahuda and Rushikulya Rivers) hotspots within the Ganjam coastal zone. The identified erosion hotspots could submerge a significant number of coastal villages that serve as breeding and mass nesting grounds for olive ridley turtles. The dominant erosion along the Ganjam coastline are likely to enhance socioecological risk and further threaten coastal communities in the future. The output of the undertaken research will benefit coastal planners, policymakers, and conservationists by helping them to formulate the most suitable action plan for coastal zone management with consideration of all stakeholders.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In present study, using artificial neural network (ANN), the land cover maps for three years (i.e. 2000, 2010 and 2019) were derived from Landsat optical data and the decadal spatio-temporal land cover dynamics was analysed. The classes delineated were built-up (urban and suburban), cultivated, vegetation, bare soil and river courses. Subsequently, the land cover change patterns were correlated with the LST values, which were retrieved from Landsat thermal data using mono-widow algorithm. The spatio-temporal clustering of high and low LST values (i.e. LST hot and cold spots) over different land covers, with special emphasis on built-up areas, was carried out. The variation in human thermal comfort levels during the period 2000-2019 was also investigated using thermal field variance index. The domain of the present study was Dehradun urban agglomeration.

TI  - Satellite-based application in drought disaster assessment using terra MOD13Q1 data across free state province, South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terra MOD13Q1 satellite data were used to assess drought disaster events and its spatiotemporal patterns over the Free State Province, South Africa between 2001 and 2019. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products and climate data downloaded from Application for Extracting and Exploring Analysis Ready Samples? (AppEEARS) and NASA: Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource databases, respectively were used in the study area. After acquiring MODIS data with the area of interest extracted using field sample and the layers of interest: using Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and pixel reliability and defining the output as GeoTIFF with geographic projection, R programming was used for the analysis. This study also evaluated Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) to further identify meteorological drought, computed at various time scales utilising information acquired from the Global Drought Observatory database. The results show and identify the years that are water-stressed in the study area, which indicated that low vegetation abundance and high temperature in the Free State Province occurred in 2000, 2008, and 2009. The result also shows that the summer season over large parts of the study region is characterized by moderate to extreme drought while winter seasons have light drought conditions during the same time. Seasonal and inter-annual comparisons of drought events outlined in the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) provided a useful tool for analysing the temporal and spatial evolution of regional drought and for estimating potential environmental impacts. Drought events occurrence in the study area is less frequent and milder in winter months while summer droughts of different years were more severe. The results of this study can also be used as a tool for monitoring droughts and support for decision making in the evaluation and management of regional drought, for disaster preparedness.

TI  - Local and remote physical processes driving variability of the planktonic system in the Juan Fernandez Archipelago: A multidisciplinary framework providing conservation insights
T2  - AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Juan Fernandez Ridge, a vulnerable marine ecosystem located far off the coast of central Chile and formed by several seamounts, guyots and three islands (Robinson Crusoe, Santa Clara and Alejandro Selkirk), has recently been declared a Coastal Marine Protected Area of Multiple Uses with several National Parks embedded in it.Recent studies have highlighted the influence of remote and local oceanographic structures on the hydrographic dynamics of this ridge. However, there is still a gap in understanding how they affect the structure and dynamics of the surrounding insular planktonic communities.A hydroacoustic and oceanographic survey was conducted during the austral spring (October 2016), including hydrographic and zooplankton sampling around Robinson Crusoe Island. Oceanographic features were identified and tracked using satellite data (chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and sea surface temperature) and modelling results.Two events of Chl-a increase relative to a threshold (>0.45 mg m(-3)) were forced by different physical processes, both affecting the western side of Robinson Crusoe Island. In event A during the cruise period, Chl-a subsurface maxima were associated with the arrival of a coastal meander originating on the continental shelf off Chile (remote process); the zooplankton was dominated by copepods and salps, with an evident coastal-oceanic gradient. In event B, Chl-a maxima were linked to a local upwelling forced by the intensification of a localized SSW wind. No influence of remote eddies or local Von Karman vortices on Chl-a distribution was observed.These findings highlight the influence of remote and local physical processes on the structure of planktonic communities around Robinson Crusoe Island. Understanding the variability of these mechanisms and their effects at the base of the pelagic food web is critical in adopting an ecosystem-level approach.

TI  - REGIONAL LYMPH NODE METASTASES IN CUTANEOUS MELANOMA: A SINGLE-CENTER ANALYSIS FROM SOUTHEAST EUROPE
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the standard of care for nodal staging in clinically node-negative melanoma patients. Our goal was to present 10-year results of sentinel lymph node biopsy at our institution and to evaluate the clinicopathologic factors as potential predictors of sentinel lymph node and non-sentinel lymph node metastatic involvement in patients with cutaneous melanoma.Methods: We have analyzed clinicopathologic and lymphoscintigraphic characteristics in 420 patients with cutaneous melanoma who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy between 2010 and 2019. In addition, we have examined the results of group of patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsy undergoing complete lymph node dissection.Results: The overall detection rate of sentinel lymph node biopsies was 97.1%, of which 18.8% was metastatic. Drainage to one regional basin was seen in 345 patients (83.1%) and to multiple drainage regions in 71 patients (17%). In-transit lymph nodes were detected in 20 patients. On univariate logistic regression analysis, male gender, primary tumor thickness with nodular histology, acral location, presence of ulceration, and the number of nodes harvested were significantly associated with sentinel lymph node biopsy status (p < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, the Breslow thickness was the only independent predictor of sentinel lymph node biopsy status. The metastases in non-sentinel lymph node found in 26 patients with positive sentinel lymph node (35.6%) correlated on univariate, as well as on multivariate logistic regression, with tumor subtype and number of sentinel lymph node harvested.Conclusion: In addition to the well-established primary tumor thickness as a predictor of sentinel lymph node biopsy positivity, we observed acral location and nodular melanoma subtype to significantly enhance the risk of metastases in sentinel lymph node(s). Primary tumor histology and number of nodes harvested were the only statistically significant variables predicting the non-sentinel lymph node status on multivariate analysis. Lymphoscintigraphy imaging characteristics were not significantly associated with sentinel lymph node status.

T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) and land use land cover (LULC) are the major components of climate- and environment-related studies. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship of LST with remotely sensed LULC-derived vegetation indices during 2018 at the global, latitudinal and continental scales. Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua daytime LST and eight LULC MODIS indices (NDVI, EVI, LAI, DSI, NDWI, albedo, NDSI, NDBI) were processed using Earth Engine Code Editor. The analysis was conducted using correlation coefficient and significance of the relationship of variables based on 2050 randomly selected points at the global scale. Based on the univariate and geographically weighted regression methods, the research confirmed that vegetation greenness (NDVI), leaf water content (NDWI) and snow cover (DSI) are the codominant drivers of decreasing LST at the global scale including Europe, Asia, South America and North America at the continental scale. Snow cover during winter and vegetation greenness in summer seasons control the global LST. Although albedo shows an inverse relationship, NDBI and NDSI displayed a positive relationship to LST at the global scale. In conclusion, temporal seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of LST in response to snow cover and vegetation properties (greenness, moisture) should be focused on understanding and regulating LST at varying scales.

TI  - Racial Differences in Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy: Impact on Breast and Axillary Surgical Management
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), an increasingly used method for breast cancer patients, has the potential to downstage patient tumors and thereby have an impact on surgical options for treatment of the breast and axilla. Previous studies have identified racial disparities in tumor heterogeneity, nodal recurrence, and NAC completion. This report compares the effects of NAC response among non-Hispanic white women and black women in relation to surgical treatment of the breast and axilla. Methods A retrospective review of 85,303 women with stages 1 to 3 breast cancer in the National Cancer Database who received NAC between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2016 was conducted. Differences in sociodemographic and clinical variables between black patients and white patients with breast cancer were tested. Results The study identified 68,880 non-Hispanic white and 16,423 non-Hispanic black women who received NAC. The average age at diagnosis was 54.8 years for the white women versus 52.5 years for the black women. A higher proportion of black women had stage 3 disease, more poorly differentiated tumors, and triple-negative subtype. The black women had lower rates of complete pathologic response, more breast-conservation surgery, and higher rates of axillary lymph node dissection, but fewer sentinel lymph node biopsies. Axillary management for the women who were downstaged showed more use of axillary lymph node dissection for black women compared with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Conclusions The black patients were younger at diagnosis, had more advanced disease, and were more likely to have breast-conservation surgery. De-escalating axillary surgery is being adopted increasingly but used disproportionately for white women.

TI  - Changes in utilization of axillary dissection in women with invasive breast cancer and sentinel node metastasis after the ACOSOG Z0011 trial
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The American College of Surgeons Oncology Group Z0011 (ACOSOG Z0011) trial demonstrated no survival advantage for women with clinical T1-T2 invasive breast cancer with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) who received whole-breast radiation, and no further axillary surgery when compared to women who did undergo axillary lymph node dissection (ALND). We used the National Cancer Database (NCDB) to study changes in utilization of ALND after the publication of this trial. NCDB was queried for female patients from 2012 to 2015 who met Z0011 criteria. Patients were divided into four groups based on Commission on Cancer facility accreditation. Outcome measures include the rate of ALND (nonadherence to Z0011) and the average number of nodes retrieved with ALND. 27,635 patients were identified, with no significant differences in T stage and receptor profiles between groups. Overall rate of ALND decreased from 34.0% in 2012 to 22.7% in 2015. Nonadherence was lowest in Academic Programs (decreasing from 30.1% in 2012 to 20.5% in 2015) and was highest in Community Cancer Programs (41.2% in 2012 to 29.1% in 2015). Median number of positive SLN did not differ between groups (p = .563). Median number of nodes retrieved on ALND decreased from 9 (IQR 5-14) in 2012 to 7 (IQR 4-12) in 2015 (p < .001). In patients who met the ACOSOG Z11 trial guidelines, rates of ALND have decreased over time. However, rates of nonadherence to Z0011 are significantly higher in Community Cancer Programs compared to Academic Programs.

TI  - Women Could Avoid Axillary Lymph Node Dissection by Choosing Breast-Conserving Therapy Instead of Mastectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The ACOSOG Z0011 trial showed that completion axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) can be safely omitted for some patients with T1-2 clinically node-negative breast cancer with one to two involved sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) treated with breast-conserving therapy (BCT). There is little evidence for the safety of omitting cALND for mastectomy-treated patients. Consequently, cALND is often recommended for sentinel node-positive patients treated with mastectomy. The aim of this study is to determine the proportion of patients who could avoid cALND by choosing BCT instead of mastectomy at a tertiary cancer center. Patients and Methods All T1-2 clinically node-negative breast cancer patients treated with BCT or mastectomy between 2012 and 2017 with metastases in the SLN(s) were selected from a prospectively maintained database. Clinical factors and outcomes were evaluated between the two groups. Differences were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test, chi-square test or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. Significance was set at the 0.05 level for all analyses. Results A total of 306 patients were included, 199 (65.0%) of whom were treated with BCT and 107 (35.0%) with mastectomy. Patients treated with mastectomy were more often treated with cALND compared with those treated with BCT (71.0% versus 26.6%, p < 0.0001). Overall, 52 of the mastectomy patients (68.4%) could have avoided cALND if they had chosen BCT. Conclusions Patients treated with mastectomy are more likely to receive cALND than those treated with BCT. Axillary management should be addressed during discussion of primary tumor therapy, and cALND may be avoided when patients choose BCT instead of mastectomy.

TI  - Estimation of Rape-Cultivated Area Based on Decision Tree and Mixed Pixel Decomposition
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The timely and accurate information of rape-cultivated area in Jianghan Plain is of great significance for crop yield estimation and food security in China. MODIS-EVI time series images were used to estimate rape-cultivated area of Jianghan Plain in 2015-2017 based on decision tree and mixed pixel decomposition methods. By analyzing the features of EVI time series curves of different objects, rape distribution was preliminarily extracted by establishing the decision tree model; however, due to the problem of mixed pixels, there are heterogeneous objects in a single pixel, which will affect the extraction accuracy of crop area by decision tree method. To solve this problem, according to EVI spectral curve of the endmembers, the linear spectral mixture model was adopted to further improve the precision of crop extraction, and rape-cultivated area was extracted accurately by using computed rape endmember abundance. The results showed that the average estimation accuracy of rape area was 96.6% with city-level R-2 (coefficient of determination) greater than 0.93. It demonstrated that the vegetation index time series data with medium resolution can accurately extract the rape-cultivated area, which can provide reference for rape monitoring over a large scale.

TI  - Environmental, demographic and policy drivers of change in mediterranean hedgerow landscape (Central Spain)
T2  - LAND USE POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - The present paper combines the classification of hedgerows in relation to surface soil moisture with the consideration of drivers of change (environmental, demographic, and policy) affecting the areal extent of hedgerow land cover in central Spain. These landscapes have a high cultural significance and functionality that needs to be preserved and improved. The hedgerow network of a continental Mediterranean mountain was mapped and different levels of surface soil moisture were estimated utilising images of the satellite Sentinel-2. In addition, we analysed the areal extent of hedgerows from 1956 to the present in relation to slope, surface soil moisture and distance from the metropolitan area.In the last 70 years there has been a decrease in the surface area of hedgerows in central Spain. In the study area in particular, this decrease represents 48.26% of the total hedgerow network identified in 1956. 51.62% of abandoned hedgerow areas demonstrate a low degree of surface soil moisture and are usually located on slopes greater than 5%. As a result, driest hedgerows -less fertile, accessible and productive- have lost their functionality in many cases. In addition, urban expansion and the proximity to Madrid Metropolitan Area are processes that have caused the loss of 9.33% of the hedgerows in the study area since 1956.We integrated an overview of European, national and regional policies related to hedgerow functions involving biodiversity, cultural heritage, rural development and spatial planning. This paper contributes to the knowledge of changing Mediterranean hedgerows and the current status of their protection within the different legislations. We conclude there are legislative tools at a European level of interest for the hedgerow landscape, however its identification and management at regional level are scarce.

AB  - This article examines the life and works of Hossein Kazemzadeh Iranshahr, focusing on the evolution of his thought from an ardent nationalist to a cosmopolitan mystic. It offers a detailed account of the spiritual transformation that Iranshahr went through around 1920 in Europe-a topic that has never been addressed in existing scholarship. It contextualizes his esoteric views, especially the influence of Theosophy on his thought in the context of the so-called "Occult Revival" in Weimar Germany. Finally, it discusses how Iranshahr's emerging spiritual worldview impacted his intellectual outlook, especially his views on religion, nationalism, civilization, and race.

TI  - Assessment and calibration of MODIS precipitable water vapor products based on GPS network over China
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The ground-based GPS provides a promising way to assess and calibrate precipitable water vapor (PWV) products from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) which has high spatial resolution and near global coverage. This study utilized PWV at about 260 ground-based GPS stations from the Crustal Movement Observation Network of China (CMONOC) from 2015 to 2018 to comprehensively assess the MODIS Near Infrared (NIR) PWV products as well as the latest ECMWF reanalysis, ERA5. Results reveal a general underestimate of MODIS PWV compared to GPS over China, with mean bias of 1.32 mm (GPS-MODIS), compared to -0.28 mm for ERA5 (GPS-ERA5). Taking GPS PWV as references, the average MODIS PWV error root mean square (RMS) is about 5.35 mm, with correlation coefficient (R) of -90% between GPS and MODIS PWV, compared to the RMS of 1.73 mm and R of -98% for ERA5. PWV differences between MODIS and GPS also show clear seasonal and climate type dependency over China. A refined linear MODIS PWV calibration model taking into account of climate region difference was then developed and examined. The calibrated MODIS PWV at more than 800 independent GPS stations from China Meteorological Administration (CMA) in the year of 2016 show obvious improvements, with RMS reduced by about 14.7, 17.7, 20.9, 2.5 and 11.3% in tropical monsoon (TM), subtropical monsoon (SM), midlatitude monsoon (MM), humid continental (HC) and plateau (PL) climate region, respectively. Compared to the unified calibration model which does not distinguish the climate regions, the RMS values after calibration using the refined model are reduced by 10.5, 8.3, 9.1, and 11.9% in TM, SM, MM and Plateau climate (PL) region, respectively. In addition, bias values are reduced from 2.01, 3.42, 1.50 and 0.84 mm to 1.64, 0.33, 0.68 and -0.06 mm in TM, SM, MM, PL region, respectively.

TI  - Monitoring and driving force analysis of spatial and temporal change of water area of Hongjiannao Lake from 1973 to 2019
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Hongjiannao Lake is the largest desert freshwater lake in China and the world?s largest breeding habitat for gulls, which is of great significance to the local ecological environment and the breeding of key protected birds, and was listed as a national key protected lake in 2012. This study uses Landsat series satellite remote sensing data from 1973 to 2019 in combination with the NDWI water body index and OSTU adaptive threshold methods to obtain a 46-year area dataset for the study area. On this basis, the temporal and spatial evolution of the lake and its coupling relationship with natural factors and human activities were studied. The results show that (1) during the period 1973?2019, Hongjiannao Lake has undergone three stages: slight shrinkage (1973?1997), sharp shrinkage (1997?2015), and expansion (2015?2019); (2) The shrinkage of the Hongjiannao Lake is mainly caused by anthropogenic factors, followed by natural factors. The anthropogenic factors mainly consist of the upstream river construction reservoirs, industrial development of water and vegetation growth increased water demand; (3) For the first time, the preliminary results of the conservation measures implemented since 2012 were analyzed. This is mainly reflected in the positive growth of the Hongjiannao Lake for the first time since its long-term shrinkage in 1997. This phenomenon is mainly due to measures such as artificially increasing rainfall and ecological water replenishment. Climate change (high evaporation, low precipitation) and human activities (construction of upstream water conservancy projects, coal mining, lagoon road construction, irrigation water use, etc.) are the key factors contributing to the changes in lake area during the shrinkage period. It is suggested that the study area should carry out artificial rain enhancement and surface ecological water replenishment to scientifically and rationally utilize water resources in the basin, effectively suppress the shrinkage of Hongjiannao Lake, and achieve long-term sustainable restoration of the wetland ecology.

TI  - Remote sensing liana infestation in an aseasonal tropical forest: addressing mismatch in spatial units of analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The ability to accurately assess liana (woody vine) infestation at the landscape level is essential to quantify their impact on carbon dynamics and help inform targeted forest management and conservation action. Remote sensing techniques provide potential solutions for assessing liana infestation at broader spatial scales. However, their use so far has been limited to seasonal forests, where there is a high spectral contrast between lianas and trees. Additionally, the ability to align the spatial units of remotely sensed data with canopy observations of liana infestation requires further attention. We combined airborne hyperspectral and LiDAR data with a neural network machine learning classification to assess the distribution of liana infestation at the landscape-level across an aseasonal primary forest in Sabah, Malaysia. We tested whether an object-based classification was more effective at predicting liana infestation when compared to a pixel-based classification. We found a stronger relationship between predicted and observed liana infestation when using a pixel-based approach (RMSD = 27.0% +/- 0.80) in comparison to an object-based approach (RMSD = 32.6% +/- 4.84). However, there was no significant difference in accuracy for object- versus pixel-based classifications when liana infestation was grouped into three classes; Low [0-30%], Medium [31-69%] and High [70-100%] (McNemar's chi(2) = 0.211, P = 0.65). We demonstrate, for the first time, that remote sensing approaches are effective in accurately assessing liana infestation at a landscape scale in an aseasonal tropical forest. Our results indicate potential limitations in object-based approaches which require refinement in order to accurately segment imagery across contiguous closed-canopy forests. We conclude that the decision on whether to use a pixel- or object-based approach may depend on the structure of the forest and the ultimate application of the resulting output. Both approaches will provide a valuable tool to inform effective conservation and forest management.

TI  - Hillslope geodiversity improves the resistance of shrubs to prolonged droughts in semiarid ecosystems
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Geodiversity effects on ecosystem productivity were investigated using remotely sensed data and a mathematical model, by introducing a spatially non-uniform surface-water infiltration. Two hillslope types, with different geodiversity levels, as determined by the soil depth and stoniness, were selected for this study. Low-geodiversity hillslopes ('homogenous hillslopes') were identified by their dense herbaceous vegetation cover, and lack of rock fragments cover. High-geodiversity hillslopes ('heterogeneous hillslopes') are characterized by a more sparse cover of herbaceous vegetation, and relatively high rock fragment cover (>20%). Calculating Soil Water Index (SWI) from Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ (SLC-ON) and Landsat-8 satellite images for the years 1994-2017 shows that during most of these years, SWI was higher at the heterogeneous hillslopes. This was particularly prominent after 2009 when mass mortality of shrubs took place on the homogenous hillslopes but not in the heterogeneous ones. Numerical simulations show that after a prolonged drought, the vegetation in the homogenous system dried out, and the system did not recover even after the yearly rainfall amounts returned to normal. In the heterogeneous system, the vegetation patches survived the drought episode and then recovered. This demonstrates the crucial role played by hillslope geodiversity in determining the durability of vegetation under prolonged droughts in semiarid regions.

TI  - Professional counseling from a Christian worldview
T2  - JOURNAL OF SPIRITUALITY IN MENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - As the counseling profession has increased focus on spiritual integration into counseling sessions, such integration brings necessary attention to professional ethics. While ethical guidelines mandate that counselors not impose values on clients, this has oftentimes been confused with the false idea that counselors who are Christian may not or cannot practice ethically due to potential conflicts between ethical practice and religious beliefs. This study helps explore professional counselors' understanding of the integration of Christianity into professional counseling. Such an understanding may help correct biases regarding ethical use of Christianity in professional mental health counseling.

TI  - Estimation and evaluation of rainfall from INSAT-3D improved IMSRA algorithm during 2018 summer monsoon season
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Indian National Satellite System (INSAT) multi-spectral Rainfall Algorithm (IMSRA) is an operational rainfall estimation technique of INSAT-3D at Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and Meteorological and Oceanographic Satellite Data Archival Centre (MOSDAC) since 2014. The IMSRA rain estimates are widely used for various application studies. This algorithm is based on an empirical power-law relation between infrared brightness temperature and surface rain rate. Based on further researches, some more innovative elements are recognized and incorporated into the parent IMSRA algorithm, termed as improved IMSRA. The present study evaluates the potential of the two versions of IMSRA algorithms for estimation of accumulated rainfall and its comparison with Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) based IMERG rainfall during the 2018 summer monsoon period. Studies suggest satellite rainfall data at monthly and seasonal scales are better suited for hydrological and meteorological applications. Much studies are not done towards the evaluation and characterizations of the two versions of IMSRA algorithms at monthly and seasonal scales, and the present study focuses on such comparisons. The results indicate that the overestimation tendencies of the older version of the IMSRA algorithm are reduced in the improved version. The statistical analysis suggests that the updated version show a reduction similar to 25% error for the improved version in the seasonal estimation of rainfall.

TI  - Towards a better understanding of grass bed dynamics using remote sensing at high spatial and temporal resolutions
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands conservation and resilience capacities are key issues in many places over the globe. Understanding these issues will benefit from a precise knowledge of seagrass species occupancy and coverage over time and over space. Such information can be obtained from remote sensing images and their classification thanks to a vegetation index, to be used in a complementary manner to field work inventories. Sentinel-2 data, which are available with a frequent revisit time (<5 days) and a high spatial resolution (10m pixel size) can be used to map grassbeds at the surface or slightly below the surface of permanent lagoons, hence enabling the characterization of its seasonal dynamics, which was not possible with previous remote-sensing tools. We have proved the feasibility of such a method in the natural reserve of the Bagnas (Herault, France) where Stuckenia pectinata coverage can be tracked over a full year thanks to Sentinel-2 images and field work. Inter-annual dynamics (seasonal growth and senescence) can be mapped over time with 10m resolution and will be extended to pluriannual studies thanks to the long-term objective of the Sentinel-2 mission. This opens the way to a concerted management of natural reserves based on data analysis and field knowledge, a better understanding of seagrass coverage with fluctuating environmental conditions, and predictive mechanistic and/or stochastic models of future qualitative trends.

TI  - GIS-based rockfall hazard zones modeling along the coastal Gulf of Aqaba Region, Egypt
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rockfall is a natural hazard in mountainous areas not to be underestimated. Mass activities differing in rock volume may cause considerable economic damage. Accomplishing qualitative appraisal of high-potential zones for rockfall is a first step towards implementing mitigation strategies. Nowadays, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are the state-of-the-art tool for a fast and economic approach of identifying potential hazard zones rather than using conventional mapping with in-situ field data. Primarily, current research focuses on designing and implementing user-friendly tools delineating potential rockfall hazard zonation (RHZ). The constructed model examines triggering factors like slope, aspect, elevation, lithology, structural lineament, rainfall intensity, and seismic activity focal depth of a mountainous coastal region (Gulf of Aqaba, Egypt). The extracted geomorphological parameters were based on a high-resolution TanDEM-X Digital Elevation Model. The enhanced Landsat ETM + 7 was used to generate the lithological and structural lineament parameters, while the rainfall data were collected from NASA project tool. The zonation model was implemented by means of ESRI's ArcGIS Pro ModelBuilder. Google Earth Pro orthophotos compared with the generated rockfall hazard zonation map indicate the potential RHZ with high reliability. The achieved results show that 15 % of the study area qualifies as a high rockfall hazard zone. As the RHZs generated by the model depend on the input data and the selected rating scores and weights, obtaining ground truth is essential to get a trustworthy result. Finally, this study recommends employing the built RHZ model on similar terrains worldwide to support decision-makers involving any sustainable development projects.

TI  - Evapotranspiration estimates from an energy-water-balance model calibrated on satellite land surface temperature over the Heihe basin
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A distributed hydrological energy-water-balance model (FEST-EWB) is calibrated over the Heihe Basin, a mainly desertic basin in China, employing remotely-sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) (MODIS, 1-km resolution) as calibration variable. This approach overcomes the problem of model parameters characterization, which are usually difficult to define especially over large basins, allowing a pixel-by-pixel calibration, preserving the spatial heterogeneity. Hence, the spatial distribution of the modelled LST, but also of soil moisture (SM) and evapo-transpiration (ET) is improved. The accuracy of the calibration process is documented through common statistical indexes. The modelled ET is compared locally against two eddy covariance stations in the agricultural area, while distributively against the ET estimates of the ETMonitor model and some global re-analysis products (ERA-Interim, GLDAS2, GLEAM and MERRA-2). Calibration and validation performed in this study prove that a considerable model accuracy is attainable even in extremely arid environments. An average LST bias of 2.6 degrees C is obtained over the basin. A good adaptation of FEST-EWB is also obtained against eddy-covariance stations ET with a little bias around -1 mm/d. On the other hand, the reanalysis products display a much worse performance, with higher absolute biases (around -3.5 mm/d), although with high variability among the models.

TI  - The CHIMAERA system for retrievals of cloud top, optical and microphysical properties from imaging sensors
T2  - COMPUTERS & GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuity and consistency of geophysical retrieval products obtained from different Earth-observing spaceborne or airborne atmospheric multispectral imagers can be challenging due to inherent differences in the instruments and/or the use of different retrieval algorithms. The Cross-platform High resolution Multi-instrument AtmosphEric Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMAERA) system addresses the latter aspect of the inter-sensor continuity problem for cloud property retrievals by removing retrieval methodology and implementation as a source of inconsistency when applied to instruments that share common measurement capabilities.Transferring an existing retrieval algorithm to a new sensor oftentimes is a nontrivial task, as it is common for an algorithm code to be tightly coupled to the sensor for which it was developed. By creating a clear division between the science algorithm and the instrument I/O codes, CHIMAERA allows easy migration of science algorithms to different sensors. CHIMAERA is built from C and FORTRAN source code, and can operate in a variety of environments ranging from a personal laptop to a high-performance computing environment for near real-time satellite data production. It is highly adaptable, low-maintenance and allows for easy expansion such that adding new instruments into the system requires only instrument-specific I/O and provision of any external lookup tables specific to the instrument's spectral characteristics.CHIMAERA currently officially supports 13 spaceborne and airborne atmospheric imagers from a single code base, and has been in use since 2007. This paper describes the engineering aspects of CHIMAERA and a few examples from its many current applications are briefly discussed.

TI  - Top four types of sentinel events in Saudi Arabia during the period 2016-19
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study discusses the summary, investigation and root causes of the top four sentinel events (SEs) in Saudi Arabia (SA) that occurred between January 2016 and December 2019, as reported by the Ministry of Health (MOH) and private hospitals through the MOH SE reporting system (SERS). It is intended for use by legislators, health-care facilities and the public to shed light on areas that still need improvement to preserve patient safety.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to review the most common SEs reported by the MOH and private hospitals between the years 2016 and 2019 to assess the patterns and identify risk areas and the common root causes of these events in order to promote country-wide learning and support services that can improve patient safety.Methods: In this retrospective descriptive study, the data were retrieved from the SERS, which routinely collects records from both MOH and private hospitals in SA. SEs were analyzed by type of event, location, time, patient demographics, outcome and root causes.Results: There were 727 SEs during this period, 38.4% of which were under the category of unexpected patient death, 19.4% under maternal death, 11.7% under unexpected loss of limb or function and 9.9% under retained instruments or sponge. Common root causes were related to policies and procedures, guidelines, miscommunication between health-care facilities, shortage of staff and lack of competencies.Conclusion: Given these results, efforts should focus on improving the care of deteriorating patients in general wards, ICU (Intensive Care Units) admission/discharge criteria and maternal, child and surgical safety. The results also highlighted the problem of underreporting of SEs, which needs to be addressed and improved. Linking data sources such as claims and patient complaints databases and electronic medical records to the national reporting system must also be considered to ensure an optimal estimation of the number of events.

TI  - Time-Varying Epipelagic Community Seascapes: Assessing and Predicting Species Composition in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The vast spatial extent of the ocean presents a major challenge for monitoring changes in marine biodiversity and connecting those changes to management practices. Remote-sensing offers promise for overcoming this problem in a cost-effective, tractable way, but requires interdisciplinary expertise to identify robust approaches. In this study, we use generalized additive mixed models to evaluate the relationship between an epipelagic fish community in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean and oceanographic predictor variables, quantified in situ as well as via remote-sensing. We demonstrate the utility of using MODIS Rrs555 fields at monthly and interannual timescales to better understand how freshwater input into the Northern California Current region affects higher trophic level biology. These relationships also allow us to identify a gradient in community composition characteristic of warmer, offshore areas and cooler, nearshore areas over the period 2003-2012, and predict community characteristics outside of sampled species data from 2013 to 2015. These spatial maps therefore represent a new, temporally and spatially explicit index of community differences, potentially useful for filling gaps in regional ecosystem status reports and is germane to the broader ecosystem-based fisheries management context.

TI  - RS-DCNN: A novel distributed convolutional-neural-networks based-approach for big remote-sensing image classification
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Developments in remote sensing technology have led to a continuous increase in the volume of remote-sensing data, which can be qualified as big remote sensing data. A wide range of potential applications is using these data including land cover classification, regional planning, catastrophe prediction and management, and climate change estimation. Big remote sensing data are characterized by different types of resolutions (radiometric, spatial, spectral, and temporal), modes of imaging, and sensor types, and this range of options often makes the process of analyzing and interpreting such data more difficult. In this paper, which is the first study of its kind, we propose a novel distributed deep learning-based approach for the classification of big remote sensing images. Specifically, we propose Distributed Convolutional-Neural-Networks for handling RS image classification (RSDCNN). The first step is to prepare the training dataset for RS-DCNN. Then, to ensure a data-parallel training on the top of the Apache Spark framework, a pixel-based convolutional-neural-network model across the big data cluster is performed using BigDL. Experiments are conducted on a real dataset covering many regions of Saudi Arabia and the results demonstrate high classification accuracy at a faster speed than other state-of-the-art classification methods.

TI  - Convolutional neural networks applied to semantic segmentation of landslide scars
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides are considered to be among the most alarming natural hazards. Therefore, there is a growing demand for databases and inventories of these events worldwide, since they are a vital resource for landslide risk assessment applications. Given the recent advances in the field of image processing, the objective of this study is to evaluate the performance of a deep convolutional neural network architecture called U-Net for the mapping of landslide scars from satellite imagery. The question that drives the study is: can fully convolutional neural networks be successfully applied as the backbone of automatic frameworks for building landslide inventories, keeping or improving the identification accuracy and agility when compared to other methods? To seek for an answer to it, scenes from the Landsat-8 satellite of a region of Nepal were obtained and processed in order to compose a landslide image database that served as the basis for the training, validation and test of deep convolutional neural networks. The U-Net architecture was applied and the results indicate that it has the potential to identify landslide scars, improving over previously published research on the topic for the same study region. The validation process resulted in recall, precision and F1-score values of 0.74, 0.61 and 0.67, respectively, thus higher than those from previous studies using different methodologies. The results indicate the potential of the method to be applied in dynamic mapping systems for landslide scar identification, which paves the way to the composition and updating of landslide scar databases. These, in turn, can support a great deal of quantitative landslide susceptibility mapping methods that heavily rely on data to provide accurate results.

TI  - Nontargeted LC/ESI-HRMS Detection of Polyhalogenated Compounds in Marine Mammals Stranded on French Atlantic Coasts
T2  - ACS ES&T WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - To date, nontargeted analysis (NTA) of halogenated organic compounds in biota has mostly been performed using GC/ MS-based instruments. We intended to broaden the spectrum of physicochemical properties of amenable substances by taking advantage of liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry coupling paired with an electrospray ionization source. Thus, a NTA strategy was applied to a set of 12 blubber samples belonging to five marine mammal sentinel species stranded on the French Atlantic coasts. It involved specific postacquisition data interpretation using open-source software HaloSeeker 1.0 for annotating chemical formulas. A total of 135 distinct unequivocal molecular formulas were assigned to 466 polyhalogenated ion clusters of interest. The most intense representative ions were identified as bioaccumulative heptachloro-1,2'-bipyrrole (Cl-7-BP), alpha- hexabromocyclododecane, and (1R,2S,4R,5R,1'E)-2-bromo-1-bromomethyl-1,4-dichloro-5- (2' -chloro ethenyl) -5-methylcyclohexane (MHC-1) in the weight range of micrograms per gram of lipids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Cl-7 -BP, the most intense signal observed, is reported in biota. A dozen other compound families will require further in-depth work to gain structural information.

TI  - A photon-counting LiDAR bathymetric method based on adaptive variable ellipse filtering
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2), equipped with the advanced topographic laser altimeter system (ATLAS), is a new measurement strategy that includes a photon-counting technique. Employing such an advanced system facilitates highly accurate measurement of changes in the land surface of the Earth, as well as water depths, thereby providing a novel opportunity for nearshore bathymetry. The main problem in photon-counting bathymetry is the precise identification and separation of photons with different density dis-tributions on the water surface and water-column. Further, automatic detection of the signal photon of the water surface and bottom from the noise photon presents a problem. To overcome such problems, we propose a novel, validated, adaptive variable ellipse filtering bathymetric method (AVEBM). This method can precisely identify and separate the photons in the above-water, water surface, and water-column regions. Filter parameters can be determined automatically by the density distribution of photons in different water environments and water depths, and the signal photons of the water surface and bottom can be detected precisely to conduct bathymetry. To ensure and improve the accuracy and reliability of the AVEBM, datasets of different photon densities were selected and employed in conducting experiments. Further, we used in situ data and remote sensing images to validate and estimate the detection accuracy of the signal photon and bathymetric accuracy. The experimental results indicated that bathymetric accuracy based on the AVEBM method reached 0.48 m of root mean square error (RMSE) when we employed three ATL03 datasets in combination for Qilianyu Islands. Moreover, the bathymetric accuracy reached 0.79 m of RMSE when comparing with the SDB result in Shanhu Island. Results showed that the proposed AVEBM method facilitated highly accurate signal photon detection and bathymetry.

AB  - The current study aims to examine the effects of mortality salience effects on worldview defense in an offline and online setting. Participants were 146 (66 offline and 80 online) Singaporeans. Participants were randomly assigned to either the mortality salience condition or the control condition and after a delay completed a Worldview Defense Assessment. No significant mortality salience effects on worldview defense occurred in either setting. The results might be explained by the Asian sample, Singapore's culture of tolerance, and data collection during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Future research directions include examining the effects of COVID-19 in activating worldview defense.

TI  - Archaeology and pre-Hispanic mining rituals in the south-central Andes (Puna of Salta, Northwestern Argentina)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article analyzes and discusses pre-Hispanic mining ritual practices in the south-central Andes, based on a novel record composed of a variety of interrelated archaeological indicators. It is a mining-ritual landscape in the highlands of northwestern Argentina (Ratones Basin, Puna of Salta), mainly related to the expansion of the Inca Empire in the region. This evidence is discussed in the general framework of archaeological information from various sites in other areas of the Andes as well as from ethnohistorical and ethnographic information. The results allow us to link the archaeological evidence of the Ratones Basin with important aspects of an Andean worldview, such as the wakas mines, production rituals, the worship of ancestors and the sacralization of landscape elements. In turn, the analyzed record indicates the importance that rituals had as a form of symbolic domination by the Inca Empire for the control of mining activities. This case is an example of the symbolic/ ideological domination developed by many empires.

TI  - Evaluation of machine learning models for predicting the temporal variations of dust storm index in arid regions of Iran
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to predict wind erosion events and specify the related effective factors to prioritize management and executive measures to combat desertification caused by wind erosion in arid areas. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate the applicability of nine machine learning (ML) models (including multivariate adaptive regression splines, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, k-nearest neighbors, genetic programming, support vector machine, Cubist, artificial neural networks, extreme gradient boosting, random forest) and their average for predicting the seasonal dust storm index (DSI) during 2000-2018 in arid regions of Iran. The results showed that the averaging method outperformed the other individual ML models in predicting DSI changes in all seasons. For instance, the averaging methods improved the prediction accuracies for winter, spring, summer, autumn, and dusty seasons by 22%, 39%, 28%, 32%, and 26%, respectively, compared to the multivariate adaptive regression splines. Furthermore, the most important factors in predicting DSI were detected as follows: wind speed for winter, enhanced vegetation index for spring, maximum wind speed for summer, autumn and dusty seasons. In general, our results indicate that the combining of the individual ML models by averaging method help us to develop a more accurate approach for predicting the temporal changes of the dust events in arid regions. Furthermore, the obtained results in this study can be applicable for prioritizing measures in order to minimize the dangers of wind erosion based on the major driving factors.

TI  - Sentinel node biopsy in patients with melanoma improves the accuracy of staging when added to clinicopathological features of the primary tumor
T2  - ANNALS OF ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: It has been claimed, without supporting evidence, that knowledge of sentinel node (SN) status does not provide more accurate prognostic information than basic clinicopathological features of a primary cutaneous melanoma. We sought to investigate this claim and to quantify any additional value of SN status in predicting survival outcome.Patients and methods: Data for a Dutch population-based cohort of melanoma patients (n = 9272) and for a validation cohort from a large Australian melanoma treatment center (n = 5644) were analyzed. Patients were adults diagnosed between 2004 and 2014 with histologically-proven, primary invasive cutaneous melanoma who underwent SN biopsy. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analyses were carried out in the Dutch cohort to assess recurrence-free survival (RFS), melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and overall survival (OS). The findings were validated using the Australian cohort. Discrimination (Harrell's C-statistic), net benefit using decision curve analysis and net reclassification index (NRI) were calculated.Results: The Dutch cohort showed an improved C-statistic from 0.74 to 0.78 for OS and from 0.74 to 0.76 for RFS when SN status was included in the model with Breslow thickness, sex, age, site, mitoses, ulceration, regression and melanoma subtype. In the Australian cohort, the C-statistic increased from 0.70 to 0.73 for OS, 0.70 to 0.74 for RFS and 0.72 to 0.76 for MSS. Decision curve analyses showed that the 3-year and 5-year risk of death or recurrence were more accurately classified with a model that included SN status. At 3 years, sensitivity increased by 12% for both OS and RFS in the development cohort, and by 10% and 6% for OS and RFS, respectively, in the validation cohort.Conclusions: Knowledge of SN status significantly improved the predictive accuracy for RFS, MSS and OS when added to a comprehensive suite of established clinicopathological prognostic factors. However, clinicians and patients must consider the magnitude of the improvement when weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of SN biopsy for melanoma.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations and potential sources of tropospheric formaldehyde over eastern China based on OMI satellite data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The eastern region is an important economic hinterland and energy region of China; however, the rapid economic development and the decoupling of environmental pressure have resulted in a significant increase in volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions, and the region is facing the air pollution problem of high-concentration formaldehyde accumulation. The Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) remote sensing satellite can perform long-term and large-scale dynamic monitoring of tropospheric formaldehyde, and its data can reflect the distribution of formaldehyde column concentration in the study area. This article discusses the spatial and temporal characteristics of formaldehyde in eastern China from 2009 to 2018 based on OMI's formaldehyde column concentration data daily products. In addition, based on the Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China (MEIC), the potential contributions of natural sources (isoprene) and anthropogenic sources (industrial sources, transportation sources, and residential sources) to formaldehyde are analyzed. The results show that the formaldehyde column concentration is higher in eastern China, and the high-value areas are mainly concentrated in regions with close human activities, such as Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD), and the concentration is predicted to increase slowly in the future. One of the main sources of formaldehyde is isoprene emitted by plants, but the impact of human activities on formaldehyde cannot be ignored. The OMI data can objectively reflect the spatiotemporal distributions and change characteristics of formaldehyde in large areas and effectively characterize the accumulation of atmospheric pollutants; thus, the use of OMI can provide an important theoretical basis and reference value for the improvement of regional ecological environment and atmospheric quality.

TI  - A high-resolution index suitable for multi-pollutant monitoring in urban areas
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In view of the problems involved in remote sensing monitoring of urban air quality, including low spatial resolution, only for a single pollutant, complex inversion algorithms, and difficultly obtaining parameter values, in this study, a new difference smog index (DSI) was developed, and then a comparison with the normal difference haze index, the difference index, and the MODIS aerosol optical depth products. The results show that the DSI model developed in this study has a higher accuracy and a better monitoring effect in urban areas, and it has a higher resolution (30 m), which greatly improves the degree of refinement of the remote sensing monitoring. The DSI model has a higher extensibility, and it is suitable for monitoring the AQI, PM2.5, NO2. The DSI model proposed in this paper is simple and easy to use, and thus, it has a high potential for application and deserves promotion in urban air quality monitoring. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Spectral ? spatial urban target detection for hyperspectral remote sensing data using artificial neural network
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral remote sensing is opening new gateways for a multitude of applications with an added advantage of high spectral and spatial resolution. Target detection of urban objects has gained prominence during the past decade for maintaining a pace with increasing urbanization. This paper aims to identify roads and roofs as urban targets using a hybrid approach of the spectral and spatial aspect of hyperspectral data. The work highlights a brief taxonomy of morphological operators namely, Dilation, Erosion, Opening and Closing with fused spectral signatures of urban targets considered. Artificial neural network (ANN) has been used as a machine learning measure due to its high prediction capability and its effectiveness over conventional target detection approaches.(c) 2021 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Estimations of Land Surface Characteristic Parameters and Turbulent Heat Fluxes over the Tibetan Plateau Based on FY-4A/AGRI Data
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimates of land surface characteristic parameters and turbulent heat fluxes play an important role in the understanding of land-atmosphere interaction. In this study, Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) satellite data and the China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) meteorological forcing dataset CLDAS-V2.0 were applied for the retrieval of broadband albedo, land surface temperature (LST), radiation flux components, and turbulent heat fluxes over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). The FY-4A/AGRI and CLDAS-V2.0 data from 12 March 2018 to 30 April 2018 were first used to estimate the hourly turbulent heat fluxes over the TP. The time series data of in-situ measurements from the Tibetan Observation and Research Platform were divided into two halves-one for developing retrieval algorithms for broadband albedo and LST based on FY-4A, and the other for the cross validation. Results show the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of the FY-4A retrieved broadband albedo and LST were 0.0309 and 3.85 K, respectively, which verifies the applicability of the retrieval method. The RMSEs of the downwelling/upwelling shortwave radiation flux and downwelling/upwelling longwave radiation flux were 138.87/32.78 W m(-2) and 51.55/17.92 W m(-2), respectively, and the RMSEs of net radiation flux, sensible heat flux, and latent heat flux were 58.88 W m(-2), 82.56 W m(-2) and 72.46 W m(-2), respectively. The spatial distributions and diurnal variations of LST and turbulent heat fluxes were further analyzed in detail.

TI  - Spatio-temporal distribution of INSAT-3D AOD derived particulate matter concentration over India
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ground observations over 60-80 sites in India during 2014-18 reveal that Particulate Matter (PM) concentration exceeded National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) by 1.5-2.5 times during Pre-Monsoon (PrM), Post-Monsoon (PoM) and Winter (Win) seasons only. Geographically Weighted Regression technique was employed to estimate PM2.5 and PM10 incorporating Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) measured from geostationary orbit by Indian National Satellite (INSAT-3D) and ERA-INTERIM derived meteorological parameters. INSAT-3D AOD was well correlated with ground measured AOD (R-2 > 0.75). Estimated PM found higher during PrM (PM2.5: 103.16 +/- 31.39 mu g m(-3), PM10: 150.07 +/- 43.13 mu g m(-3)) than PoM (PM2.5: 58.72 +/- 22.9 mu g m(-3), PM10: 127.17 +/- 48.95 mu g m(-) ) and Win (PM(2.)5: 71.02 +/- 20.25 mu g m(-3), PM10: 96.86 +/- 27.63 mu g m(-3)). PM pollution was severe in West India (PM2.5: 87.44 +/- 30.07 mu g m(-3), PM10: 148.13 +/- 42.8 mu g m(-3)), 1.2-1.5 times higher than least polluted North-East India. Spatial variability of PM distinctly discern the major prone areas that experience episodic events like dust (PM10 > 150 mu g m(-3)) and biomass burning (PM2.5 >100 mu g m(-3)). Overall country registered increase in AOD, PM10, PM2.5 by 52.34%, 36.23%, 36.58% respectively. Estimation accuracy produced by the model was satisfactory (R-2 > 0.6; NMSE <0.25; -0.01 < FB < 0.09). The human footprint perceived by the PM2.5/PM10 ratio signifies that 60.95% PM10 is attributed to PM2.5 across the country and it was highest during Win (73.45%). The changes in spatial distribution of PM highlight that Indo-Gangetic Plain and coastal area in Southern India had undergone major industrialization, urban expansions which resulted in increase of PM2.5 by 50-125 mu g m(-3) during all seasons.

TI  - A dataset composed of multiangular spectral libraries and auxiliary data at tree, leaf, needle, and bark level for three common European tree species
T2  - DATA IN BRIEF
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This article describes a dataset of multiangular scattering properties of small trees (height = 0.38-0.7 m) at visible, near-infrared, and shortwave-infrared wavelengths (350-2500 nm), and provides supporting auxiliary data that comprise leaf, needle, and bark spectra, and structural characteristics of the trees. Multiangular spectra were measured for 18 trees belonging to three common European tree species: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst), and sessile oak (Quercus petraea (Matt.) Liebl.). The measurements were performed in 47 different view angles across a hemisphere, using a laboratory goniometer and a non-imaging spectrometer. Leaf and needle spectra were measured for each tree, using a non-imaging spectrometer coupled to an integrating sphere. Bark spectra were measured for one sample tree per species. In addition, leaf and needle fresh mass, surface area of leaves, needles, and woody parts, silhouette area, and spherically averaged silhouette to total area ratio (STAR) for each tree were measured or derived from the measurements. The data are useful for modeling the shortwave reflectance characteristics of small trees and potentially forests, and thus benefit climate modeling or interpretation of remote sensing data.

TI  - Assessment of land degradation 'on the ground' and from 'above'
T2  - SN APPLIED SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessments of land degradation vary in methodology and outcome. The objective of this study is to identify the state, extent and patterns of land degradation in Eastern Africa (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania). More recently (2000s), satellite-based imagery and remote sensing have been utilized to identify the magnitude and processes of land degradation at global, regional and national levels. This involves the use of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer data and the use of high-quality satellite data from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer. This study is the first in Eastern Africa to complement remote sensing with ground-level assessments in evaluating the extent of land degradation at national and regional scales. The results based on NDVI measures show that land degradation occurred in about 51%, 41%, 23% and 22% of the terrestrial areas in Tanzania, Malawi, Ethiopia and Kenya, respectively, between the 1982 and 2016 periods. Some of the key hot spot areas include west and southern regions of Ethiopia, western part of Kenya, southern parts of Tanzania and eastern parts of Malawi. To evaluate the accuracy of the NDVI observations, ground-truthing was carried out in Tanzania and Ethiopia through focus group discussions (FGDs). The FGDs indicate an agreement with remotely sensed information on land degradation in seven sites out of eight in Tanzania and five sites out of six in Ethiopia. Given the significant magnitude of land degradation, appropriate action is needed to address it.

TI  - Potential role of urban forest in removing PM<sub>2.5</sub>: A case study in Seoul by deep learning with satellite data
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - PM2.5 has been considered as a crucial issue in densely populated cities because of its adverse effects on human health. As a way to mitigate this problem on city scale, urban forest is recently suggested as a solution due to its potential to absorb and adhere PM2.5. However, limited observations in the forest prevent a full understanding in the role of forest on urban PM2.5 concentration. In this paper, we present an application of deep learning using satellite data to clarify the role of forest with respect to the PM2.5 concentration mitigation in the city. Based on PM2.5 data collected from the ground-based observation stations, two PM2.5 prediction models are constructed through the deep learning approach. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth from the GOCI and MODIS are used as the main predictors of two models. Both models predict spatial distribution throughout Seoul, Korea (R-2 of 0.61 and 0.78). Particularly, the western parts of Seoul tend to have higher PM2.5 concentrations than the other parts, whereas mid-outskirts have noticeably low concentrations. A comparison of spatial distributions of PM2.5 between observations and predictions show that the existing observation network only reflects 15%-60% of entire characteristics of Seoul. Utilizing city-wide PM2.5 estimations, a comparison of estimated PM2.5 between urban and forest regions has been performed. The results show that the estimated PM2.5 concentrations in the forest regions are less than those in urban regions by up to 16.4 mu g m(-3). In contrast to urban regions, the average of PM2.5 concentrations in the forest regions is likely below the daily mean WHO PM2.5 outdoor standard. Our study suggests that urban forest could be a potential way to improve urban air quality with a specific focus on PM2.5. In addition, the deep learning approach used in this study can be applied to other cities where obtaining observation measurements is difficult.

TI  - Multi-information collaborative cloud identification algorithm in Gaofen-5 Directional Polarimetric Camera imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE SPECTROSCOPY & RADIATIVE TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - The Directional Polarimetric Camera (DPC) onboard China's Gaofen-5 (GF-5) satellite has provided multi angle (3-polarization channel), large-scale (1850 km swath width and 3.3 km spatial resolution), and high-frequency (2-day revisit period) Earth observation since May 2018. These features make DPC imagery application scenarios extensively. However, like other optical imagery, the presence of clouds is also a pervasive and unavoidable issue in DPC imagery. To leverage both radiation and polarization properties of DPC, we proposed a multi-information collaborative (MIC) method to identify clouds in the DPC imagery. Instead of a fixed single threshold, the MIC method adopts dynamic thresholds obtained by simulation in different atmosphere models, at different times, and under different underlying surfaces. Specifically, we included surface albedo and ice/snow cover distribution libraries to the MIC method, as they compensate for fewer spectral bands in the DPC imagery, thereby improving the accuracy of cloud detection results, especially in special bright surface scenarios (e.g., desert, bare soil and ice/snow). We also added an ice/snow detection algorithm to further eliminate the issue of misidentifying ice/snow pixels as clouds. Finally, after obtaining the DPC cloud mask results based on the MIC method, we calculated four cloud confidence levels for different application requirements by cloud quality evaluation criteria.We evaluated the MIC algorithm by comparing it with two other independent satellite cloud observation products, namely Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We found that the MIC cloud mask is in good agreement with the other two cloud products, with agreement probabilities of 93.06% (CALIPSO) and 85% (MODIS), respectively. Furthermore, the detected high confidence cloud and clear sky results agree with the CALIPSO cloud confidence products by more than 97.35% and 96.13%, respectively. We therefore suggest that the MIC method can provide the basis for subsequent studies of atmospheric parameters, such as accurate retrieval of aerosol optical thickness (AOT), cloud optical thickness (COT), cloud droplet effective radius (CDR) and land surface reflectance.

TI  - Maize and soybean heights estimation from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR data
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop height is a key structure parameter for the modelling of crop growth, healthy status, yield forecasting and biomass estimation. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) LiDAR systems can quickly and precisely acquire vegetation structure information at a low cost. UAV LiDAR data are increasingly used in vegetation parameters estimation. In this study, we estimated maize and soybean heights using two methods, i.e., based on LiDAR-derived CHM and based on LiDAR variables. The results show that UAV LiDAR data can successfully estimate maize and soybean heights. We found that the method based on LiDAR variables can produce more accurate estimates than CHMbased method. The estimation model of combined maize and soybean had a better prediction performance than those of the specific maize and soybean. Moreover, the soybean height estimation models derived from both methods yielded the lowest prediction precision. We studied the influence of LiDAR point density on crop height estimates through reduced point density (0.25-420 points/m(2)). When LiDAR point density was less than 1 point/m(2), the estimation precision for the specific maize and soybean dropped rapidly with the decrease of point density. However, the point density had no significant influence on crop height estimation precision while LiDAR point density was greater than or equal to 1 point/m2. Moreover, the original point density did not generate the highest estimation precision in our study. Therefore, high LiDAR point density may be not required for estimating vegetation parameters, and a good balance between the point density and data acquisition cost should be found.

TI  - Variable seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness across geographical regions, age groups and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains: A systematic review and <i>meta</i>-analysis of the evidence from test-negative design studies after the 2009/10 influenza pandemic
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: We examined the influence of some factors on seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE) from test-negative design (TND) studies.Methods: We systematically searched for full-text publications of VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza from TND studies in outpatient settings after the 2009/10 influenza pandemic. Two reviewers independently selected and extracted data from the included studies. We calculated pooled adjusted VE across geographical regions, age groups and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains, using an inverse variance, random-effects model.Results: We included 76 full-text articles from 11,931 citations. VE estimates against A(H1N1)pdm09, A (H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza were homogenous and point pooled VE higher in the Southern hemisphere compared with the Northern hemisphere. The difference in pooled VE between the Southern and Northern hemispheres was statistically significant for A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza. A consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across both hemispheres and continents, with the highest point pooled VE being against A(H1N1)pdm09, followed by influenza B, and lowest against A (H3N2). A nearly consistent pattern was observed in pooled VE across age groups in the Northern hemisphere, with pooled VE mostly decreasing with age. Point pooled VE against A(H3N2), influenza B, and all influenza were statistically significantly higher when vaccine was antigenically similar to circulating virus strains compared with when antigenically dissimilar. Similar pattern was observed in the Northern hemisphere, but there was a lack of data from the Southern hemisphere.Conclusion: Consistent patterns appear to exist in seasonal influenza VE across regions, age groups, and levels of vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains, with best vaccine performance against A(H1N1)pdm09 and worst against A(H3N2). The evidence highlights the need to consider geographical location, age, and vaccine antigenic similarity with circulating virus strains when designing and evaluating influenza VE studies.

TI  - Mega-dams and extreme rainfall: Disentangling the drivers of extensive impacts of a large flooding event on Amazon Forests
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Extreme weather events and the presence of mega-hydroelectric dams, when combined, present an emerging threat to natural habitats in the Amazon region. To understand the magnitude of these impacts, we used remote sensing data to assess forest loss in areas affected by the extreme 2014 flood in the entire Madeira River basin, the location of two mega-dams. In addition, forest plots (26 ha) were monitored between 2011 and 2015 (14,328 trees) in order to evaluate changes in tree mortality, aboveground biomass (AGB), species composition and community structure around the Jirau reservoir (distance between plots varies from 1 to 80 km). We showed that the mega-dams were the main driver of tree mortality in Madeira basin forests after the 2014 extreme flood. Forest loss in the areas surrounding the reservoirs was 56 km(2) in Santo Antonio, 190 km(2) in Jirau (7.4-9.2% of the forest cover before flooding), and 79.9% above that predicted in environmental impact assessments. We also show that climatic anomalies, albeit with much smaller impact than that created by the mega-dams, resulted in forest loss along different Madeira sub-basins not affected by dams (34-173 km(2); 0.5-1.7%). The impact of flooding was greater in varzea and transitional forests, resulting in high rates of tree mortality (88-100%), AGB decrease (89-100%), and reduction of species richness (78-100%). Conversely, campinarana forests were more flood-tolerant with a slight decrease in species richness (6%) and similar AGB after flooding. Taking together satellite and field measurements, we estimate that the 2014 flood event in the Madeira basin resulted in 8.81-12.47 center dot 10(6) tons of dead biomass. Environmental impact studies required for environmental licensing of mega-dams by governmental agencies should consider the increasing trend of climatic anomalies and the high vulnerability of different habitats to minimize the serious impacts of dams on Amazonian biodiversity and carbon stocks.

TI  - Carbon stock losses and recovery observed for a mangrove ecosystem following a major hurricane in Southwest Florida
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Studies integrating mangrove in-situ observations and remote sensing analysis for specific sites often lack precise estimates of carbon stocks over time frames that include disturbance events. This study quantifies change in mangrove area from 1985 to 2018 with Landsat time series analysis, estimates above and belowgmund stored carbon using field data, and evaluates aboveground carbon stock changes after the 2004 Category 4, Hurricane Charley, in J.N. "Ding" Darling National Wildlife Refuge. Two allometric equation methods yielding similar results were used to estimate aboveground carbon content in three mangrove species found in the refuge. Aboveground carbon contained 67 (SE = 2) MgC ha(-1) with a total refuge estimate of 74,504 MgC in 2018. Sediment contained 259 (SE = 28) MgC ha(-1) for a total of 288,008 MgC in the refuge. The initial reduction in mangrove area caused by Hurricane Charley was between 0.6% and 5.3%, equivalent to between 427 MgC and 3,599 MgC under three different scenarios of carbon loss. As a result of the hurricane, approximately 61 ha of mangroves were disturbed, of which 24 ha had recovered by 2018, with 37 ha (similar to 3% of the pre-hurricane mangrove area) still not recovered 14 years after the event. The 37 ha of mangroves that have not recovered are located in a tidally restricted area of the refuge. A longer recovery time in this area will likely result in a greater loss of carbon storage than in the rest of the refuge.

TI  - A Synchronous Long Time-Series Completion Method Using 3-D Fully Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Traditional spatiotemporal fusion methods utilize remote sensing images from two or three adjacent dates to predict missing images. Thus, temporal information in longtime data sets is not fully utilized, increasing the costs of long time series construction in terms of time and labor. Here, we propose a synchronous long time-series completion method using a 3-D fully convolutional neural network (LTSC3D). This method can be used to convert long time-series high-temporal-low-spatial (HTLS)- and high-spatial-low-temporal (HSLT)-resolution remotely sensed images into 4-D data sets. From these data sets, we can then extract and fuse spatiotemporal features to produce synchronous long time-series high-temporal-high-spatial (HTHS)-resolution predictions. The model was tested using simulated and real data sets and compared with four representative traditional spatiotemporal fusion methods. The results demonstrated the high accuracy and high efficiency of our method.

TI  - Spring leads in the Beaufort Sea and its interannual trend using Terra/MODIS thermal imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice leads promote mass and energy exchange between the atmosphere and the Arctic Ocean. The continuous thinning of sea ice and the enhanced sea ice mobility in the past decades can potentially change the seasonal cycle and interannual variability of lead distribution in the Arctic, especially during spring. However, the long-term trend in Arctic leads, associated with sea ice loss, remains inconclusive. Sequential lead distribution data from serial middle-or high-resolution satellite observations are needed to obtain realistic variation, trends, and lead characteristics on a regional or basin scale. This study proposed a modified algorithm to retrieve daily spring leads in the Beaufort Sea using temperature anomaly from Terra/MODIS thermal imagery. Our lead map was compared to existing lead datasets and validated by Landsat-8 images, showing that the modified method gave better results in identification of open water leads and refrozen leads covered by thin ice. The development and interannual trend for April leads were explored for the study period 2001-2020. We found a positive interannual trend in the April lead area of about 2612 +/- 1245 km(2)/year (90% confidence). Higher increasing rate was identified in the early April, which would be 26.4 - 29.2% lower if the influence from cloud variation was removed. Lead area presents a close correlation with the 11-day average of ice drift speed before lead detection, while the influence of regional pressure gradient and easterly wind on the lead area is limited to the synoptic scale and recedes within a week. In the years with anomalous large lead area, we found the detected lead area are closely related to enhanced ice motion driven by strengthening Beaufort High and persistent easterly wind.

TI  - Surface response and subsurface features during the restriction of groundwater exploitation in Suzhou (China) inferred from decadal SAR interferometry
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater overexploitation has caused dramatic land subsidence over the metropolitan areas in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and many other economic centers worldwide. Suzhou (China) is such a sinking city and faces enhanced flood risks. Restrictions on groundwater exploitation (RGE) have been imposed by the government since 1997 to prevent further elevation loss. However, knowledge on the spatiotemporal evolution of the urban land deformation during the RGE is limited by sparse and infrequent field measurements, which may bias the evaluation of the RGE policy and the strategy formulation of water management. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) provides regional surface deformation at a regular temporal interval of dozens of days. Here we present the decadal evolution of ground deformation in Suzhou using multiple InSAR datasets from ERS1/2, ENVISAT-ASAR, and ALOS-1 PALSAR-1 during 1993?2010, spanning the entire RGE period. An elongated zone from southern to northwestern Suzhou is highlighted by a drastic cumulative land subsidence exceeding 0.9 m due to inelastic aquifer compaction. We characterize the spatiotemporal ground deformation response to the RGE policy using an exponential decay function, from which we also infer the subsurface boundaries with sharp bedrock gradients. We identify a corridor connecting the Yangcheng and Taihu lakes, which is highly sensitive to RGE during the decelerated subsidence. Our analysis also suggests that urban subsidence in Suzhou was under control by 2006(-0.4)(+1.4).

TI  - Quantifying relationships between subsidence and longwall face advance using DInSAR
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MINING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface subsidence that results from longwall mining can be large magnitude and can affect significant areas. Conventional methods for subsidence monitoring include leveling, global positioning system (GPS), and photogrammetric surveys. Remote sensing techniques including, aerial LiDAR, terrestrial laser scanning, and satellite-based Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR), are also used to measure deformation associated with subsidence. DInSAR data are different than data from conventional subsidence surveys. Images capture data over large areas (hundreds of kilometers), and each pixel (data point) in an image quantifies the average displacement over an area of square meters. DInSAR data can have fairly high time resolution; imaging periods typically range from weeks to months. DInSAR data can be useful to monitor subsidence sequentially over short periods. Regularly monitoring subsidence may help define if caving is progressing normally and can establish relationships between surface deformation and longwall face advance, which has potential to help quantify possible risks to mine stability. In this study, subsidence at a longwall trona mine is monitored over short periods, typically 12 days, as the longwall face is advanced through a panel. C-band interferometric wide swath synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the sentinel satellites are used to quantify the subsidence. The onset of subsidence occurs close in time to the beginning of the longwall face advance, and overall, the development of subsidence closely follows the longwall face advance.

TI  - Aerosols properties over desert influenced locations situated in four different continents
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper investigates aerosol properties (physical, optical and radiative) to understand the aerosol climatology (2008-17) over four Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites situated in different continents. For this purpose, the chosen sites are Jaipur, India in Asia, Ilorin, Nigeria in Africa, Birdsville, Queensland in Australia and White Sand, New Mexico in America. The higher AOD were found at Jaipur (AOD approximate to 0.57; alpha = 0.38) during month of June and at Ilorin (AOD approximate to 1.12 and alpha approximate to 0.56), Africa during February. The value of SSA are also found higher i.e. 0.94 and 0.96 during the MAM over Jaipur and Ilorin respectively due to dominance of dust aerosols. Ilorin experiences the influence of harmattan winds from November to March and shows significant increase not only in coarse mode but also in fine particles fraction. While the remaining sites i.e. White Sand, America; and Birdsville, Australia are found relatively pristine based on monthly averaged AOD, AE (a) and SSA. The estimated direct radiative forcing using SBDART indicates that Ilorin and Jaipur sites in Africa-Asia exhibit much higher values of TOA and BOA as compared to White Sands and Birdsville in America-Australia. The annual averaged radiative forcing are estimated over Ilorin (38.38 +/- 16.89 W m(-2)) and Jaipur (36 +/- 8.34 W m(-2)). Similarly, high radiative forcing efficiency of 66.86 +/- 16.69 W m(-2) tau(-1)(0.55nm) and 67.96 +/- 20.46 W m(-2) tau(-1)(0.55nm) are calculated for Ilorin and Jaipur, respectively. The influence of emission differs in different continents i.e. Africa-Asia to America-Australia sites.

TI  - Spatiotemporal assessment of land use/land cover change and associated carbon emissions and uptake in the Mekong River Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use and land cover (LULC) change caused by human activities is a major source of anthropogenic carbon emissions and a driver of climate change. The Mekong Region is highly dynamic, experiencing extensive LULC change in recent decades. This study provides a spatially and temporally continuous estimate of LULC change for the Mekong River Basin for 2001-2019 using time series analysis of MODIS data coupled with a spatiotemporal carbon bookkeeping model to track carbon losses and recovery. The LULC change product has an overall accuracy of 74.4 +/- 1.9% (82.1 +/- 1.7% after consolidating tree-dominated classes), including an increase of 5.6% after combining with existing MODIS products (referred to as the M-CCDC process). Two of the largest components of LULC change in the region are the establishment of plantations and agricultural expansion, which were estimated to be 33,617 +/- 7342 km(2) and 14,915 +/- 4682 km(2) between 2003 and 2014. We found that 82% of the deforested area was converted to tree plantations. Among all the newly added plantations, 86% replaced natural forests and 12% replaced agricultural land. In addition, existing maps of annual tree canopy cover (TCC) were used to assess forest disturbances that do not result in LULC conversions. The M-CCDC results combined with the forest disturbances derived from TCC maps were coupled to a spatiotemporal carbon bookkeeping model to estimate carbon emissions and uptake. Carbon emissions were 72.9 +/- 6.2 Tg C yr(-1) during 2001-2017; emissions increase to 102.8 +/- 8.6 Tg C yr(-1) if including carbon not yet released to the atmosphere in the form of decomposing slash and wood products. Carbon uptake for the same period was-35.5 +/- 4.9 Tg C yr(-1), with carbon uptake from new plantations offsetting almost half of the emissions from deforestation in this area. Assessment of post-deforestation land use is crucial for quantifying the short-and longer-term carbon consequences of LULC change.

TI  - Atmospheric correction of Sentinel-3/OLCI data for mapping of suspended particulate matter and chlorophyll-a concentration in Belgian turbid coastal waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The performance of different atmospheric correction algorithms for the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) on board of Sentinel-3 (S3) is evaluated for retrieval of water-leaving radiance reflectance, and derived parameters chlorophyll-a concentration and turbidity in turbid coastal waters in the Belgian Coastal Zone (BCZ). This is performed using in situ measurements from an autonomous pan-and-tilt hyperspectral radiometer system (PANTHYR). The PANTHYR provides validation data for any satellite band between 400 and 900 nm, with the deployment in the BCZ of particular interest due to the wide range of observed Near-InfraRed (NIR) reflectance. The Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) atmospheric correction algorithm is adapted for S3/OLCI processing in ACO-LITE, and its performance and that of 5 other processing algorithms (L2-WFR, POLYMER, C2RCC, SeaDAS, and SeaDAS-ALT) is compared to the in situ measured reflectances. Water turbidities across the matchups in the Belgian Coastal Zone are about 20?100 FNU, and the overall performance is best for ACOLITE and L2-WFR, with the former providing lowest relative (Mean Absolute Relative Difference, MARD 7?27%) and absolute errors (Mean Average Difference, MAD-0.002, Root Mean Squared Difference, RMSD 0.01?0.016) in the bands between 442 and 681 nm. L2-WFR provides the lowest errors at longer NIR wavelengths (754?885 nm). The algorithms that assume a water reflectance model, i.e. POLYMER and C2RCC, are at present not very suitable for processing imagery over the turbid Belgian coastal waters, with especially the latter introducing problems in the 665 and 709 nm bands, and hence the chlorophyll-a and turbidity retrievals. This may be caused by their internal model and/or training dataset not being well adapted to the waters encountered in the BCZ. The 1020 nm band is used most frequently by ACOLITE/DSF for the estimation of the atmospheric path reflectance (67% of matchups), indicating its usefulness for turbid water atmospheric correction. Turbidity retrieval using a single band algo-rithm showed good performance for L2-WFR and ACOLITE compared to PANTHYR for e.g. the 709 nm band (MARD 15 and 17%), where their reflectances were also very close to the in situ observations (MARD 11%). For the retrieval of chlorophyll-a, all methods except C2RCC gave similar performance, due to the RedEdge band-ratio algorithm being robust to typical spectrally flat atmospheric correction errors. C2RCC does not retain the spectral relationship in the Red and RedEdge bands, and hence its chlorophyll-a concentration retrieval is not at all reliable in Belgian coastal waters. L2-WFR and ACOLITE show similar performance compared to in situ radiometry, but due to the assumption of spatially consistent aerosols, ACOLITE provides less noisy products. With the superior performance of ACOLITE in the 490?681 nm wavelength range, and smoother output products, it can be recommended for processing of S3/OLCI data in turbid waters similar to those encountered in the BCZ. The ACOLITE processor for OLCI and the in situ matchup dataset used here are made available under an open source license.

TI  - Applicability of sentinel lymph node oriented treatment strategy for gallbladder cancer
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundUtility of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in some malignancies has been reported, however, research on that of gallbladder cancer (GBC) is rare. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the concept of SLN is applicable to T2/3 GBC.MethodsA total of 80 patients who underwent resection for gallbladder cancer were enrolled in this study. Patients with GBC were stratified into two groups based on the location of tumor, peritoneal-side (T2p or 3p) and hepatic-side (T2h or 3h) groups. We evaluated the relationship between cystic duct node (CDN) and downstream lymph node (LN) status. CDN was defined as a SLN in this study.ResultsThirty-eight patients were classified into T2, including T2p (n = 18) and T2h (n = 20), and 42 patients into T3, including T3p (n = 22) andT3h (n = 20). The incidence of LN metastasis was significantly higher in hepatic-side than peritoneal-side in both T2 and T3 (P = 0.036 and 0.009, respectively). In T2, 14 T2p had negative CDN and downstream LN, however, three T2h had negative CDN and positive downstream LNs (defined as a skipped LN metastasis) (P = 0.043). In T3, patients with skipped LN metastasis were significantly higher in T3h (n = 11) than those in T3p (n = 2) (P<0.001). There was no recurrence of the local lymph node. Disease-free survival in the T2p and T3p were significantly better than those in the T2h and T3h (P = 0.005 and 0.025, respectively).ConclusionThe concept of SLN can be applicable to T2p GBC, where the downstream LNs dissection can be omitted.

TI  - Air quality predictions with a semi-supervised bidirectional LSTM neural network
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient and accurate air quality predictions can contribute to public health protection and policy decision making. Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an important index for measuring and controlling the degree of air pollution. Recent studies have obtained satisfactory PM2.5 predictions by designing complex models or adding numerous auxiliary data sets to models, and few studies have effectively extracted the spatiotemporal features of PM2.5 time-series data. In this study, a semi-supervised model was proposed for predicting PM2.5 concentrations. The approach includes empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural networks. This model only requires PM2.5 time-series data as inputs, which are regarded as signal data. EMD is applied as an unsupervised feature learning method to decompose the data and extract the frequency and amplitude features. This approach improved short-term trend predictions, especially for sudden changes. BiLSTM was used in the supervised learning stage. Beijing hourly and daily PM2.5 datasets collected from the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre were used to validate the prediction performance of the proposed model. The results demonstrated that this model was more accurate than the other standard LSTMbased model, with four better indicator values at the hourly (RMSE: 6.86 mu g.m(-3), MAE: 4.92 mu g.m(-3), MAPE: 10.66%, R-2: 0.989) and daily (RMSE: 22.58 mu g.m(-3), MAE: 16.67 mu g.m(-3), MAPE: 60.87%, R-2: 0.742) scales. Furthermore, this study proposed a new method of multiscale PM2.5 predictions by reconstructing hourly PM2.5 datasets to form multi-hour datasets. This method could reduce error accumulation in PM2.5 multi-step predictions using LSTM-based models and captured at least 70% of the explained variance in this study, demonstrating the feasibility of the model.

TI  - Crop farming adaptation to droughts in small-scale dryland agriculture in Chile
T2  - WATER RESOURCES AND ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Small-scale agriculture is one of the fundamental economic sectors in Chile. An increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events due to climate change suggest a higher weather risk for the future, with potential consequences for crop choices. These effects are expected to be greater in dryland areas, where producers are more vulnerable to shocks and, therefore, less able to protect themselves against these risks. Using data from the 7th Chilean National Agriculture and Forestry Census, we explore small-scale farmers' cropland decisions as an adaptation strategy to cope with droughts. We use remote sensing data to identify drought events and model the impact of droughts on farmers' decisions using a multivariate fractional model. This model assumes that farmers allocate shares of land over a crop portfolio. Our findings show that farmers in dryland areas reduce high-risk cropping activities after recent drought shocks, choosing crops with shorter growing periods and lower capital and technological costs, such as cereals. However, we found a different cropland pattern in areas with a higher frequency of droughts. In these locations, farmers prefer legumes and tubers, vineyards, fruits and vegetables. Finally, maize and vineyards are more likely to be grown in places with higher temperatures. Results suggest potential crop adaptation strategies in the face of more arid environments in the future.

TI  - NOAA/NCEI and University of Colorado candidate models for IGRF-13
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF) is a set of parameters representing the large-scale internal part of Earth's magnetic field. The 13th generation IGRF requested candidate models for a definitive main field for 2015.0, a provisional main field for 2020.0, and a predictive secular variation covering the period 2020.0-2025.0. The University of Colorado (CU) and the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), have produced these three candidate models for consideration in IGRF-13. In this paper, we present the methodology used to derive our candidate models. Our candidates were built primarily from Swarm satellite data, and also relied on geomagnetic indices derived from the ground observatory network. The ground observatories played a crucial role as independent data in validating our candidates. This paper also provides a retrospective assessment of the CU/NCEI candidate model to the previous IGRF (IGRF-12) and discusses the impact of differences between candidate and final IGRF models on global model errors.

TI  - Moving past postcolonial hybrid spaces: How Buddhist monks make meaning of biology
T2  - SCIENCE EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In formal learning spaces, students must navigate making meaning of both new knowledge and potentially new worldviews. In this qualitative grounded theory study, we examined how adult Buddhist monastic students learned about and described the origin of biodiversity in an introductory biology course. The study was conducted at a Tibetan settlement in south India during an 8-day class that was offered as part of joint program between an American university and the Tibetan Buddhist monastic community. Informed by hybridity theory, we describe four findings regarding how the monks made meaning (i.e., deciding what to learn, framing what to learn, why they should learn, and how they could learn). The monks (1) integrated the new knowledge about physical diversity into their worldview of "mental diversity;" (2) found similarities between their worldview and academic science; (3) were both intrinsically and extrinsically motivated to learn about biology; and (4) valued opportunities to engage in dialectical discourse to assist in meaning making. We conclude that the monks navigated different epistemologies demonstrating secured collateral learning. We encourage researchers to consider using a decolonized perspective when conducting studies of learning in hybrid or third spaces.

TI  - The BGS candidate models for IGRF-13 with a retrospective analysis of IGRF-12 secular variation forecasts
T2  - EARTH PLANETS AND SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The three candidate models submitted by the British Geological Survey for the 13th generation International Geomagnetic Reference Field are described. These DGRF and IGRF models are derived from vector and scalar magnetic field data from the European Space Agency Swarm satellites and ground observatories, covering the period 2013.9 to 2019.7. The internal field model has time dependence for degrees 1 to 15, represented by order 6 B-splines with knots at six monthly intervals. We also solve for a degree 1 external field time dependence describing annual and semi-annual signals with additional dependence on a bespoke Vector Magnetic Disturbance index. Satellite data are weighted by spatial density, along-track standard deviations, and a larger-scale noise estimator defined in terms of a measure of Local Area Vector Activity at the geographically closest magnetic observatories to the sampled datum. Forecasting of the magnetic field secular variation for 2020-2025 is by advection of the main field using steady core surface flows with steady acceleration applied. We also investigate the performance of the previous generation of candidate secular variation models, for IGRF-12, analysing the agreement of the candidates between 2015 and 2020 with the retrospective IGRF-13. We find that there is no clear distinction between the performance of mathematically and physically extrapolated forecasts in the period 2015-2020. We confirm that the methodology for the BGS IGRF-12 predictions performed well, despite observed secular accelerations that are highlighted by our analysis, and thus justify the methodology used for our IGRF-13 SV candidate.

TI  - Assessment of flood vulnerability in some communities in Lokoja, Kogi State, Nigeria, using Participatory Geographic Information Systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Lokoja, the capital of Kogi State, Nigeria, experiences seasonal flooding with devastating consequences on the people and the natural and built environments. In contrast with developed countries, researchers and flood managers in Nigeria have largely ignored Participatory Geographic Information System, which integrates the perceptions and experiences of the people affected by flood events with technical, conventional methods, as a flood management strategy, with flood managers employing a reactive, top-bottom post-flood strategy of relief and rescue. This study employed PGIS to conduct a vulnerability assessment in Lokoja as a pre-flood strategy that involves the communities. Datasets utilized include Landsat imageries, DEM, and soil samples. Spatial multi criteria evaluation using the analytical hierarchy process was employed to analyze flood parameters determined through community participation to evaluate vulnerability while consistency ratio was also calculated to ensure that the comparison of criteria made was consistent. Results revealed that elevation is the most important factor, and land use, among other parameters of flood vulnerability. Out of a total area of 6, 258 Ha, 4, 445 Ha are highly vulnerable and 1, 815 Ha being moderately vulnerable. Comparison consistency ratio was determined to be 0.08 which is acceptable. Based on the results, this study concludes that the perception of affected communities can complement conventional flood research for a more effective response and mitigation strategy. The research therefore recommends the integration of geospatial techniques and participatory approaches for flood vulnerability studies for a proactive, bottom-up approach to flood management.

TI  - Vegetation classification for the management of large mammalian herbivores: a case study at Mushingashi Conservancy, Central Province, Zambia
T2  - AFRICAN JOURNAL OF RANGE & FORAGE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation of Mushingashi Conservancy in central Zambia was classified and mapped to provide a template for wildlife management. Putative vegetation types were delineated using Landsat 8 imagery, then sampled with 73 plots for vegetation composition and structure, and topo-edaphic properties. Classification followed a four-stage process. Valley dambo and floodplain grasslands were first separated as landscape units from wooded plots. Hierarchical cluster analysis was then used to identify 13 vegetation types based on woody composition and structure. Convex hull plots on a principal component analysis biplot successfully delineated the topo-edaphic environment and woody structure of each type. Linear discriminant analysis confirmed differences in topo-edaphic environment among types. The main environmental gradient was from vertic clays, supporting open Acacia woodland, to sandy soils, supporting miombo woodland, but other gradients were also important. Of a total of 193 woody species recorded, 25 occurred only on large termitaria. An influence of environmental gradients independent of plant-available moisture and nutrients is emphasised. Total woody cover decreased conspicuously on clay-rich soils with increased water availability. A functional vegetation classification of this nature is considered an essential first step towards the informed management of rangeland for large herbivores. Potential applications for management are discussed.

TI  - Vegetation trends in a protected area of the Brazilian Atlantic forest
T2  - ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Among worldwide tropical forest ecosystems, the Atlantic forest of Brazil stands out as a highly fragile area and a biodiversity hotspot, with a high degree of endemism. The Capara?o National Park is an important conservation area for this biome, where recent studies have found new species of animals and plants, including endemic and highly vulnerable ones. We analyzed interannual and seasonal trends in vegetation for Capara?o National Park and its buffer zone, using data from MODIS vegetation indices between the years 2001 and 2019. Our methods included both parametric (linear trend and linear correlation) and non-parametric (Mann-Kendall) analyses of interannual trends, wavelet transform, and seasonal trends analysis. We also studied the correlation of the vegetation index data with the variability of monthly rainfall data from the TRMM satellite. We generated linear regression analyses, with precipitation as the independent variable and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as the dependent variable, and repeated this procedure for time lags from 0 to 3 months. In accordance with the findings of the temporal profiles and Mann Kendall trend method identified a prevalence of decreasing trend in the values of vegetation indices in Capara?o National Park, with values higher than 90% of the regions where the result was significant, for the EVI and 80% for the NDVI. For the buffer zone, there is an increasing trend for the NDVI and EVI, with values higher than 50% of the regions where the result was significant. In most of the area, a positive slope was found in the buffer zone, while in the Caparao? National Park the slope was predominantly negative. The r values indicated tendencies predominantly positive for the buffer zone and predominantly negative for the area within the park. 66.9% of the results were positive trends for ndvi in the buffer zone, and 51.7% for EVI, both for r value and slope. In the park area, this trend was negative in 68.9% of the area for ndvi in both methods; 93.8% for the EVI and 93.9% for the NDVI. These differences may be evidence of how vegetation responds to disturbances, once the vegetation in the buffer zone is fragmented and does not have the same protection as vegetation in the park area. The native vegetation in study area shows seasonal similarities, as detected by seasonal trend analysis and wavelets transform. The existence of two annual cycles is a common feature to the biome of Atlantic forest. R values for the correlation of precipitation with vegetation indices indicate high dependence of vegetation on precipitation in the study area. Values in the 0.4 to 0.8 class, represented almost 80% of the buffer zone for the NDVI and 90% for the EVI. For Capara?o National Park, this class accounted for 27% and 38% of the area for the NDVI and EVI, respectively. Vegetation in the protected area was less dependent on rainfall, which can be attributed to the fact that it can better meet its water needs through available water in the soil. In addition, due to anthropogenic pressures and a high degree of forest fragmentation, vegetation in the buffer zone may have less advanced successional stages. Our results collaborate with the range of vegetation studies in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. This methodology can be applied to larger areas around the world to provide information on vegetation trends conditions and influence of climatic variables.

TI  - Developing distance-dependent growth models from irregularly measured sample plot data - A case for <i>Larix olgensis</i> in Northeast China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The need for distance-dependent individual-tree models for diameter increment and survival is increasing due to the increased use of individual-tree detection in forest inventories based on remote sensing data. Distance-dependent models can be used to analyze alternative thinning schemes, planting patterns and species mixing. The present study developed a methodology to develop distance-dependent models from data where the measurement interval of the sample plots is irregular. The method employs optimization to find the parameters of a simulation software in such a way that the simulated diameter distribution at the end of the measurement interval matches with the measured distribution. The methodology was applied to Larix olgensis A. Henry plantations of the Heilongjiang province of northeastern China. The distance-dependent models were fitted using two alternative competition indices adopted from earlier literature. The optimal way of computing the competition indices was solved simultaneously with the coefficients of model predictors. Distance-independent models were also fitted, and they provided a reference for assessing the performance of the distance-dependent models. The results indicated that the distance-dependent models did not provide better estimates on the periodical change of stand basal area or number of trees per hectare, compared to distance-independent models. However, the distance-dependent models are still useful as they enable model-based analyses of spatial questions.

TI  - Sentinel-1 remote sensing data and Hydrologic Engineering Centres River Analysis System two-dimensional integration for flash flood detection and modelling in New Cairo City, Egypt
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital surface models, land use and rainfall data were used to simulate water areas using Hydrologic Engineering Centres River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) software. Multi-temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) was used for the detection of flood prone area to calibrate HEC-RAS, due to the lack of data validation in the New Cairo City, Egypt. The thresholding water detection method was applied to two Sentinel-1 images, one pre- and one post-flash flood event from April 24 to 27, 2018. The threshold method was used to detect water areas from SAR Sentinel-1 images. Feature statistical agreement F-1 and F-2 values ranged from 73.4 to 77.7% between water areas extracted based on backscattering values between 19.97 and 16.53 in decibels (dB) and reference water areas obtained using an optical image of the Sentinel-2 satellite. The similarity between simulated HEC-RAS two-dimensional (2D) of water areas and reference water areas based on SAR data ranged between 74.2 and 89.7% using feature statistical agreement values F-1 and F-2. It provides a clear suggestion that, in the absence of field observations, SAR data can be used to calibrate the model. Two flood hazard maps created based on water velocity and depth were obtained from HEC-RAS 2D simulation. The obtained maps indicated that 11% of the roads and 50% of the buildings in New Cairo City are exposed to high hazard areas. Furthermore, 28% of the bare land is situated in a very high vulnerability area. We recommend the use of obtained hazard map in supporting emergency response, and designing effective emergency plans.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, satellite data and those obtained from air quality monitoring stations were used to evaluate the effect of cloud seeding missions conducted from January 2017 to March 2017 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). To determine PM variability during and after the cloud seeding missions, information on daily mean particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations obtained from 20 air quality ground-based stations was analyzed from January 2017 to April 2017. The stations were divided according to four distinct geographic zones, which include petrochemical and non-petrochemical industrial, residential, and low populated areas. Moreover, data from the MAIAC 1-km product (MCD19A2) obtained using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer onboard the Terra satellite were used to identify the correlation between aerosol optical depth and ground PM concentrations. The results showed that among the areas, the petrochemical and non-petrochemical industrial areas had the highest PM2.5 levels. Urban areas located adjacent to deserts had significantly higher PM10 concentrations than other urban areas. The PM concentration was high during the period of cloud seeding missions. This finding indicated that silver iodine crystals fired during the missions might have increased the concentration of PM in the air. Moreover, cloud seeding missions might have a more significant effect in increasing PM10 concentrations compared with PM2.5 concentrations. Hence, local weather conditions might have affected the decay of silver iodine particles during the missions. Long-range air mass transport may have an influence on the natural and anthropogenic particle concentrations in land and water bodies surrounding the UAE.

TI  - Remote sensing of trophic cascades: multi-temporal landsat imagery reveals vegetation change driven by the removal of an apex predator
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Trophic cascade theory predicts that predators indirectly benefit plants by limiting herbivore consumption. As humans have removed large predators from most terrestrial ecosystems the effect of their absence is unrecognized. Objectives A manipulation of dingo populations across Australia's dingo-proof fence, within the Strzelecki Desert, was used to assess how predator absence has altered vegetation cover dynamics at landscape and site scales. Methods Landscape-scale analysis used Landsat fractional vegetation cover time series statistics to classify landforms and examine vegetation dynamics either side of the dingo fence. Generalised additive models were used to analyse the influence of predator absence on site-scale observations of fauna abundance and vegetation cover. Results The location of the dingo fence was visible as a change in both the standard deviation and maximum of non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) cover (e.g. wood and dry leaves) over 32 years (1988-2020). On average, NPV cover of swales decreased in the standard deviation by 1.4% and in the maximum by 5.0% where dingo abundance was reduced. The differences were consistent with suppressed vegetation growth following rainfall, due to high grazing pressure, where predators were rare. The landscape-scale analysis was supported by site-scale observations. Conclusions The influence of the trophic cascade was observable at both the landscape and site scales, suggesting that apex predator removal has significantly affected the arid ecosystem's responses to resource pulses. Analogous effects may exist across the large areas of the planet over which apex predators have been extirpated.

TI  - Estimation of post-fire vegetation recovery in boreal forests using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of post-fire vegetation recovery is essential for forest management and wildfire policy-making. In the last few decades, vegetation indices have been widely used to monitor post-fire vegetation recovery by comparison with the pre-fire state. In this study, vegetation recovery is estimated using Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF), which is a by-product of photosynthesis and can reflect the physiological characteristics of a plant. We found that 20 years is insufficient for vegetation recovery, as the SIF within burned areas exhibited a significant increasing trend, which was most notable within the first 6 to 10 years after a wildfire. When comparing the SIF within and outside burned areas, we found that, during the first 3 to 6 years, SIF values outside burned areas were larger than that within burned areas; however, after similar to 6 years, the SIF within the burned areas exceeded that outside burned areas owing to the different carbon sequestration intensities of different vegetation recovery stages. Field photos of recovering vegetation were then compared with the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) trend within the burned area, and it was found that, although the EVI reached pre-fire levels or stabilised, vegetation recovery was continuing.

TI  - Prenatal PM<sub>2.5</sub> exposure and neurodevelopment at 2 years of age in a birth cohort from Mexico city
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYGIENE AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Recent studies have reported that air pollution exposure may have neurotoxic properties.Objective: To examine longitudinal associations between prenatal particles less than 2.5 mu m in diameter (PM2.5) exposure and neurodevelopment during the first two years of children's life.Methods: Analysis was conducted in PROGRESS, a longitudinal birth cohort between 2007 and 2013 in Mexico City. We used satellite data to predict daily PM2.5 concentrations at high spatial resolution. Multivariate mixed-effect regression models were adjusted to examine cognitive, language and motor scores in children up to 24 months of age (n = 740) and each trimester-specific and whole pregnancy exposure to PM2.5.Results: Models adjusted by child sex, gestational age, birth weight, smoking and mother's IQ, showed that each increase of 1 mu g/m(3) of PM2.5 was associated with a decreased language function of 0.38 points (95% CI: 0.77, 0.01). PM2.5 exposure at third trimester of pregnancy contributed most to the observed association.Conclusion: Our findings suggest that language development up to 24 months of age may be particularly sensitive to PM2.5 exposure during pregnancy.

TI  - Investigating connections between COVID-19 pandemic, air pollution and community interventions for Pakistan employing geoinformation technologies
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Several major cities that witnessed heavy air pollution by particulate matter (PM2.5) concentration and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) have contributed to high rate of infection and severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Owing to the negative impact of COVID-19 on health and economy, it is imperative to predict the pandemic trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. Pakistan is one of the mostly affected countries by recent COVID-19 pandemic in terms of COVID-cases and economic crises. Like other several Asian countries to combat the virus impacts, Pakistan implemented non-pharmacological interventions (NPI), such as national lockdowns. The current study investigates the effect of major interventions across three out of four provinces of Pakistan for the period from the start of the COVID-19 in March 22, 2020 until June 30, 2020, when lockdowns were started to be eased. High-resolution data on NO2 was recorded from Sentinel-5's Precursor spacecraft with TRO-POspheric Monitoring Instrument (Sentinel-5P TROPOMI). Similarly, PM2.5 data were collected from sampling sties to investigate possible correlation among these pollutants and COVID-19. In addition, growth and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models utilizing time-series data of COVID-19 from February 26 to December 31, 2020, with- and without NPI that encompass the predicted number of infected cases, peak time, impact on the healthcare system and mortality in Pakistan. Maximum mean PM2.5 concentration of 108 mu gm-3 was recorded for Lahore with the range from 51 to 215 mu gm(-3), during strict lockdown (L), condition. This is three times higher than Pak-EPA and US-EPA and four times for WHO guidelines, followed by Peshawar (97.2 and 58 +/- 130), Islamabad (83 and 158 +/- 58), and Karachi (78 and 50 +/- 140). The majority of sampling sites in Lahore showed NO2 levels higher than 8.75E-5 (mol/m2) in 2020 compared to 2019 during "L" period. The susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model depicted a strong correlation (r) between the predicted and reported cases for Punjab (r = 0.79), Sindh (r = 0.91), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) (r = 94) and Islamabad (r = 0.85). Findings showed that major NPI and lockdowns especially have had a large effect on minimizing transmission. Continued community intervention should be undertaken to keep transmission of SARS-CoV-2 under control in cities where higher incidence of COVID-19 cases until the vaccine is available. This study provides a methodological framework that if adopted can assist epidemiologist and policy makers to be well-prepared in advance in cities where PM2.5 concentration and NO2 levels are already high in order to minimize the potential risk of further spread of COVID-19 cases.

TI  - Initial experience with positron emission tomography/computed tomography in addition to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in preoperative risk assessment of endometrial cancer patients
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Improved preoperative evaluation of lymph node status could potentially replace lymphadenectomy in women with endometrial cancer. PET/CT was routinely implemented in the preoperative workup of endometrial cancer at St Olav's University Hospital in 2016. Experience with PET/CT is limited, and there is no consensus about the use of PET/CT in the diagnostic workup of endometrial cancer. The aim of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT compared to standard CT/MRI in identifying lymph node metastases in endometrial cancer with histologically confirmed lymph node metastases as the standard of reference. We especially wanted to look at PET/CT as a supplement to the sentinel lymph node algorithm in the detection of paraaortic lymph nodes.Study design: A retrospective study included all women undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer from January 2016 through July 2019 at St Olav's University Hospital. Clinical data, results of CT, MRI, and PET/CT, and histopathological results were analyzed.Results: Among 185 patients included, 27 patients (15 %) had lymph node metastases. 17 (63 %) had pelvic lymph node metastases, one (4 %) had isolated paraaortic lymph node metastases, and 9 (33 %) had lymph node metastases in both the pelvis and the paraaortic region. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of PET/CT for the detection of lymph node metastases were 63 %, 98 %, 85 %, 94 %, and 93 %, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of CT/MRI were 41 %, 98 %, 73 %, 91 %, and 90 %, respectively (p = 0.07). For the 26 pelvic lymph node metastases, PET/CT had a sensitivity of 58 %, compared to 42 % for CT/MRI (p = 0.22). PET/CT detected all 10 paraaortic lymph node metastases, for a sensitivity of 100 %, compared to 50 % for CT/MRI (p = 0.06).Conclusions: PET is superior to CT/MRI for detection of lymph node metastases in endometrial cancer, particularly in detecting paraaortic lymph node metastases. The ability of preoperative PET to exclude paraaortic lymph node metastases may strengthen the credibility of the sentinel lymph node algorithm. (C) 2021 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Detection of Wakashio oil spill off Mauritius using Sentinel-1 and 2 data: Capability of sensors, image transformation methods and mapping
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spill incidents contaminate water bodies, and damage the coastal and marine environment including coral reefs and mangroves, and therefore, monitoring the oil spills is highly important. This study discriminates the Wakashio oil spill, which occurred off Mauritius, located in the Indian Ocean on August 06, 2020 using the Sentinel-1 and 2 data acquired before, during and after the spill to understand the spreading of the spill and assess its impact on the coastal environment. The interpretation of VV polarization images of Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) C-band (5.404 GHz) of Sentinel-1 acquired between July 5 and September 3, 2020 showed the occurrence and distribution of oil spill as dark warped patches. The images of band ratios (5 thorn 6)/7, (3 thorn 4)/2, (11 thorn 12)/8 and 3/2, (3 thorn 4)/2, (6 thorn 7)/5 of the Sentinel-2 data detected the oil spill. The images of decorrelated spectral bands 4, 3 and 2 distinguished the very thick, thick and thin oil spills in a different tone and showed clearly their distribution over the lagoon and offshore, and the accumulation of spilled oil on the coral reefs and along the coast. The distribution of post-oil spill along the coast was interpreted using the images acquired after 21 August 2020. The accuracy of oil spill mapping was assessed by classifying the SAR-C data and decorrelated images of the MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) data using the Parallelepiped supervised algorithm and confusion matrix. The results showed that the overall accuracy is on an average 91.72 and 98.77%, and Kappa coefficient 0.84 and 0.96, respectively. The satellite-derived results were validated with field studies. The MSI results showed the occurrence and spread of oil spill having different thicknesses, and supported the results of SAR. This study demonstrated the capability of Sentinel sensors and the potential of image processing methods to detect, monitor and assess oil spill impact on environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Deep learning-based models for temporal satellite data processing: Classification of paddy transplanted fields
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Deep learning-based frameworks have not been much explored to incorporate the temporal dimension of the remote sensing data. In this research work, deep learning-based models have been developed which exploit the spectral-temporal domain of bi-sensor remote sensing data obtained from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 satellites. Application of proposed deep learning frameworks has been tested for mapping transplanted paddy fields using Class Based Sensor Independent -Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (CBSI-NDVI) spectral reduction approach. Two deep learning-based models viz., one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1-D CNN) and hybrid 1-D Convolutional Neural Network ? Long Short Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) consisting of 1-D CNN and LSTM layers respectively were developed. For both of the models the optimized model hyper-parameters were also deduced. Though the performance of both the models were above satisfactory level still the 1-D CNN model performed slightly better than the hybrid 1-D CNN-LSTM based model with average overall accuracies of 93.75% and 91.25% respectively. The average F-measure values were computed as 0.93 and 0.90 respectively for the 1-D CNN based and hybrid CNN-LSTM based models. This study indicates that 1-D CNN based deep learning models provide an effective solution to handle mono/bi-sensor temporal remote sensing data of medium spatial resolution with small size training datasets.

TI  - An ecological dynamics conceptualisation of physical 'education': Where we have been and where we could go next
T2  - PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In this paper, we explore physical education from a relational worldview. Theoretically guided by an ecological dynamics framework, this perspective calls us to conceptualise 'education' in its etymological roots - ex-ducere - meaning 'to lead' an individual 'out' into the world. In doing so, an educator would employ a 'softer' pedagogy, seeking to guide the attention and encourage exploration of a less experienced individual toward the perception of things that can support, or regulate, their behaviours. This pedagogical approach could help learners to self regulate in the environment, becoming more responsive to emergent opportunities for action available.Theory: This is a pedagogy of exploration, search, discovery, invention and adaptation that is devised from three of the contributing theories to ecological dynamics: ecological psychology, dynamical systems theory and complexity sciences. Throughout this paper we show that this progressive view contrasts with the more traditional perspectives of physical education, grounded in established pedagogical approaches that are often pre-occupied with instilling idealised ways of moving in learners, typically at the expense of appreciating how the environment reciprocally shapes behaviour.Practical Implications: In an effort to support educators with integrating an ecological conceptualisation of PE into their practice we outline three cornerstones. We bring these ideas to life by concluding the paper with the presentation of three practical examples that transcends the physical educational journey from primary/elementary school through to secondary/ high schools. We exemplify how an ecological approach to PE can move us closer to achieving the aim of enabling children to lead a physically active life beyond the school gates.

TI  - <i>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</i> antimicrobial resistance in Spain: a prospective multicentre study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Gonococcal infection is one of the most reported sexually transmitted infections and antimicrobial resistance in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) is challenging for the treatment of this infection. This observational study aimed to describe antimicrobial resistance of NG and epidemiological data from patients with gonococcal infection in eight regions of Spain, for updating the local therapeutic guidelines.Methods: MICs of penicillin, cefixime, ceftriaxone, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin and gentamicin were determined by Etest for all NG isolates recovered from 1 April 2018 to 30 September 2019 from 10 hospitals in Spain. Resistance determinants were identified using logistic regression analysis. Differences with a P value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for 2571 gonococci isolated from 2429 patients. 44.5% (945/2124) of patients were MSM. The resistance rate to extended-spectrum cephalosporins was low, with 0.2% (6/2561) of isolates resistant to ceftriaxone and 1.7% (44/2517) of isolates resistant to cefixime. The overall azithromycin resistance rate was 12.1% (310/2560), but differed greatly depending on the area. 56.2%(1366/2429) of the strains studied were ciprofloxacin resistant. MIC50 and MIC90 values of gentamicin and fosfomycin were 4 and 8 mg/L and 24 and 48 mg/L, respectively.Conclusions: Our study shows that NG susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins remains high in Spain. The azithromycin resistance rate questions the suitability of dual therapy. This study provides data of interest for updating the national treatment guidelines and highlights the need to develop and implement a national sentinel gonococcal antimicrobial susceptibility programme.

TI  - Assessment of breast cancer surgical margins with multimodal optical microscopy: A feasibility clinical study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Providing surgical margin information during breast cancer surgery is crucial for the success of the procedure. The margin is defined as the distance from the tumor to the cut surface of the resection specimen. The consensus among surgeons and radiation oncologists is that there should be no tumor left within 1 to maximum 2 mm from the surface of the surgical specimen. If a positive margin remains, there is substantial risk for tumor recurrence, which may also result in potentially reduced cosmesis and eventual need for mastectomy. In this paper we report a novel multimodal optical imaging instrument based on combined high-resolution confocal microscopy-optical coherence tomography imaging for assessing the presence of potential positive margins on surgical specimens. Since rapid specimen analysis is critical during surgery, this instrument also includes a fluorescence imaging channel to enable rapid identification of the areas of the specimen that have potential positive margins. This is possible by specimen incubation with a cancer specific agent prior to imaging. In this study we used a quenched contrast agent, which is activated by cancer specific enzymes, such as urokinase plasminogen activators (uPA). Using this agent or a similar one, one may limit the use of high-resolution optical imaging to only fluorescence-highlighted areas for visualizing tissue morphology at the sub-cellular scale and confirming or ruling out cancer presence. Preliminary evaluation of this technology was performed on 20 surgical specimens and testing of the optical imaging findings was performed against histopathology. The combination of the three imaging modes allowed for high correlation between optical image analysis and histological ground-truth. The initial results are encouraging, showing instrument capability to assess margins on clinical specimens with a positive predictive value of 1.0 and a negative predictive value of 0.83.

TI  - Declined trend in herbaceous plant green-up dates on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau caused by spring warming slowdown
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - There has been much debate on the temporal change trend and existence of a turning point in spring green-up date (GUD) of plants on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP). Most previous studies on the QTP used remote sensing data, which have large uncertainties. In this study, using a large amount of long-term ground observation data at 27 phenological stations across the QTP (1694 GUD records), we showed that on the whole, QTP herbaceous plant GUD insignificantly advanced during 1982-2017. Although the direction of the GUD trend did not change from 1982 to 2017, the magnitude of the advancing trend greatly weakened after 1999. According to our estimated results from 28 paired GUD time series, the overall GUD trend shifted from -2.70 clays/decade during 1982-1999 to -0.56 days/decade during 2000-2017. This finding contrasts with the conclusions of previous satellite-based studies, which either reported a continuous significant advancement of GUD or a turning point in the mid-to-late 1990s. Through partial correlation analysis and partial least squares regression, we found that winter and spring air temperatures were the primary climatic factors that influenced the temporal change in GUD, and both had negative effects on GUD. The decreased GUD trend was mainly attributable to the warming slowdown in spring. On average, the spring warming rate decreased by 52.43% after 1999, whereas the winter warming rate displayed no obvious change. This study also found that the GUD of (orbs showed stronger sensitivity to air temperature change than that of sedges and grasses. This indicates that (orbs are more competitive in adaptation to climate warming, which might shift plant community structure and affect ecosystem service function. Moreover, the declined advancement in GUD implies that the spring phenologically driven increase in carbon uptake may have also slowed in the past two decades. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Penile cancer
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS DISEASE PRIMERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Penile squamous cell carcinoma (PSCC) is a rare cancer with orphan disease designation and a prevalence of 0.1-1 per 100,000 men in high-income countries, but it constitutes up to 10% of malignancies in men in some African, Asian and South American regions. Risk factors for PSCC include the absence of childhood circumcision, phimosis, chronic inflammation, poor penile hygiene, smoking, immunosuppression and infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). Several different subtypes of HPV-related and non-HPV-related penile cancers have been described, which also have different prognostic profiles. Localized disease can be effectively managed by topical therapy, surgery or radiotherapy. As PSCC is characterized by early lymphatic spread and imaging is inadequate for the detection of micrometastatic disease, correct and upfront surgical staging of the inguinal lymph nodes is crucial in disease management. Advanced stages of disease require multimodal management. Optimal sequencing of treatments and patient selection are still being investigated. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy regimens are the mainstay of systemic therapy for advanced PSCC, but they have poor and non-durable responses and high rates of toxic effects, indicating a need for the development of more effective and less toxic therapeutic options. Localized and advanced penile cancers and their treatment have profound physical and psychosexual effects on the quality of life of patients and survivors by altering sexual and urinary function and causing lymphoedema. This Primer discusses the epidemiology of penile cancer and mechanisms underlying its development, including HPV infection. The authors explain contemporary and possible future diagnostic and management approaches in localized and advanced disease and highlight important considerations around the quality of life of affected patients.

AB  - Arboviral infections are re-emerging diseases of public health concern circulating among wild animals and human populations due to shortage of strong entomological data in addition to increasing urbanization, transportation and mosquito adaptation to complex environment in Ethiopia. This study assessed the response of Aedes mosquito to interventions (environmental management and Chemical (Temephos and Propoxure) spray) made to control the Chikungunya outbreak in Dire Dawa, Eastern Ethiopia. A before and after intervention entomological study design was used to address all villages, with simple random sampling technique. To determine the vector density, entomological indices (House index, Container index, Bretaeu index and Pupae index) were calculated. A total of 1297 containers were inspected in 800 households for the presence of Aedes immature and adult. Out of 1297 containers inspected, 1128 (87%) were found be Aedes larvae/pupae positive. A total 1289 mosquitoes were collected, 1264 (98%) were Aedes and the rest 25 (2%) were Culex mosquitoes. The house index, container index, bretaue index and pupae index before and after control intervention was (90.125%, 7.4%), (92.87%, 14.75%), (141.75%, 20.5%) and (1431.5, 4%) respectively. The infestation indices of Aedes mosquitoes drastically reduced after control interventions which imply that deploying integrated vector control intervention, like environmental management, insecticidal applications are effective in Aedes mosquito control during outbreaks of arboviral diseases. Permanent and comprehensive sentinel sites should be established fort continuous surveillance of vector status and diseases to halt cyclic transmission.

TI  - A multi-scale daily SPEI dataset for drought characterization at observation stations over mainland China from 1961 to 2018
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - The monthly standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) can be used to monitor and assess drought characteristics with 1-month or longer drought duration. Based on data from 1961 to 2018 at 427 meteorological stations across mainland China, we developed a daily SPEI dataset to overcome the shortcoming of the coarse temporal scale of monthly SPEI. Our dataset not only can be used to identify the start and end dates of drought events, but also can be used to investigate the meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomic droughts with a different timescales. In the present study, the SPEI data with 3-month (about 90 d) timescale were taken as a demonstration example to analyze spatial distribution and temporal changes in drought conditions for mainland China. The SPEI data with a 3-month (about 90 d) timescale showed no obvious intensifying trends in terms of severity, duration, and frequency of drought events from 1961 to 2018. Our drought dataset serves as a unique resource with daily resolution to a variety of research communities including meteorology, geography, and natural hazard studies. The daily SPEI dataset developed is free, open, and publicly available from this study. The dataset with daily SPEI is publicly available via the figshare portal (Wang et al., 2020c), with https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12568280.

TI  - Circadian Responses to Light-Flash Exposure: Conceptualization and New Data Guiding Future Directions
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A growing number of studies document circadian phase-shifting after exposure to millisecond light flashes. When strung together by intervening periods of darkness, these stimuli evoke pacemaker responses rivaling or outmatching those created by steady luminance, suggesting that the circadian system's relationship to light can be contextualized outside the principle of simple dose-dependence. In the current review, we present a brief chronology of this work. We then develop a conceptual model around it that attempts to relate the circadian effects of flashes to a natural integrative process the pacemaker uses to intermittently sample the photic information available at dawn and dusk. Presumably, these snapshots are employed as building blocks in the construction of a coherent representation of twilight the pacemaker consults to orient the next day's physiology (in that way, flash-resetting of pacemaker rhythms might be less an example of a circadian visual illusion and more an example of the kinds of gestalt inferences that the image-forming system routinely makes when identifying objects within the visual field; i.e., closure). We conclude our review with a discussion on the role of cones in the pacemaker's twilight predictions, providing new electrophysiological data suggesting that classical photoreceptors-but not melanopsin-are necessary for millisecond, intermediate-intensity flash responses in ipRGCs (intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells). Future investigations are necessary to confirm this "Cone Sentinel Model" of circadian flash-integration and twilight-prediction, and to further define the contribution of cones vs. rods in transducing pacemaker flash signals.

TI  - Improved retrieval of land surface biophysical variables from time series of Sentinel-3 OLCI TOA spectral observations by considering the temporal autocorrelation of surface and atmospheric properties
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of essential vegetation properties from remote sensing is crucial for a quantitative understanding of the Earth system. Ill-posedness of the model inversion problem leads to multiple interpretations of one satellite observation, and using prior information is a promising way to reduce the ill-posedness and increase the accuracy of land surface products. Tobler's first law of geography states that "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things". Likewise, it is expected that the state of an object at a single moment is related to the state at every other moment, but temporally near attributes are more related than distant ones. This temporal autocorrelation is a vital source of prior information and can be used to improve the retrieval accuracy. In this study, we develop a retrieval framework that makes use of the temporal autocorrelation and dependence of land surface and atmospheric properties. We apply this retrieval algorithm to Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) satellite data to derive land surface biophysical variables with a focus on leaf area index (LAI) from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance observations. The results from both a synthetic dataset and a real satellite dataset show that the use of the temporal continuity as a priori information improves the accuracy of the estimation of land surface properties, such as leaf chlorophyll content and LAI. Compared with the MODIS LAI products, much less unrealistic short-term fluctuations are found in the LAI retrievals from OLCI with the time-series retrieval approach across different land cover types including cropland, forest and savannah. Field measurements of LAI at two forest sites quantitatively confirm that the estimated LAI from OLCI is reasonably accurate with R-2 > 0.65 and RMSE < 1.00 m(2)m(-2). Overall, the time series retrieval results in more robust and smoother time series than standard retrievals of LAI from individual scenes, more stable retrievals than the MODIS LAI product, and values of LAI that match better with reported measurements in the field. The present retrieval framework can make better use of time series of spectral observations and potentially of multi-sensor observations.

TI  - Long-term trends of surface and canopy layer urban heat island intensity in 272 cities in the mainland of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The canopy layer urban heat island (CLUHI) and surface urban heat island (SUHI) refer to higher canopy layer and land surface temperatures in urban areas than in rural areas, respectively. The long-term trends of CLUHIs are poorly understood at the regional scale. In this study, 1 km resolution air temperature (Ta) data for the 2001-2018 period in the mainland of China were mapped using satellite data and station-based Ta data. Subsequently, the temporal trends of the CLUHI and SUHI intensities (CLUHII and SUHII, respectively) were investigated in 272 cities in the mainland of China. The Ta was estimated with high accuracy, with a root mean square error ranging from 0.370 degrees C to 0.592 degrees C. The CLUHII and SUHII increased significantly in over half of the cities in spring and summer, over one-third of the cities in autumn, and over one-fifth of the cities in winter. The trends of the nighttime SUHII were strongly related to the CLUHII calculated using mean and minimum Ta (correlation coefficients ranging from 0.613 to 0.770), whereas the relationships between the trends of the day-time SUHII and CLUHII were relatively weak. Human activities were the major driving forces for the increase in the CLUHII and SUHII. The difference in impervious surfaces between urban and rural areas was significantly correlated with the CLUHII and SUHII in approximately half of the cities. Meteorological factors were significantly correlated with the CLUHII and SUHII in few cities. This study highlights the trends of the significant increase in the CLUHII and SUHII in the mainland of China, which may have negative effects on humans and the environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland, an important carbon pool on the earth, is of great significance for human beings and the environment. In this study, we modeled the wetland NPP using Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) and time series with high spatial and temporal resolution generated by Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 images. Firstly, the downscaled Landsat 8 data (10 m) combined with Sentinel-2 data were utilized to produce time series with high spatial and temporal resolution. Subsequently, all Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data within each stage (five stages.) are employed to obtain monthly wetland maps in these stages by an adaptive Stacking algorithm, respectively. Then, monthly fraction cover maps (mainly sedge, reed and poplar) were derived from the time series reflectance product using fully constrained least squares (FCLS) in these five Stages, respectively. Finally, monthly normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface water index (LSWI), temperature, solar radiation, as well as wetland maps and were combined to estimate monthly and total NPP in the Dongting Lake wetland by CASA model. The high correlation (R-2 = 0.8445) and low (RMSE = 20.30 g C/m2) between the estimated NPP using proposed method and measured NPP demonstrated a significant linear relationship and the estimated NPP based on Sentinel-2 data using the CASA model with the above-described input parameters is creditable. The NPP estimation method in this paper is expected to provide scientific data support for quantitative research of regional wetland carbon reserves and sustainable development.

TI  - Fractional monitoring of desert vegetation degradation, recovery, and greening using optimized multi-endmembers spectral mixture analysis in a dryland basin of Northwest China
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate identification of desert vegetation dynamics in arid regions is challenging because of its complex composition of grass species, obscure boundary with non-desert vegetation, and high sensitiveness to climatic variations. This study examined the ability of optimized multi-endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA) for monitoring desert vegetation degradation, recovery, and greening in a dryland basin of Northwest China using Landsat time series data from the 1990s to 2016. Eight modeled endmember fractions were generated using the best endmember model with the lowest fraction error and root mean square error (RMSE). Abundances of non-desert vegetation, desert vegetation, soil, and impervious surface areas were incorporated based on the eight original fractions and validated using high spatial resolution images. Finally, the post-classification comparison approach was used to detect desert vegetation degradation, recovery, and greening. Results show that: (1) More than 97% of the land pixels were modeled successfully into eight endmember fractions for each period with the mean RMSE less than 0.01. All four simulated abundances had high correlations (r = 0.89-0.96) with the corresponding reference data, indicating good performance of MESMA in this study; (2) Desert vegetation increased dramatically (772.68 km(2)) during the 26-year period. The major change was desert vegetation recovery with a total area of 10,705 km(2), followed by degradation with a total area of 4,715 km(2). The greening area was the smallest, covering only 1,509 km(2); (3) Increased precipitation was the major contributor for desert vegetation greening in the west of upper region while decreased precipitation was the major contributor for the degradation in the west of lower region. Anthropogenic factors (e.g., improvement of irrigation, crop expansion) were major contributors for the change in desert vegetation in the middle region. This research demonstrates that MESMA is promising in detecting desert vegetation dynamics in semi-arid and arid regions.

TI  - Microplastics pollution in the soil mulched by dust-proof nets: A case study in Beijing, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - As a driving factor of global changes, microplastics have gradually attracted widespread attention. Although MPs are extensively studied in aquatic systems, their presence and fate in terrestrial systems and soil are not fully understood. In China, construction-land must be mulched by dust-proof nets to prevent and control fine particulate pollution, which may cause MPs pollution and increase ecological risks. In order to understand the pollution characteristics and sources of MP in the soil covered by dust nets, we conducted a case study in Beijing. Our results revealed that the abundance of MPs in soil mulched by dust-proof nets ranged from 272 to 13,752 items/kg. Large-sized particles (>1000 mm) made up a significant proportion (49.83%) of MPs in the study area. The dominant MP polymer types were polyethylene (50.12%) and polypropylene (41.25%). The accumulation of MPs in construction- site soil mulched by dust-proof nets (average, 4910.2 items/kg) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that in unmulched soil (average, 840.8 items/kg), which indicates a dust-proof nets as an essential source of microplastics in the soil of construction land. We applied a remote-sensing data analysis technique based on remote imagery acquired from a high-resolution remote-sensing satellite combined with deeplearning convolutional neural networks to automatically detect and segment dust-proof nets. Based on high-resolution remote sensing images and using a U-net convolutional neural network, we extract the coverage area of Beijing's dust-proof nets (18.6 km(2)). Combined the abundance of MPs and the dustproof nets' coverage area, we roughly estimate that 7.616 x 10(9) to 3.581 x 10(11) MPs accumulated in the soil mulched by the dust-proof nets in Beijing. Such a large amount of MPs may cause a series of environmental problems. This study will highlight the understanding of soil MPs pollution and its potential environmental impacts for scientists and policymakers. It provides suggestions for decisionmakers to formulate effective legislation and policies, so as to protect human health and protect the soil and the wider environment. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Doppler imaging detects bacterial infection of living tissue
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Living 3D in vitro tissue cultures, grown from immortalized cell lines, act as living sentinels as pathogenic bacteria invade the tissue. The infection is reported through changes in the intracellular dynamics of the sentinel cells caused by the disruption of normal cellular function by the infecting bacteria. Here, the Doppler imaging of infected sentinels shows the dynamic characteristics of infections. Invasive Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and Listeria monocytogenes penetrate through multicellular tumor spheroids, while non-invasive strains of Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua remain isolated outside the cells, generating different Doppler signatures. Phase distributions caused by intracellular transport display Levy statistics, introducing a Levy-alpha spectroscopy of bacterial invasion. Antibiotic treatment of infected spheroids, monitored through time-dependent Doppler shifts, can distinguish drug-resistant relative to non-resistant strains. This use of intracellular Doppler spectroscopy of living tissue sentinels opens a new class of microbial assay with potential importance for studying the emergence of antibiotic resistance. Honggu Choi et al. use biodynamic Doppler imaging to monitor bacterial infection of 3D living tissue and describe changes in the intracellular motions of living host tissue induced by early-stage infection. This work demonstrates the potential for the clinical use of this method to test for antibiotic-resistant infections.

TI  - Quantifying influences of anthropogenic-natural factors on ecological land evolution in mega-urban agglomeration: A case study of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao greater Bay area
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling ecological land evolution and determining the responsible driving forces is a common research topic in land use and landscape ecology. However, the interaction effect and dynamic change of anthropogenic-natural factors on the ecological land evolution of urban agglomerations is still unclear. Supported by Google Earth Engine, this study used Landsat satellite imagery and random forest algorithm to obtain the land cover datasets of Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area from 1990 to 2019. Furthermore, a geographic detector was used to identify the driving factors' impact on ecological land evolution by quantifying nonlinear associations, change characteristics, and mechanisms. The results show: (1) Ecological land shifted from decline and fragmentation (1990-2010) to growth and integration (2010-2019). (2) Population density (q = 0.83) and land urbanization rate (q = 0.75) mainly controlled the ecological land evolution, illustrating more explanatory power than other factors, and accounting for higher proportion of area as the determinant factor in the study region. All driving factors interactions were bivariate, and the interaction between population density and elevation had the largest influence (q = 0.92). (3) Anthropogenic factors had a generally greater influence on ecological land than natural factors, and the impact of population density and GDP per capita exhibited a continuous increase, while land urbanization rate first decreased (1990-2000) and then increased (2000-2019) in response to industrial restructuring and accelerated urbanization. Due to the intensification of anthropogenic activities, the effect of average annual temperature and precipitation declined by 69% and 77%, respectively. The conclusions indicate that the interaction and spatially heterogeneous distribution of anthropogenic-natural factors should be comprehensively considered when designing a system based on cooperative mechanisms to improve ecological protection efficiency.

TI  - Which medical disciplines diagnose and treat melanoma in Europe in 2019? A survey of experts from melanoma centres in 27 European countries
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE EUROPEAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY AND VENEREOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives The incidence of melanoma is increasing. This places significant burden on societies to provide efficient cancer care. The European Cancer Organisation recently published the essential requirements for quality melanoma care. The present study is aimed for the first time to roughly estimate the extent to which these requirements have been met in Europe.Materials and methods A web-based survey of experts from melanoma centres in 27 European countries was conducted from 1 February to 1 August 2019. Data on diagnostic techniques, surgical and medical treatment, organization of cancer care and education were collected and correlated with national health and economic indicators and mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) as a surrogate for survival. Univariate linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the correlations. SPSS software was used. Statistical significance was set at P The MIR was lower in countries with a high health expenditure per capita and with a higher numbers of general practitioners (GPs) and surgeons (SURG) per million inhabitants. In these countries, GPs and dermatologists (DER) were involved in melanoma detection; high percentage of DER used dermatoscopy and were involved in the follow-up of all melanoma stages; both medical oncologists (ONC) and dermato-oncologists administered systemic treatments; and patients had better access to sentinel lymph node biopsy and were treated within multidisciplinary tumour boards.Conclusion Based on these first estimates, the greater involvement of GPs in melanoma detection; the greater involvement of highly trained DER in dermatoscopy, dermatosurgery, follow-up and the systemic treatment of melanoma; and the provision of ongoing dermato-oncology training for pathologists, SURG, DER and ONC are necessary to provide an optimal melanoma care pathway. A comprehensive analysis of the melanoma care pathway based on clinical melanoma registries will be needed to more accurately evaluate these first insights.

TI  - Delineation of burned arid landscapes using Landsat 8 OLI data: a case study of Karaganda region in Kazakhstan
T2  - ARID LAND RESEARCH AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In arid lands of Central Kazakhstan, fires commonly occur due to both man-made (e.g. space rocket launches) and natural factors. Remote sensing is the best method to identify burned landscapes and to assess their long-term dynamics. In this paper, we assessed total areas and seasonal features of fires using Landsat 8 OLI data of high spatial and temporal resolution, corrected for atmospheric effects. We defined data requirements, considered various spectral indices, and evaluated their suitability for automated delineation of burned areas. Spectral indices included special burn indices (NBRT, MIRBI, NBR, NBR2, BAI) and vegetation indices (MSAVI, MSAVI2, MTVI2, GEMI3) that allowed us to determine the boundaries and severity of fires indirectly based on the state of vegetation. Our study showed that burned areas were most accurately identified using indices of NBR2 (normalized burn ratio 2) and MSAVI2 (modified soil adjusted vegetation index 2). They were extracted using image segmentation and natural breaks classification methods. We have assessed MSAVI2 and NBR2 segmentation results with machine learning metrics, i.e. for Soyuz drop zone (landing area of rocket stages) precision of NBR segmentation equaled 99.5%, recall - 99.5%, accuracy - 98.5%. For Proton drop zone NBR segmentation precision equaled 99.3%, recall - 99.7%, accuracy - 99.4%. MSAVI2 results are less accurate. The accuracy of segmentation significantly depended on the vegetation state which was predetermined by the frequency and severity of previous fires within certain territory.

TI  - Effect of land use on the phytoplankton community of Pampean shallow lakes of the Salado River basin (Buenos Aires Province, Argentina)
T2  - AQUATIC ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Salado River basin, Buenos Aires, Argentina, contains numerous permanent shallow lakes under anthropic pressure due to different land uses/land covers (LULC) in their catchments. Here, we explored the relation of LULC in the surrounding areas and the physical and chemical variables of six shallow lakes of the aforementioned basin with phytoplankton structure and morpho-functional groups (MFGs) along one year and evaluated whether LULC or physical and chemical variables were more relevant in shaping phytoplankton structure. We hypothesized that: (1) shallow lakes with higher proportion of land committed to agriculture exhibit more eutrophic characteristics; (2) the phytoplankton structure and MFGs differ in shallow lakes with different LULC in their surrounding areas; and (3) LULC effects decrease with increase in buffer width. Landsat satellite images were used to extract LULC composition in three buffer zones surrounding each lake: 1, 2.5 and 5 km. In all the lakes studied, LULC had greater influence on phytoplankton MFGs than physical and chemical variables. This influence was highest for the 2.5 km buffer. The phytoplankton structure and some physical and chemical characteristics were also different between the shallow lakes studied. Cyanobacteria were widely detected, probably related to the high proportion of land dedicated to agriculture in the region. Chlorococcales, typical of these eutrophic systems, were also well represented. Our study evidenced the influence of LULC on the shallow lakes studied, particularly on the phytoplankton structure. The response of the planktonic microalgal communities to human activities in catchments evidences their value as sentinels of aquatic ecosystems.

TI  - Assessing the reliability of peatland GPP measurements by remote sensing: From plot to landscape scale
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of peatland carbon fluxes based on remote sensing data are a useful addition to monitoring methods in these remote and precious ecosystems, but there are questions as to whether large-scale estimates are reliable given the small-scale heterogeneity of many peatlands. Our objective was to consider the reliability of models based on Earth Observations for estimating ecosystem photosynthesis at different scales using the Forsinard Flows RSPB reserve in Northern Scotland as our study site. Three sites across the reserve were monitored during the growing season of 2017. One site is near-natural blanket bog, and the other two are at different stages of the restoration process after removal of commercial conifer forestry. At each site we measured small (flux chamber) and landscape scale (eddy covariance) CO2 fluxes, small scale spectral data using a handheld spectrometer, and obtained corresponding satellite data from MODIS. The variables influencing GPP at small scale, including microforms and dominant vegetation species, were assessed using exploratory factor analysis. A GPP model using land surface temperature and a measure of greenness from remote sensing data was tested and compared to chamber and eddy covariance CO2 fluxes; this model returned good results at all scales (Pearson's correlations of 0.57 to 0.71 at small scale, 0.76 to 0.86 at large scale). We found that the effect of microtopography on GPP fluxes at the study sites was spatially and temporally inconsistent, although connected to water content and vegetation species. The GPP fluxes measured using EC were larger than those using chambers at all sites, and the reliability of the TG model at different scales was dependent on the measurement methods used for calibration and validation. This suggests that GPP measurements from remote sensing are robust at all scales, but that the methods used for calibration and validation will impact accuracy. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - PM<sub>2.5</sub> surface concentrations in southern West African urban areas based on sun photometer and satellite observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Southern West Africa (SWA) is influenced by large numbers of aerosol particles of both anthropogenic and natural origins. Anthropogenic aerosol emissions are expected to increase in the future due to the economical growth of African megacities. In this paper, we investigate the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the coastal area of the Gulf of Guinea using sun photometer and MODIS satellite observations. A network of lightweight handheld sun photometers have been deployed in SWA from December 2014 to April 2017 at five different locations in COte d'Ivoire and Benin. The handheld sun photometer measures the solar irradiance at 465, 540 and 619 nm and is operated manually once per day. Handheld-sun-photometer observations are complemented by available AERONET sun photometer observations and MODIS level 3 time series between 2003 and 2019. MODIS daily level 3 AOD agrees well with sun photometer observations in Abidjan and Cotonou (correlation coefficient R = 0.89 and RMSE = 0.19). A classification based on the sun photometer AOD and Angstrom exponent (AE) is used to separate the influence of coarse mineral dust and urban-like aerosols. The AOD seasonal pattern is similar for all the sites and is clearly influenced by the mineral dust advection from December to May. Sun photometer AODs are analyzed in coincidence with surface PM2.5 concentrations to infer trends in the particulate pollution levels over conurbations of Abidjan (COte d'Ivoire) and Cotonou (Benin). PM2.5-to-AOD conversion factors are evaluated as a function of the season and the aerosol type identified in the AE classification. The highest PM2.5 concentrations (up to 300 mu g m(-3)) are associated with the advection of mineral dust in the heart of the dry season (December-February). Annual means are around 30 mu g m(-3), and 80 % of days in the winter dry season have a value above 35 mu g m(-3), while concentrations remain below 16 mu g m(-3) from May to September. No obvious trend is observed in the 2003-2019 MODIS-derived PM2.5 time series. However the short dry period (August-September), when urban-like aerosols dominate, is associated with a monotonic trend between 0.04 and 0.43 mu g m(-3) yr(-1) in the PM2.5 concentrations over the period 2003-2017. The monotonic trend remains uncertain but is coherent with the expected increase in combustion aerosol emissions in SWA.

TI  - Responses of native egg parasitoids to the invasive seed bug <i>Leptoglossus occidentalis</i>
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Western conifer seed bug Leptoglossus occidentalis, a native insect of North America, was accidentally introduced in Europe in the late 1990s. Since then, it has spread rapidly. Biological control could provide an efficient management option but natural enemies of the pest have been poorly examined in Europe.In this study, we exposed sentinel egg masses and collected naturally laid egg masses in southern France in 2016 and 2017, to identify the egg parasitoids of L. occidentalis and investigate their potentials.Three egg parasitoids were detected: Anastatus bifasciatus, Ooencyrtus pityocampae and Ooencyrtus telenomicida. The overall parasitism was low compared to that observed in the native range with 6.4% of all eggs being parasitized, while 17.1% of egg masses carried at least one parasitized egg. The total number of parasitized egg masses was similar between parasitoid species, but the mean number of parasitized eggs per egg mass was highest for A. bifasciatus (5.57 vs. 1.25 for Ooencyrtus spp.).Sentinel egg masses underestimated the parasitism compared to natural egg masses (respectively, 1.42% and 7.71%).Our results suggested that the three generalist parasitoids detected can respond in a Leptoglossus egg density-dependent manner, but this requires further investigations.

TI  - Time-series snowmelt detection over the Antarctic using Sentinel-1 SAR images on Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Antarctic ice sheet is an important mass of glacier ice. It is particularly sensitive to climate change, and the flow of Antarctica?s inland glaciers into the sea, accelerated by collapsing ice shelves, threatens global sea level rise. The amount of snowmelt on the surface of the ice sheet is an important metric for accurately assessing surface material loss and albedo change, which affect the stability of the ice sheet. This study proposes a framework for quickly extracting time-series freeze-thaw information at the continental scale and 40 m resolution by taking advantage of the huge amount of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired by Sentinel-1 satellites over the Antarctic, available for rapid processing on Google Earth Engine. Co-orbit normalization is used in the proposed framework to establish a unified standard of judgement by reducing the variations in the backscattering coefficient introduced by observation geometry, terrain fluctuations, and melt conditions between images acquired at different times. We implemented the framework to produce a massive dataset of both monthly freeze-thaw information over the Antarctic and higher temporal resolution freeze-thaw information for the Larsen C ice shelf from 2015 to 2019, with overall accuracies of 93% verified by a manual visual interpretation method and 84% evaluated from automatic weather station temperatures. Due to its effectiveness and robustness, the framework can be used to analyse the spatiotemporal distribution of snowmelt, the change in melt area, and anomalous melt events in Antarctica, especially those in Larsen C caused by foehn wind.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of agricultural water use efficiency and its response to the Grain to Green Program during 1982-2015 in the Chinese Loess Plateau
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The interaction between agricultural water use efficiency (WUEc) and change in vegetation dynamics (mainly crops coverage) was analyzed to assess the ecological effect of the implementation of China's Grain to Green Program (GGP) and to further analyze the impact of the policy on agriculture on a long-term scale from an ecosystem perspective. Remote sensing data (e.g., gross primary productivity, GPP; evapotranspiration, ET; and the normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI) were used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of WUEc in the Loess Plateau during three periods: 1982-2015, 1982-2001, and 2001-2015. The results indicated that, first, the average and the trend of WUEc showed strong spatial heterogeneity over 1982-2015, a period that shows a strip distribution. The average value increased from the northwest to the southeast while the multiyear trend value decreased from the northwest to the southeast, and a positive slope prevailed (p < 0.05). Second, statistically significant positive trends (p < 0.001) in the annual mean WUEc for 1982-2015, with a value of 7.11 x 10(-3) g C kg(-1) H2O yr(-1), indicate that the rate of carbon sequestration in the agricultural ecosystem was faster than that of water loss. Finally, the GGP was conducive to the improvement of WUEc in this arid and semiarid area, with interannual trend values of WUEc from 1982 to 2001 of 4.26 x 10(-3) g C kg(-1) H2O, and 9.88 x 10(-3) g C kg(-1) H2O (p < 0.05) after the GGP. Our analyses explored how the changes in WUEc after the GGP were more sensitive to the NDVIc (the subscript c stands for cropland) trends, which means that NDVIc was an important controller influencing GPPc and ETc tendency and thus further influencing WUEc in response to the GGP. This study contributes to a better understanding of the variations of agricultural carbon-water coupling and provides references and theories for the development of water-saving agriculture in an ecological restoration area.

TI  - An open-source python library for detection of known and novel Kell, Duffy and Kidd variants from exome sequencing
T2  - VOX SANGUINIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and objectives Next generation sequencing (NGS) has promising applications in transfusion medicine. Exome sequencing (ES) is increasingly used in the clinical setting, and blood group interpretation is an additional value that could be extracted from existing data sets. We provide the first release of an open-source software tailored for this purpose and describe its validation with three blood group systems.Materials and methods The DTM-Tools algorithm was designed and used to analyse 1018 ES NGS files from the ClinSeq(R) cohort. Predictions were correlated with serology for 5 antigens in a subset of 108 blood samples. Discrepancies were investigated with alternative phenotyping and genotyping methods, including a long-read NGS platform.Results Of 116 genomic variants queried, those corresponding to 18 known KEL, FY and JK alleles were identified in this cohort. 596 additional exonic variants were identified KEL, ACKR1 and SLC14A1, including 58 predicted frameshifts. Software predictions were validated by serology in 108 participants; one case in the FY blood group and three cases in the JK blood group were discrepant. Investigation revealed that these discrepancies resulted from (1) clerical error, (2) serologic failure to detect weak antigenic expression and (3) a frameshift variant absent in blood group databases.Conclusion DTM-Tools can be employed for rapid Kell, Duffy and Kidd blood group antigen prediction from existing ES data sets; for discrepancies detected in the validation data set, software predictions proved accurate. DTM-Tools is open-source and in continuous development.

TI  - Is the protected area coverage still relevant in protecting the Southern Ground-hornbill (<i>Bucorvus leadbeateri</i>) biological niche in Zimbabwe? Perspectives from ecological predictions
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Examining the suitability of landscape patches for endangered species enhances critical insights and indicators into the processes of population structure, community dynamics, and functioning in ecosystems particularly in protected areas (PAs). While PAs are the cornerstone in biodiversity conservation, there is debate on their efficacy to retain their conservation superiority over unprotected areas under climate change. In the present study, we examined the spatial and temporal effectiveness of PAs at maintaining suitable habitat for the "vulnerable" Southern Ground-hornbill (SGH), Bucorvus leadbeateri compared with the unprotected areas in Zimbabwe. We used a landscape-scale analysis of 182 PAs, their surrounding buffer zones, and unprotected areas coupled with three machine learning models (maximum entropy: MaxEnt, random forest, and support vector machines) to simulate SGH habitat suitability. Bioclimatic, vegetation seasonality and terrain variables were used as predictors against SGH "presence-only" observations and the models were projected for 2050 as future climatic scenarios (i.e. representative concentration pathways: RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The true skill statistic (TSS) and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the modeling framework. Our results show that the PAs network in Zimbabwe is extremely relevant for the conservation of SGH, with 8% of the suitable habitat within PAs projected to become unsuitable by 2050. Higher levels of protection status resulted in higher levels of suitable habitat for the SGH while the suitability of eastern-based PAs showed a decrease and the western-based PAs will potentially increase in suitability. Thus, conservation strategies should take the eastern PAs range contraction and associated westward shift into account. The established potential increase in suitability outside the PAs network (23%-31%) might increase conflicts between agriculture and conservation. We, therefore, suggest an expanded cross-boundary institutional alliance and policy development with all stakeholders to implement a holistic conservation plan. Our work demonstrates the importance of combining multi-source remotely sensed data in predicting habitat suitability for endangered species such as the SGH as key indicators of biological conservation and PAs' effectiveness.

TI  - Supporting operational site-specific fertilization in rice cropping systems with infield smartphone measurements and Sentinel-2 observations
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the low efficiency of nitrogen fertilizers in flooded rice paddies, there is a rising demand for tools able to detect crop nitrogen status in space and time to allow farmers to use the technical novelties of precision agriculture to improve fertilizer management in extensive fields. This work sets up an operational approach to increase nitrogen use efficiency of top-dressing fertilization by supporting variable rate fertilization in rice cropping systems. The procedure exploits (i) crop modelling to identify best periods for fertilization (When), (ii) Sentinel-2 imagery to draw management zones (MZ) and lead field scouting (Where), and (iii) smartphone app to measure nitrogen nutritional index (NNI) (How much). Automatically generated MZ from Sentinel-2 data were able to identify within field patches with different nutritional status and NNI data well described the crop temporal dynamic in relation to crop development and nutritional needs. The workflow was implemented to provide farmers with timely information on plant nutritional status during the 2018 growing season to define site-specific fertilization strategies implemented with variable rate technology (VRT). Tests conducted on 6 fields over 30 ha in 3 farms showed the feasibility of the proposed workflow in real farming conditions allowing a reduction of applied fertilizer up to 25% in the areas with sufficient nutritional status. Demonstration revealed that VRT based on geospatial information from integrated in-field and satellite data can provide agronomic and environmental benefits compared with standard fertilization resulting in promising outcomes both in terms of yield (increase in the range 0.2-0.5 t ha(-1)) and nitrogen use efficiency (increase up to 7.8%).

TI  - Remote sensing depicts riparian vegetation responses to water stress in a humid Atlantic region
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Riparian areas in the Cantabrian Atlantic ecoregion (northwest Portugal) play a key role in soil formation and conservation, regulation of nutrient and water cycle, creation of landscape aesthetic value and the preservation of biodiversity. The maintenance of their ecological integrity is crucial given the ever increase in multiple anthropogenic (water demand and agriculture) and climatic pressures (droughts and extreme events). We developed a transferable remote sensing approach, taking advantage of the latest freely available technologies (Sentinel-2 and Copernicus Land products), to detect intra-annual and inter-annual changes in riparian vegetation productivity at the river basin scale related to water stress. This study has used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to investigate riparian vegetation productivity dynamics on three different vegetation types (coniferous, broadleaved and grassland) over the past 5 years (2015-2019). Our results indicated that inter-annual seasonality differed between drier (2017) and wetter (2016) years. We found that intra-annual dynamics of NDVI were influenced by the longitudinal river zonation. Our model ranked first (r(2)m 0.73) showed that the productivity of riparian vegetation during the dry season was positively influenced by annual rainfall and by the type of riparian vegetation. The emergent long lags between climatic variation and riparian plant productivity provides opportunities to forecast early warnings of climatically-driven impacts. In addition, the different average productivity levels among vegetation types should be considered when assessing climatic impacts on riparian vegetation. Future applications of Sentinel 2 products could seek to distinguish riparian areas that are likely to be more vulnerable to changes in the annual water balance from those that are more resistant under longer-term changes in climate.

TI  - Generalized Vertical Components of built-up areas from global Digital Elevation Models by multi-scale linear regression modelling
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of the vertical components of built-up areas from free Digital Elevation Model (DEM) global data filtered by multi-scale convolutional, morphological and textural transforms are generalized at the spatial resolution of 250 meters using linear least-squares regression techniques. Six test cases were selected: Hong Kong, London, New York, San Francisco, Sao Paulo, and Toronto. Five global DEM and two DEM composites are evaluated in terms of 60 combinations of linear, morphological and textural filtering and different generalization techniques. Four generalized vertical components estimates of built-up areas are introduced: the Average Gross Building Height (AGBH), the Average Net Building Height (ANBH), the Standard Deviation of Gross Building Height (SGBH), and the Standard Deviation of Net Building Height (SNBH). The study shows that the best estimation of the net GVC of built-up areas given by the ANBH and SNBH, always contains a greater error than their corresponding gross GVC estimation given by the AGBH and SGBH, both in terms of mean and standard deviation. Among the sources evaluated in this study, the best DEM source for estimating the GVC of built-up areas with univariate linear regression techniques is a composite of the 1-arcsec Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM30) and the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) World 3D-30 m (AW3D30) using the union operator (CMP_SRTM30-AW3D30_U). A multivariate linear model was developed using 16 satellite features extracted from the CMP_SRTM30-AW3D30_U enriched by other land cover sources, to estimate the gross GVC. A RMSE of 2.40 m and 3.25 m was obtained for the AGBH and the SGBH, respectively. A similar multivariate linear model was developed to estimate the net GVC. A RMSE of 6.63 m and 4.38 m was obtained for the ANBH and the SNBH, respectively. The main limiting factors on the use of the available global DEMs for estimating the GVC of built-up areas are two. First, the horizontal resolution of these sources (circa 30 and 90 meters) corresponds to a sampling size that is larger than the expected average horizontal size of built-up structures as detected from nadir-angle Earth Observation (EO) data, producing more reliable estimates for gross vertical components than for net vertical component of built-up areas. Second, post-production processing targeting Digital Terrain Model specifications may purposely filter out the information on the vertical component of built-up areas that are contained in the global DEMs. Under the limitations of the study presented here, these results show a potential for using global DEM sources in order to derive statistically generalized parameters describing the vertical characteristics of built-up areas, at the scale of 250x250 meters. However, estimates need to be evaluated in terms of the specific requirements of target applications such as spatial population modelling, urban morphology, climate studies and so on.

TI  - Predicting catchment-scale methane fluxes with multi-source remote sensing
T2  - LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Context Spatial patterns of CH4 fluxes can be modeled with remotely sensed data representing land cover, soil moisture and topography. Spatially extensive CH4 flux measurements conducted with portable analyzers have not been previously upscaled with remote sensing. Objectives How well can the CH4 fluxes be predicted with plot-based vegetation measures and remote sensing? How does the predictive skill of the model change when using different combinations of predictor variables? Methods We measured CH4 fluxes in 279 plots in a 12.4 km(2) peatland-forest-mosaic landscape in Pallas area, northern Finland in July 2019. We compared 20 different CH4 flux maps produced with vegetation field data and remote sensing data including Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and digital terrain model (DTM). Results The landscape acted as a net source of CH4 (253-502 mu g m(-2) h(-1)) and the proportion of source areas varied considerably between maps (12-50%). The amount of explained variance was high in CH4 regressions (59-76%, nRMSE 8-10%). Regressions including remote sensing predictors had better performance than regressions with plot-based vegetation predictors. The most important remote sensing predictors included VH-polarized Sentinel-1 features together with topographic wetness index and other DTM features. Spatial patterns were most accurately predicted when the landscape was divided into sinks and sources with remote sensing-based classifications, and the fluxes were modeled for sinks and sources separately. Conclusions CH4 fluxes can be predicted accurately with multi-source remote sensing in northern boreal peatland landscapes. High spatial resolution remote sensing-based maps constrain uncertainties related to CH4 fluxes and their spatial patterns.

TI  - Land use land cover change in Kashmir Himalaya: Linking remote sensing with an indicator based DPSIR approach
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the most dominant forces responsible for changing the global landscape cover includes the changes in Land Use and Land Cover (LULC). These changes are initiated by a string of forces that are interconnected with each other. This study has been done to focus primarily on various LULC changes that have occurred in the Southern part of Kashmir Himalaya and at the same time study the factors governing these. A 27-year period of study has been selected from 1990 to 2017, the main focus being to characterize these forces and link them with the statistics obtained from remotely sensed data. The cause and effect relationship between various indicators of land use change were analyzed using Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) assessment framework. This framework was applied to have a comprehensive view of interactions between human society and the environment. The goal has been achieved by using satellite based data, questionnaire based survey and an in depth analysis of data obtained from various secondary sources. The study finds out the major land use changes occur in a few selected classes, with cropland agriculture losing the most (-5%) whereas economically fruitful horticulture gaining the most (+4.29%) during the study period. The LULC changes have been driven by various forces ranging from natural, demographic and economic resulting in pressures on land and having various environmental ramifications and ultimately focus on responses. Strict land use planning needs to be implemented in Kashmir Himalayas to ensure ecologically fragile environment?s food security and sustainability. A much more in depth study of human environment interactions and complex relationships will be needed to understand these complex systems.

TI  - The influence of Friedrich Engels on Alexander Bogdanov's <i>Basic Elements of the Historical View of Nature</i>
T2  - STUDIES IN EAST EUROPEAN THOUGHT
M3  - Article
AB  - Alexander Bogdanov's first work of philosophy, Basic Elements of the Historical View of Nature, was fundamentally influenced by Friedrich Engels. As a Marxist philosopher seeking to elaborate a comprehensive, systematic, and scientific worldview appropriate for worker-students, Bogdanov found inspiration in Engels's Anti-Duhring, which provided him with his monist conception of being and his 'historical view of nature' and pointed him toward three critical elements of his work: the monism of motion (energy), Spinoza's naturalist and determinist system, and Charles Darwin's conception of natural selection. Bogdanov's overall goal was to demonstrate that in nature, life, the psyche, and society there is no such thing as self-generated motion; all change occurs because of external action. For the individual and for society this means that existence determines consciousness, and societies evolve as a result of their struggle for existence, which is manifested first and foremost in labor.

TI  - Impacts of extreme climate on Australia's green cover (2003-2018): A MODIS and mascon probe
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Australia as a continent represents a semi-arid environment that is generally water-limited. Changes in rainfall pattern will inevitably occur due to rising temperatures caused by climate change, which has a direct impact on the distribution of Australia's vegetation (green cover). As variability in rainfall continues to increase, i.e., in frequency and/or magnitude, due to climate change, extreme climate events such as droughts are predicted to become more pervasive and severe that will have an adverse effect on vegetation. This study investigates the effects of extreme climate on Australia's green cover during 2003-2018 for the end of rainy seasons of April and October in the northern and southern parts, respectively, to (i) determine the state of vegetation and its changes, (ii) identify "hotspots", i.e., regions that constantly experienced statistically significant decrease in NDVI, and (iii), relate changes in the identified hotspots to GRACE-hydrological changes. These are achieved through the exploitation of the statistical tools of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Mann-Kendel Test on Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) hydrological products on the one hand, and the utilization of Australia's rainfall product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (MODIS-NDVI) used here with its native spatial resolution of 0.002413 degrees x 0.002413 degrees on the other hand. Differences between 3-year intervals from 2003 to 2018 for both April and October datasets are used to quantify vegetation variations. Through area change analysis, the vegetation differences (2003-2018) indicate that April exhibited larger increase (13.77% of total vegetation area) than decrease (7.83%) compared to October, which experienced slightly larger decrease (9.41%) than increase (8.71%). South Australia and Western Australia emerge as "hotspots" in which vegetation statistically decreased in October, with no noticeable change in April. GRACE-based hydrological changes in both hotspots reflect a decreasing trend (2003-2009) and increasing trend (2009-2012) that peaks in 2011, which then transitions towards a gradually decreasing trend after 2012. Australia-wide climate variability (ENSO and IOD) influenced vegetation variations during the data period 2003 to 2018. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Measurement matters: changing penalty calculations under the hospital acquired condition reduction program (HACRP) cost hospitals millions
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Since October 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has penalized 25% of U.S. hospitals with the highest rates of hospital-acquired conditions under the Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Program (HACRP). While early evaluations of the HACRP program reported cumulative reductions in hospital-acquired conditions, more recent studies have not found a clear association between receipt of the HACRP penalty and hospital quality of care. We posit that some of this disconnect may be driven by frequent scoring updates. The sensitivity of the HACRP penalties to updates in the program's scoring methodology has not been independently evaluated. Methods We used hospital discharge records from 14 states to evaluate the association between changes in HACRP scoring methodology and corresponding shifts in penalty status. To isolate the impact of changes in scoring methods over time, we used FY2018 hospital performance data to calculate total HAC scores using FY2015 through FY2018 CMS scoring methodologies. Results Comparing hospital penalty status based on various HACRP scoring methodologies over time, we found a significant overlap between penalized hospitals when using FY 2015 and 2016 scoring methodologies (95%) and between FY 2017 and 2018 methodologies (46%), but substantial differences across early vs later years. Only 15% of hospitals were eligible for penalties across all four years. We also found significant changes in a hospital's (relative) ranking across the various years, indicating that shifts in penalty status were not driven by small changes in HAC scores clustered around the penalty threshold. Conclusions HACRP penalties have been highly sensitive to program updates, which are generally announced after performance periods are concluded. This disconnect between performance and penalties calls into question the ability of the HACRP to improve patient safety as intended.

TI  - Changes in ambient air quality and atmospheric composition and reactivity in the South East of the UK as a result of the COVID-19 lockdown
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic forced governments around the world to impose restrictions on daily life to prevent the spread of the virus. This resulted in unprecedented reductions in anthropogenic activity, and reduced emissions of certain air pollutants, namely oxides of nitrogen. The UK 'lockdown' was enforced on 23/03/2020, which led to restrictions on movement, social interaction, and 'non-essential' businesses and services. This study employed an ensemble of measurement and modelling techniques to investigate changes in air quality, atmospheric composition and boundary layer reactivity in the South East of the UK post-lockdown. The techniques employed included in-situ gas- and particle-phase monitoring within central and local authority air quality monitoring networks, remote sensing by long path Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy and Sentinel-5P's TROPOMI, and detailed 0-D chemical box modelling. Findings showed that de-trended NO2 concentrations decreased by an average of 14-38% when compared to the mean of the same period over the preceding 5-years. We found that de-trended particulate matter concentrations had been influenced by interregional pollution episodes, and de-trended ozone concentrations had increased across most sites, by up to 15%, such that total O-x levels were roughly preserved. 0-D chemical box model simulations showed the observed increases in ozone concentrations during lockdown under the hydrocarbon-limited ozone production regime, where total NOx decreased proportionally greater than total non-methane hydrocarbons, which led to an increase in total hydroxyl, peroxy and organic peroxy radicals. These findings suggest a more complex scenario in terms of changes in air quality owing to the COVID-19 lockdown than originally reported and provide a window into the future to illustrate potential outcomes of policy interventions seeking large-scale NOx emissions reductions without due consideration of other reactive trace species.

TI  - Preoperative prediction of axillary sentinel lymph node burden with multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomogram in early-stage breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To develop and validate a multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomogram for pretreatment predicting the axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) burden in early-stage breast cancer. Methods A total of 230 women with early-stage invasive breast cancer were retrospectively analyzed. A radiomics signature was constructed based on preoperative multiparametric MRI from the training dataset (n = 126) of center 1, then tested in the validation cohort (n = 42) from center 1 and an external test cohort (n = 62) from center 2. Multivariable logistic regression was applied to develop a radiomics nomogram incorporating radiomics signature and predictive clinical and radiological features. The radiomics nomogram's performance was evaluated by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical use and was compared with MRI-based descriptors of primary breast tumor. Results The constructed radiomics nomogram incorporating radiomics signature and MRI-determined axillary lymph node (ALN) burden showed a good calibration and outperformed the MRI-determined ALN burden alone for predicting SLN burden (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.82 vs. 0.68 [p < 0.001] in training cohort; 0.81 vs. 0.68 in validation cohort [p = 0.04]; and 0.81 vs. 0.58 [p = 0.001] in test cohort). Compared with the MRI-based breast tumor combined descriptors, the radiomics nomogram achieved a higher AUC in test cohort (0.81 vs. 0.58, p = 0.005) and a comparable AUC in training (0.82 vs. 0.73, p = 0.15) and validation (0.81 vs. 0.65, p = 0.31) cohorts. Conclusion A multiparametric MRI-based radiomics nomogram can be used for preoperative prediction of the SLN burden in early-stage breast cancer.

TI  - Prediction of soil organic carbon and the C:N ratio on a national scale using machine learning and satellite data: A comparison between Sentinel-2, Sentinel-3 and Landsat-8 images
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) are the main indicators of soil quality and health and play an important role in maintaining soil quality. Together with Landsat, the improved spatial and temporal resolution Sentinel sensors provide the potential to investigate soil information on various scales. We analyzed and compared the potential of satellite sensors (Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3) with various spatial and temporal resolutions to predict SOC content and C:N ratio in Switzerland. Modeling was carried out at four spatial resolutions (800 m, 400 m, 100 m and 20 m) using three machine learning techniques: support vector machine (SVM), boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest (RF). Soil prediction models were generated in these three machine learners in which 150 soil samples and different combinations of environmental data (topography, climate and satellite imagery) were used as inputs. The prediction results were evaluated by cross-validation. Our results revealed that the model type, modeling resolution and sensor selection greatly influenced outputs. By comparing satellite-based SOC models, the models built by Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 performed the best and the worst, respectively. C:N ratio prediction models based on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 showed better results than Sentinel-3. However, the prediction models built by Sentinel-3 had competitive or better accuracy at coarse resolutions. The BRT models constructed by all available predictors at a resolution of 100 m obtained the best prediction accuracy of SOC content and C:N ratio; their relative improvements (in terms of R2) compared to models without remote sensing data input were 29.1% and 58.4%, respectively. The results of variable importance revealed that remote sensing variables were the best predictors for our soil prediction models. The predicted maps indicated that the higher SOC content was mainly distributed in the Alps, while the C:N ratio shared a similar distribution pattern with land use and had higher values in forest areas. This study provides useful indicators for a more effective modeling of soil properties on various scales based on satellite imagery. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Mapping abandoned farmland in China using time series MODIS NDVI
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Farmland abandonment is an important aspect of land cover land use (LCLU) that has both positive and negative effects on the environment. There is limited information regarding the spatial distribution of abandoned farmland in China. In this study, we 1) use a C5.0 decision tree classification based on a 250 m spatial resolution Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series to develop LCLU maps for the period 2000-2017; 2) produce time series maps of the abandoned farmland during the period 2002-2017 based on LCLU maps; and 3) analyze spatial distribution, intensity, trend, frequency, and recultivation in terms of farmland abandonment. The results show that the overall accuracy of the LCLU maps ranged from 85.45% to 90.56% over the study period (2002-2017). The average national rate of farmland abandonment was 5% over the period 2002-2017, with the lowest rate in 2002 and the highest in 2015. Approximately 60% of the 34 agricultural areas in China showed an increasing trend for abandonment including some of the main grain-producing areas such as the North China Plain and the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Abandoned farmland areas with an abandonment frequency of <= 3 y comprised 58.24% of the total area of abandoned farmland. The first map detailing the distribution of the abandoned farmland across China was produced in this study, providing guidance for the development of a method of identifying abandoned farmland on a large spatial scale.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study illustrates the Spatial-temporal dynamics of Land use/Land cover (LULC), and locate land suitability for agricultural use. Landsat satellite images of three different years 1990, 2000 and 2018 over 28 years were acquired from Global Land Cover Facility Site (GLCF) and earth explorer. Land suitability for agriculture use was assessed on five criteria; rainfall, temperature, slope percentage, soil types and water Wells distribution. The different geospatial layers were transferred using suitability coding system to produce the suitability maps for rainfed and irrigated areas using weighted overlay method. Ma'an Governorate covers approximately 37% of the total area of Jordan, and consists mostly of uncultivated land 33304.66 km2 (99.49%). Three main LULC classes were identified of the three years; 1990, 2000 and 2018; forest and irrigated areas have been fluctuated between 86.00 km(2) (0.26%), 108.06 km(2) (0.32) and 102.68 km(2) (0.31%), built-up area increased by 24.00 km(2), (0.07%), 41.88 km(2) (0.13%) and 68.66 km(2) (0.21%), while the bare land has been decreased from 33366 km(2) (99.67%),33476 km(2) (99.55%) and 33304.66 km(2) (99.49%) during 1990, 2000 and 2018 respectively. land suitability for the agricultural use (rainfed areas and irrigated crops); Data from the five parameters (mentioned above) are used for spatial analysis applying weighted overlay method. The results showed that only about (0.2%) from the total area of Ma'an is highly suitable for agriculture dependent on rainfall. While about (1.4%) is high suitable for the irrigation crops. The main reason of the low levels of land suitability for agriculture is very low soil fertility, and the water scarcity.(c) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

AB  - Megapoleses in developing countries, are subject to persistent increase in road traffic due to immigration, increase in prosperity, fast development expansion of economy, travel and tourism. Road traffic congestion is increasing exponentially while road infrastructure are not and cannot be increased in the same ratio.The present study proposes the exploration of the potential of Satellite Imagery, GIS and traffic flow information in solving traffic congestion in one of these cities in developing countries. The Land-use has been generated from a combination of the imagery of the Landsat and SPOT. A Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was extracted from a large-scale Stereo-pair of aerial photographs with a geometric resolution of 60 cm.Up-to-date information such Land use, DTM, Access site information and Restricted Access Area information were combined in a GIS for analysis and visualization. Analytic Hierarchy Process is used for obtaining the optimal alternatives to the congested roads.(c) 2019 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Remote sensing-based geological mapping and petrogenesis of Wadi Khuda Precambrian rocks, South Eastern Desert of Egypt with emphasis on leucogranite
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The exposed Precambrian rocks along Wadi Khuda area, South Eastern Desert of Egypt, comprise gneisses, amphibolites and migmatites associations (infrastructural rocks) which are intruded by diorite, tonalite, syenogranite and leucogranite (LG). LG forms homogeneous boss like bodies, devoid to xenoliths, except along the outer margins. Chemically and mineralogically they are dissimilar to the surrounding gneisses. In the current study, band ratio and Decorrelation Stretch image processing algorithms were proposed and applied on Landsat-8, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and Sentinel-2 remote sensing data to discriminate the widely exposed lithological units in the mapped area. Geochemically, I-type classification and volcanic arc environment were revealed. LG is peraluminous (ASI average of 1.09) with normative corundum up to 1.38 for LG. The LG displays limited major and trace element variations (SiO2 = 74.5-76.2%, AI(2)O(3) = 13.4-14.4%), MgO = 0.03-0.19%, Na2O = 3.6- 4.6%), and Rb = 55-85 ppm) probably due to textural and mineralogical homogeneity. The contents of REE in the leucogranite are low (Sigma REE = 21-37), but the REE patterns are [(La/Yb)n = 2.45-9.03], [(La/Sm)(n) = 1.09-2.6], with negative Eu anomaly, (Eu/Eu* = 0.19-0.78). The negative Eu anomaly and the low Sr content (16-92 ppm) may be attributed to the plagioclase feldspars fractionation. The leucogranites represent residual melt of syenogranite which forms Um Itly pluton at the southern flank of Wadi Khuda entrance.(c) 2019 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

AB  - An exact modeling for laser target illumination and electro-optic detection parameters used in most common laser remote sensing systems, such as laser microphones, LiDARs, laser range finders, laser spot tracking, laser designation, stand-off laser spectroscopy (Raman, LIBS, LIF,...), laser imaging of remote targets and all laser transceiver system having a laser source and an electro-optical detection measure in one assembly. The model makes possible to embed most basic parameters in one equation to ease the design of the main system components from engineering point of view, instead of the currently used general models. The resulting equation corrects calculations for short standoff target detection parameters.

TI  - Reference evapotranspiration of Brazil modeled with machine learning techniques and remote sensing
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Reference evapotranspiration (ETo) is a fundamental parameter for hydrological studies and irrigation management. The Penman-Monteith method is the standard to estimate ETo and requires several meteorological elements. In developing countries, the number of weather stations is insufficient. Thus, free products of remote sensing with evapotranspiration information must be used for this purpose. In this context, the objective of this study was to estimate monthly ETo from potential evapotranspiration (PET) made available by MOD16 product. In this study, the monthly ETo estimated by Penman-Monteith method was considered as the standard. For this, data from 265 weather station of the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), spread all over the Brazilian territory, were acquired for the period from 2000 to 2014 (15 years). For these months, monthly PET values from MOD16 product for all Brazil were also downloaded. By using machine learning algorithms and information from WorldClim as covariates, ETo was estimated through images from the MOD16 product. To perform the modeling of ETo, eight regression algorithms were tested: multiple linear regression; random forest; cubist; partial least squares; principal components regression; adaptive forward-backward greedy; generalized boosted regression and generalized linear model by likelihood-based boosting. Data from 2000 to 2012 (13 years) were used for training and data of 2013 and 2014 (2 years) were used to test the models. The PET made available by the MOD16 product showed higher values than those of ETo for different periods and climatic regions of Brazil. However, the MOD16 product showed good correlation with ETo, indicating that it can be used in ETo estimation. All models of machine learning were effective in improving the performance of the metrics evaluated. Cubist was the model that presented the best metrics for r(2) (0.91), NSE (0.90) and nRMSE (8.54%) and should be preferred for ETo prediction. MOD16 product is recommended to be used to predict monthly ETo, which opens possibilities for its use in several other studies.

TI  - Macroinvertebrates as biomonitors of pollutants on natural sandy beaches: Overview and meta-analysis
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Review
AB  - This review synthesises information from published articles on the incorporation of pollutants by macroinvertebrates from sandy beaches, including both field samplings and bioassays. The hypothesis that macroinvertebrates quantitatively reflect the presence of pollutants in sediment, acting as biomonitors, was tested through a meta-analysis based on studies performed in situ. More than half of the studies were conducted in the Mediterranean. Of the 53 articles based on field samplings, less than half (40%) determined the concentration of pollutants in the sediment as well as in the organisms. Donacidae, Talitridae, and Hippidae were tested as biomonitors, mainly of trace elements. Donacidae and Talitridae reflected in their soft tissues the presence of most trace elements in the sediment, which was not the case with Hippidae. Few studies (<= 2 articles) evaluated the response of these macroinvertebrates to persistent organic pollutants, hydrocarbons, or microplastic. A selection based on sampling of sediment and species not yet tested as biomonitors is necessary due to the scarcity of a baseline worldwide and because responses to pollutants may be species-specific.

TI  - Ensemble learning updating classifier for accurate land cover assessment in tropical cloudy areas
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use/cover information is fundamental for the sustainable management of resources. Notwithstanding the advancement of remote sensing, analysts daunt to generate sufficient-quality land use/cover products due to dense-cloud-contaminated and/or technical issues. This study proposes a novel approach (Ensemble Learning Updating Classifier/ELUC), which can be applied with various classification algorithms and data sets to simplistically generate new classifications or renew existing classifications with a remarkable accuracy improvement. Applying miscellaneous features of Landsat-8 images, the ELUC of a random-forest-based algorithm produces sequences of single-time classifications with a mean overall accuracy of 84%. Through the study period, these sequences of individual classifications were then joined to achieve a final classification which reaches an overall accuracy of 94%. Also, the ELUC of the random-forest-based algorithm outperforms that of Kernel-Density-Estimation with a 5% overall accuracy higher. These outcomes confirm the effectiveness of the ELUC for a remarkably consistent land use/cover estimation with a data-rich environment.

TI  - Post-operative follow-up of 150 patients with sentinel lymph node biopsy under tumescence local anesthesia
T2  - JOURNAL DER DEUTSCHEN DERMATOLOGISCHEN GESELLSCHAFT
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is useful for staging of patients with melanoma. Although SLNB is mostly performed under general anesthesia (GA), tumescence local anesthesia (TLA) can also be used. However, less data are available regarding feasibility of SLNB under TLA. Here we present a post-operative follow-up of 150 patients.Patients and Methods: We prospectively analyzed data from 150 patients with primary cutaneous malignant melanoma. We assessed pain, post-operative complications and patients' satisfaction after SLNB under TLA.Results: 32 % of the patients reported post-operative pain within the first 48 h after SLNB. Seroma was the most frequent complication, as 29 seromas after SLNB were observed. Wound infection was observed in 3.3 % of the patients. 98.7 % of the patients were satisfied with SLNB under TLA.Conclusions: SLNB under TLA is a safe and feasible option and should be considered for patients with melanoma. Especially with multimorbid or elderly patients, the risks of GA can be avoided.

TI  - A daily, 250m and real-time gross primary productivity product (2000-present) covering the contiguous United States
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Gross primary productivity (GPP) quantifies the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) fixed by plants through photosynthesis. Although as a key quantity of terrestrial ecosystems, there is a lack of high-spatialand-temporal-resolution, real-time and observation-based GPP products. To address this critical gap, here we leverage a state-of-the-art vegetation index, near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV), along with accurate photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), to produce a SatelLite Only Photosynthesis Estimation (SLOPE) GPP product for the contiguous United States (CONUS). Compared to existing GPP products, the proposed SLOPE product is advanced in its spatial resolution (250m versus >500 m), temporal resolution (daily versus 8 d), instantaneity (latency of 1 d versus >2 weeks) and quantitative uncertainty (on a per-pixel and daily basis versus no uncertainty information available). These characteristics are achieved because of several technical innovations employed in this study: (1) SLOPE couples machine learning models with MODIS atmosphere and land products to accurately estimate PAR. (2) SLOPE couples highly efficient and pragmatic gap-filling and filtering algorithms with surface reflectance acquired by both Terra and Aqua MODIS satellites to derive a soil-adjusted NIRV (SANIRV) dataset. (3) SLOPE couples a temporal pattern recognition approach with a long-term Cropland Data Layer (CDL) product to predict dynamic C4 crop fraction. Through developing a parsimonious model with only two slope parameters, the proposed SLOPE product explains 85% of the spatial and temporal variations in GPP acquired from 49 AmeriFlux eddy-covariance sites (324 site years), with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.63 gCm(-2) d(-1). The median R-2 over C3 and C4 crop sites reaches 0.87 and 0.94, respectively, indicating great potentials for monitoring crops, in particular bioenergy crops, at the field level. With such a satisfactory performance and its distinct characteristics in spatiotemporal resolution and instantaneity, the proposed SLOPE GPP product is promising for biological and environmental research, carbon cycle research, and a broad range of real-time applications at the regional scale. The archived dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1786 (download page: https://daac.ornl.gov/daacdata/cms/SLOPE_GPP_CONUS/data/, last access: 20 January 2021) (Jiang and Guan, 2020), and the real-time dataset is available upon request.

TI  - Patterns, drivers and implications of ascidian distributions in a rapidly deglaciating fjord, King George Island, West Antarctic Peninsula
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report strong evidence for the utility of ascidian communities as sentinel organisms for monitoring nearshore Antarctic marine ecosystem response to climate-induced warming and glacial melting. Ascidians are one of the most common Antarctic epibenthic megafauna, but information on their distribution and the determinants is still scarce. In this study we investigated spatial patterns of ascidians in Marian Cove (MC), a rapidly deglaciating fjord in the West Antarctic Peninsula, one of the most rapidly warming regions on earth. We also analyzed key drivers structuring the communities and assessed their relevance to glacial retreat and following processes. The first applied ROV survey in MC discovered that ascidians were the most diverse (14 out of 64 taxa) taxa with the greatest abundance (-264 inds?m? 2). Ascidian abundance and diversity greatly varied in space, by distance from glacier and/or depths, explaining -64% of total megafaunal variations. Notably, in deep seabed (50?90 m) they shifted distinctly from early colonization communities near glacier (0.2 km to glacier) with predominance of two opportunistic species, Molgula pedunculata and Cnemidocarpa verrucosa, to mature communities at the most remote site (3.5 km). A set of analyses revealed that such shifts were related mostly to changes in sediment properties that develop in association with glacial retreat and consequent processes. Sediment composition, grain size and sorting collectively explained outward increasing physical stability apparently with decreased influence of glacial retreat, supporting ascidian community maturing at the deep and distant site. BIOENV analysis indicated that ?distance? to glacier is one key factor influencing ascidian community structure in the deep seabed. Overall, the results of the analyses strongly indicated that physical disturbances (mainly sedimentation and ice scouring) accompanying glacial retreat are an important force shaping ascidian assemblages in the cove, and that these forces are altered by the distance from the glacier and water depth. Notably, in this fjord, the period of sea bed deglaciation was roughly proportional to the distance to glacier over the last six decades. This suggested that the ascidian shift identified in this study reflects a long-term successional process associated with glacial retreat in the past in MC, which in turn warrants to project future changes in this glacial fjord and possibly other similar environments.

TI  - Sudden changes in nitrogen dioxide emissions over Greece due to lockdown after the outbreak of COVID-19
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The unprecedented order, in modern peaceful times, for a near-total lockdown of the Greek population as a means of protection against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, commonly known as COVID-19, has generated unintentional positive side-effects with respect to the country's air quality levels. Sentinel-5 Precursor/Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (S5P/TROPOMI) monthly mean tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations show an average change of -34 % to +20 % and -39 % to -5 % with an average decrease of -15 % and -11 % for March and April 2020 respectively, compared with the previous year, over the six larger Greek metropolitan areas; this is mostly attributable to vehicular emission reductions. For the capital city of Athens, weekly analysis was statistically possible for the S5P/TROPOMI observations and revealed a marked decline in the NO2 load of between -8 % and -43 % for 7 of the 8 weeks studied; this is in agreement with the equivalent Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)/Aura observations as well as the ground-based estimates of a multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy ground-based instrument. Chemical transport modelling of the NO2 columns, provided by the Long Term Ozone Simulation European Operational Smog (LOTOS-EUROS) chemical transport model, shows that the magnitude of these reductions cannot solely be attributed to the difference in meteorological factors affecting NO2 levels during March and April 2020 and the equivalent time periods of the previous year. Taking this factor into account, the resulting decline was estimated to range between similar to-25 % and -65 % for 5 of the 8 weeks studied, with the remaining 3 weeks showing a positive average of similar to 10 %; this positive average was postulated to be due to the uncertainty of the methodology, which is based on differences. As a result this analysis, we conclude that the effect of the COVID-19 lockdown and the restriction of transport emissions over Greece is similar to-10 %. As transport is the second largest sector (after industry) affecting Greece's air quality, this occasion may well help policymakers to enforce more targeted measures to aid Greece in further reducing emissions according to international air quality standards.

TI  - Self-esteem and immortality: Evidence regarding the terror management hypothesis that high self-esteem is associated with a stronger sense of symbolic immortality
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Terror Management Theory (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, & Solomon, 1986) defines self-esteem as the feeling that one is living up to the standards of their internalized cultural worldview and is consequently worthy of the symbolic and/or literal modes of death transcendence offered by that worldview. Although there is ample evidence for the death-anxiety buffering function of self-esteem, no study to date has assessed the hypothesis that high self-esteem is associated with a stronger sense of symbolic immortality. Supporting this hypothesis, in seven samples (N = 7404) we found that American students with higher self-esteem more strongly believed that they will be remembered and have an impact after they die. Symbolic immortality was also related to greater ingroup identification and lower levels of loneliness, existential isolation, death-thought accessibility, and depression. Additionally, symbolic immortality partially mediated the effect of self-esteem on death-thought accessibility (Samples 4-7) and on depression (Sample 4), although these relationships were also bi-directional with selfesteem partially explaining the variance between symbolic immortality and these constructs. These findings augment the literature delineating the existential function of self-esteem and highlight the potential importance of perceived symbolic immortality to psychological well-being.

TI  - DInSAR and statistical modeling to assess landslides: The case study of Sierras Chicas (central Argentina)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of this investigation was to assess landslides in the steep West-facing slope of the Sierras Chicas mountains in central Argentina using two complementary approaches: Differential SAR interferometry (DinSAR) and statistical modeling. The combination of the geological characteristics of the area, wildfires, intense rainfall events and human disturbances have made the area highly susceptible to landslides. This condition has been recently aggravated with the construction of a roadway. In this work, we applied DInSAR methods to explore the suitability of COSMO-SkyMed (CSK) acquisitions to measure displacements and we used Sentinel-1 C-band images for accuracy comparison. In addition, Generalized Linear Models were fitted to identify landslideconditioning factors. Based on the results obtained, Sentinel-1 proved to be the most adequate source of images to perform interferometry, in contrast to Cosmo Skymed imagery that showed very poor coherence in the study area. The statistical modeling identified slope degree, distance to roads and fire frequency as the main variables explaining landslide occurrence on the west escarpment of the Sierras Chicas. Results will hopefully contribute to improving future applications of SAR interferometry both in the study area and others with similar characteristics, as well as the tools and knowledge for decision making in engineering and urban development projects in order to minimize risk.

TI  - Re-evaluation of Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy for Melanoma
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Opinion statement The vast majority of patients newly diagnosed with melanoma present with clinically localized disease, and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is a standard of care in the management of these patients, particularly in intermediate thickness cases, in order to provide important prognostic data. However, SLNB also has an important role in the management of patients with other subtypes of melanoma such as thick melanomas, certain thin melanomas, and specific histologic variants of melanoma such as desmoplastic melanoma. Furthermore, there have been technical advances in the SLNB technique, such as the development of newer radiotracers and use of SPECT/CT, and there is some data to suggest performing a SLNB may be therapeutic. Finally, the management of patients with a positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) has undergone dramatic changes over the past several years based on the results of recent important clinical trials. Treatment options for patients with SLN metastases now include surveillance, completion lymph node dissection, and adjuvant therapy with checkpoint inhibitors and targeted therapy. SLNB continues to play a crucial role in the management of patients with melanoma, allowing for risk stratification, potential regional disease control, and further treatment options for patients with a positive SLN.

This paper conducts a systematic spatial and temporal analysis for a better insight into the contemporary conflict between preserving the historical landscape and developing the urban areas. Methods The analysis involves: (1) classification of land-cover/land-use between 1995 and 2016 using SPOT data; (2) investigation of the urbanization intensity index; (3) identification of key metrics of landscape, spatial index, and natural hazard indicators to build a risk map of the heritage sites; and (4) a final assessment of the risks, as results of urban expansion, on the Outstanding Universal Values (OUV) of these selected samples. Results The results show that monuments are under threat as risks increased from 1995 to 2016 with a considerable correlation between urbanization intensity index and the risks to OUV. In particular, the area with high risk to OUV increased from 19.78% in 1995 to 23.74% in 2016, and the increasing percentage for the area with very high risk was from 1.26% to 6.67%, respectively. Conclusions The study area is an example of many similar worldwide cultural heritages that might be threatened by socio-economic development. The successful implementation of the approach for assessing heritage risk presented in this study can be used for other areas with similar characteristics.

TI  - The potential for income improvement and biodiversity conservation via specialty coffee in Ethiopia
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - The specialty coffee sector represents opportunities for coffee farmers and other actors due to increased value within the supply chain, driven by elevated consumer purchase prices. We investigated these relationships up to the export stage, as well as the potential for specialty coffee to improve stakeholder participation in biodiversity conservation. Household data was collected from a sample of 272 coffee farmers belonging to five primary cooperatives, in the heavily forested area of Yayu, in the Illubabor administrative zone of Oromia regional state in south-western Ethiopia, for the 2017/2018 harvest season. Qualitative and quantitative data, gathered between 2015 and 2019, from focus group discussions, was used to supplement the survey and to explain the empirical findings. We show that the income from coffee (and thus household income) can be increased, in some cases substantially, via participation in the specialty coffee market. The unit price for coffee was much higher than standard market prices and those including certification premiums. Whilst quality is a key factor for specialty coffee, income increases via the specialty market are caveat bound. In particular, there is a critical requirement for efficient and effective cooperative management, and we provide suggestions for improvements. In the long-term, more focus is needed to increase the financial and human capacities of Ethiopian coffee cooperatives, to make them more effective partners in the specialty coffee value chain. The high conversion rates from harvested to clean exportable specialty coffee (8:1, or higher) is identified as a major constraint on profitability. We show that specialty coffee can bring about positive environmental benefits. Elevating coffee prices and farm profitability to bring household income levels to around or above the global poverty line may ensure the continuation of forest coffee production, and thus the retention of forest. The increases in income via specialty coffee production, reported in the study, were achieved without increasing land use or the application of environmentally costly inputs. Moreover, analysis of satellite data shows that a large proportion of the coffee farms surveyed retain a level of forest cover and quality approaching primary (undisturbed) forest, and that the coffee production area at Yayu has not experienced any significant deforestation (since 2000). We recommend that coffee premiums linked to environmental benefit should demonstrate clearly defined and appropriate metrics, as we have demonstrated here for forest (canopy) quality and coverage (area).

TI  - Spatio-temporal-spectral observation model for urban remote sensing
T2  - GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Taking cities as objects being observed, urban remote sensing is an important branch of remote sensing. Given the complexity of the urban scenes, urban remote sensing observation requires data with a high temporal resolution, high spatial resolution, and high spectral resolution. To the best of our knowledge, however, no satellite owns all the above characteristics. Thus, it is necessary to coordinate data from existing remote sensing satellites to meet the needs of urban observation. In this study, we abstracted the urban remote sensing observation process and proposed an urban spatio-temporal-spectral observation model, filling the gap of no existing urban remote sensing framework. In this study, we present four applications to elaborate on the specific applications of the proposed model: 1) a spatio-temporal fusion model for synthesizing ideal data, 2) a spatio-spectral observation model for urban vegetation biomass estimation, 3) a temporal-spectral observation model for urban flood mapping, and 4) a spatio-temporal-spectral model for impervious surface extraction. We believe that the proposed model, although in a conceptual stage, can largely benefit urban observation by providing a new data fusion paradigm.

TI  - Precambrian basement rocks of Wadi-Khuda-Shut area, South Eastern Desert of Egypt: Geology and remote sensing analysis
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Wadi Khuda-Wadi Shut area in the South Eastern Desert (SED) of Egypt is mainly made up of gneisses, ophiolitic serpentinites and intermediate schistose metavolcanics. These metamorphic rock units are intruded by syn-late-tectonic diorite, granodiorite, ultramafic-mafic, and monzogranite intrusions. The gneisses comprise biotite hornblende gneiss, hornblende gneiss and migmatites. They are of granodiorite and diorite composition. The ophiolitic serpentinite with talc carbonate rocks were thrusted over the metavolcanics with NW-SE thrust contact. The late tectonic ultramafic-mafic rock units are represented in the study area by Dahanib pluton, which is consisted of layered peridotite-dunite associated with olivine gabrro, normal gabbro and gabbro-norite as well as rare hornblende gabbro. These varieties are related to the layered intrusions rather than Alaskan-types, and formed by magmatic differentiation. The granodiorite and monzogranite represent the youngest basement rock units in the study area. The principal components and band ratios of ASTER and Landsat-8 data were successfully used for the first time in lithological discrimination and geological mapping of the study area. This study concluded that, the interpreted data of ASTER and Landsat-8 combined with field study and petrographic investigation clearly discriminated the exposed rock units. Accordingly, a detailed geological map emphasizing the lithological units in Khuda-Shut area has been presented. (c) 2019 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research article novel Possibilistic c-Means with Possibilitic Local Information c-Means (PCM with PLICM) and Possibilistic c-Means with Adaptive Possibilitic Local Information c-Means (PCM with ADPLICM) algorithms have been presented in a supervised way. Using the local convolution these algorithms are efficient to resolve the limitations of PCM. These algorithms are tested on a multispectral remote sensing data with the added the salt and pepper noise. The Mean Membership Difference (MMD), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Fuzzy Error Matrix (FERM) techniques were used to examine the performance of proposed algorithms. MMD has been calculated on original classified image for independent accuracy in which PCM with ADPLICM shows higher MMD by 7% and 17% in comparison to PCM with PLICM and PCM respectively. The original and noisy images have been used to compute the RMSE. The combination of PCM with ADPLICM produces least RMSE. FERM overall accuracy has also been increased up to 15% after incorporating spatial local information. (c) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Landslide probability mapping by considering fuzzy numerical risk factor (FNRF) and landscape change for road corridor of Uttarakhand, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide poses severe threats to the natural landscape of the Lesser Himalayas and the lives and economy of the communities residing in that mountainous topography. This study aims to investigate whether the landscape change has any impact on landslide occurrences in the Kalsi-Chakrata road corridor by detailed investigation through correlation of the landslide susceptibility zones and the landscape change, and finally to demarcate the hotspot villages where influence of landscape on landslide occurrence may be more in future. The rational of this work is to delineate the areas with higher landslide susceptibility using the ensemble model of GIS-based multi-criteria decision making through fuzzy landslide numerical risk factor model along the Kalsi-Chakrata road corridor of Uttarakhand where no previous detailed investigation was carried out applying any contemporary statistical techniques. The approach includes the correlation of the landslide conditioning factors in the study area with the changes in land use and land cover (LULC) over the past decade to understand whether frequent landslides have any link with the physical and hydro-meteorological or, infrastructure, and socioeconomic activities. It was performed through LULC change detection and landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM), and spatial overlay analysis to establish statistical correlation between the said parameters. The LULC change detection was performed using the object-oriented classification of satellite images acquired in 2010 and 2019. The inventory of the past landslides was formed by visual interpretation of high-resolution satellite images supported by an intensive field survey of each landslide area. To assess the landslide susceptibility zones for 2010 and 2019 scenarios, the geo-environmental or conditioning factors such as slope, rainfall, lithology, normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI), proximity to road and land use and land cover (LULC) were considered, and the fuzzy LNRF technique was applied. The results indicated that the LULC in the study area was primarily transformed from forest cover and sparse vegetation to open areas and arable land, which is increased by 6.7% in a decade. The increase in built-up areas and agricultural land by 2.3% indicates increasing human interference that is continuously transforming the natural landscape. The landslide susceptibility map of 2019 shows that about 25% of the total area falls under high and very high susceptibility classes. The result shows that 80% of the high landslide susceptible class is contained by LULC classes of open areas, scrubland, and sparse vegetation, which point out the profound impact of landscape change that aggravate landslide occurrence in that area. The result acclaims that specific LULC classes, such as open areas, barren-rocky lands, are more prone to landslides in this Lesser Himalayan road corridor, and the LULC-LSM correlation can be instrumental for landslide probability assessment concerning the changing landscape. The fuzzy LNRF model applied has 89.6% prediction accuracy at 95% confidence level which is highly satisfactory.The present study of the connection of LULC change with the landslide probability and identification of the most fragile landscape at the village level has been instrumental in delineation of landslide susceptible areas, and such studies may help the decision-makers adopt appropriate mitigation measures in those villages where the landscape changes have mainly resulted in increased landslide occurrences and formulate strategic plans to promote ecologically sustainable development of the mountainous communities in India's Lesser Himalayas.

TI  - Mapping of surface deformation associated with the 5.2 magnitude Stilfontein earthquake of 3 April 2017 using radar interferometry
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents surface deformation associated with the 5.2 magnitude Stilfontein earthquake of 3 April 2017 using Sentinel-1 data. Analysis involved calculation of vertical displacement for two situations (unmasked and masked with a layer of coherence >= 0.6). The displacement for the unmasked situation ranged from-21 mm to +49 mm whereas with higher coherence of >= 0.6 it ranged from-18 mm to 45 mm. Major positive displacements of 32-45 mm observed in the KOSH region whereas negative displacements of-15 mm to-28 mm observed in the northern, north-eastern, north-western and southwestern part of the image. Comparison of vertical displacement with geology indicated that the areas of high positive deformation or uplifts were in the central portion of the image underlain by the geological units of Malmani Subgroup, Rietgat Formation, Klipriviersberg Group, Dominion Group, Hospital Hill Subgroup, Allanridge Formation and Volksrust Formation. Areas of high negative deformation or subsidence are confined to the northern and north-eastern region underlain by Malmani Subgroup and north-western region underlain by Kameeldoorns Formation and south-western region underlain by Allanridge Formation. An attempt to compare the deformation and vertical displacement with isoseismal map revealed similarity/matching of higher surface deformation areas with the shapes and values of high value isoseismal contours. No major faults were seen at or near the epicentre of the earthquake. The surface deformation distribution associated with the occurred earthquake will help to identify possible areas of major deformation, if earthquake of same magnitude and depth of origin occurs in the same area in future.(c) 2020 National Authority for Remote Sensing and Space Sciences.

TI  - Adaptive ensemble optimal interpolation for efficient data assimilation in the red sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ensemble optimal interpolation (EnOI) is a variant of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) that operates with a static ensemble to drastically reduce its computational cost. The idea is to use a pre-selected ensemble to parameterize the background covariance matrix, which avoids the costly integration of the ensemble members with the dynamical model during the forecast step of the filtering process. To better represent the pronounced time-varying circulation of the Red Sea, we propose a new adaptive EnOI approach in which the ensemble members are adaptively selected at every assimilation cycle from a large dictionary of ocean states describing the Red Sea variability. We implement and test different schemes to select the ensemble members (i) based on the similarity to the forecast state according to some criteria, or (ii) in term of best representation of the forecast in an ensemble subspace using an Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm. The relevance of the schemes is first demonstrated with the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 models. Then results of numerical experiments assimilating real remote sensing data into a high resolution MIT general circulation model (MITgcm) of the Red Sea using the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) system are presented and discussed.

TI  - Role of landslides on the volume balance of the Nepal 2015 earthquake sequence
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The 7.8 M-w earthquake that struck Nepal on April 25th, 2015 triggered over 21,000 landslides over an area of more than 25,000 km(2). These landslides contributed to mass wasting, partially compensating the tectonic uplift by the earthquake. In this paper we quantify the volume balance resulting from the 2015 earthquake uplift (or subsidence) and landslide erosion. Starting from a new complete earthquake-induced landslide inventory, we calculated landslide volume by adopting different strategies for low-mobility and high-mobility landslides, considering also the potential supply of sediments to the drainage network. The results show that the contribution of earthquake-induced landslides to erosion is about one order of magnitude smaller than the vertical coseismic displacement. We found landslide volume values, due to the 2015 Nepal earthquake, ranging between 251 (- 15/+16) Mm(3) up to 1503 (- 183/+210) Mm(3) based on the adopted method, and a volume due to coseismic vertical displacement of 2134 (+/- 1269) Mm(3) for the whole area. The volume balance of the 2015 Nepal earthquake is strongly dominated by tectonic displacement. We show that these estimates depend on several uncertainties. We identified and quantified uncertainties related to: (1) the choice of empirical volume-area scaling relationships and their parameters; (2) the completeness and quality of landslide inventory through comparison with available inventories; (3) the approach adopted for the assessment of elongated landslide volume; (4) the InSAR displacement data.

TI  - Improving Landsat predictions of rangeland fractional cover with multitask learning and uncertainty
T2  - METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Operational satellite remote sensing products are transforming rangeland management and science. Advancements in computation, data storage and processing have removed barriers that previously blocked or hindered the development and use of remote sensing products. When combined with local data and knowledge, remote sensing products can inform decision-making at multiple scales.We used temporal convolutional networks to produce a fractional cover product that spans western United States rangelands. We trained the model with 52,012 on-the-ground vegetation plots to simultaneously predict fractional cover for annual forbs and grasses, perennial forbs and grasses, shrubs, trees, litter and bare ground. To assist interpretation and to provide a measure of prediction confidence, we also produced spatiotemporal-explicit, pixel-level estimates of uncertainty. We evaluated the model with 5,780 on-the-ground vegetation plots removed from the training data.Model evaluation averaged 6.3% mean absolute error and 9.6% root mean squared error. Evaluation with additional datasets that were not part of the training dataset, and that varied in geographic range, method of collection, scope and size, revealed similar metrics. Model performance increased across all functional groups compared to the previously produced fractional product.The advancements achieved with the new rangeland fractional cover product expand the management toolbox with improved predictions of fractional cover and pixel-level uncertainty. The new product is available on the Rangeland Analysis Platform (), an interactive web application that tracks rangeland vegetation through time. This product is intended to be used alongside local on-the-ground data, expert knowledge, land use history, scientific literature and other sources of information when making interpretations. When being used to inform decision-making, remotely sensed products should be evaluated and utilized according to the context of the decision and not be used in isolation.

TI  - Prototyping Sentinel-2 green LAI and brown LAI products for cropland monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - For agricultural applications, identification of non-photosynthetic above-ground vegetation is of great interest as it contributes to assess harvest practices, detecting crop residues or drought events, as well as to better predict the carbon, water and nutrients uptake. While the mapping of green Leaf Area Index (LAI) is well established, current operational retrieval models are not calibrated for LAI estimation over senescent, brown vegetation. This not only leads to an underestimation of LAI when crops are ripening, but is also a missed monitoring opportunity. The high spatial and temporal resolution of Sentinel-2 (52) satellites constellation offers the possibility to estimate brown LAI (LAI(B)) next to green LAI (LAI(G)). By using LAI ground measurements from multiple campaigns associated with airborne or satellite spectra, Gaussian processes regression (GPR) models were developed for both LAI(G) and LAI(B), providing alongside associated uncertainty estimates, which allows to mask out unreliable LAI retrievals with higher uncertainties. A processing chain was implemented to apply both models to 52 images, generating a multiband LAI product at 20 m spatial resolution. The models were adequately validated with insitu data from various European study sites (LAI(G): R-2 = 0.7, RMSE = 0.67 m(2)/m(2); LAI(B): R-2 = 0.62, RMSE = 0.43 m(2)/m(2)). Thanks to the 52 bands in the red edge (B5: 705 nm and B6: 740 nm) and in the shortwave infrared (B12: 2190 nm) a distinction between LAI(G) and LAI(B) can be achieved. To demonstrate the capability of LAI(B) to identify when crops start senescing, 52 time series were processed over multiple European study sites and seasonal maps were produced, which show the onset of crop senescence after the green vegetation peak. Particularly, the LAI(B) product permits the detection of harvest (i.e., sudden drop in LAI(B)) and the determination of crop residues (i.e., remaining LAI(B)), although a better spectral sampling in the shortwave infrared would have been desirable to disentangle brown LAI from soil variability and its perturbing effects. Finally, a single total LAI product was created by merging LAI(G) and LAI(B) estimates, and then compared to the LAI derived from 52 L2B biophysical processor integrated in SNAP. The spatiotemporal analysis results confirmed the improvement of the proposed descriptors with respect to the standard SNAP LAI product accounting only for photosynthetically active green vegetation.

TI  - An alternative approach for mapping burn scars using Landsat imagery, Google Earth Engine, and Deep Learning in the Brazilian Savanna
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Cerrado biome in Brazil is characterized by a mosaic of vegetation types similar to African savanna and has one of the highest levels of biodiversity in the world. Wildfires have historically contributed to shaping the natural vegetation and are now being used in the establishment and management of agricultural systems and pastures. Consequently, the fire regime has been changing over the last few decades and increasingly affecting native vegetation, natural habitats, and ecosystem services in tropical regions. Mapping fire dynamics and spatial distribution are crucial to assess impacts on ecosystems and to define and enforce strategies and measures of fire control and prevention. In this study, we developed an alternative approach for mapping burned areas in the Cerrado biome in Brazil, using Landsat imagery and Deep Learning algorithm, implemented on the Google Earth Engine and on Google Cloud Storage platform. We compared our mapping results with two Burned Area products developed by INPE (30 m resolution) and MODIS MCD64A1 Burned Area Product (500 m resolution). Additionally, we assessed the accuracies of these three mapping products using 2,200 validation points within the study area. By comparing our mapping result with MCD64A1 and INPE burn scar products, we estimated an average agreement of 34% for both. We observed that most mapping disagreements were mainly because of the effects of clouds/shadow conditions that affected the ability for spectral observations, differences in methodologies, and spatial resolution of each remotely sensed datasets used for mapping burned areas. Our validation results indicated an overall accuracy of 97% of our methodological approach for mapping burned areas and, therefore, it can be successfully applied across savanna regions. Our results showed that 202,230 km(2) was affected by fires within the Cerrado biome in 2017, in which 31% overlapped cropping lands (agricultural fields and pastures) and 67% overlapped various types of native vegetation (forest, savanna and grassland). Our proposed methodological approach and its results can be useful to enforce environmental command and control policies and to estimate carbon emissions, analyses interactions between climate and ecological drivers of fire, develop predictive models of fire risk dynamics, and providing spatial information that can help public policies and fire management/prevention actions for the Cerrado conservation.

TI  - Drought years in peatland rewetting: rapid vegetation succession can maintain the net CO<sub>2</sub> sink function
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The rewetting of peatlands is regarded as an important nature-based climate solution and intended to reconcile climate protection with the restoration of self-regulating ecosystems that are resistant to climate impacts. Although the severity and frequency of droughts are predicted to increase as a consequence of climate change, it is not well understood whether such extreme events can jeopardize rewetting measures. The goal of this study was to better understand drought effects on vegetation development and the exchange of the two important greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4, especially in rewetted fens. Based on long-term reference records, we investigated anomalies in vegetation dynamics, CH4 emissions, and net CO2 exchange, including the component fluxes of ecosystem respiration (R-eco) and gross ecosystem productivity (GEP), in a rewetted fen during the extreme European summer drought in 2018. Drought-induced vegetation dynamics were derived from remotely sensed data.Since flooding in 2010, the fen was characterized by a patchy mosaic of open-water surfaces and vegetated areas. After years of stagnant vegetation development, drought acted as a trigger event for pioneer species such as Tephroseris palustris and Ranunculus sceleratus to rapidly close persistent vegetation gaps. The massive spread of vegetation assimilated substantial amounts of CO2. In 2018, the annual GEP budget increased by 20 % in comparison to average years (2010-2017). R-eco increased even by 40 %, but enhanced photosynthetic CO2 sequestration could compensate for half of the drought-induced increase in respiratory CO2 release. Altogether, the restored fen remained a net CO2 sink in the year of drought, though net CO2 sequestration was lower than in other years. CH4 emissions were 20 % below average on an annual basis, though stronger reduction effects occurred from August onwards, when daily fluxes were 60 % lower than in reference years.Our study reveals an important regulatory mechanism of restored fens to maintain their net CO2 sink function even in extremely dry years. It appears that, in times of more frequent climate extremes, fen restoration can create ecosystems resilient to drought. However, in order to comprehensively assess the mitigation prospects of peatland rewetting as a nature-based climate solution, further research needs to focus on the long-term effects of such extreme events beyond the actual drought period.

TI  - Annual and inter-annual variability and trends of albedo of Icelandic glaciers
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - During the melt season, absorbed solar energy, modulated at the surface predominantly by albedo, is one of the main governing factors controlling surface-melt variability for glaciers in Iceland. Using MODIS satellite-derived daily surface albedo, a gap-filled temporally continuous albedo product is derived for the melt season (May to August (MJJA)) for the period 2000-2019. The albedo data are thoroughly validated against available in situ observations from 20 glacier automatic weather stations for the period 2000-2018. The results show that spatio-temporal patterns for the melt season have generally high annual and inter-annual variability for Icelandic glaciers, ranging from high fresh-snow albedo of about 85 %-90 % in spring to 5 %-10 % in the impurity-rich bare-ice area during the peak melt season. The analysis shows that the volcanic eruptions in 2010 and 2011 had significant impact on albedo and also had a residual effect in the following years. Furthermore, airborne dust, from unstable sandy surfaces close to the glaciers, is shown to enhance radiative forcing and decrease albedo. A significant positive albedo trend is observed for northern Vatnajokull while other glaciers have non-significant trends for the study period. The results indicate that the high variability in albedo for Icelandic glaciers is driven by climatology, i.e. snow metamorphosis, tephra fallout during volcanic eruptions and their residual effects in the post-eruption years, and dust loading from widespread unstable sandy surfaces outside the glaciers. This illustrates the challenges in albedo parameterization for glacier surface-melt modelling for Icelandic glaciers as albedo development is driven by various complex phenomena, which may not be correctly captured in conventional energy-balance models.

TI  - Morphological characteristics and changes of two meandering rivers in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated bend morphology and dynamic changes of two highly convoluted meandering rivers, the Black River and the White River, in the Upper Yellow River Watershed of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), China. Using remotely sensed data, we characterized channel morphology and lateral changes of 290 meander bends in the two rivers. These bends exhibited extensive development of compound structures with each involving multiple sub-bends. Their migration patterns were dominated by extension, translation, and the combination of both, with the average migration rate higher in bends that changed by translation than that of bends by other modes. These morphological changes led to a longitudinal erosion-to-deposition pattern along the two studied rivers. Our analyses showed that the White River migrated much faster with more frequent cutoffs but fewer compound bends than the Black River, which may be attributed to the greater stream power of the former. We found a similar single-mode relationship between migration rate and bend curvature, commonly reported in previous studies, indicating that the largest migration rate occurred in bends with medium curvatures. This relationship, however, was altered to a quasi-monotonic inverse one when the average migration rates of bends were calculated for each class interval of bend curvatures, suggesting the complexity of bend morphodynamics. In general, the two studied meandering rivers migrated slower than many other meandering rivers worldwide, which allowed their bends to evolve into complex planform structures. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Classification and status monitoring of agricultural crops in central Morocco: a synergistic combination of OBIA approach and fused Landsat-Sentinel-2 data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop type mapping provides essential information to control and make decisions related to agricultural practices and their regulations. To map crop types accurately, it is important to capture their phenological stages and fine spatial details, especially in a temporally and spatially heterogeneous landscape. The data availability of new generation multispectral sensors of Landsat-8 (L8) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites offers unprecedented options for such applications. Given this, our study aims to display how the synergistic use of these optical sensors can efficiently support crop type mapping research while integrating an object-based image analysis (OBIA). Through the applied methods, we used the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) and the flexible spatiotemporal data-fusion model (FSDAF) to blend L8 and S2 data and obtain reliable normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) datasets with fine spatial and temporal resolution. Then the crop phenological information was extracted using a Savitzky-Golay filter and fused NDVI time series. Finally, a model combining phenological metrics and fused reconstructed NDVI as classification features was developed using a random forest (RF) classifier/OBIA approach. The results show that the FSDAF method creates more accurate fused NDVI and keeps more spatial details than ESTARFM. The FSDAF model was then used to create fused, high-resolution time-series products that were able to extract crop phenology in single-crop fields while providing a very detailed pattern relative to that from individual sensor time-series data. Moreover, combined L8 and S2 data by FSDAF produced highly significant overall classification accuracies (90.03% for pixel-based RF to 93.12% OBIA RF), outperforming individual sensor use (82.57% for L8-only; 88.45% for S2-only). Our proposed workflow highlights the advantage of spatiotemporal fusing and OBIA environment in spatiotemporally heterogeneous areas and fragmented landscapes, which represents a promising step toward generating fast, accurate, and ready-to-use agricultural data products.

TI  - A machine learning approach to estimating the error in satellite sea surface temperature retrievals
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global, repeated, and accurate measurements of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) are critical for weather and climate projections. While thermometers on buoys measure SST relatively accurately, only sensors aboard satellites give global and repeated SST measurements necessary for many applications, including climate modeling. For satellite-based thermal infrared sensors, an atmospheric correction converts calibrated brightness temperatures measured at orbital height into an SST estimate, but imperfect assumptions in the correction algorithm coupled with variability in atmospheric conditions and viewing geometries can lead to a wide range of errors and uncertainties in the satellite-derived SST retrievals. Estimates of the resulting errors are imperative for satellite-derived SST assimilation into climate models. This paper evaluates the use of machine learning Decision Tree algorithms to predict the central tendency and dispersion of errors in satellite-derived SST retrievals. First, using records from the NASA R2014.1 MODIS Aqua SST Matchup Database, which includes matched-up satellite and in situ SST measurements, a set of seven variables was derived that addresses the assumptions and known issues in the satellite SST retrieval process. Then, both Random Forest and Cubist Decision Trees were used to predict the SST residual (satellite SST minus skin-corrected buoy SST) for each matchup. While both Decision Tree methods performed similarly well, the Cubist model is more easily interpreted and yields better predictions of errors for relatively infrequent conditions. Various characteristics of the groups of matchups identified by Cubist were explored, and uncertainty values for the error estimates were derived for each group. Overall, the Cubist model predicted the skin SST residual with a root-mean-squared-error of 0.380 degrees C across nighttime cloud-filtered domains, demonstrating that a Cubist model is viable for quantitatively and accurately predicting Single Sensor Error Statistics per pixel as required by the Group for High Resolution SST. In this paper, we present the training and testing of both Decision Tree models. Because of its interpretability, we explore in detail the characteristics of the Cubist-derived groups to gain new geophysical insight into the satellite-derived SST retrieval error across different measurement conditions.

TI  - Modelling vegetation health and stress using hypersepctral remote sensing data
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation health mapping is extremely helpful for distinguishing nuisance and scourge conditions and it is additionally valuable in surveying zones of lumber gather. Decline in forest health occurs due to many reasons, including land-use intensification, forest disturbances and bad management practices at various scale that can be assessed and monitored using geoinformatics. Among various remote sensing (RS) techniques, the use of hyperspectral band information suits more for vegetation stress and health analysis and possesses better accuracy. Besides, RS gives lot of opportunity to monitor and manage natural resources at multi-temporal, multi-spectral and multi-spatial level. In this study, we evaluated the applications of hyperspectral RS for forest health assessment and mapping in terms of vegetation health analysis, stress and fire fuel vegetation analysis and linked these to forest management. We analysed the vegetation health of the Lonar forest (Maharashtra) using hyperspectral imagery using ENVI software for the management of forest and its conservation in terms of healthy and stressed vegetation using different indices. The background studies suggest that a forest displaying low pressure conditions comprise sound vegetation, although a forest under high pressure conditions gives the indication of dry and kicking the bucket plant material, exceptionally thick and inadequate overhang and wasteful light use. We examined different vegetation models to compare and identify the index which resulted showing the best accuracy. We executed six Vegetation Index models (VIM) i.e. Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Sum Green Index (SGI), Moisture Stress Index (MSI), Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI), Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for evaluation of the timberland strength of the woods locale. The study suggest that each vegetation model index has its specific expression for healthy and stressed vegetation and its own suitability for specific uses and also some limiting factors. We argue on the importance to select an appropriate vegetation model to evaluate vegetation health and stress that must be based on environmental conditions, forest composition, leaf type and other biophysical factors.

TI  - Quality-control tests for OC4, OC5 and NIR-red satellite chlorophyll-a algorithms applied to coastal waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable satellite estimates of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) are needed in coastal waters for applications such as eutrophication monitoring. However, because of the optical complexity of coastal waters, retrieving accurate Chl-a is still challenging. Many algorithms exist and give quite different performance for different optical conditions but there is no clear definition of the limits of applicability of each algorithm and no clear basis for deciding which algorithm to apply to any given image pixel (reflectance spectrum). Poor quality satellite Chl-a data can easily reach end-users. To remedy this and provide a clear decision on when a specific Chl-a algorithm can be used, we propose simple quality control tests, based on MERIS water leaving reflectance (rho(w)) bands, to determine on a pixel-by-pixel basis if any of three popular and complementary algorithms can be used. The algorithms being tested are: 1. the OC4 blue-green band ratio algorithm which was designed for open ocean waters; 2. the OC5 algorithm which is based on look-up tables and corrects OC4 overestimation in moderately turbid waters and 3. a near infrared-red (NIR-red) band ratio algorithm designed for eutrophic waters.Using a dataset of 348 in situ Chl-a/MERIS matchups, the conditions for reliable performance of each of the selected algorithms are determined. The approach proposed here looks for the best compromise between the minimization of the relative difference between In situ measurements and satellite estimations and the number of pixels processed. Conditions for a reliable application of OC4 and OC5 depend on rho(w)412/rho(w)443 and rho(w)560, used as proxies of coloured dissolved organic matter and suspended particulate matter (SPM), as compared to rho(w)560/rho(w)490, used as a proxy for Chl-a. Conditions for reliable application of the NIR-red band ratio algorithm depend on Chl-a and SPM. These conditions are translated into pixel-based quality control (QC) tests with appropriately chosen thresholds. Results show that by removing data which do not pass QC, the performance of the three selected algorithms is significantly improved. After combining these algorithms, 70% of the dataset could be processed with a median absolute percent difference of 30.5%. The QC tests and algorithm merging methodology were then tested on four MERIS images of European waters. The OC5 algorithm was found to be suitable for most pixels, except in very turbid and eutrophic waters along the coasts where the NIR-red band ratio algorithm helps to fill the gap. Finally, a test was performed on an OLCI-S3A image. Although some validations of water reflectance are still needed for the OLCI sensors, results show similar behavior to the MERIS applications which suggests that when applied to OLCI data the present methodology will help to accurately estimate Chl-a in coastal waters for the next decade.

TI  - Assessment of water infiltration of urban surface based on remote sensing: a case study of Wuhan, China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of water infiltration of the urban surface is the prerequisite and basis when we study the impact of urbanization on the urban ecological environment such as stormwater runoff and the heat island effect. However, few studies have been done on how to make such an assessment. In this paper, a detailed assessment of water infiltration of urban surface for Wuhan, China was conducted based on remote sensing. Classification of land-use types and their water infiltration criterion was proposed by the V-I-S (Vegetation-Impervious Surface-Soil) model. The Landsat-8 remote sensing data were used to classify various land-use types in Wuhan. The water infiltration capacity distribution in Wuhan was then obtained and classified into five levels. These results will also be helpful to provide a basis for establishing a comprehensive water infiltration model of the urban surface in the future.

TI  - Influence of Holding Conditions and Storage Duration of <i>Halyomorpha halys</i> (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Eggs on Adventive and Quarantine Populations of <i>Trissolcus japonicus</i> (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) Behavior and Parasitism Success
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Halyomorpha halys (Stal) is an invasive pest in the United States and other countries. In its native range, H. halys eggs are parasitized by a co-evolved parasitoid, Trissolcus japonicus (Ashmead). In the United States, T. japonicus, a classical biological control candidate, is being redistributed in many states where adventive populations exist. To establish if H. halys egg holding conditions affect T. japonicus foraging behavior or successful parasitism, naive, female parasitoids from an adventive population were allowed to forage in laboratory bioassay arenas with either fresh or frozen (-20 or -80 degrees C) egg masses, the latter held for five durations ranging from 1 h to 112 d. Parasitoid movements were recorded for 1 h. Thereafter, parasitoids were transferred with the same egg mass for 23 h. Additionally, female parasitoids from a quarantine colony were exposed to: 1) pairs of fresh egg masses and egg masses frozen at -40 degrees C (>24 h) or 2) a single fresh egg mass or egg mass frozen at -40 degrees C (<1 h). All exposed egg masses were held to assess progeny emergence. In the foraging bioassay, holding temperature and storage duration appeared to influence host-finding and host quality. Egg masses held at -80 degrees C and fresh egg masses resulted in significantly greater levels of parasitism and progeny emergence compared with eggs held at -20 degrees C. No differences were recorded between egg masses held at -40 degrees C for <= 1 h and fresh egg masses.These results will help refine methods for preparation of egg masses for sentinel monitoring and parasitoid mass rearing protocols.

TI  - The Use of UAS to Release the Egg Parasitoid <i>Trichogramma</i> spp. (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) Against an Agricultural and a Forest Pest in Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The egg parasitoid Trichogramma spp. (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae) is a widely used biocontrol agent against lepidopteran pests. Historically, Trichogramma were deployed either by plane or by using cardboard cards on which parasitized eggs are glued and manually installed at sites. Plane deployment is costly and card installation is time consuming, but the use of Trichogramma has been shown to be efficient against several pests. In 2016 and 2017, a research project investigated the potential use of unmanned aerial system for distributing Trichogramma as biocontrol agents against two major pests: an agricultural pest of maize, the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis (Flibner) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae), and a forest pest, the eastern spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clemens) (Lepidoptera:Tortricidae). Exposure duration of parasitized eggs to field conditions (temperature, predation, etc.) in maize fields influenced the Trichogramma's emergence rate, suggesting that timing of parasitoid releases with their emergence is essential. Although parasitism of naturally occurring eggs in maize fields could not be compared due to the low density of the European corn borer, parasitism of sentinel eggs by Trichogramma was more prominent in plots with unmanned aircraft systems (UAS)-releases compared to control plots. For spruce budworm, treatment with Trichogramma increased egg parasitism and there was no difference between the deployment by UAS and by Trichocards. We discuss these results in the context of pest biology and management. We also discuss the advantages and shortcomings of both methods and offer insights into where future work might go to further leverage the use of UAS in managing these important pests.[GRAPHICS].

TI  - Land use/land cover change, physico-chemical parameters and freshwater snails in Yewa North, Southwestern Nigeria
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The management of ecosystem has been a major contributor to the control of diseases that are transmitted by snail intermediate hosts. The ability of freshwater snails to self-fertilize, giving rise to thousands of hatchlings, enables them to contribute immensely to the difficulty in reducing the endemicity of some infections in the world. One of the effects of land use/land cover change (LU/LCC) is deforestation, which, in turn, leads to the creation of suitable habitats for the survival of freshwater snails. This study was aimed at studying the land use/land cover change, physico-chemical parameters of water bodies and to understand the interplay between them and freshwater snails in an environment where a new industrial plant was established. Landsat TM, 1984, Landsat ETM+ 2000 and Operational land Imager (OLI) 2014 imageries of the study area were digitally processed using ERDAS Imagine. The land use classification includes settlement, water bodies, wetlands, vegetation and exposed surface. Dissolved oxygen, water temperature, pH, total dissolved solids and conductivity were measured with multipurpose digital meters. Snail sampling was done at each site for 30 minutes along the littoral zones, using a long-handled scoop (0.2mm mesh size) net once every month for 24 months. Independent t-test was used to determine the variation between seasons, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to test the relationship between physico-chemical parameters and snail species while regression was used to analyze the relationship between LU/LCC and freshwater snails. Species' richness, diversity and evenness were examined using Margalef, Shannon Weiner and Equitability indexes. Snail species recovered include: Bulinus globosus, Bulinus jousseaumei, Bulinus camerunensis, Bulinus senegalensis, Bulinus forskalii, Amerianna carinatus, Ferrissia spp., Segmentorbis augustus, Lymnaea natalensis, Melanoides tuberculata, Physa acuta, Gyraulus costulatus, Indoplanorbis exuxtus and Gibbiella species. Out of the total snails recovered, M. tuberculata (2907) was the most abundant, followed by Lymnaea natalensis (1542). The highest number of snail species was recovered from Iho River while the least number of snails was recovered from Euro River. The mean and standard deviation of physico-chemical parameters of the water bodies were DO (2.13 +/- 0.9 mg/L), pH (6.80 +/- 0.4), TDS (50.58 +/- 18.8 mg/L), Temperature (26.2 +/- 0.9 degrees C) and Conductivity (74.00 +/- 27.5 mu S/cm). There was significant positive correlation between pH and B. globosus (r = 0.439; P<0.05). Dissolved oxygen showed significant positive correlation with B. globosus (r = 0.454; P<0.05) and M. tuberculata (r = 0.687; P<0.01). There was a positive significant relationship between LULCC and B. camerunensis (p<0.05). The positive relationship between LULCC and the abundance of B. globosus, B. jousseaumei was not significant. The area covered by water bodies increased from 3.72 to 4.51 kilometers; this indicates that, more suitable habitats were being created for the multiplication of freshwater snails. We therefore conclude that, increase in areas suitable for the survival of freshwater snails could lead to an increase in water-borne diseases caused by the availability of snail intermediate hosts.

TI  - Performance of MODIS C6.1 Dark Target and Deep Blue aerosol products in Delhi National Capital Region, India: Application for aerosol studies
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) of India is one of the most polluted regions in the world, yet only two ground-based monitoring sites under the AEROsol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) measuring Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) are operational in this region. Here, we assessed the performance of Terra and Aqua MODIS collection 6.1 AOD product to understand their applicability for studying seasonal and spatial variations of AOD over Delhi-NCR. We compared Deep Blue AOD at 550 nm retrieved at 10 km resolution (DB10K), and Dark Target AOD retrieved at 3 km (DT3K) and 10 km (DT10K) resolutions against AOD from these two AERONET sites (Gual Pahari and Amity University) during 2010-2019 keeping in mind the uncertainty range represented as expected error (EE) envelope [EE = + (0.03 +/- 20% AOD(AERONET)) for DB10K, EE = +/- (0.05 + 20% AOD(AERONET)) and EE = +/- (0.05 + 15% AOD(AERONET)) for DT3K and DT10K respectively]. Our evaluation reveals the following statistics: correlation coefficients (R) of 0.44, 0.74, and 0.77 for DB10K, DT3K, and DT10K AODs from TERRA and 0.7, 0.79, and 0.72 from AQUA, respectively and root mean square errors of 0.26, 0.01, and 0.17 for AODs from TERRA and 0.24, 0.20, and 0.24 for AODs from AQUA, respectively. Our results demonstrate better reliability of the DT AOD products relative to DB over urbanized areas in North India. Emission from industries, power plants, brick kilns, enhances aerosol loading after a light precipitation event.

T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGERY
M3  - Article
M3  - Early Access
AB  - BackgroundUrothelial cell carcinoma (UCC), the most common cancer of the urinary system, rarely metastasizes to the brain. 1-3 More rare still is the subset of patients with urothelial carcinoma brain metastases whose UCC primary is first diagnosed at the same time as their CNS metastatic disease, with oncologic workup prompted by CNS clinical manifestations.4 Paraneoplastic optic neuropathy (PON) is likewise a rare clinical entity, which has not yet been described in association with UCC brain metastases.Case DescriptionHerein, we present the sentinel case of UCC believed to be of endometrial origin in an 81 year old woman initially presenting with symptoms of fatigue, nausea, vertigo, and rapidly deteriorating vision over the course of 1 month. Visual deterioration prompted neuro imaging remarkable for multiple supratentorial and infratentorial metastases as well as likely neoplastic inflammatory involvement of the bilateral optic nerves. The patient underwent a right temporal open brain biopsy, with pathology findings consistent with UCC. Subsequent PET scanning demonstrated a heavy burden of disease including an FDG-avid uterine mass with local and distal extension of disease including bilateral hydroureteronephrosis with obstruction of the distal ureters. The patient and her family elected to pursue home hospice without further workup or intervention.ConclusionsWhile this is the first such case presented, it is possible that UCC of the uterine wall represents a particularly aggressive form of the disease more prone to presenting with CNS metastases and PON.

TI  - Digital mapping of soil chemical properties with limited data in the Thung Kula Ronghai region, Thailand
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Prediction of soil chemical properties has significant implications for land management in Thailand but it is especially challenging in vast areas with limited soil data. In this study we identified important spectral and terrain indices for predicting various soil properties, evaluated the suitability of the digital soil mapping (DSM) technique for creating digital soil maps, and assessed the soil nutrients levels in the Thung Kula Ronghai (TKR) region of Thailand. A total of 186 soil samples were collected at 0-30 cm depth and analyzed for nutrients. A digital elevation model with 5 m resolution was used to derive the terrain variables of the study area. Landsat-8 images collected at bare soil conditions with 30 m resolution were used to determine the soil and vegetation indices. Models developed to predict soil properties using multiple linear regression (MLR) were evaluated in terms of the coefficient of determination, root mean square error and normalized root mean square error. We found that indices such as brightness, saturation, coloration, normalized difference water, and moisture stress are the most important predictor variables, significantly correlated with various soil properties. The accuracy of the MLR models developed for predicting soil properties in this study suggests that the DSM technique could be useful to predict soil nutrient status in the TKR region.

T2  - ARCHIVE FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION-ARCHIV FUR RELIGIONSPSYCHOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - The positive role of religion in reducing prejudice has remained a neglected theme in Psychology of religion, concerning itself mostly with prejudice and fundamentalism. Recently, noting the absence of a positive antithesis to prejudice and fundamentalism, faith development theory presents xenosophia as going beyond mere tolerance to a creative engagement with other religious faiths to develop new insights and broaden one's own worldview. The current research undertakes a study of Muslim faith contents to get insights into how these beliefs shape construction of self in relation to other faith communities. Conducting inductive thematic analysis of faith development interviews from 12 Muslim participants from three major religious affiliations in Pakistan (equally divided for gender and ages ranging from 31 to 76 years) in an earlier research, the research analyzes a range of xenological patterns from xenophobia to xenosophia with associated potentials for inter-faith dialogue. Focusing on residents of a country with a dense Muslim population, the study carries implications for religious socialization and religious education in a globalized world.

TI  - Blocks-removed spatial unmixing for downscaling MODIS images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Terra/Aqua MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have been used widely for global monitoring of the Earth?s surface due to their daily fine temporal resolution. The spatial resolution of MODIS time-series (i.e., 500 m), however, is too coarse for local monitoring. A feasible solution to this problem is to downscale the coarse MODIS images, thus creating time-series images with both fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Generally, the downscaling of MODIS images can be achieved by fusing them with fine spatial resolution images (e.g., Landsat images) using spatio-temporal fusion methods. Among the families of spatiotemporal fusion methods, spatial unmixing-based methods have been applied widely owing to their lighter dependence on the available fine spatial resolution images. However, all techniques within this class of method suffer from the same serious problem, that is, the block effect, which reduces the prediction accuracy of spatiotemporal fusion. To our knowledge, almost no solution has been developed to tackle this issue directly. To address this need, this paper proposes a blocks-removed spatial unmixing (SU-BR) method, which removes the blocky artifacts by including a new constraint constructed based on spatial continuity. SU-BR provides a flexible framework suitable for any existing spatial unmixing-based spatio-temporal fusion method. Experimental results on a heterogeneous region, a homogeneous region and a region experiencing land cover changes show that SUBR removes the blocks effectively and increases the prediction accuracy obviously in all three regions. SU-BR also outperforms two popular spatio-temporal fusion methods. SU-BR, thus, provides a crucial solution to overcome one of the longest standing challenges in spatio-temporal fusion.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Cokriging method for assimilating and downscaling multi-scale remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - No single satellite remote sensing system is able to provide the observations on the Earth's surface at both high spatial and high temporal resolution due to the general trade-off between orbit revisit frequency and satellite sensor's spatial resolution. This paper presents a spatio-temporal Cokriging (ST-Cokriging) method for assimilating remote sensing data sets acquired by multiple remote sensing systems with different temporal sampling frequencies and different spatial resolutions. By extending the traditional Cokriging technique from a sole spatial domain to a spatio-temporal domain, we derived and implemented ST-Cokriging algorithm that explicitly takes the spatial covariance, temporal covariance and spatio-temporal covariance structures within and between different data sets into account. Compared with previous downscaling methods, such as, STARFM and FSDAF, our ST-Cokriging method produces more accurate and reliable assimilation results for the heterogeneous region, with associated uncertainty estimates. This method has been implemented into a software package using Python language within ArcGIS environment. The advantages and effectiveness of our ST-Cokriging method have been demonstrated through an application example, in which MODIS images (daily, 250 m and 500 m spatial resolution) and Landsat TM/ETM+ images (16 days revisit cycle, 30 m) are assimilated to generate daily spectral bands and NDVI images at 30 m spatial resolution. Our validation and accuracy assessments indicate that our ST-Cokriging method can effectively fill in data gaps due to clouds and generate reliable assimilation results and uncertainty estimates at both high spatial resolution and high temporal frequency

TI  - Extraction and Evolution Analysis of Urban Built-Up Areas in Beijing, 1984-2018
T2  - APPLIED SPATIAL ANALYSIS AND POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate extraction of the boundaries of urban built-up areas (UBA) based on remote sensing and GIS technology is extremely important for predicting urban spatial evolution. Therefore, this study proposes a method for extracting urban built-up areas based on the impervious surface aggregation density (ISAD) of an object and uses the long-time series of the built-up area extraction results to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of Beijing cities. The results show that the precision for extracting UBA using this method is 91.3%, which is better than that of existing methods based on supervised classification. The extraction results can also accurately depict the urban form and maintain the integrity of the built-up areas. Built-up areas in Beijing expanded from 1984 to 2018, with the most significant expansion in 2014-2018. In these 5 years, the expansion speed and intensity of Beijing respectively reached 270.70 km(2)/a and 1.65%, which were 2.43 times that of the entire research period. Built-up areas in Beijing have been expanding past their original limits over time in a 'centralized concentric circle' expansion model. The focus of the UBA moved northeast by 11.56 km. In the past 35 years, the contours of Beijing's urban borders have become increasingly complex, and the spatial form of built-up areas has become increasingly discrete. The analysis of the spatial evolution of UBA is beneficial for more sustainable, compact and coordinated urban development.

TI  - A method to avoid spatial overfitting in estimation of grassland above-ground biomass on the Tibetan Plateau
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate assessments of grassland above-ground biomass (AGB) are crucial for the sustainable utilization and protection of grassland resources and the eco-environment. In this study, a random forest (RF) model combined with the forward feature selection (FFS) and leave-location-out cross-validation (LLO-CV) methods was trained to predict the dry weight (DW) of grassland AGB based on multiple factors. The final model exhibited a performance of R2 = 0.66, root mean square error (RMSE) of 503.86 kg DW/ha and mean absolute error (MAE) of 376.51 kg DW/ha. The spatial distribution of grassland AGB increased from northwest to southeast over the entire Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2001 to 2018. Grassland AGB increased more than it decreased (70.6% vs 29.4%, respectively) during the study period. Using a combination of FFS and LLO-CV, spatial overfitting was reduced, and the predictive accuracy of the RF was improved, thus enhancing the ability to predict the AGB in unknown locations from training data. This study proposes a robust methodology with which to improve the transferability of machine learning algorithms to predict grassland AGB in unknown locations.

TI  - Dynamics of phenology and its response to climatic variables in a warm-temperate mixed plantation
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation phenology is an integrated indicator of vegetation growth and development in response to climate, and it is one of the important variables regulating carbon flux in forest ecosystems. Land surface phenology derived from different remote sensing products and their relationships with flux tower gross primary production (GPP) data have been paid much attention. Remotely sensed phenology was retrieved based on greenness, while GPP-based phenology was extracted based on photosynthesis. However, exploring the differences between remotely sensed and GPP-based phenology are limited. In this study, we compared phenological metrics obtained from flux tower GPP of a mixed plantation with phenological metrics derived using MODIS EVI and MCD12Q2 from 2006 to 2017. We also explored phenological transitions and the response of phenology to climatic variables. The results showed that the 16-day composited EVI time series was in agreement with the 16-day composited GPP time series (R-2 = 0.86, p < 0.001). The root mean squared deviation values between flux tower GPP- and the MODIS EVI- and MCD12Q2-retrieved phenology dates were 8, 13, 34, and 16 days and 8, 19, 28, and 18 days for the start of the growing season (SOS), end of the growing season (EOS), peak of the growing season (POS), and growing season length (GSL), respectively, suggesting that MODIS EVI and MCD12Q2 were valuable products for retrieving the vegetation phenological dynamics, except for POS. The partial correlation analysis showed that temperature had a more important role in phenophase than precipitation. Rising temperatures in spring triggered earlier SOS. Significant correlations were found between EOSEVI, EOSMCD12Q2, EOSGPP, and preseason temperature (60 d prior to EOS) (p < 0.05), indicating that warming over the preseason resulted in earlier EOS. These findings help to understand the discrepancies between MODIS EVI, MCD12Q2, and flux tower GPP-based phenologies, their responses to climatic factors, and further confirm that precipitation should be taken into account to improve the accuracy of phenology models.

TI  - Characterization of field-scale soil variation using a stepwise multi-sensor fusion approach and a cost-benefit analysis
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The potential of a stepwise fusion of proximally sensed portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectra and electromagnetic induction (EMI) with remote Sentinel-2 bands and a digital elevation model (DEM) was investigated for predicting soil physicochemical properties in pedons and across a heterogeneous 80-ha crop field in Wisconsin, USA. We found that pXRF spectra with partial least squares regression (PLSR) models can predict sand, total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), silt contents, and clay with validation R-2 of 0.81, 0.74, 0.73, 0.68, and 0.64 at the pedon scale but performed less well for soil pH (R-2 = 0.51). A combination of EMI, Sentinel-2, and DEM data showed promise in mapping sand, silt contents, and TN at two depths and Ap horizon thickness and soil depth across the field. A clustering analysis using combinations of mapped soil properties or proximal and remote sensing data suggested that data fusion improved the characterization of field-scale variability of soil properties. The cost-benefit analysis showed that the most accurate management zones (MZs) for topsoil can be generated only using estimated soil property maps while it was the most costly as compared to other data sources. For an intermediate-high (for topsoil) and high (subsoil) accuracy and a moderate economic budget, the combination of sensors (proximal + remote sensing + DEM) might be a better approach for effective MZs generation than collecting soil samples for laboratory analysis while the latter produced the most accurate maps for topsoil. It can be concluded that pXRF spectra can be useful for predicting key soil properties (e.g., sand, TN, OC, silt, clay) at different soil depths, and a combination of proximal and remote sensing provides an effective way to delineate soil MZs that are useful for decision-making.

TI  - Future Development of Gold Mineralization Utilizing Integrated Geology and Aeromagnetic Techniques: A Case Study in the Barramiya Mining District, Central Eastern Desert of Egypt
T2  - NATURAL RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Old gold mines in the Barramiya district, Eastern Desert of Egypt, are associated with NE-SW-trending ophiolitic ultramafic belts and their alteration zones (listvenitization). This paper integrates geophysical aeromagnetic and geological studies, including remote sensing technologies, to explore the potential for planning future development of gold mining in Barramiya, Central Eastern Desert (CED), Egypt. Utilizing remote sensing techniques and processed Landsat-8 images is valuable and successful in delineating the distribution of ophiolitic ultramafic belts with their associated alteration zones. Moreover, aeromagnetic data analyses were carried out to reveal the subsurface geologic setting, the extent with depth and the possible association with gold mineralization. The total intensity map was examined numerically for remanent magnetization content using the normalized source strength transformation (NSS) for proper delineation of the mineralization with depth. The reduced-to-pole map was subjected to a variety of digital filters and tomographic inversions. The results reveal the association of three previously productive gold mines with clear low magnetic anomalies and consequently low magnetic susceptibility in the Barramiya mine area and Um Slim. However, numerous new similar anomalies were recognized and need to be explored for possible gold mineralization. The estimated depths to magnetic sources using the 3D Euler technique range between 143 and 1125 m, while 506.7 m was the estimated average depth to sources. Such results suggest other possible locations and deep gold mineralization in the areas corresponding to low magnetic susceptibilities. These results agree well with the constructed geologic map, and the spatial distributions of different rock units were classified according to distinctive mineral assemblies of serpentinites and their spectral characteristics to improve their identifications.

TI  - Effect of landscape pattern and spatial configuration of vegetation patches on urban warming and cooling in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spatial configuration of vegetation patches in the landscape has implications for the provision of ecosystem services, human adaptation to climate change, enhancement, or mitigation of urban heat island. Until recently, the effect of spatial configuration of vegetation to enhance or mitigate urban heat island has received little consideration in urban thermal assessments. This study examines the impact of spatial configuration of vegetation patches on urban thermal warming and cooling in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe. The study used Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER), Landsat and Sentinel 2 data acquired between 1994 and 2017 to derive detailed information on vegetation patches, landscape metrics, and land surface temperature LST(degrees C). The spatial configuration of urban vegetation patterns was analyzed using landscape metrics in Fragstats program. Getis Ord Gi* as a Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) was used to characterize the spatial clustering and dispersion of urban vegetation patches. Results of the Getis Ord Gi* showed that clustered vegetation lowers surface temperatures more effectively than dispersed and fragmented patterns of vegetation. The size, density, shape complexity, and cohesion of vegetation patches conferred different levels of cooling but Patch Cohesion Index had the strongest negative relationship with LST(degrees C) at three spatial resolutions of 10 m (Sentinel 2), 15 m (ASTER) and 30 m (Landsat 8). The Spatial Lag Regression model performed better than the Ordinary Least Squares regression analysis in exploring the relationship between LST(degrees C) and landscape metrics. Specifically, the Spatial Lag Regression model showed higher R-2 values and log likelihood, lower Schwarz criteria, and Akaike information criterion, and reduced spatial autocorrelations. The overall information provides important insights into the provision of larger, connected, and less fragmented urban vegetation patches to derive maximum and higher cooling effects which is critical for urban planning and design approaches for mitigating increasing surface temperatures in cities.

TI  - Identification of active fault topography along the Kishtwar Fault, Jammu and Kashmir, Northwest Himalaya, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Kishtwar region of Jammu and Kashmir, India has been investigated to identify the traces of active faults preserved in the topography of the area. The objectives were achieved by geomorphic mapping with the help of satellite imageries (Cartosat-1 with 2.5 m resolution), detailed geological field investigations, shallow sub-surface geophysical mapping and the optical luminescence dating. Active tectonic landforms mapped in this study include Kishtwar rhombohedral basin, fault scarps, drainage offset, deformed recent sediments, uplifted lacustrine sediments and faulted river terraces. The evidence of active extensional topography reported here is from the compressional tectonic regime of NW Himalaya and is represented by the similar to 10 km long and 2-3 km wide Quaternary basin, interpreted as a tectonic graben. The basin is vaulted by normal faults, where master fault and the antithetic fault show continuous and enechelon behaviour respectively. The presence of normal fault system bounding the basin/graben, lead to hypothesize that the releasing bend of Kishtwar strike-slip fault is responsible for their origin. Detailed field investigation along these faults led to highlight their active nature and future prospects for palaeoseismic investigations. The active nature of these faults is supported by dip-slip movement, fault scarp, fault rupture and displacement in the Holocene and recent sediments. The spatial distribution of these features has been confirmed with the help of Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) survey. Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) dating of the deformed units demonstrate that the displacement along the Kishtwar fault has occurred between 16.35 +/- 2.13 to 13.14 +/- 0.91 ka and 13.14 +/- 0.91 to 7.89 +/- 0.71 ka.

TI  - Development of an empirical relation to assess soil spatial variability for off-road trafficability using terrain similarity analysis & geospatial data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Soils trafficability is measure of soil strength required to support the manoeuvring of military vehicles. Trafficability can be measured with the tests performed using cone penetrometer and moisture metre to understand the complexity of phenomenon. Empirical relation can be developed through the outcomes of these tests. This empirical relation can be used in tandem with geospatial data to understand the heterogeneous soil behaviour and its impact on trafficability. Further, it will enhance the remote sensing data capability to assess the trafficability in inaccessible areas. In this study, a numerical approach is described in which geo-parameters like land use, soil, elevation and moisture are quantified using various data sources such as remote sensing and ground survey information. Terrain similarity analysis was performed to find analogous soil patches of homogenous nature. The aim of this paper is to outline a procedure, which will be useful for off-road trafficability studies. The current advancement in remote sensing technologies and ground survey from digital equipment was used to have better accuracy of results along with better understanding of utilization of geo-spatial data. It will pave the way to analyse the terrain suitability for off-road trafficability operation.

TI  - The impact of indicator selection on assessment of global greening
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Greening represents a significant increase in vegetation activity. Accurate quantification of global greening in peak growth is vital for quantifying changes in terrestrial productivity. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is the remote sensing indicator most commonly applied for this purpose. However, there is limited knowledge about how the applications of other improved or newly available products can impact global greening assessments. This study reports the first systematic investigation of the impact of vegetation indicator selection on global greening in peak growth. It examines the period from 2003 to 2017 using six indicators with a spatial resolution of 500 m: Near Infrared Reflectance of terrestrial vegetation (NIRv) and the coupled diagnostic biophysical modeled Gross Primary Production (PML-GPP), together with NDVI, Enhanced Vegetation Index with two bands (EVI2), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP (MOD-GPP) calculated based on MODIS images. Vegetation trends were estimated using the Mann-Kendall test, the unanimous trends by six vegetation indicators were derived, and the concordance ratio in estimated trends by each pair of indicators was investigated among different biomes and their sensitivity to changes in climate were investigated. We found that the estimated greening and browning varied between 12-23% and 2-13% of the vegetated areas, respectively. There was more net greening estimated from NDVI and MOD-GPP (around 19%) compared to the other indicators (8-11%). The concordance ratio between EVI2 and NIRv was much higher (>94%) than other combinations (61-76%) at the global scale. The concordance ratio between one specific indicator and the other indicators gradually increased with its change magnitude. Unanimous results from these six indicators were exhibited in less than two-fifths (38.71%) of vegetated areas. Apart from the EVI2 and NIRv, the concordance ratio varied among different biomes: high in cropland (67-81%), but low in deciduous needle-leaf forest (51-62%) and very low in evergreen broadleaf forest between PML-GPP and others (37-49%). The diverse sensitivity to changes in climate contributed to the discrepancies: greening was more pronounced during warming conditions for the GPP products when compared with the greenness indices. At the global scale, the concordance ratio was higher during cooling conditions among all the indicators except between PML-GPP. Datasets supporing these findings are available online at https://github.com/FuzhouSIRC/Greening_6indicators.2

TI  - Achieving and Maintaining Safety in Healthcare Requires Unwavering Institutional and Individual Commitments
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - In 2000, "To Err Is Human" brought to light the fact that the estimated number of people dying from medical errors occurring in hospitals exceeded those that die from motor vehicle accidents (MVAs), breast cancer, or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) - three causes receiving far more public attention. The report prompted the gradual adoption of safety processes developed in the nuclear and aviation industries.However, sophisticated engineering solutions to operations are not enough. High and low mortality hospitals have similar processes and procedures, but low-mortality hospitals are more proficient at recognizing and managing serious complications as they unfold. This ability to rescue a deteriorating situation (resilience) reflects a healthier safety culture. Organizations move within the safety space in the direction of either more or less resilience depending on the fluctuation of their safety culture.Improving resilience requires transforming learned safety practices into a "habit" in conjunction with accepting accountability. Personal accountability means commitment to safe practices along with effective and transparent reporting of near misses/close calls and adverse events (AEs). Institutional accountability means putting safety first by ensuring the availability of appropriate resources, role leadership modeling, and effective management of sentinel events (SEs) to reduce harm occurrence and re-occurrence. This requires a more robust root cause analysis (RCA) process to guarantee that action plans produce strong and effective corrective measures.Synergistic coaching interventions include instilling the awareness that failure can and will happen, mapping team talents, and assessing gaps. These interventions will optimize group expertise, reaffirming the concept of institutional and personal accountability. The unending performance of drills will sustain the group resilience under both expected and unexpected conditions.Given the strong correlation between practice environment and outcomes, sustained improvement of the safety climate will produce more robust safety behaviors and ultimately better outcomes.

TI  - Cloud top height retrieval over the Arctic Ocean using a cloud-shadow method based on MODIS
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud top height (CTH) plays an important role in the Earth's radiation budget and thus in climate change. However, accurate CTH retrieval based on satellite data remains a challenge when using currently widespread methods based on passive remote sensing satellite data, particularly over the Arctic Ocean. It is well known that using geometric correlation between CTH and cloud-shadow distance along the normal direction of sunlight, cloud-edge top height (CETH) can be determined. However, this cloud-shadow method (CSM) exhibited larger CTH errors due to low-resolution weather satellite data of the past. The aim of the paper is to analyze the effect of higher-resolution images (MODIS with 250-m resolution) on CSM accuracy. We present a method in which CETH is first retrieved using the MODIS data, and to calculate CTH in the center of cloud region by combining the calculated CETH and cloud top brightness temperature using an environmental temperature lapse rate method. We validated 14 cases over the Arctic Ocean by the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations) CTH lidar product and another two cases by radiosonde data. CSM revealed better performance (mean difference is 0.45 km and standard deviation is 0.92 km) compared to the operational MODIS CTH product (mean difference is -0.78 km and standard deviation is 1.78 km), when validated by the CALIPSO product. When validated by sounding data, CSM also performed better than the MODIS CTH product: the CSM CTH errors are 0.41 and 0.52 km in two sounding cases, while the corresponding MODIS CTH errors are -1.10 and 1.07 km. The CSM technique especially showed better performance for double-deck cloud systems. We conclude that further improvements in CTH accuracy based on CSM can be achieved by mainly using higher resolution satellite imagery.

TI  - Efficient RTM-based training of machine learning regression algorithms to quantify biophysical & biochemical traits of agricultural crops
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With an upcoming unprecedented stream of imaging spectroscopy data, there is a rising need for tools and software applications exploiting the spectral possibilities to extract relevant information on an operational basis. In this study, we investigate the potential of a scientific processor designed to quantify biophysical and biochemical crop traits from spectroscopic imagery of the upcoming Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) satellite. Said processor relies on a hybrid retrieval workflow executing pre-trained machine learning regression models fast and efficiently based on training data from a lookup table of synthetic vegetation spectra and their associated parameterization of the well-known radiative transfer model (RTM) PROSAIL. The established models provide spatial information about leaf area index (LAI), average leaf inclination angle (ALIA), leaf chlorophyll content (C-ab) and leaf mass per area (C-m). In contrast to using site-specific training data, the approach facilitates a universal application without the need to integrate a priori information into the processor. Four machine learning algorithms, namely artificial neural networks (ANN), random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine regression (SVR), and Gaussian process regression (GPR), were found to estimate biophysical and biochemical variables of unseen targets with high performance (relative error scores < 10%). ANNs excelled in terms of accuracy, model size and execution time when the 242 spectral bands were transformed into 15 principal components, the signals of which were scaled by a z-transformation. Validation using in situ data from the SPARC03 Barrax campaign dataset revealed an overall good estimation of measured functional traits, for instance for LAI with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.81 m(2) m(-2), and for C-ab RMSE of 6.2 mu g cm(-2) with the ANN model. Moreover, both crop traits could be successfully mapped using a pseudo-EnMAP scene revealing plausible within-field patterns. Conformity with LAI output of the SNAP biophysical processor was found especially for grassland and maize in the vegetative stages. Based on these findings, ANN models are considered the best choice for implementation of a hybrid retrieval workflow within the context of operational agricultural crop traits monitoring from future satellite imaging spectroscopy.

TI  - Influence of the mightiest rivers worldwide on coastal sea surface temperature warming
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean warming as a consequence of climate change occurred during the last decades is not homogeneous. This is especially patent for coastal areas, where the warming is influenced by local processes that occur at different time and spatial scales. In this sense, plumes formed by rivers discharge can play a key role in sea surface temperature (SST) warming. SST trends for the coastal points affected by the plumes of the 19 world's mightiest rivers (south 60 degrees N) and their oceanic counterparts were analyzed by means of NOAA's AVHRR OISST data over the period 1982-2019. Coastal areas affected by river plumes showed an annual less intense warming trend than observed at the adjacent ocean in all cases. In average, warming trend was 0.088 degrees C dec(-1) lower for coastal areas, ranging from 0.027 degrees C dec(-1) for Mekong and lrrawaddy/Salween River plume systems to 0.208 degrees C dec(-1) and 0.278 degrees C dec(-1) for Mississippi and Parana River plumes. The differences in coastal-ocean warming obtained for rivers debouching into inland seas (Danube and Volga Rivers) are similar to the ones observed for the rest of the rivers, even if inland seas are prone to higher warming rates than open seas. As the main conclusion, river plumes seem to have the ability to modulate SST warming near coast within the current context of global warming. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - COVID-19 induced lockdown and decreasing particulate matter (PM10): An empirical investigation of an Asian megacity
T2  - URBAN CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The air quality in the cities of developing countries is deteriorating with the proliferation of anthmpogenic activities that add pollutant matters in the lower part of the troposphere. Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter lower than 10 mu m (PM10) is considered one of the direct indicators of air quality in an urban area as it brings health morbidities. The article empirically investigates the role COVID-19 related lockdown has played in bringing down pollution level (PM10) in the megacity of Kolkata. It does so by taking account of PM10 level in three stages - pre, presage and complete-lockdown timelines. The extracted results show a significant declining trend (about 77% vis-a-vis the pre-lockdown period) with 95% of the geographical area under 100 mu m/m(3) and a strong fit with the station-based records. The feasibility and robustness showed by the remotely sensed data along with other earth observatory information for larger-scale pollution prevalence make its adoption imperative. Simultaneously, it becomes urgent in times of lockdown when the physical mobility of maintenance and research staff to stations is significantly curtailed. The work contributes to study on PM10 by its ability to replicate in examining cities of both the global north and global south.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The study focused on deriving the LST of the Raipur City of India and generating the relationships of LST with six selected remote sensing indices, like MNDWI, NDBaI, NDBI, NDVI, NDWI, and NMDI. The entire study was performed by using 210 cloud-free Landsat data of different months from 1988 to 2019. The LST retrieval mono-window algorithm was applied in the study. Based on Pearson's linear correlation coefficient (r), the study finds that LST builds a strong positive correlation (r = 0.65) with NDBI, a moderate positive correlation (r = 0.30) with NDBaI, a weak positive correlation with NDWI (r = 0.19), a strong negative relation with NMDI (r = -0.54), and a moderate negative correlation (r = -0.38) with MNDWI and NDVI. These relationships were consistent and stronger in earlier years. The LST-NDBI correlation is the most consistent (CV = 9.09), while the LST-NDBaI correlation is the most variable (CV = 60.21).

TI  - Do Arabian babblers play mixed strategies in a "volunteer's dilemma"?
T2  - JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL AND EXPERIMENTAL ECONOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - When group-living Arabian babbler songbirds hear a sentinel alarm call that indicates a raptor approach, they should instantaneously choose whether to flee to shelter, or rather to expose themselves while calling towards the raptor to communicate to it its detection. If enough group members thus signal to the raptor their vigilance, the raptor is likely to be dissuaded from attacking the group. Groupmates thus engage in a variant of the "volunteer's dilemma" game (Diekmann, 1985), whose symmetric equilibrium is in mixed strategies.We check whether in nature Arabian babblers indeed make independent randomized choices upon hearing alarm calls, in natural conditions as well as in a controlled field experiment in which recorded alarm calls were broadcast to group members. We use a resampling method to check for independence across group members in their reactions to sentinel alarm calls.In natural conditions independent mixed-strategy behaviour was refuted, and not refuted in the artificial conditions of the experiment. This is the first real-world test of mixed-strategy behaviour in games with more than two players.

TI  - Quality of Sub-national Government and Regional Development in Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENT STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite widespread interest in government quality and economic development, the role of sub-national government has been largely overlooked. This represents an omission in Africa, given ongoing processes of devolution in much of the continent. In this article, we consider the impact of sub-national government institutions on economic development in 339 regions across 22 African countries. We create a novel index of sub-national government quality based on large-scale survey data and assess its impact on regional economies using satellite data on night light luminosity. To address causality concerns, we instrument sub-national government quality with data from pre-colonial societies. Our results show a positive and significant relationship between sub-national government quality and regional economic development, even when controlling for the quality of national-level institutions. Better sub-national governments are a powerful but often overlooked determinant of development in Africa.

TI  - Severe haze events in the Indo-Gangetic Plain during post-monsoon: Synergetic effect of synoptic meteorology and crop residue burning emission
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, the frequent occurrence of haze events in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) during crop residue burning period has caused a serious reduction in atmospheric visibility and deteriorated air quality. The present study is carried out to investigate the haze event observed in IGP in Nov 2017 using ground-based observations, satellite data and synoptic meteorology to understand the possible factors responsible for haze formation. PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m) concentrations and Air Quality Index (AQI) at two sites (Agra and Delhi) situated in the central Indo-Gangetic Plain (CIGP) showed a sudden increase in PM2.5 concentrations and deteriorated air quality during 7-14 Nov. To monitor the variation of particulate matter (PM) in IGP, PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 10 mu m) concentrations were monitored at 22 stations in 12 cities of IGP during 1-15 Nov which also showed an increase in PM concentrations during haze event (7-14 Nov). Crop residue burning activities in north-west Indo-Gangetic Plain (NW-IGP) were observed during haze event. Synoptic weather conditions of IGP identified using geopotential height and wind at 700 hPa showed high-pressure systems and low winds in IGP favoring stagnant conditions during haze event. A detailed analysis of the variation of pollutants and meteorology was carried out at Agra. Ozone (O-3), carbon monoxide (CO). sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) showed higher concentrations during haze event along with lower temperature, low wind speed and high relative humidity. Aerosol ionic composition showed a higher contribution (similar to 84%) of Cl-, NO3-, SO42- and NH4+ to total soluble ions suggesting secondary aero- sol formation during haze event.

TI  - Influence of two management practices in the Canadian Prairies on radiative forcing
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo and soil carbon sequestration are influenced by agricultural management practices which impact the Earth's radiation budget and climate change. In this study we investigate the impact of reduced summer fallowing and reduced tillage in the Canadian Prairies on climate change by estimating the change in radiative forcing due to albedo and soil carbon sequestration. Seasonal variations of albedo, which are dependent on agricultural management practices and soil colour in three soil zones, were derived from 10-day composite 250-m Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Using this information, we found an overall increase of surface albedo due to the conversion from summer fallowing to continuous cropping and from conventional tillage (CT) to either no-tillage (NT) or reduced tillage (RT). The increase was dependent on soil brightness, type of vegetation and snow cover. Using data from the Census of Agriculture and taking into consideration both albedo and soil carbon changes, we estimated that from 1981 to 2016, the total radiative forcing for the cropland area in the Canadian Prairies was -405 mu W m(-2) due to the conversion of CT to either NT or RT and about 70% was due to the change in albedo. During the same period, the total radiative forcing was -410 mu W m(-2) due to a reduction in the area under summer fallow and about 62% was due to the change in albedo. The equivalent atmospheric CO2 drawdown from these two management changes from albedo change was about 7.8 and 8.7 Tg CO2 yr(-1), respectively. These results demonstrate that it is important to consider both the changes of soil carbon and surface albedo in evaluating climate change impacts due to agricultural management practices.

TI  - Spatio-temporal analysis of air quality and its relationship with major COVID-19 hotspot places in India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic spread worldwide, such as wind, with more than 400,000 documented cases as of March 24th, 2020. In this regard, strict lockdown measures were imposed in India on the same date to stop virus spread. Thereafter, various lockdown impacts were observed, and one of the immediate effects was a reduction in air pollution levels across the world and in India as well. In this study, we have observed approximately 40% reduction in air quality index (AQI) during one month of lockdown in India. The detailed investigations were performed for 14 major hotspot places where the COVID-19 cases were >1000 (as of 1st June 2020) and represents more than 70% associated mortality in India. We assessed the impact of lockdown on different air quality indicators, including ground (PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O-3, and AQI) and tropospheric nitric oxide (NO2) pollutants, through ground monitoring stations and Sentinel-5 satellite datasets respectively. The highest reductions were noticed in NO2 (-48.68%), PM2.5 (-34.84%) and PM10 (-33.89%) air pollutant (unit in mu g/m(3)) post-lockdown. Moreover, tropospheric NO2 (mol/m(2)) concentrations were also improved over Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Thane, and Ahmedabad metro cities. We found strong positive correlation of COVID-19 mortality with PM10 (R-2 = 0.145; r = 0.38) and AQI (R-2 = 0.17; r = 0.412) pollutant indicators that significantly improved next time point. The correlation finding suggests that long-term bad air quality may aggravate the clinical symptoms of the disease.

TI  - BO Ari Light Curve Analysis using Ground-Based and TESS Data
T2  - NEW ASTRONOMY
M3  - Article
AB  - We present new BVR band photometric light curves of BO Aries obtained in 2020 and combined them with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) light curves. We obtained times of minima based on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions and then applied the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method to measure the amount of uncertainty from our CCD photometry and TESS data. A new ephemeris of the binary system was computed employing 204 times of minimum. The light curves were analyzed using the Wilson-Devinney binary code combined with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. For this light curve solution, we considered a dark spot on the primary component. We conclude that this binary is an A-type system with a mass ratio of q = 0.2074 +/- 0.0001, an orbital inclination of i = 82.18 +/- 0.02 deg, and a fillout factor of f = 75.7 +/- 0.8%. Our results for the a (R-circle dot) and q parameters are consistent with the results of the Xu-Dong Zhang and Sheng-Bang Qian (2020) model. The absolute parameters of the two components were calculated and the distance estimate of the binary system was found to be 142 +/- 9 pc.

TI  - Effects of land use/land cover alterations on regional meteorology over Northwest India
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigation activities, as part of the agricultural green revolution, in Northwest India are aimed at transforming barrenland to agriculturally productive area. The main objective of this study is to determine the effects of these land use land cover (LULC) transformations on regional meteorology over this region. Satellite derived LULC classes in 2003 and 2012 reveal conversion of significantly large areas of barrenland to open shrubland and open shrubland to cropland over Northwest India. Model simulations show that these LULC changes (LULCC) alone decreases sensible heat flux (SHF) over this region by -5.85 +/- 0.24Wm(-2) and enhances latent heat flux (LHF) by 11.03 +/- 0.41Wm(-2), with prominent changes over the exact regions of LULCC. These alterations lead to decrease in surface level air temperature by -0.14 +/- 0.005 K and increase in relative humidity by 1.48 +/- 0.03%. While reanalysis data show increase (decrease) in LHF (SHF) at a rate of 8.5Wm(-2)dec(-1) (-5.67Wm(-2)dec(-1)), satellite measurements show increasing trend in near surface relative humidity at a rate of 2.13%dec(-1) with an increasing trend in daily mean air temperature (0.3Kdec(-1)). However, day time air temperature and diurnal temperature range decreases at rates of -0.007Kdec(-1) and -0.6Kdec(-1) respectively. To delineate the contribution of LULCC from the measured trend of daily mean temperatures, Observation Minus Reanalysis (OMR) method has been employed. OMR analysis shows a decreasing trend in daily mean temperature (-0.48Kdec(-1)) and increasing trend in RH (6.85% dec(-1)), corroborating the model simulated changes. The study shows increase in vegetated area over Northwest India, which leads to increase in evapo-transpiration. This affects the regional meteorology by enhancing humidity and SHF and reducing LHF and temperature. These results demonstrate that the land-based mitigation strategies yield measurable climatic benefits over the period of one or two decades, in contrast to the much longer time period generally required for greenhouse gases to cycle through the climate system.

TI  - Has COVID-19 halted winter-spring wildfires in the Mediterranean? Insights for wildfire science under a pandemic context
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfires in the Mediterranean are strongly tied to human activities. Given their particular link with humans, which act as both initiators and suppressors, wildfire hazard is highly sensitive to socioeconomic changes and patterns. Many researchers have prompted the perils of sustaining the current management policy, the so called 'total fire exclusion'. This policy, coupled to increasingly fire-prone weather conditions, may lead to more hazardous fires in the mid-long run. Under this framework, the irruption of the COVID-19 pandemic adds to the ongoing situation. Facing the lack of an effective treatment, the only alternative was the implementation of strict lockdown strategies. The virtual halt of the system undoubtedly affected economic and social behavior, triggering cascading effects such as the drop in winter-spring wildfire activity. In this work, we discuss the main impacts, challenges and consequences that wildfire science may experience due to the pandemic situation, and identify potential opportunities for wildfire management. We investigate the recent evolution of burned area (retrieved from the MCD64A1 v006 MODIS product) in the EU Mediterranean region (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy and Greece) to ascertain to what extent the 2020 winter-spring season was impacted by the public health response to COVID-19 (curfews and lockdowns). We accounted for weather conditions (characterized using the 6-month Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index; SPEI6) to disregard possible weather effects mediating fire activity. Our results suggest that, under similar drought-related circumstances (SPEI6 approximate to -0.7), the expected burned area in 2020 during the lockdown period in the EU (March-May) would lay somewhere within the range of 38,800 ha +/- 18,379 ha. Instead, the affected area stands one order of magnitude below average (3325 ha). This stresses the need of considering the social dimension in the analysis of current and future wildfire impacts in the Mediterranean region. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to classify the cubic polynomialsH(z,x,y)=(j+k <= 3)Sigma -a(jk)(z)x(j)y(k)over the field of algebraic functions such that the corresponding Hamiltonian system x' = H-y, y' = - H-x has at least one transcendental algebroid solution. Ignoring trivial subcases, the investigations essentially lead to several non-trivial Hamiltonians which are closely related to Painleve's equations P-I, P-II, P-34, and P-IV. Up to normalisation of the leading coefficients, common Hamiltonians areHI : = -2y(3) + 1/2x(2) - zyH-II/34 : x(2)y - 1/2y(2) + 1/2zy +kappa xx(2)y + xy(2) +2zxy+2 kappa x+2 lambda yHIV: 1/3 (x(3)+y(3))+zxy+kappa x+lambda y,but the zoo of non-equivalent Hamiltonians turns out to be much larger.

TI  - Plant species classification in salt marshes using phenological parameters derived from Sentinel-2 pixel-differential time-series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Salt marshes are one of the most productive but vulnerable ecosystems on Earth; and due to the continued intensification of natural and anthropogenic pressures on them, accurate and timely information on the distribution of plant species in salt marshes is needed for effective coastal management. Time-series approaches have been widely applied to classify plant species; however, developing time-series with high spatial and temporal resolution over coastal zones remains challenging due to the influence caused by frequent cloud cover and periodic tidal fluctuations. In this study, aiming at the above challenges, we presented a saltmarsh vegetation classification method using phenological parameters derived from Sentinel-2 pixel-differential time-series (PDTS): first, a PDTS that each pixel has a different distribution of observations was constructed using a time series cloud mask; second, a tidal filter determined by the threshold and frequency of the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) was used to exclude tide-related observations from the PDTS; third, phenological parameters that highlight the differences among salt marsh vegetation were extracted from a two term Fourier fitting curve as classification features; and finally, the random forest algorithm was used for plant species classification with the assistance of sample data. Six common plant species (Spartina alterniflora, Phragmites australis, Suaeda salsa, Tamarix chinensis, Imperata cylindrica, and Scirpus mariqueter) from three representative coastal sites in China were analyzed. The major results were as follows: (1) The MNDWI demonstrated superior ability in identifying flooding pixels, with an overall accuracy of similar to 0.91. After tidal filtering, the R-2 of the fitting curve for more than 70% of the vegetated salt marsh pixels was improved with an average increase of 0.113. (2) The six plant species exhibit unique phenological characteristics. In particular, P. australis has an advanced green-up season, 19-42 days earlier than that of the other plant species mentioned above, whereas S. alterniflora senesces one to two months later than the native plant species. (3) The average overall accuracy of the plant species classification based on the PDTS was 81.5%. Compared with a single-image based classification, the PDTS-based classification demonstrated a 5.1% improvement in overall accuracy, which is expected to serve the annual monitoring dynamics of the salt marsh.

TI  - Region-wide glacier area and mass budgets for the Shaksgam River Basin, Karakoram Mountains, during 2000-2016
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The Karakoram Mountains are well known for their widespread surge-type glaciers and slight glacier mass gains. On the one hand, glaciers are one of the sensitive indicators of climate change, their area and thickness will adjust with climate change. On the other hand, glaciers provide freshwater resources for agricultural irrigation and hydroelectric generation in the downstream areas of the Shaksgam River Basin (SRB) in Western China. The shrinkage of glaciers caused by climate change can significantly affect the security and sustainable development of regional water resources. In this study, we analyzed the changes in glacier area from 2000 to 2016 in the SRB using Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper)/ETM+ (Enhanced Mapper Plus)/OLI (Operational Land Imager) images. It is shown that the SRB contained 472 glaciers, with an area of 1840.3 km(2), in 2016. The glacier area decreased by 0.14%/a since 2000, and the shrinkage of glacier in the southeast, east and south directions were the most, while the northeast, north directions were the least. Debris-covered area accounted for 8.0% of the total glacier area. We estimated elevation and mass changes using the 1 arc-second SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) DEM (Digital Elevation Model) (2000) and the resolution of 8 m HMA (High Mountain Asia) DEM (2016). An average thickness of 0.08 (+/- 0.03) m/a, or a slight mass increase of 0.06 (+/- 0.02) m w.e./a has been obtained since 2000. We found thinning was significantly lesser on the clean ice than the debris-covered ice. In addition, the elevation of glacier surface is spatially heterogeneous, showing that the accumulation of mass is dominant in high altitude regions, and the main mass loss is in low altitude regions, excluding the surge-type glacier. For surge-type glaciers, the mass may transfer from the reservoir to the receiving area rapidly when surges, then resulting in an advance of glacier terminus. The main surge mechanism is still unclear, it is worth noting that the surge did not increase the glacier mass in this study.

TI  - Estimation of shrubland aboveground biomass of the desert steppe from optical and C-band SAR data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurately estimating the shrubland aboveground biomass (AGB) of the desert steppe and understanding its dynamic changes are vitally important for studying the regional carbon cycle and sustainable use of grassland resources. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are seldom applied to estimate shrubland AGB, particularly in arid and semiarid desert steppe landscapes. The main objective of this study was to model shrubland AGB in arid and semiarid desert steppe regions with HJ1B and RADARSAT-2 C-band data. The main species was Caragana microphylla, one of the most widespread shrubs in desert grasslands. Three regression models based on stepwise multiple linear regression (SMLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR) and random forest regression (RFR) were developed between the measured AGB and radar backscatter coefficient, vegetation indices and texture information. The three methods were compared, and their performance was evaluated for the estimation of shrubland AGB from HJ1B and RADARSAT-2 data. The results show that SAR can produce higher accuracy with R-2 = 0.34-0.42 than PLSR and RFR in arid and semiarid desert steppe regions. The RF results were slightly worse than those of SMLR and PLSR for sparse vegetation. The use of C-band SAR data to monitor dynamic changes in shrubland AGB in northern China will be of great value.

TI  - Probabilistic merging and verification of monthly gridded aerosol products
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aims at merging five gridded products of monthly aerosol optical depth (AOD), namely, MERRA-2, MISR, MODIS-Terra, MODIS-Aqua, and VIIRS, over a period of eight years, from 2012 March to 2020 February. Since these individual products offer alternative realizations of the same underlying AOD process, it is beneficial to study them collectively. To that effect, several parametric and nonparametric regressions, including ensemble model output statistics, quantile regression, quantile regression neural network, and quantile regression forest, are used to optimally combine these products. These regressions generate predictive distributions or quantiles, and thus can be thought of as probabilistic merging or fusion tools. As compared to traditional merging or fusion techniques, which only issue single-valued predictions of AOD, the present ones allow the final AOD product to carry a notion of probability, which is essential for uncertainty quantification. To assess the quality of the final AOD product with respect to that of the individual products, this study employs the important, yet often overlooked, distribution-oriented verification approach. In addition, the calibration and sharpness of the predictive distributions issued by different merging techniques are compared using two strictly proper scoring rules, as well as appropriate graphical tools. Overall, a significant reduction (13%) in root mean square error is achieved by the best merging method (quantile regression forest) compared to the best original dataset (MERRA-2). A significant reduction in bias is also achieved with respect to the MODIS and VIIRS databases, and even more so, to MISR's.

TI  - Quaternary crustal reactivation of the southwestern Beishan, NW China: The Liuyuan sinistral transpressional duplex
T2  - TECTONOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We report remote sensing evidence and reconnaissance field observations for an actively evolving transpressional duplex 150 km north of Tibet, in the southern Beishan region of western China. We analyze Landsat-8, Google Earth and SRTM-30 data to reveal active fault traces, kinematics, offset contacts and landforms, and the overall duplex geometry in an area of limited recorded seismicity compared to surrounding regions. Eight NE-striking faults transfer sinistral displacement between E-W bounding faults and accommodate N-S shortening by sinistral-reverse displacements that have tilted the internal duplex blocks. The potential moment magnitude of a surface-rupturing event on one fault, that displays a twenty km-long, 1-3 m-high surface scarp, is estimated to be 6.6. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests the Beishan is a region of subtly expressed, but widespread, continental interior, strike-slip reactivation at low strain rates - challenging the long-held view that the Beishan has anomalous crustal stability within the huge Indo-Eurasia deformation field.

TI  - A long-term record (1995-2019) of the dynamics of land desertification in the middle reaches of Yarlung Zangbo River basin derived from Landsat data
T2  - GEOGRAPHY AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Widespread desertification in the middle part of the Yarlung Zangbo River (YZR) basin is threatening the sustainable development of this region. To capture this process, a method was proposed for large-scale desertification monitoring by using Landsat images from 1995 to 2019. The method used an integrated classification method combined with a hierarchical decision tree and nearest neighbor classifiers. The spatio-temporal dynamics of the desertification pattern were analyzed to assist in the detection of possible driving forces. Using validation samples collected from Google Earth high-resolution images and field investigations, the overall accuracy of the classification in 2019 was 92.3% with a Kappa coefficient of 0.84. The major results were: (1) total sandy land area in 2019 was 734.1 km(2), which accounted for 3.7% of the study area, prominently distributed along the wide river valleys and inlets of tributaries with a strip and discontinuous pattern. Sandy land tends to be distributed in the southern aspect regions with lower elevations and that are closer to rivers; (2) sandy land areas showed two temporal stages: a gradual increase of 102.4 km(2) from 1995 to 2015 and a large decrease of 106.8 km(2) from 2015 to 2019; (3) newly increased sandy land was distributed in the YZR Valley, while the revegetation on sandy land occurred mainly in the Lhasa River basin and some regions in the YZR Valley; and (4) increased sandy land area of 142.1 km(2) was mainly distributed in the southern band of the two rivers. Correspondingly, revegetation on sandy land was more effective on the northern banks of the river valleys. These findings provide guidance for implementing vegetation recovery on sandy lands and provide important insights for maintaining sustainable development.

TI  - The key role of inter-row vegetation and ants on predation in Mediterranean organic vineyards
T2  - AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Biodiversity-friendly farming practices are taking centre stage, with herbicide use sparking major public debate on human health. Vegetation cover is increasingly used to enhance agroecosystem biodiversity and functions, providing important ecosystem services like biological pest control. However, further information is required on the relationship between vegetation cover, natural enemies, and pest predation. Using a sentinel prey experiment set up in 26 Mediterranean organic vineyards, we analysed the response of generalist predators, and the associated final predation and dynamics under three inter-row management types: bare soil, one out of two inter rows vegetated and all inter-rows vegetated. Predation on sentinel prey was monitored on the ground and on the vine trunk throughout the daytime and after a night of exposure. Generalist predator abundance was quantified using pitfall traps. Final sentinel prey predation both on vine trunks and on the ground were significantly higher in fully vegetated vineyards, with a shorter prey survival time than in tilled vineyards. Both diurnal and nocturnal predation were significantly related to increased vegetation cover and richness. Moreover, 96 % of the identified predation events involved ants. We demonstrated the key role of vegetation cover in improving the predation function through a spill-over from the inter-row to the grapevine. Contrary to what is commonly observed in agrosystems, we clearly identified ants as the predominant predator both on the ground and on the vine trunk. Our study has important implications for Mediterranean vineyard management, promoting vegetation as a nature-based solution. Sustainable management of vineyard vegetation favouring the natural predator community may contribute to a reduction in pesticide use and fossil fuel consumption.

TI  - Ground-penetrating radar, electromagnetic induction, terrain, and vegetation observations coupled with machine learning to map permafrost distribution at Twelvemile Lake, Alaska
T2  - PERMAFROST AND PERIGLACIAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - We collected ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and frequency-domain electromagnetic induction (FDEM) profiles in 2011 and 2012 to identify the extent of permafrost relative to surface biomass and solar insolation around Twelvemile Lake near Fort Yukon, Alaska. We compared a Landsat-derived biomass estimate and modeled solar insolation from a digital elevation model to the geophysical measurements. We show correspondence between vegetation type and biomass relative to permafrost extent and seasonal freeze-thaw. Thicker permafrost (>= 25 m) was covered by greater biomass, and seasonal thaw depths in these regions were minimal (1 m). Shallow (1-3 m depth) and thin (20-50 cm) newly forming permafrost or frozen layers from the previous winter occurred below northward oriented slopes with thin biomass cover. South-facing slopes exhibited permafrost when there was enough biomass to shield incoming solar energy. We developed an artificial neural network to predict permafrost extent across the broader region by mapping GPR-observed instances of permafrost to FDEM, biomass, and terrain observations with 90.2% accuracy. We identified a strong linear correlation (r = -0.77) between permafrost probability and seasonal thaw depth, indicating that our models may also be used to explore thaw patterns and variability in active layer thickness. This study highlights the combined influence of biomass and terrain on the presence of permafrost and the value of evaluating such parameters via remote sensing to predict permafrost spatial or temporal variability. Incorporating diverse geophysical datasets with in-situ validation into machine learning models demonstrates a useful approach to upscale estimated permafrost extent across large Arctic expanses.

TI  - A limited effect of sub-tropical typhoons on phytoplankton dynamics
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoons are assumed to stimulate primary ocean production through the upward mixing of nutrients into the ocean surface. This assumption is based largely on observations of increased surface chlorophyll concentrations following the passage of typhoons. This surface chlorophyll enhancement, occasionally detected by satellites, is often undetected due to intense cloud coverage. Daily data from a BGC-Argo profiling float revealed the upper-ocean response to Typhoon Trami in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Temperature and chlorophyll changed rapidly, with a significant drop in sea surface temperature and a surge in surface chlorophyll associated with strong vertical mixing, which was only partially captured by satellite observations. However, no net increase in vertically integrated chlorophyll was observed during Typhoon Trami or in its wake. In contrast to the prevailing dogma, the result shows that typhoons likely have a limited effect on net primary ocean production. Observed surface chlorophyll enhancements during and immediately following typhoons in tropical and subtropical waters are more likely to be associated with surface entrainment of deep chlorophyll maxima. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that remote sensing data alone can overestimate the impact of storms on primary production in all oceans. Full understanding of the impact of storms on upper-ocean productivity can only be achieved with ocean-observing robots dedicated to high-resolution temporal sampling in the path of storms.

TI  - Transformative Radical Self-care by Women in African and Pan-African Spiritual Traditions: Divine Power of Joy, Lemonade Self-care, Self-love Holiday
T2  - JOURNAL OF WOMEN POLITICS & POLICY
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring radical self-care practices as liberatory political resistance exposes the paradox that freedom from suffering is not free or an entitlement, instead it is a daily practice. This is a particularly important political claim for the three radical self-care practices surveyed in this article: Queen Mother Maasht Amm Amen's The Divine Power of Joy events live-streamed and held in-person in the United States; Nalokai, Omisade, and Julia's The Lemonade Series: Self-Care and Renewal Retreat in Treasure Beach, Jamaica; and Oyabunmi's The Self Love Holiday Retreat in Dominicale, Costa Rica. Each practice was envisioned, organized, and led by Black women linked to African or Pan-African spiritual traditions between 2018 and 2020. Drawing on participant observation, interviews, and digital print media, what emerged from these events are theories and practices influenced by a worldview reflective of a collective spiritual and political response to the afterlives of punitive public policies including Johnson's "War on Poverty'' and Nixon's "War on Drugs'' which have contributed to the othering and subjugation of Black bodies, Black experiences, and Black politics enforced through violent punishment. The execution of these punitive public policies consequently provides an enduring context for alternative forms of radical and liberatory political resistance. Intersectionality, as a liberatory practice for Black women, proved to be a useful methodology for analyzing and making sense of how the COVID-19 crisis exposed racial, health, and economic disparities, the global mass resistance to anti-Black racism, criminalization resulting in police murders of unarmed Black and Brown people, and the rise of radical self-care events. The three radical self-care practices created by Black women are examples of new legacies being forged through ongoing and evolving strategic activities and techniques that produce what I call transformative radical self-determination.

TI  - Application of remotely sensed sea surface temperature for assessment of recurrent coral bleaching (2014-2019) impact on a marginal coral ecosystem
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2014-2016 El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) caused a prolonged marine heatwave that led to widespread coral bleaching and mortality across the Indo-pacific coral reefs. Prediction of coral bleaching and assessment of bleaching impact on corals is vital for reef ecosystem functioning, services and management. Wherein, advanced satellite remote sensing approach to determine and quantify the thermal stress on corals can assist as an alternative and convenient tool for reef monitoring programs. The present study examines the impact of consecutive coral bleaching episodes on shallow-water marginalized patch reef ecosystems on the Eastern Arabian Sea. Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) satellite data from the NOAA Coral Reef Watch's (NOAA-CRW) platform, known as CoralTemp, were used to analyze the thermal stress on the coral reefs. Coral bleaching indices like Bleaching Threshold (BT), Positive Anomaly (PA), and Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) were calculated. Ground-truthing revealed that detected thermal stress from satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data over this region well corroborate with the mass coral bleaching events, and found reliable for detecting coral bleaching episodes in the marginalized turbid coral habitats. This study signifies the potential benefit of incorporating remote sensed SST data in coral bleaching monitoring program, which may guide to undertake targeted coral surveys and aid in decision-making and conservation of the vulnerable coral reef ecosystems.

TI  - Novel Diagnostic Approaches for Assessment of the Clinically Negative Neck in Head and Neck Cancer Patients
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - In head and neck cancer, the presence of nodal disease is a strong determinant of prognosis and treatment. Despite the use of modern multimodality diagnostic imaging, the prevalence of occult nodal metastases is relatively high. This is why in clinically node negative head and neck cancer the lymphatics are treated "electively" to eradicate subclinical tumor deposits. As a consequence, many true node negative patients undergo surgery or irradiation of the neck and suffer from the associated and unnecessary early and long-term morbidity. Safely tailoring head and neck cancer treatment to individual patients requires a more accurate pre-treatment assessment of nodal status. In this review, we discuss the potential of several innovative diagnostic approaches to guide customized management of the clinically negative neck in head and neck cancer patients.

TI  - Evaluating natural experiments in ecology: using synthetic controls in assessments of remotely sensed land treatments
T2  - ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Many important ecological phenomena occur on large spatial scales and/or are unplanned and thus do not easily fit within analytical frameworks that rely on randomization, replication, and interspersed a priori controls for statistical comparison. Analyses of such large-scale, natural experiments are common in the health and econometrics literature, where techniques have been developed to derive insight from large, noisy observational data sets. Here, we apply a technique from this literature, synthetic control, to assess landscape change with remote sensing data. The basic data requirements for synthetic control include (1) a discrete set of treated and untreated units, (2) a known date of treatment intervention, and (3) time series response data that include both pre- and post-treatment outcomes for all units. Synthetic control generates a response metric for treated units relative to a no-action alternative based on prior relationships between treated and unexposed groups. Using simulations and a case study involving a large-scale brush-clearing management event, we show how synthetic control can intuitively infer treatment effect sizes from satellite data, even in the presence of confounding noise from climate anomalies, long-term vegetation dynamics, or sensor errors. We find that accuracy depends on the number and quality of potential control units, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate control populations. Although we consider the synthetic control approach in the context of natural experiments with remote sensing data, we expect the methodology to have wider utility in ecology, particularly for systems with large, complex, and poorly replicated experimental units.

TI  - Performance of OLCI Sentinel-3A satellite in the Northeast Pacific coastal waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal oceans play a pivotal role in fisheries production and global biogeochemical cycles, making large-scale monitoring an essential task. The advent of modern remote sensors, such as OLCI (Ocean Land Colour Instrument), on board the Sentinel-3A satellite, has made it possible to obtain oceanic biogeochemical products at higher spatial (300 m) and temporal (daily) resolutions than previously possible. However, validating the Sentinel-3A retrievals for coastal waters is an ongoing effort. Using a regional in situ dataset from British Columbia (BC) and Southeast Alaska (SEA) coastal waters, we evaluated the performance of OLCI Sentinel-3A in retrieving remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) and biophysical products, including total suspended matter (TSM), chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and coloured dissolved organic matter (CDOM). The OLCI data were processed through a spectral optimization-based algorithm (POLYMER) and a neural net-based (NN) algorithm (C2RCC), including the original (C2RCC v1) and the alternative version (altNN or v2), in which the neural network was trained with extended ranges to cope with larger dynamic range for high backscatter waters. The processors? performance was evaluated through match-up analysis using data from southern BC, as well as expected ranges and seasonal trends for northern BC and SEA. Multimetric statistical analyses demonstrated that POLYMER provided the best overall performance for TSM and Chl-a retrievals, with the Chl-a product improved by the use of the so-called ?Case-2? flag. Despite the relative outperformance of POLYMER-derived products, with low systematic biases, the relative percent differences are still high (80?100%) and should be acknowledged in future analyses when using these data. CDOM, only retrieved here from NN approaches, was better estimated using the alternative version of C2RCC. The best performing approaches were used to evaluate Level-3 composites for northern BC and SEA waters. The observed spatial and seasonal trends compared favourably with those reported in the literature, including highlighting more productive areas (e.g. west coast of Vancouver Island), and the important interactions between riverine systems and adjacent coastal waters (e.g., high TSM and CDOM loads near the Skeena and Nass rivers). This study demonstrated the benefits of OLCI Sentinel-3A to investigate complex coastal ecosystems and provides a robust evaluation of OLCI performance and a framework for future observational and process-oriented studies.

TI  - Evaluating mangrove conservation and sustainability through spatiotemporal (1990-2020) mangrove cover change analysis in Pakistan
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study provides the first comprehensive mangrove cover change assessment from 1990 to 2020, at five-year intervals, across all five mangrove areas in Pakistan, i.e. Indus Delta, Sandspit, Sonmiani, Kalmat Khor, and Jiwani. Using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) geospatial cloud computing platform, Random Forest (RF) classifier was applied on Landsat 30 m spatial resolution satellite images to classify three major land cover classes: 'mangrove', 'water' and 'other'. High temporal and spectral resolutions of Landsat images, with a low saturation level of spectral bands with the integration of indices, are the main factors that ensured >90% overall accuracy of land cover maps. Over the last three decades (1990-2020), the annual rate of change calculation, cross-tabulated method, and fragmentation analysis were carried out to identify the changes in mangrove cover. Overall, the findings of this paper revealed that, at the national scale, an estimated 477.22 km(2) was covered with mangrove in 1990, which increased to 1463.59 km(2) in 2020, a 3.74% annual rate of change. Mangrove fragmentation mapping results have also showed enhancement in mangrove tree canopy density. Due to planting and effective conservation practices, the current study shows positive changes in mangrove cover across all five study sites. The findings of this study will prove useful for design and implementation of mangrove ecosystem management plans, initiatives for adaptation to extreme weather events, carbon budgeting, and others.

TI  - Evolving applications of fluorescence guided surgery in pediatric surgical oncology: A practical guide for surgeons
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is an increasingly available and popular method of visual field augmentation. The basic premise of FGS entails injection of fluorescent indocyanine green (ICG) and subsequent detection with a near-infrared (NIR) camera. For pediatric surgical oncologists, FGS remains experimental but is a promising modality for identifying tumor margins, locating metastases, performing sentinel lymph node biopsies, protecting peritumoral structures of interest, and facilitating reconstruction. Familiarity with basic ICG pharmacokinetics and NIR detection optics is critical for surgeons wishing to judiciously use FGS, as its success is firmly grounded in a thorough understanding of its capabilities and limitations. In this practical guide, we outline several well-described and innovative FGS applications by disease type, including their methods of administration, modes of detection, and typical ICG dosing paradigms.

T2  - LANCET REGIONAL HEALTH-EUROPE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Disease epidemiology of (re-)emerging infectious diseases is changing rapidly, rendering surveillance of travel-associated illness important.Methods: We evaluated travel-related illness encountered at EuroTravNet clinics, the European surveillance sub-network of GeoSentinel, between March 1, 1998 and March 31, 2018.Findings: 103,739 ill travellers were evaluated, including 11,239 (10.8%) migrants, 89,620 (86.4%) patients seen post-travel, and 2,880 (2.8%) during and after travel. Despite increasing numbers of patient encounters over 20 years, the regions of exposure by year of clinic visits have remained stable. In 5-year increments, greater proportions of patients were migrants or visiting friends and relatives (VFR); business travel-associated illness remained stable; tourism-related illness decreased. Falciparum malaria was amongst the most-frequently diagnosed illnesses with 5,254 cases (5.1% of all patients) and the most-frequent cause of death (risk ratio versus all other illnesses 2.5:1). Animal exposures requiring rabies post-exposure prophylaxis increased from 0.7% (1998-2002) to 3.6% (2013-2018). The proportion of patients with seasonal influenza increased from zero in 1998-2002 to 0.9% in 2013-2018. There were 44 cases of viral haemorrhagic fever, most during the past five years. Arboviral infection numbers increased significantly as did the range of presenting arboviral diseases, dengue and chikungunya diagnoses increased by 2.6% and 1%, respectively.Interpretation: Travel medicine must adapt to serve the changing profile of travellers, with an increase in migrants and persons visiting relatives and friends and the strong emergence of vector-borne diseases, with potential for further local transmission in Europe.

TI  - Augmenting excellence, promoting diversity? Preliminary design of a foundation year for the University of Cambridge
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Undergraduate students at Cambridge come disproportionately from independent schools, high participation neighbourhoods and high socio-economic groups (SEGs). This article examines the process of designing a foundation year (FY) for Cambridge aimed at promoting SEG diversity. The transformative potential of Bourdieu's concepts of habitus, capitals and field are explored to frame the curriculum development process. Working in an intercollegiate group and drawing on international pedagogical research, we first embarked on mapping the architecture of a FY, then analysed potential students' responses to the initiative. Our survey of 304 students suggests that those from low SEGs might be encouraged to apply by a FY. They also preferred a discipline-based, not thematic, approach to developing students' academic capital. However, financial costs and concerns about 'fitting in' constituted barriers for many students. We suggest field and pedagogical transformations that are necessary to promote SEG diversity at Cambridge, rather than a FY alone.

TI  - Understanding cotton cultivation dynamics in Aksu Oases (NW China) by reconstructing change trajectories using multi-temporal Landsat and Sentinel-2 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatiotemporal dynamics of cotton cultivation patterns is an essential input to cotton farming management, production prediction and policy formulations. Thus, this study demonstrates cotton cultivation dynamics by constructing their change trajectories using multi-temporal Landsat and Sentinel-2 images. Then we reclassified the trajectories into four change trends, namely permanent cotton-field, cotton-field gain, cotton-field loss and unstable changes type. The results showed that increased cotton-cultivated areas were greater than the decreased areas. Cotton fields' expansion gradually appeared in the outer parts of the permanent cotton fields, especially towards the northern mountain front alluvial-plain. Production decline caused by cotton cultivation loss was 3.09 x 10(8) kg. The observed cotton cultivation dynamics were associated to farmers' options driven by crop price fluctuations, agricultural policies and natural conditions. The production loss was associated to cotton field loss and fields that underwent unstable changes. Management strategies should thus focus intercepting the loss and the unstable change trajectories.

TI  - Spatial variation of surface urban heat island magnitude along the urban-rural gradient of four rapidly growing Indian cities
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The unplanned and uncontrolled urbanization of Indian cities has put them under different ecological and environmental threats. Urban heat island (UHI) is one such critical ecological hazard, whereby an urban area is experiencing higher land surface temperature (LST) as compared to the surrounding rural area. In the present study, the relationship of LST and surface urban heat island (SUHI) with the degree of impervious surface (IS) and green spaces (GS) in four rapidly growing Indian cities is presented. This study utilizes different geospatial techniques, including urban-rural gradient analysis, surface urban heat island estimation using Landsat OLI/TIRS data. The results signify a strong negative correlation of LST with the IS for Ahmedabad, Jodhpur, and Nagpur, while a positive correlation is seen over Guwahati. The negative correlation is the manifestation of the urban cool island, pertaining to higher LST over rural areas. On the other hand, Guwahati is surrounded by green vegetation, which provides natural cooling and thus lowers the LST, resulting in positive SUHI. The density of GS is found to be a significant contributor of SUHI in Guwahati city, whereas in the other three cities, its impact is insignificant due to its presence in very less amount in rural surroundings.

TI  - Human movement and gully erosion: Investigating feedback mechanisms using Frequency Ratio and Least Cost Path analysis in Tigray, Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The cost of human movement, whether expressed in time, effort, or distance, is a function of natural and human related variables. At the same time, human movement itself, whether on land, air or sea, causes environmental cost. We are looking into the long-term environmental relationship of this interplay. Gullies-linear landforms, which dissect the landscape-are considered to be a cost for human movement, as they can form unpassable barriers destroying present path networks. On the other hand, human movement creates pathways, which flatten the surface and decrease the water permeability potential. This process results in runoff generation and possibly gully erosion. Accordingly, the spatial relationship between pathways and gullies is investigated. In the Tigray region of the Northern Ethiopian Highlands, gullies and pathways were mapped using remote sensing data. Frequency Ratio was used for assessing pathways as a variable affecting the location of gullies while Least Cost Paths were tested to evaluate the possible constraining impact gullies have on mobility. Based on these results, it is concluded that a positive feedback exists between the cost of human movement and gully erosion. We further discuss possible effects gullies may have had on trade, territory, and political affairs in Tigray. Consequently, we suggest that movement cost and gullying may not only hold strictly environmental or movement-related implications, but also socio-cultural ones.

TI  - Expansion of glacial lakes on Nelson and King George Islands, Maritime Antarctica, from 1986 to 2020
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to quantify the areal variation of glacial lakes in the coastal ice-free areas of King George Island (KGI) and Nelson Island (NI) from 1986 to 2020. Glacial lake and glacial area fluctuations are estimated using spaceborne remote sensing data and annual mean near-surface air temperature data from station observations and ERA-Interim reanalysis were analyzed. The area of glacial lakes expanded 732%, from 0.18 km(2) in the 1980s to 1.39 km(2) in 2020. For the 1988-2000/2003 and 2000/2003-2020 periods, the increase in NI lake area is estimated to be 190% and 86%, respectively. Meanwhile, on KGI, the increase is estimated to be 316% for the 1988-2000/2003 period and 103% for the 2000/2003-2020 period. The majority of lakes and higher lake expansions occurred at the glacier fronts and can be attributed to the melting of glacier fronts and the subsequent glacial retreat in recent decades.

TI  - A hybrid model based on general regression neural network and fruit fly optimization algorithm for forecasting and optimizing paclitaxel biosynthesis in <i>Corylus avellana</i> cell culture
T2  - PLANT METHODS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Paclitaxel is a well-known chemotherapeutic agent widely applied as a therapy for various types of cancers. In vitro culture of Corylus avellana has been named as a promising and low-cost strategy for paclitaxel production. Fungal elicitors have been reported as an impressive strategy for improving paclitaxel biosynthesis in cell suspension culture (CSC) of C. avellana. The objectives of this research were to forecast and optimize growth and paclitaxel biosynthesis based on four input variables including cell extract (CE) and culture filtrate (CF) concentration levels, elicitor adding day and CSC harvesting time in C. avellana cell culture, as a case study, using general regression neural network-fruit fly optimization algorithm (GRNN-FOA) via data mining approach for the first time. Results GRNN-FOA models (0.88-0.97) showed the superior prediction performances as compared to regression models (0.57-0.86). Comparative analysis of multilayer perceptron-genetic algorithm (MLP-GA) and GRNN-FOA showed very slight difference between two models for dry weight (DW), intracellular and extracellular paclitaxel in testing subset, the unseen data. However, MLP-GA was slightly more accurate as compared to GRNN-FOA for total paclitaxel and extracellular paclitaxel portion in testing subset. The slight difference was observed in maximum growth and paclitaxel biosynthesis optimized by FOA and GA. The optimization analysis using FOA on developed GRNN-FOA models showed that optimal CE [4.29% (v/v)] and CF [5.38% (v/v)] concentration levels, elicitor adding day (17) and harvesting time (88 h and 19 min) can lead to highest paclitaxel biosynthesis (372.89 mu g l(-1)). Conclusions Great accordance between the predicted and observed values of DW, intracellular, extracellular and total yield of paclitaxel, and also extracellular paclitaxel portion support excellent performance of developed GRNN-FOA models. Overall, GRNN-FOA as new mathematical tool may pave the way for forecasting and optimizing secondary metabolite production in plant in vitro culture.

TI  - Hydro-climatological variability in Lagunas de Vilama System, Argentinean Altiplano-Puna Plateau, Southern Tropical Andes (22° S) and its response to large-scale climate forcings
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Altiplano-Puna Plateau holds several shallow lakes, which are very sensitive to climate changes. This work is focused on a high-altitude lake system called Lagunas de Vilama (LVS), located in a complex climatic transition area with scarcity of continuous and homogeneous instrumental records. The objective of this study is to determine the regional spatial-temporal variability of precipitation and evaluate the seasonal and interannual lake responses. We use a lake-surfaces record derived from Landsat images to investigate links with regional precipitations and different climatic forcings. The results reveal that austral summer and autumn precipitations control the variability of the annual lake-surfaces. Also, we found intra-annual and interannual lags in the lake responses to precipitations, and identified several wet and dry stages. Our results show negative trends in precipitations and lake-surfaces, whose were strengthened by a shift to a warm phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation in the 1990s. The El Nino Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and Southern Annular Mode also exert a strong influence in the region. This study demonstrates that the variability of LVS lakes is strongly related to the South American Monsoon System dynamics and large-scale climate fordngs from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This work provides novel indices which demonstrated to be good indicators of regional hydroclimatological variability for this region of South America. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Validation of FY-4A AGRI layer precipitable water products using radiosonde data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the first of China's next-generation geostationary meteorological satellite series (FY-4A) can provide high temporal resolution layer precipitable water (LPW) products. The AGRI LPWs, including total precipitable water (TPW), low (PW_low), middle (PW_mid), and high (PW_high) levels precipitable water, were first validated using a year radiosonde data. The results show that AGRI LPWs generally agree well with radiosonde derived LPWs, and the accuracy of LPWs demonstrates obvious spatial and temporal patterns. All LPWs at 00 UTC were underestimated and the root means square error (RMSE) of TPW, PW_low, PW_mid, and PW_high at 00 UTC are 6.04, 1.79, 3.32, and 2.68 mm, while the correlation coefficients (R) are 0.953, 0.958, 0.925, and 0.887, respectively. In contrast, AGRI LPWs at 12 UTC have no obvious underor over-estimation, and shows a lower RMSE (1.49-4.4 mm) and a higher correlation (0.934-0.971). PW_high shows the largest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) (>39%), while the MAPE of the other three LPWs is less than 29%. The RMSE of all four AGRI LPWs generally increase with water vapor, while R and MAPE decrease with water vapor. Thus, the AGRI LPWs over low latitudes with high water vapor content show larger RMSE while lower MAPE and R than mid and high latitudes. The accuracy of AGRI LPWs displays a seasonal pattern, with higher RMSE, lower R and MAPE in summer wet months, while lower RMSE, higher R and MAPE in winter dry months.

TI  - Derivation of PM<sub>10</sub> mass concentration from advanced satellite retrieval products based on a semi-empirical physical approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - PM10 remote sensing is of great significance in the atmospheric environment studies. Contrary to intuitive perception, deriving PM10 is more difficult than PM2.5 from satellite measurements. This is because although the major satellite parameter Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) contain contribution of all suspended particles, it is much more sensitive to fine particles than coarse particles. To address this challenge, a physically based remote sensing method for PM10 is developed using two new semi-empirical physical models: the model of columnar volume-to extinction ratio (VE10) and the model of particle effective density. VE10 is a key parameter bridging the nonlinear relationship between aerosol extinction and volume concentration. A semi-empirical VE10 model is developed based on the fine mode fraction (FMF), and the mean relative error of VE10 modeling is 14.5%. Similarly, the particle effective density depends on the ratio of mass to volume. The particle effective density is effectively characterized by refractive index of matter, with the theoretical error of 13.8%. Both semi-empirical physical models are applied to the derivation of PM10, by using aerosol retrieval products of POLarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances (POLDER) produced by the Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) algorithm. As a validation, PM10 mass concentration is estimated over China from Jan. to Oct. in 2013. A fairly good correlation and consistency are achieved by inter-comparison with in-situ PM10 measurements.

TI  - Towards advancing the earthquake forecasting by machine learning of satellite data
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquakes have become one of the leading causes of death from natural hazards in the last fifty years. Continuous efforts have been made to understand the physical characteristics of earthquakes and the interaction between the physical hazards and the environments so that appropriate warnings may be generated before earthquakes strike. However, earthquake forecasting is not trivial at all. Reliable forecastings should include the analysis and the signals indicating the coming of a significant quake. Unfortunately, these signals are rarely evident before earthquakes occur, and therefore it is challenging to detect such precursors in seismic analysis. Among the available technologies for earthquake research, remote sensing has been commonly used due to its unique features such as fast imaging and wide image-acquisition range. Nevertheless, early studies on preearthquake and remote-sensing anomalies are mostly oriented towards anomaly identification and analysis of a single physical parameter. Many analyses are based on singular events, which provide a lack of understanding of this complex natural phenomenon because usually, the earthquake signals are hidden in the environmental noise. The universality of such analysis still is not being demonstrated on a worldwide scale. In this paper, we investigate physical and dynamic changes of seismic data and thereby develop a novel machine learning method, namely Inverse Boosting Pruning Trees (IBPT), to issue short-term forecast based on the satellite data of 1371 earthquakes of magnitude six or above due to their impact on the environment. We have analyzed and compared our proposed framework against several states of the art machine learning methods using ten different infrared and hyperspectral measurements collected between 2006 and 2013. Our proposed method outperforms all the six selected baselines and shows a strong capability in improving the likelihood of earthquake forecasting across different earthquake databases.

TI  - Retrospective analysis of sentinel lymph node biopsy using methylene blue dye for early breast cancer
T2  - CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Methylene blue is the most commonly used tracer for sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy (SLNB) in China. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of clinical application of SLNB using methylene blue dye (MBD) for early breast cancer and the prognosis of patients with different SLN and non-SLN statuses. Methods We retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological data of patients with early breast cancer treated at the Peking University First Hospital between 2013 and 2018. We calculated the SLN identification rate (IR) in SLNB with MBD and the false-negative rate (FNR), and analyzed the prognosis of patients with different SLN and non-SLN statuses using Kaplan-Meier curves. Results Between January 2013 and December 2018, 1603 patients with early breast cancer underwent SLNB with MBD. The SLN IR was 95.8% (1536/1603). Two SLNs (median) were detected per patient. There were significant differences in FNR between patients with SLN micrometastasis and macrometastasis (19.0% vs. 4.5%, chi(2) = 12.771, P < 0.001). Chi-square test showed that there were significant differences in SLN successful detection rates among patients with different vascular tumor embolism status (96.3% vs. 90.8%, chi(2) = 9.013, P = 0.003) and tumor (T) stages (96.6% vs. 94.1%, chi(2) = 5.189, P = 0.023). Multivariate analysis showed that vascular tumor embolism was the only independent factor for SLN successful detection (odds ratio: 0.440, 95% confidence interval: 0.224-0.862, P = 0.017). Survival analysis showed a significant difference in disease-free survival (DFS) between patients with non-SLN metastasis and patients without non-SLN metastasis (P = 0.006). Conclusion Our single-center data show that, as a commonly used tracer in SLNB in China, MBD has an acceptable SLN IR and a low FNR in frozen sections. This finding is consistent with reports of dual tracer-guided SLNB. Positive SLNs with non-SLN metastasis are associated with DFS.

TI  - Sentinel lymph node biopsy in head and neck cutaneous melanomas A PRISMA-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Head and neck melanomas (HNMs) behave differently from cutaneous melanomas in other sites, and the efficacy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) for patients with HNMs remains controversial. Methods: Studies on prognosis following SLNB were included. The prognostic role of SLNB and other potential predictors were analyzed using pooled relative risk (RR) or hazard ratio (HR). Results: Pooled statistics showed that SLNB improved overall survival of HNMs patients (HR = 0.845; 95% CI: 0.725-0.986; P = .032). The positive status of SN was proved as a risk factor of poor prognosis in HNMs (HR = 3.416; 95% CI: 1.939-6.021; P < .001). SLNB did not have significant correlation with lower recurrences (RR = .794; 95% CI: 0.607-1.038; P = .091). Conclusions: SLNB is associated with better overall survival and the SN status is a promising risk factor of poor prognosis for HNMs patients.

TI  - Malignant adenomyoepithelioma of the breast: A case report
T2  - MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Rationale: Adenomyoepithelioma (AME) is a rare biphasic tumor consisting of epithelial and Myoepithelial cell. Most of the AME is benign, and only a few will progress to malignancy, Here, we report a case of low-grade malignant adenomyoepithelioma, and review the related literature, in a bid to investigate its clinical and pathological features and thus, enhance our understanding of this tumor.Patient concerns: A 64-year-old woman visited our hospital with a 1-year history of a painless mass in her left breast. Physical examination revealed a palpable painless mass, measuring approximately 4.5cm, in the left breast.Diagnosis: Histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of malignant adenomyoepitheliomaInterventions:The patient underwent local excision of the mass, with frozen section analysis revealing ductal carcinoma in situ. Mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy were then performed.Outcomes: We conducted a one-year follow-up, and relapse was not observed.Lessons:Treatment of AME remains controversial owing to the lack of high volume data and absence of prospective studies. Simple mastectomy is an acceptable treatment of this tumor.

TI  - Spatiotemporal dynamics and exposure analysis of daily PM2.5 using a remote sensing-based machine learning model and multi-time meteorological parameters
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Identifying spatiotemporal characteristics of daily fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations is essential for assessing air quality and understanding the environmental consequences of urbanization. More importantly, exposure analysis can provide basic information for appropriate decision making. This paper demonstrates an integrated method incorporating satellite-based aerosol optical depth, machine learning models and multi-time meteorological parameters to analyze spatiotemporal dynamics and exposure levels of daily PM2.5 in the economically developed Yangtze River Delta (YRD) from 2016 to 2018. Ten-fold cross validation (CV) was implemented to evaluate the model performance. Compared to the models with daily means of meteorological fields, the models with multi-time meteorological parameters had higher CV coefficient of determination (R-2) and lower CV root mean square error (RMSE) values. The model with the best performance achieved sample-(site-) based CV R-2 values of 0.88 (0.88) and RMSE values of 10.33 (10.35) mu g/m(3). The YRD region was seriously polluted (exceeding the World Health Organization Interim Targets-1 standard of 35 mu g/m(3)) during our study period, especially in Jiangsu Province, but with an improving trend. The residents in Zhejiang Province suffered the least from exposure, with 39 days (4% of the total days) characterized as over polluted (daily average > 75 mu g/m(3)) in our study period. Air pollution in Shanghai Municipality mitigated the most from 2016 to 2018. With the advantages of high-accuracy and high-resolution (daily and 0.01 degrees x 0.01 degrees resolutions), the proposed method can guide for environmental policy planning.

TI  - A receptor-binding radiopharmaceutical for imaging of traumatic brain injury in a rodent model: [<SUP>99m</SUP>Tc]Tc-tilmanocept
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption and subsequent neuro-inflammation occur following traumatic brain injury (TBI), resulting in a spectrum of human nervous system disorders. [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept is a receptor-binding radiopharmaceutical FDA-approved for sentinel lymph node mapping. We hypothesize that after an intravenous (i.v.) injection, [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept, will traverse a disrupted BBB and bind to CD206-bea ring microglial cells.Methods: Age-matched mice were divided into three groups: 5-days post TBI (n = 4), and 5-days post sham (n = 4), and naive controls (n = 4). IRDye800CW-labeled [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept (0.15 nmol per gram body weight) and FITC-labeled bovine scrum albumin (FITC-B5A) were injected (i.v.) into each mouse. Mice were imaged with a high-resolution gamma camera for 45 min. Immediately after imaging, the brains were perfused with fixative, excised, imaged with a fluorescence scanner, assayed for radioactivity, and prepared for histology.Results: In vivo nuclear imaging, ex vivo fluorescence imaging, ex vivo gamma well counting, and histomicroscopy demonstrated enhanced tilmanocept uptake in the TBI region. The normalized [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept uptake value from nuclear imaging and the maximum pixel intensity from fluorescence imaging of the TBI group ( 1.12 +/- 0.12 and 2288 +/- 278 a.u., respectively) were significantly (P < 0.04) higher than the sham group (0.64 0.28 and 1708 +/- 101 am., respectively) and the naive group (0.76 +/- 024 and 1643 +/- 391 a.u., respectively). The mean [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept scaled uptake in the TBI brains (0.058 +/- 0.013%/g) was significantly (P < 0.010) higher than the scaled brain uptake of the sham group (0.031 +/- 0.011%/g) and higher (P 0.04) than the uptake of the naive group (0.020 +/- 0.002%/g). Fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased uptake of the IRDye800CW-tilmanocept and ITTC-BSA in the TBI brain regions.Conclusion: [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept traverses disrupted blood-brain barrier and localizes within the injured region.Advances in knowledge and implications for patient care: [Tc-99m]Tc-tilmanocept could serve as an imaging biomarker for TBI-associated neuroinflammation and any disease process that involves a disruption of the blood-brain barrier.

TI  - Real-world data on neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) has been shown to be effective in ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer in clinical trials. However, adoption in clinical practice is still limited. Real-world data may provide useful insights into effectiveness, toxicities and quality of care, potentially rendering clinical trial results to the real-world setting. Our purpose was to report real-world data of a cohort of postmenopausal patients submitted to NET. Methods This prospective cohort study evaluated 146 postmenopausal female patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer treated with NET at three tertiary hospitals between 2016 and 2018. Clinicopathological information were collected prospectively. Preoperative Endocrine Prognostic Index (PEPI) score was calculated for tumors submitted to at least 16 weeks of NET. Results Median age was 67 years old, and 87.8% had stage I-II disease. Most tumors had histological grade II (76.1%). Median pretreatment Ki67 expression was 10%. Aromatase inhibitor was used in 99.5% of patients, and median treatment duration was 21.0 weeks. No tumor progressed during NET. Breast-conserving surgery was performed in the majority of patients (63.0%), as well as sentinel lymph-node biopsy (76.7%). Pathological complete response rate was 1.0%. 43 patients (29.5%) had PEPI score 0, and 26% had PEPI scores 4-5. Posttreatment Ki67 median expression was 3.0%, and only five tumors (3.4%) showed marked increase in Ki67 expression during treatment. Seven patients (4.8%) had HER2-positive residual disease, and were treated with adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab. Conclusions Our real-world data shows that NET is effective and safe in postmenopausal patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer. Postmenopausal status and low-risk luminal tumor features (luminal A-like) should be used as selection criteria to ensure the best results with NET.

TI  - Season, not lockdown, improved air quality during COVID-19 State of Emergency in Nigeria
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Globally, ambient air pollution claims similar to 9 million lives yearly, prompting researchers to investigate changes in air quality. Of special interest is the impact of COVID-19 lockdown. Many studies reported substantial improvements in air quality during lockdowns compared with pre-lockdown or as compared with baseline values. Since the lockdown period coincided with the onset of the rainy season in some tropical countries such as Nigeria, it is unclear if such improvements can be fully attributed to the lockdown. We investigate whether significant changes in air quality in Nigeria occurred primarily due to statewide COVID-19 lockdown. We applied a neural network approach to derive monthly average ground-level fine aerosol optical depth (AOD(f)) across Nigeria from year 2001-2020. using the Multi-angle Implementation of Atmospheric Correction (MAIAC) AODs from Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellites, AERONET aerosol optical properties, meteorological and spatial parameters. During the year 2020, we found a 21% or 26% decline in average AOD(f) level across Nigeria during lockdown (April) as compared to pre-lockdown (March), or during the easing phase-1 (May) as compared to lockdown, respectively. Throughout the 20-year period, AOD(f) levels were highest in January and lowest in May or June, but not April. Comparison of AOD(f) levels between 2020 and 2019 shows a small decline (1%) in pollution level in April of 2020 compare to 2019. Using a linear time-lag model to compare changes in ACID (levels for similar months from 2002 to 2020, we found no significant difference (Levene's test and ANCOVA; alpha = 0.05) in the pollution levels by year, which indicates that the lockdown did not significantly improve air quality in Nigeria. Impact analysis using multiple linear regression revealed that favorable meteorological conditions due to seasonal change in temperature, relative humidity, planetary boundary layer height. wind speed and rainfall improved air quality during the lockdown.

TI  - Risk of Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer in Association With Use of Hydrochlorothiazide-Containing Products in the United States
T2  - JNCI CANCER SPECTRUM
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: European studies reported an increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer associated with hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)-containing products. We examined the risks of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) associated with HCTZ compared with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) in a US population. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the US Food and Drug Administration's Sentinel System. From the date of HCTZ or ACEI dispensing, patients were followed until a SCC or BCC diagnosis requiring excision or topical chemotherapy treatment on or within 30 days after the diagnosis date or a censoring event. Using Cox proportional hazards regression models, we estimated the hazard ratios (HRs), overall and separately by age, sex, and race. We also examined site- and age-adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRRs) by cumulative HCTZ dose within the matched cohort. Results: Among 5.2 million propensity-score matched HCTZ and ACEI users, the incidence rate (per 1000 person-years) of BCC was 2.78 and 2.82, respectively, and 1.66 and 1.60 for SCC. Overall, there was no difference in risk between HCTZ and ACEIs for BCC (HR = 0.99, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.97 to 1.00), but there was an increased risk for SCC (HR = 1.04, 95% CI = 1.02 to 1.06). HCTZ use was associated with higher risks of BCC (HR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.07 to 1.11) and SCC (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.17) among Caucasians. Cumulative HCTZ dose of 50 000 mg or more was associated with an increased risk of SCC in the overall population (IRR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.35) and among Caucasians (IRR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.47). Conclusions: Among Caucasians, we identified small increased risks of BCC and SCC with HCTZ compared with ACEI. Appropriate risk mitigation strategies should be taken while using HCTZ.

TI  - Evaluation of atmospheric aerosols in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo simulated by the regional EURAD-IM model on high-resolution
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a high-resolution air quality study over Sao Paulo, Brazil with the EURopean Air Pollution Dispersion - Inverse Model (EURAD-IM) used for the first time over South America simulating detailed features of aerosols. Modeled data are evaluated with observational surface data and a Lidar. Two case studies in 2016 with distinct meteorological conditions and pollution plume features show transport (i) from central South America, associated to biomass burning activities, (ii) from the rural part of the state of Sao Paulo, (iii) between the metropolitan areas of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo (MASP) either through the Paraiba Valley or via the ocean, connecting Brazil's two largest cities, (iv) from the port-city Santos to MASP and also from MASP to the city Campinas, and vice versa. A Pearson coefficient of 0.7 was found for PM10 at MASP CENTER and EURAD-IM simulations vary within the observational standard deviation, with a Mean Percentual Error (MPE) of 10%. The model's vertical distributions of aerosol layers agree with the Lidar profiles that show either characteristics of long-range transported biomass burning plumes, or of local pollution. The distinct transport patterns that agree with satellite Aerosol Optical Death and fire spot images as well as with the ground-based observations within the standard deviations, allows us exploring patterns of air pollution in a detailed manner and to understand the complex interactions between local to long-range transport sources.

TI  - Coupling threshold theory and satellite-derived channel width to estimate the formative discharge of Himalayan foreland rivers
T2  - EARTH SURFACE DYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - We propose an innovative methodology to estimate the formative discharge of alluvial rivers from remote sensing images. This procedure involves automatic extraction of the width of a channel from Landsat Thematic Mapper, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-1 satellite images We translate the channel width extracted from satellite images to discharge using a width-discharge regime curve established previously by us for the Himalayan rivers. This regime curve is based on the threshold theory, a simple physical force balance that explains the first-order geometry of alluvial channels. Using this procedure, we estimate the formative discharge of six major rivers of the Himalayan foreland: the Brahmaputra, Chenab, Ganga, Indus, Kosi, and Teesta rivers. Except highly regulated rivers (Indus and Chenab), our estimates of the discharge from satellite images can be compared with the mean annual discharge obtained from historical records of gauging stations. We have shown that this procedure applies both to braided and single-thread rivers over a large territory. Furthermore, our methodology to estimate discharge from remote sensing images does not rely on continuous ground calibration.

TI  - Assessing spatio-temporal patterns and driving force of ecosystem service value in the main urban area of Guangzhou
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Increasing human activity around the world has greatly changed the natural ecosystem and the services it provides. In the past few decades, a series of significant changes have taken place in land use/land cover (LULC) in China due to the rapid growth in population, particularly in the cities of the Zhujiang Deita. However, there have been few attempts to study the co-evolution of land use/land cover change and ecosystem service value (ESV) in the main urban area of Guangzhou. Therefore, based on Landsat TM/OLI images from 1987, 1993, 1999, 2005, 2011 and 2017, the weight vector AdaBoost (WV AdaBoost) multi-classification algorithm was utilized to extract LULC data sets, and the spatiotemporal patterns of LULC over these periods were studied. The ESV was estimated and the driving force was analysed. The effect of LULC dynamics on the ESV was evaluated. The results showed that great changes have taken place in LULC in the main urban area of Guangzhou from 1987 to 2017, of which the most significant was the large-scale expansion of the built-up area that occurred through degradation of the forest and cultivated land. The proportion of forest and cultivated land decreased from 43.12% and 34.23% to 25.88% and 12.59%, respectively. The results between periods revealed a decrease in total ESVs from 5.63x10(9) yuan in 1987 to 5.27, 4.16, 4.62, 3.76 and 4.47x10(9) yuan in 1993, 1999, 2005, 2011 and 2017, respectively. In total, ESVs decreased by 1.16 billion yuan (20.61%) from 1987 to 2017. Water supply, food production, nutrient cycling and gas regulation were the four principal ecosystem service functions that affected the total ESVs. Forest, water body and cultivated land areas played a key role in ecosystem services. Therefore, we advocate that when protecting natural ecosystems in the future land use management in Guangzhou should be prioritized.

TI  - The effect on subsequent fracture risk of age, sex, and prior fracture site by recency of prior fracture
T2  - OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The risk of a recurrent fragility fracture varies by age and sex, as by site and recency of sentinel fracture. Introduction The recency of prior fractures affects subsequent fracture risk. Variable recency may obscure other factors that affect subsequent fracture risk. The aim of this study was to quantify the effect of a sentinel fracture by site, age, and sex where the recency was held constant. Methods The study used data from the Reykjavik Study fracture register that documented prospectively all fractures at all skeletal sites in a large sample of the population of Iceland. Fracture incidence was compared to that of the general population determined at fixed times after a sentinel fracture (humeral, clinical vertebral, forearm, hip, and minor fractures). Outcome fractures comprised a major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture. Results Sentinel osteoporotic fractures were identified in 9504 men and women. Of these, 3616 individuals sustained a major osteoporotic fracture as the first subsequent fracture, of whom 1799 sustained a hip fracture. Hazard ratios for prior fracture were consistently higher in men than in women and decreased progressively with age. Hazard ratios varied according to the site of sentinel fracture with higher ratios for hip and vertebral fracture than for humerus, forearm, or minor osteoporotic fracture. Conclusion The risk of a recurrent fragility fracture varies by age, sex, and site of sentinel fracture when recency is held constant.

TI  - Phenology estimation of subtropical bamboo forests based on assimilated MODIS LAI time series data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Phenology plays an important role in revealing the spatiotemporal evolution of forest ecosystem carbon cycles. The accuracy of vegetation phenology estimates based on remote sensing has improved in temperate zones. However, subtropical vegetation is complex, and the corresponding phenology estimates using remote sensing face great challenges. Bamboo forests are subtropical unique forest types and exhibit on- and off-years, fast growth, high productivity and carbon sequestration capability. In this study, we propose a new method to improve phenology estimates of bamboo forests by coupling the particle filter (PF) assimilation algorithm and a logistic model. The phenological metrics are estimated using high-precision leaf area index (LAI) assimilation products and a logistic model from 2001 to 2018, and the results are compared to those extracted from Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) calculated based on the MODIS reflectance data. The results reveal that the R-2 values between the start of the growing season (SOS) and end of the growing season (EOS) estimated by the assimilated LAI and ground-observed values are the highest (>0.50) and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are the smallest (<6.35 days). A negative correlation occurs between the EVI-simulated and ground-observed SOS and EOS values, which indicates that EVI products cannot be adopted to estimate the phenology of bamboo forests. Compared to the MODIS LAI, the R2 values of the predicted SOS and EOS by the assimilated LAI data are improved by 3.67 times and 12.50%, respectively, and the RMSEs are reduced by 58.91% and 41.13%, respectively. Therefore, the new method solves the problem whereby the phenology of subtropical bamboo forests cannot be accurately extracted from MODIS LAI and EVI products. The temporal and spatial patterns of the SOS and EOS of bamboo forests are estimated with the new method from 2001 to 2018, and the SOS exhibits obvious spatial heterogeneity during on- and off-years, and the SOS during the on-years occurs slightly earlier than that during the off-years. A total of 70.13% of all pixels exhibit a SOS advance trend, while more than half of the areas (58.42%) present an EOS delay trend. The results indicate that coupling the data assimilation algorithm and phenology method greatly improves the estimation precision and reduces the estimation errors of the SOS and EOS of bamboo forests.

TI  - On the physical constraints for the exceeding probability of deep water rogue waves
T2  - APPLIED OCEAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly four decades have elapsed since the first efforts to obtain a realistic narrow-banded model for extreme wave crests and heights were made, resulting in a couple dozen different exceeding probability distributions. These models reflect results of numerical simulations and storm records measured off of oil platforms, buoys and more recently satellite data. Nevertheless, no consensus has been achieved in either deterministic or operational approaches. Moreover, a minor issue with the established distributions is that they are not bounded by more than one physical limit while others are not bounded at all. Though the literature is rich in physical bounds for single waves, here we describe physical limits for the ensemble of waves that have not yet been addressed. As previous studies have shown, the exceeding probability distribution does not depend unequivocally on one sea state parameter, thus, this work supplies a combination of sea state parameters that provide guidance on the sea state influence on rogue wave occurrence. Based on specific bounds, we conjecture the dependence of the expected maximum of normalized wave heights (also known as abnormality index) and crests on the aforementioned sea state parameters instead of the total number of waves in the wave record. Finally, we introduce a new dimensionless parameter that is capable of explaining the uneven distribution of rogue waves in the different storms pointed out by Stansell [74].

TI  - Progress towards the 2020 fast track HIV/AIDS reduction targets across ages in Ethiopia as compared to neighboring countries using global burden of diseases 2017 data
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundSustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.3, targets to eliminate HIV from being a public health threat by 2030. For better tracking of this target interim Fast Track milestones for 2020 and composite complementary measures have been indicated. This study measured the Fast Track progress in the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia across ages compared to neighboring countries.MethodsThe National Data Management Center for health's research team at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute has analyzed the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2017 secondary data for the year 2010 to 2017 for Ethiopia and its neighbors. GBD 2017 data sources were census, demographic and a health survey, prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, antiretroviral treatment programs, sentinel surveillance, and UNAIDS reports. Age-standardized and age-specific HIV/AIDS incidence, prevalence, mortality, Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), incidence:mortality ratio and incidence:prevalence ratio were calculated with corresponding 95% confidence intervals.ResultsEthiopia and neighboring countries recorded slow progress in reducing new HIV infection since 2010. Only Uganda would achieve the 75% target by 2020. Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uganda already achieved the 75% mortality reduction target set for 2020. The incidence: prevalence ratio for Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Uganda were<0.03, indicating the countries were on track to end HIV by 2030. Ethiopia had an incidence: mortality ratio<1 due to high mortality; while Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda had a ratio of >1 due to high incidence. The HIV incidence rate in Ethiopia was dropped by 76% among under 5 children in 2017 compared to 2010 and the country would likely to attain the 2020 national target, but far behind achieving the target among the 15-49 age group.ConclusionsEthiopia and neighboring countries have made remarkable progress towards achieving the 75% HIV/AIDS mortality reduction target by 2020, although they progressed poorly in reducing HIV incidence. By recording an incidence:prevalence ratio benchmark of less than 0.03, Ethiopia, Rwanda, and Uganda are well heading towards epidemic control. Nonetheless, the high HIV/AIDS mortality rate in Ethiopia for its incidence requires innovative strategies to reach out undiagnosed cases and to build institutional capacity for generating strong evidence to ensure sustainable epidemic control.

TI  - Evolution of Native and Alien Macrophytes in a Fluvial-wetland System Using Long-term Satellite Data
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - An overgrowth of invasive floating macrophytes can occur in shallow eutrophic lakes as a result of significant anthropogenic pressures. This necessitates appropriate monitoring, followed by informed management, control and mitigation actions. In this study, we explored the long-term dynamics of macrophyte stands in a fluvial-wetland system and the influence of mechanical removal alongside environmental drivers. The Landsat imagery archive was used to analyze the areal coverage and canopy density of both autochthonous and allochthonous macrophytes in the Mantua lakes system (Northern Italy). Satellite derived data showed a substantial increase in the extent of the alien Nelumbo nucifera, and Ludwigia hexapetala, and the native Trapa natans over a timescale of decades, possibly caused by the temporary absence of macrophyte removal and altered hydrology. According to spectral proxies, N. nucifera recorded consistently the highest density in the system. T. natans density was found to respond to the maximum summer temperature and Eastern Atlantic climatic index, reflecting the role of regional climatic controls. This approach may be transferred to inland waters from regional to global scale exploiting satellite archives to obtain a time series on changing species dynamics essential for the conservation and management of aquatic habitats.

TI  - Effects of COVID-19 pandemic control measures on air pollution in Lima metropolitan area, Peru in South America
T2  - AIR QUALITY ATMOSPHERE AND HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The sanitary measures implemented to control and prevent an increase in infections due to the COVID-19 pandemic have produced an improvement in the air quality of many urban areas around the world. We assessed air quality during the COVID-19 pandemic for particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), NO2 and O-3 in in metropolitan area of Lima, Peru between pre-lockdown period (February 1 and March 15 of 2020), historical period (March 16 to April 30 2017-2019) and lockdown period (March 16 to April 30, 2020). The complete national lockdown that was implemented in Peru produced statistically significant reductions in the in-air pollutant (PM10 (-40% and -58%), PM2.5 (-31% and -43%) and NO2 (-46% and -48%)), as recorded by the by the ground-based air quality monitoring network throughout the metropolitan area, compared with the corresponding concentrations for the previous weeks and over the same period for 2017-2019. Analysis of the spatial Distribution of satellite data also show decreases in the concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and NO2 as a result of the containment measures and suspension of activities implemented by the Peruvian government. The concentrations of O-3 significantly increased (11% and 170%) as a result of the decrease in the concentration of NO2, confirming that the study area is a hydrocarbon-limited system, as previously reported. The results obtained contribute to the assessment by the regulatory agencies of the possible strategies of control and monitoring of air pollution in the study area.

TI  - Coastal water bathymetry for critical zone management using regression tree models from Gaofen-6 imagery
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal water depth information is fundamental to coast management and coastal critical zone development. The traditional bathymetric sounding method depends on radar or surveying vessels, which are expensive and timeconsuming. Thus, it is of high importance to develop a rapidly updating water depth detection method. In order to bridge this gap, we explored the Chinese Gaofen-6 wide field of view (GF-6 WFV) visible-near infrared satellite imagery for large-scale accurate coastal bathymetric mapping and to understand the vertical water column environment with regression tree models. The predictors, including the Blue band/Violet band (BV), Green band/Violet band (GV), Yellow band/Violet band (YV), Green band (G), Yellow band (Y), and red-edge1 band (Re1), were derived via statistical analysis, as well as spectroscopy knowledge and experience. Compared with the conventional bathymetric method, such as single band algorithm (SBA), band ratio algorithm and support vector regression (SVR), the two regression trees used in this study yielded better accuracy. The R2, MAE and RMSE of the classification and regression tree (CART), the Cubist tree model were 0.74, 3.78 m and 5.35 m vs 0.78, 3.56 m and 4.88 m. Besides the improved accuracies, these tree-based models can effectively reveal water depth-associated environment types with the hierarchical relationships present in the visible spectral characteristics, which supports spatial zoning strategies for coastal critical zone management based on the Gaofen-6 imagery.

TI  - Properties of surface water masses in the Laptev and the East Siberian seas in summer 2018 from in situ and satellite data
T2  - OCEAN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Variability of surface water masses of the Laptev and the East Siberian seas in August-September 2018 is studied using in situ and satellite data. In situ data were collected during the ARKTIKA-2018 expedition and then complemented with satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST), salinity (SSS), sea surface height, wind speed, and sea ice concentration. The estimation of SSS fields is challenging in high-latitude regions, and the precision of soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) SSS retrieval is improved by applying a threshold on SSS weekly error. For the first time in this region, the validity of DMI (Danish Meteorological Institute) SST and SMOS SSS products is thoroughly studied using ARKTIKA-2018 expedition continuous thermosalinograph measurements and conductivity- temperature-depth (CTD) casts. They are found to be adequate to describe large surface gradients in this region. Surface gradients and mixing of the river and the sea water in the ice-free and ice-covered areas are described with a special attention to the marginal ice zone at a synoptic scale. We suggest that the freshwater is pushed northward, close to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) and under the sea ice, which is confirmed by the oxygen isotope analysis. The SST-SSS diagram based on satellite estimates shows the possibility of investigating the surface water mass transformation at a synoptic scale and reveals the presence of river water on the shelf of the East Siberian Sea. The Ekman transport is calculated to better understand the pathway of surface water displacement on the shelf and beyond.

TI  - Revisiting the Structural, Electronic, and Magnetic Properties of (LaO)MnAs: Effect of Hubbard Correction and Origin of Mott-Insulating Behavior
T2  - ACS OMEGA
M3  - Article
AB  - We study the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the antiferromagnetic-layered oxyarsenide (LaO)-MnAs system from the first-principle calculation. The increasing Hubbard energy (U) in the Mn 3d orbital induces the increasing local-symmetry distortions (LSDs) in MnAs4 and OLa4 tetrahedra. The LSD in MnAs4 tetrahedra is possibly promoted by the second-order Jahn-Teller effect in the Mn 3d orbital. Furthermore, the increasing U also escalates the bandgap (E-g) and the magnetic moment of Mn (mu(Mn)). The value of U = 1 eV is the most appropriate by considering the structural properties. This value leads to E-g and mu(Mn )of 0.834 eV and 4.31 mu(B), respectively. The calculated if mu(Mn) is lower than the theoretical value for the high-spin state of Mn 3d (5 mu(B)) due to the hybridization between Mn 3d and As 4p states. However, d(xy) states are localized and show the weakest hybridization with valence As 4p states. The Mott-insulating behavior in the system is characterized by the E-g transition between the valence and conduction d(zx)/d(zy) states. This work shows new physical insights for advanced functional device applications, such as spintronics.

TI  - Spatial variation and influencing factors of the effectiveness of afforestation in China's Loess Plateau
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Payment for ecosystem services (PES) has become a widely accepted strategy for combining environmental conservation or restoration with socioeconomic development. Understanding the spatial heterogeneity of the effects of PES programs and their influencing factors is necessary for the design and implementation of effective programs. However, few researchers have both distinguished the effects of PES and analyzed their spatial variation simultaneously. Here, we analyzed the spatial differences in the effectiveness of afforestation under China's Grain-to-Green Program(GTGP), a well-known PES program, in the Loess Plateau. The approach is based on remote sensing data and county-level statistical data, which reflects the basic implementation unit of the GTGP. We identified several local and non-local influencing factors: the aridity index, rural non-farm employment, and rural migration improved afforestation effectiveness, whereas the total afforestation degree (the cumulative area of afforestation divided by the total area), vegetation conditions before afforestation, grain production, and investment in fixed assets decreased its effectiveness. Based on our results, we propose several suggestions for improvement: preferring afforestation in humid counties with low vegetation cover, identifying an optimal degree of afforestation, and promoting the transformation of rural livelihoods. Our study provides a general approach to analyze the effectiveness of PES and its spatial variation, thereby providing insights into future PES programs both within China and around the world.

TI  - Connectivity of temperate shallow lakes to groundwater in the Pampean Plain, Argentina: A remote sensing and multi-tracer approach
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Pampean Plain in Argentina is one of the most extended plain regions of the world with numerous wetland systems and very shallow lakes. Certain anomalies related to geomorphology and shallow lakes' hydrology are particularly present in a sector of the southern Pampean Plain, specifically, in the southwestern limit of the Quequen Grande River Basin. Here, shallow lakes can be defined as upland-embedded wetlands, characterized by the lack of observable hydrological connectivity due to the absence of surface water flows. The aim of this study was to identify groundwater connectivity of Pampean shallow lakes considered as upland-embedded wetlands and classify them according to their water presence frequency over time and their water source origin based on natural tracers (O-18-H2O, H-2-H2O, electrical conductivity and Cl content). In this work, a methodological framework involving a multitemporal analysis of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from Landsat data, in addition to field data is proposed. According to water presence frequency, shallow lakes were classified in four categories: occasionally (89.0 %), regularly (6.7 %), usually (1.9 %) and permanently (2.3 %) with water. Obtained results allowed identifying shallow lakes having low, moderate or high mineralized water due to both different evaporation degree and water sources.

TI  - Modeling historical subsidence due to groundwater withdrawal in the Alto Guadalentin aquifer-system (Spain)
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Alto Guadalentin Basin (Spain) is widely recognized as an area of major anthropogenic land subsidence due to groundwater extraction. This paper presents a numerical methodology to quantify the severe subsidence of this basin over history. First, a 3D groundwater model is proposed to reproduce groundwater evolution in the regional Alto Guadalentin aquifer system since 1960, leading to an average piezometric level drop of 150 m. Secondly, a generalized plasticity state parameter-based model is calibrated to reproduce the mechanical behavior, observed in oedometer laboratory tests, of compressible materials extracted from a 300-m drilled borehole located in the area of maximum subsidence. The strength of this constitutive model is that a single set of material parameters can be used to reproduce the mechanical behavior of material located at different depths, hence having different confining pressures and void ratio states. Afterwards, subsidence is assessed through a partially saturated 1D vertical finite element model, solving Biot equations that reproduce the slow vertical drainage and vertical consolidation processes, taking into account the calibrated constitutive model and prescribing the previously computed groundwater evolution of the aquifer. Finally, the subsidence model is adjusted with different displacement data available from 1992: datasets acquired by ERS, ENVISAT, Cosmo-SkyMed satellites and the global positioning system GNSS. The proposed calibrated subsidence model reproduces the 3.1 m subsidence monitored in the period 1992-2018, and quantifies historical subsidence (since 1960) in the Alto Guadalentin Basin area at around 5.8 m. Moreover, the model predicts subsidence of up to 7.3 m by 2100 for an assumed constant hydraulic head from 2012 onward.

TI  - Assessing the effects of vegetation cover changes on resource utilization and conservation from a systematic analysis aspect
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - How to improve the utilization efficiency of natural resources and control environmental impacts is one of the key steps to achieve the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A multidimensional approach integrating landscape and systematic analysis might be a good way to address this issue. In this study, three main ecosystems and six vegetation cover changes on the Loess Plateau (LP) from 2000 to 2015 were selected to clarify their impacts on resource utilization and conservation in three environmental regions based on landscape-level remote sensing data and an emergy-based thermodynamic system processing model. The evapotranspiration empower was regarded as the system emergy utilization, with the structure and function of the ecosystem being divided into resource utilization efficiency and environmental impacts. Results showed that (1) Forest could reinforce production by improving the water and soil conservation in water erosion region, although it had a lower water utilization efficiency than other ecosystems. (2) Grassland was more suitable than forest in the water-limited wind and wind-water erosion regions, with a higher water utilization efficiency and higher resource conservation. These results suggested that maximum resource acquisition is not always the optimal strategy for the development of ecosystems, especially in a resource-limited environment. The maximum empower principle could be a general principle to drive ecosystem development at a regional scale. Expanding cultivated land in the wind-water erosion region might be a choice for the sustainable increase of grain production in the LP. By incorporating the main characteristics of the major issues concerned in the studied area into the ecosystem processes and landscape integration model, the new multi-dimensional method has a good application potential in guiding land use planning and decision making in ecological fragile areas, like but not limited to the LP.

T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - The dynamic shoreline of Bangladesh was analyzed for the last thirty years in this study, in order to identify the positional changes due to erosion and accretion. Remotely acquired, multi-temporal Landsat images, of 30 m resolution and comparable tidal conditions, were collected for the period 1989-2019 at a five-year interval. Shorelines were then manually digitized, and a transect-based analysis was carried out using the Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) extension in ArcGIS. Rates of shoreline change and net movement along transects were determined for the three different coastal zones of the country. Almost 12,000 transects were cast with 50 m interval, for the whole coast, majority of which showed shoreline retreat. The shoreline variability is found to be the highest in the central zone, with rates of erosion being observed up to similar to 120 m/year and accretion up to similar to 230 m/year. The western zone is found to be retreating steadily over the years, at an average rate of 15-20 m/year, while the eastern zone displayed significant changes only at a few localized sites. A supplementary polygon-based analysis was also carried out in ArcGIS, through which the net area of erosion and accretion was determined for the whole study period. The net area loss is observed to be the highest in central zone (similar to 62 km(2)), whereas opposite scenario is found in the eastern zone which has gained a net area of around 30 km(3).

TI  - Three decades of trace element sediment contamination: The mining of governmental databases and the need to address hidden sources for clean and healthy seas
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Trace elements (TEs) frequently contaminate coastal marine sediments with many included in priority chemical lists or control legislation. These, improved waste treatment and increased recycling have fostered the belief that TE pollution is declining. Nevertheless, there is a paucity of long-term robust datasets to support this confidence. By mining UK datasets (100s of sites, 31 years), we assess sediment concentrations of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), mercury (Hg), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) and zinc (Zn) and use indices (PI [Pollution], TEPI [Trace Element Pollution] and I-geo [Geoaccumulation]) to assess TE pollution evolution. PI and TEPI show reductions of overall TE pollution in the 1980s then incremental improvements followed by a distinct increase (2010-13). Zn, As and Pb I-geo scores show low pollution, whilst Cd and Hg are moderate, but with all remaining temporally stable. I-geo scores are low for Ni, Fe and Cr, but increasing for Ni and Fe. A moderate pollution I-geo score for Cu has also steadily increased since the mid-1990s. Increasing site trends are not universal and, conversely, minimal temporal change masks some site-specific increases and decreases. To capture this variability we strongly advocate embedding sufficient sentinel sites within observation networks. Decreasing sediment pollution levels (e.g. Pb and Hg) have been achieved, but stabilizing I-geo and recently increasing TEPI and PI scores require continued global vigilance. Increasing Ni and Fe I-geo scores necessitate source identification, but this is a priority for Cu. Local, regional and world analyses indicate substantial 'hidden' inputs from anti-fouling paints (Cu, Zn), ship scrubbers (Cu, Zn, Ni) and sacrificial anodes (Zn) that are also predicted to increase markedly. Accurate TE input assessments and targeted legislation are, therefore, urgently required, especially in the context of rapid blue economic growth (e.g. shipping).

T2  - MEDIZINISCHE KLINIK-INTENSIVMEDIZIN UND NOTFALLMEDIZIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Forecasting models for intensive care occupancy of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients are important in the current pandemic for strategic planning of patient allocation and avoidance of regional overcrowding. They are often trained entirely on retrospective infection and occupancy data, which can cause forecast uncertainty to grow exponentially with the forecast horizon. Methodology We propose an alternative modeling approach in which the model is created largely independent of the occupancy data being simulated. The distribution of bed occupancies for patient cohorts is calculated directly from occupancy data from "sentinel clinics". By coupling with infection scenarios, the prediction error is constrained by the error of the infection dynamics scenarios. The model allows systematic simulation of arbitrary infection scenarios, calculation of bed occupancy corridors, and sensitivity analyses with respect to protective measures. Results The model was based on hospital data and by adjusting only two parameters of data in the Aachen city region and Germany as a whole. Using the example of the simulation of the respective bed occupancy rates for Germany as a whole, the loading model for the calculation of occupancy corridors is demonstrated. The occupancy corridors form barriers for bed occupancy in the event that infection rates do not exceed specific thresholds. In addition, lockdown scenarios are simulated based on retrospective events. Discussion Our model demonstrates that a significant reduction in forecast uncertainty in occupancy forecasts is possible by selectively combining data from different sources. It allows arbitrary combination with infection dynamics models and scenarios, and thus can be used both for load forecasting and for sensitivity analyses for expected novel spreading and lockdown scenarios.

TI  - Pelvic Fragility Fractures An Opportunity to Improve the Undertreatment of Osteoporosis
T2  - JOURNAL OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-AMERICAN VOLUME
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Osteoporosis is often undiagnosed until patients experience fragility fractures. Pelvic fractures are common but underappreciated sentinel fractures. Screening patients with a pelvic fracture for osteoporosis may provide an opportunity to initiate appropriate treatments such as anti-osteoporosis therapy to prevent additional fractures. Methods: This retrospective cohort review examined the management of osteoporosis after pelvic fractures at a large tertiary care center without an established secondary fracture prevention program. Data were extracted from electronic medical records of all new patients with a pelvic fracture who were >= 50 years of age from this center and its affiliated community hospitals from 2008 to 2014. Outcome measures included the initiation of anti-osteoporosis therapy before the fracture, within the year following the fracture, >1 year following the fracture, or never and new osteoporotic fractures within 2 years after a pelvic fracture. Results: From 2008 to 2014, 947 patients presented with pelvic fractures. Of these patients, 27.1% (257 patients) were taking anti-osteoporosis medications before the fracture. Four percent of treatment-naive patients began anti-osteoporosis therapy within 1 year of fracture, with 1.2% (11 patients) starting after 1 year. Of the treatment-naive patients, 92.3% (637 patients) were never prescribed anti-osteoporosis therapy. Treatment rates were consistent over time. Within 2 years, 41.0% (388 patients) developed fragility fractures at secondary sites: 12.0% (114 patients) experienced a hip fracture, and 16.4% (155 patients) experienced a vertebral fracture. Conclusions: Osteoporosis screening and initiation of secondary fracture prevention after a pelvic fracture were inadequate in the study population. Of the patients in this study, 909 (96.0%) never underwent a dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan during the study period. Of the 690 treatment-naive patients, 637 (92.3%) were never administered anti-osteoporosis medications. Within 2 years, 41.0% of all patients developed additional osteoporotic fractures. This study demonstrates an opportunity to improve bone health by screening for and treating osteoporosis in patients with a pelvic fragility fracture.

TI  - MLAs land cover mapping performance across varying geomorphology with Landsat OLI-8 and minimum human intervention
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The machine learning algorithms (MLAs) are capable of automatic land cover classification with a huge volume of data and are prevalent in land mapping applications. Minimal human intervention is desired when producing land cover products over a large area and the choice of an algorithm may determine the precision of the map. The study aims to compare the performance of random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) algorithms in the context of mapping three typical landscapes (plain, foothill, and mountain) in Hunan Province, China, with minimal human interventions. Performance comparisons among the four machine learning algorithms are based on ROC curves, AUC value, confusion matrix, overall accuracy, spatial comparisons and inconsistency along with altitude and slope. RF produced the most accurate maps (93.0% in mountain area, 93.1% in plain region, and 95.2% in foothill) across various geomorphology with minimal human interventions, and was most resistant to landscape pattern complexity. The accuracy of DT was similar to RF including similar ROC curves and slightly lower accuracy. SVM and ANN showed relatively poor performance without significant human intervention. RF produced robust and highly accurate land cover maps over large areas and various complex geomorphology with little human intervention.

TI  - Spaceborne C-band SAR remote sensing-based flood mapping and runoff estimation for 2019 flood scenario in Rupnagar, Punjab, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Floods are one of the most disastrous and dangerous catastrophes faced by humanity for ages. Though mostly deemed a natural phenomenon, floods can be anthropogenic and can be equally devastating in modern times. Remote sensing with its non-evasive data availability and high temporal resolution stands unparalleled for flood mapping and modelling. Since floods in India occur mainly in monsoon months, optical remote sensing has limited applications in proper flood mapping owing to lesser number of cloud-free days. Remotely sensed microwave/synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data has penetration ability and has high temporal data availability, making it both weather independent and highly versatile for the study of floods. This study uses space-borne SAR data in C-band with VV (vertically emitted and vertically received) and VH (vertically emitted and horizontally received) polarization channels from Sentinel-1A satellite for SAR interferometry-based flood mapping and runoff modeling for Rupnagar (Punjab) floods of 2019. The flood maps were prepared using coherence-based thresholding, and digital elevation map (DEM) was prepared by correlating the unwrapped phase to elevation. The DEM was further used for Soil Conservation Service-curve number (SCS-CN)-based runoff modelling. The maximum runoff on 18 August 2019 was 350 mm while the average daily rainfall was 120 mm. The estimated runoff significantly correlated with the rainfall with an R-2 statistics value of 0.93 for 18 August 2019. On 18 August 2019, Rupnagar saw the most devastating floods and waterlogging that submerged acres of land and displaced thousands of people.

TI  - Variations in Persistent Use of Low-Value Breast Cancer Surgery
T2  - JAMA SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - IMPORTANCE Through the Choosing Wisely campaign, surgical specialties identified 4 low-value breast cancer operations. Preliminary data suggest varying rates of deimplementation and have identified patient-level and clinician-level determinants of continued overuse. However, little information exists about facility-level variation or determinants of differential deimplementation.OBJECTIVE To identify variation and determinants of persistent use of low-value breast cancer surgical care.DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study in which reliability-adjusted facility rates of each procedure were calculated using random-intercept hierarchical logistic regression before and after evidence demonstrated that each procedure was unnecessary. The National Cancer Database is a prospective cancer registry of patients encompassing approximately 70% of all new cancer diagnoses from more than 1500 facilities in the United States. Data were analyzed from November 2019 to August 2020. The registry included women 18 years and older diagnosed as having breast cancer between 2004 and 2016 and meeting inclusion criteria for each Choosing Wisely recommendation.MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Rate of each low-value breast cancer procedure based on facility type and breast cancer volume categories before and after the release of data supporting each procedure's omission. RESULTS The total cohort included 920 256 women with a median age of 63 years. Overall, 86% self-identified as White, 10% as Black, 3% as Asian, and 4.5% as Hispanic. Most women in this cohort were insured (51% private and 47% public), were living in ametropolitan or urban area (88% and 11%, respectively), and originated from the top half of income-earning households (65.5%). While there was significant deimplementation of axillary lymph node dissection and lumpectomy reoperation in response to guidelines supporting omission of these procedures, rates of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy in older women increased during the study period. Academic research programs and high-volume facilities overall demonstrated the greatest reduction in use of these low-value procedures. There was significant interfacility variation for each low-value procedure. Facility-level axillary lymph node dissection rates ranged from 7% to 47%, lumpectomy reoperation rates ranged from 3% to 62%, contralateral prophylactic mastectomy rates ranged from 9% to 67%, and sentinel lymph node biopsy rates ranged from 25% to 97%. Pearson correlation coefficient for each combination of 2 of the 4 procedures was less than 0.11, suggesting that hospitals were not consistent in their deimplementation performance across all 4 procedures. Many were high outliers in one procedure but low outliers in another.CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Interfacility variation demonstrates a performance gap and an opportunity for formal deimplementation efforts targeting each procedure. Several facility-level characteristics were associated with differential deimplementation and performance.

TI  - Antibiofilm Activity of Small-Molecule ZY-214-4 Against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is the most important pathogenic bacteria in humans. As the resistance of S. aureus to existing antibiotics is increasing, there is an urgent need for new anti-infective drugs. S. aureus biofilms cause persistent infections and resist complete eradication with antibiotic therapy. The present study investigated the inhibitory effect of the novel small-molecule ZY-214-4 (C19H11BrNO4) on S. aureus biofilm formation. At a subinhibitory concentration (4 mu g/ml), ZY-214-4 had no effect on the growth of S. aureus strains and also showed no cytotoxicity in human normal bronchial epithelial cells (Bease-2B). The results of a semi-quantitative biofilm test showed that ZY-214-4 prevented S. aureus biofilm formation, which was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy. ZY-214-4 significantly suppressed the production of polysaccharide intercellular adhesion and prevented cell aggregation, and also inhibited the mRNA expression of icaA and other biofilm-related genes (eno, clfA/B, fnbB, fib, ebpS, psm alpha, and psm beta) in clinical S. aureus isolates. Thus, at a subinhibitory concentration, ZY-214-4 inhibits biofilm formation by preventing cell aggregation, highlighting its clinical potential for preventing or treating S. aureus infections.

TI  - Satellite-based ground PM<sub>2.5</sub> estimation using a gradient boosting decision tree
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) is one of the major air pollutants risks to human health worldwide. Satellite-based aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are an effective metric for acquiring PM2.5 information, featuring broad coverage and high resolution, which compensate for the sparse and uneven distribution of existing monitoring stations. In this study, a gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model for estimating ground PM2.5 concentration directly from AOD products across China in 2017, integrating human activities and various natural variables was proposed. The GBDT model performed well in estimating temporal variability and spatial contrasts in daily PM2.5 concentrations, with relatively high fitted model (10-fold cross-validation) coefficients of determination of 0.98 (0.81), low root mean square errors of 3.82 (11.57) mu g/m(3), and mean absolute error of 1.44 (7.45) mu g/m(3). Seasonal examinations revealed that summer had the cleanest air with the highest estimation accuracies, whereas winter had the most polluted air with the lowest estimation accuracies. The model successfully captured the PM(2.5 )distribution pattern across China in 2017, showing high levels in southwest Xinjiang, the North China Plain, and the Sichuan Basin, especially in winter. Compared with other models, the GBDT model showed the highest performance in the estimation of PM2.5 with a 3-km resolution. This algorithm can be adopted to improve the accuracy of PM2.5 estimation with higher spatial resolution, especially in summer. In general, this study provided a potential method of improving the accuracy of satellite-based ground PM2.5 estimation. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Spatial heterogeneity of vegetation extent and the response to water level fluctuations and micro-topography in Poyang Lake, China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland vegetation dynamics are vital but difficult to understand due to complex impact factors and their spatial heterogeneities. Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake in China, is well-known for its ecological importance as a floodplain wetland. However, heterogeneity in vegetation extent and its response to water regimes across different geomorphic units of Poyang Lake remain unclear to date. To address this gap, Landsat images acquired during dry seasons from 1987 to 2018 were selected to explore vegetation extent and its response to water level fluctuations across multiple elevation bands and four wetland types, namely Riparian Wetland (RW), Delta Wetland (DW), Dish-shaped Wetland (DSW), and Fan-shaped wetland (FSW). Results show that vegetation extent in lower elevation bands of the four wetland types increased remarkably with an average increase rate of 0.53 km(2)/year between 2003 and 2018 compared to-0.17 km(2)/year(-1) during 1987 to 2002. Hydrological variables indicating high-flow events negatively affected vegetation extent in DSW while variables indicating low-flow events appear to be positive for vegetation extent in RW, DW, and FSW. Over-long floods as happened in 2016 has caused fatal damage to vegetation extent in DSW. In addition, extreme droughts in recent years caused by the Three Gorges Dam promoted significant (p < 0.05) vegetation expansion in lower elevation bands of RW, DW, and FSW, but a deterioration of vegetation extent in higher elevation bands, making Poyang Lake at risk of shrinkage and degradation. Human impacts on the evolution Poyang Lake system have caused wide concern, which also contribute to the proposal of Poyang Lake water control structure. Heterogeneity in vegetation extent and their response to water regimes across Poyang Lake provide precise spatial information for restoration efforts of the wetland ecosystem.

TI  - Clinical Practice Guideline on Melanoma From the Spanish Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (AEDV)
T2  - ACTAS DERMO-SIFILIOGRAFICAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Specialist approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of melanoma have undergone many changes. This guideline aims to provide Spanish dermatologists with evidence-based information for resolving the most common doubts that arise in clinical practice. Members of the Spanish Oncologic Dermatology and Surgery Group (GEDOC) with experience treating melanoma were invited to participate in drafting the guideline. The group developed a new guideline on the basis of existing ones, using the ADAPTE collaboration process, first summarizing the care process and posing relevant clinical questions, then selecting guidelines with the best scores according to the AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation) tool. Finally, the group searched the selected guidelines for answers to the clinical questions, drafted recommendations, and sent them for external review. The guideline is structured around 21 clinical questions chosen for their relevance to issues that make clinical decisions about the management of melanoma difficult. Evidence from existing guidelines was used to answer the questions. A limitation of this guide derives from the scarce evidence available for answering some questions. Moreover, some areas are changing rapidly, so recommendations must be updated often. The present guideline offers answers to clinical questions about the routine management of melanoma in clinical practice and provides dermatologists with a reference to guide decisions, taking into consideration the resources available and patient preferences.

TI  - Eurasian beaver (<i>Castor fiber</i>) health surveillance in Britain: Assessing a disjunctive reintroduced population
T2  - VETERINARY RECORD
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Numerous translocations of Eurasian beavers have occurred with little implementation of standardised health screening. Pre-release health screening enables the selection of individuals with the best survival prospects and reduces potential health risks, but this is by-passed during unofficial releases. Beaver reintroduction to Britain has been haphazard and currently disjunctive populations of varying status exist.Methods: This observational cross section study investigated the health status of three beaver populations, with 90 live beavers tested for a range of pathogens comprising 56 from Tayside (unofficially released Scotland), nine from Knapdale (officially released Scotland) and 25 from Devon (unofficially released England). In addition, a further 32 cadavers were screened (25 from Tayside and seven from Knapdale).Results: All beavers were in good physical condition, did not harbour any non-native disease or parasites of concern and demonstrated remarkably low levels of any disease or parasite exposure.Conclusion: Beavers are establishing and adapting well to British landscapes and are not acting as reservoirs of significant zoonotic diseases. Official, licensed reintroduction programmes may appear overly convoluted; however, reputational damage of unofficial releases should be considered, along with the health and welfare of the animals involved and collateral damage to other wildlife, domestic animals and humans.

TI  - Impact of tropical cyclone "Fani" on land, ocean, atmospheric and meteorological parameters
T2  - MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year, during the pre-monsoon season, tropical storms form in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) and hit the eastern coast of India, affecting the lives of people living in the coastal region. On 3 May 2019, deadly cyclone Fani impacted coastal areas of Odisha (eastern province) causing large scale damage and the impact was observed up to the Eastern Himalayan region. Detailed analyses of satellite, ground, and Argo data have provided information about the changes on land due to floods caused by heavy precipitation, weather conditions, atmospheric, and ocean parameters. Pronounced changes in ocean and atmospheric parameters were observed at the time of the formation of the cyclone and its movements towards the land, especially along its track. Changes in ocean parameters such as chlorophyll concentration, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and sea surface and sub-surface temperature are found to be associated with the cyclone Fani. Our analysis shows a strong coupling between the land-ocean-atmosphere associated with the cyclone Fani.

TI  - Multiaxial fatigue assessment of jacket-supported offshore wind turbines considering multiple random correlated loads
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Fatigue analysis is an important part of the design process for offshore wind turbines (OWTs). The aerodynamic wind forces are the main fatigue loads, and are generally transformed into six load components: Fx, Fy, Fz, Mx, My, and Mz, which may lead to hotspots of concentrated multiaxial stress. In addition, the six wind load components may be correlated, which makes fatigue analysis complex. To address these issues, this paper derives and presents two new formulae to account for load correlation in the determination of stress power spectral density (PSD) from multiple random loads based on the interaction equation approach and the first principle stress approach. These two formulae form two frequency domain fatigue criteria to evaluate fatigue life of OWT support structures. Two frequency domain criteria are validated through comparison with full time domain analysis results. (C) 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Optimized remote sensing estimation of the lake algal biomass by considering the vertically heterogeneous chlorophyll distribution: Study case in Lake Chaohu of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the difference of vertical distribution of algae in lakes, it is necessary to carry out remote sensing estimation of algal biomass based on the vertically heterogeneous distribution of chlorophyll in order to improve the accuracy of biomass inversion. A new algorithm is proposed and validated to measure algal biomass in Lake Chaohu based on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images. The algal biomass index (ABI) is defined as the difference in remote-sensing reflectance (R-rs, sr(-1)) at 555 nm normalized against two baselines with one formed linearly between R-rs(859) and R-rs(469) and another formed linearly between R-rs(645) and R-rs(469). Both theory and model simulations show that ABI has a good relation with the algal biomass in the euphotic zone (R-2 = 0.88, p < 0.01, N = 50). Field data were further used to estimate the biomass outside the euphotic layer through an empirical algorithm. The ABI algorithm was applied to MODIS Rayleigh-corrected reflectance (R-rc) data after testing the sensitivity to sun glint and thickness of aerosols, which showed an acceptable precision (root mean square error < 21.31 mg and mean relative error < 16.08%). Spectral analyses showed that ABI algorithm was immune to concentration of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) but relatively sensitive to suspended particulate inorganic matter (SPIM), which can be solved by using Turbid Water Index (TWI) though in such a challenging environment. A long-term (2012-2017) estimation of algal biomass was further calculated based on the robust algorithm, which shows both seasonal and spatial variations in Lake Chaohu. Tests of ABI algorithm on Sentinel-3 OLCI demonstrates the potential for application in other remote sensors, which meets the need of observation using multi-sensor remote sensing in the future.

TI  - Numerical simulations of dust storms originated from dried lakes in central and southwest Asia: The case of Aral Sea and Sistan Basin
T2  - AEOLIAN RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Ephemeral and dried lakes in southwest and central Asia, such as the Aral Sea and Hamouns in east Iran, are major sources of dust storms with an increasing tendency during the last decades due to anthropogenic influence and climate change. This study examines two characteristic dust-storm events originated from these areas on 12?15 July 2016 and 27?28 May 2018. Thermal low-pressure systems over topographic-low areas and the Caspian Sea High, along with pressure gradients and intense surface winds over the dust sources facilitated the dust outbreaks and transport. Three models (DREAM-NMME-MACC, CAMS and WRF-Chem) are synergized to simulate the spatial distribution of AOD and surface dust concentrations during the dust events. The results show that DREAM-NMME-MACC and WRF-Chem exhibit the highest discrepancies (R = 0.15?0.58; RMSE = 83%? 125%) in representing the spatial and temporal distribution of dust compared to Terra-MODIS AODs, while CAMS reveals the best performance (R = 0.29?0.77; RSME = 67%?124%). All models significantly underestimate the high MODIS AODs, especially near the source areas, due to different dust schemes, soil conditions, meteorology and dynamic processes for dust emissions that they comprise. Furthermore, notable differences between the models are revealed in simulations of the PM10 concentrations in Zabol, east Iran, as the models fail to reproduce the temporal evolution and high intensity of the dust event. In general, all models represent better the dust storm originated from Sistan (13?14 July 2016) rather than the Aralkum dust storm (27?28 May 2018), indicating an incapability in representing the soil characteristics in a progressively drying terrain.

TI  - Mismatch between watershed effects and local efforts constrains the success of coastal salt marsh vegetation restoration
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal restoration is considered a key solution to counteract coastal degradation and mitigate climate change. In recent years, China's coastal restoration projects have multiplied, with more than one billion US dollars spent during 2016-2019. Due to the sudden die-off of marsh vegetation in the Liaohe River Estuary, local managers have spent more than 30 million dollars to restore these salt marshes since 2015. However, these projects either failed or yielded limited results. Combining long-term remote sensing data to ground-based surveys, we found that salt marshes in the Liaohe River Estuary have experienced two dramatic diebacks separated by a recovery period, and the rapid changes in vegetation canopy were primarily driven by freshwater availability, especially river discharge. We suggest that mismatch between degradation drivers at the watershed-scale and restoration efforts at the local-scale hinders the success of coastal restorations. Efforts to restore these salt marshes will always be thwarted unless freshwater availability is replenished. Therefore, we propose a watershed-based solution, incorporating water replenishment from the river basin in estuarine restoration projects. Given the declining trends in river freshwater inputs in low-middle latitude coastlines, such wetland deterioration might also occur in many world's estuaries. Lessons from China's large-scale coastal restoration projects can help other regions to avoid similar shortcomings, and improve our restoration practices before too many resources are lost.

T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study identified the correlation between OCO-2 XCO2 signatures and night-time light (NTL) dynamics for four different landscapes in India: Megapolis (part of Mumbai), City (part of Raipur), Town (part of Dindigul), and Village (part of Balnoi). The data used for building the correlation were collected from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) XCO2 and Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line Scanner's (DMSP/OLS) NTL datasets. The result of the study indicated that CO2 concentration is strongly related to NTL data. Megapolis part was found to exhibit higher values in both CO2 mean concentration (405.8 ppm) and NTL distribution level (41.5-pixel value), while the village part was low in both CO2 mean concentration (400.306 ppm) and NTL distribution level (4.4-pixel values). The city part of the data showed that the highest mean local R-2 (0.964) in Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR), while the village part recorded the lowest mean local R-2 (0.579) in the given data set. This study further emphasizes that the night light satellite imagery can be used as descriptors and proxies to calculate CO2 emission.

TI  - Drought disaster monitoring using MODIS derived index for drought years: A space-based information for ecosystems and environmental conservation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought disaster is one of the major factors restricting the development of vegetation across a wide variety of environments. Monitoring the temporal and spatial dynamics of drought episodes in the study area is crucial for environmental and ecosystem conservation. This study assesses drought disaster by utilising space-based data and R programming for drought years 2003, 2007, 2012 and 2019 in the Free State Province, South Africa. Results revealed that the study area witnessed drought events in the year 2003 where March, August, September, October, November and December were more affected by drought disaster events. It was further observed that February and March were affected by extreme drought conditions in the year 2007. In year 2012, January, October, November and December, there exist moderate to severe drought conditions in the study area where some regions were more affected than the other. Finally, year 2019 witnessed variations in drought event distributions across the months with January, October and November witnessing severe to extreme drought conditions from about 0 to 30% drought values. Overall, this study shows that the 16-day Terra-MODIS composite and EVI products are sensitive to stressors associated with drought. The Vegetation Condition Monitoring Index (VCI) based on MODIS is suited for monitoring drought disasters. The technique used in this study revealed the suitability of MODIS data for assessing drought conditions and their potential environmental impacts.

TI  - On the self-regulation of sentinel activity among Arabian babbler groupmates
T2  - ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR
M3  - Article
AB  - In many cooperatively breeding species, one of the group members (called a sentinel) flies or climbs up occasionally to a high position, looks around and utters alarm calls if a predator approaches, while other group members are foraging. Bednekon (1997, American Naturalist, 150, 373-392; 2001, Annales Zoologici Fennici, 38, 5-14) game-theoretic model assumes that group members trade the need to forage against the advantages of earlier risk detection when sentinelling. The model predicts that in the presence of another sentinel which may provide timely alerts, a sentinel will terminate its sentinel bout earlier when its energy level drops below a threshold that is higher than the depletion threshold that would incentivize it to resume foraging if it were sentinelling alone. We propose a complementary hypothesis, that this effect of shortened sentinel duration in the presence of another sentinel will be more pronounced for subordinate group members, for whom the fierce competition they suffer while foraging gets attenuated when a groupmate sentinels. We tested these hypotheses in Arabian babbler, Argya squamiceps, groups by comparing sentinel activity under natural conditions vis-a-vis sentinel activity in a feeding experiment in which one or two individuals were fed. In natural conditions, dominant males not only acted as sentinels longer and more often, but they also initiated a larger share of their sentinel bouts when another group member was already on guard. Following experimental feeding ad libitum, in line with the game-theoretic predictions (1) the probability of starting a sentinel bout was not affected by the presence of another sentinel, nor by its sex or rank, and (2) sentinel bouts that terminated in the presence of another sentinel were significantly shorter than sentinel bouts ending alone. Our findings suggest that the seemingly systematic exchange of sentinels may be a consequence of differential needs and incentives rather than active coordination.

TI  - Recovery of Chilean Mediterranean vegetation after different frequencies of fires
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Post-fire recovery of sites in the Chilean Mediterranean vegetation were evaluated 20-30 years after the last fire. We mapped all fires that occurred between 1985 and 2015 in Central Chile using Landsat images. In order to conduct a spatial analysis of vegetation recovery and field sample, we chose sites burned between 1985 and 1995 that retained native vegetation and cover until 2015. In a sampled of these sites, richness and abundance of woody vegetation, and herbaceous richness were recorded. We contrasted our results from field sampling with control (unburned) sites at the species level. Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to evaluate the relationship between the percentage of vegetation recovered with fire frequency, pre-fire cover, topographic and geographic factors. In addition, GLM were used to evaluate the effects of fire frequency on species richness, abundance, and cover. We found that the proportion of dense and semi-dense vegetation cover were similar in sites burned once and twice, and higher than sites burned three times. Besides, the proportion of dense and semidense vegetation cover were higher in lower elevation sites, in those with higher slopes, and far from population centers. The richness and abundance of adult woody species, richness of regeneration and richness of native herbs, were greater in sites that had lesser fire frequency. Mean species richness of native herbaceous species decreased as fire frequency increased, exotic herbaceous cover had no relation with fire frequency, and both native and exotic herbaceous cover were greater at driest latitudes but were not related to fire frequency. Mean species richness after one fire was higher than in unburned sites, but some plant species were found only at unburned sites. We conclude that the Mediterranean vegetation of Chile is able to regenerate to pre-fire conditions after one and two fires, but three consecutive fires reduced its cover, richness and abundance, even 20 years after the fire.

TI  - Estimating ground-level PM<sub>2.5</sub> concentrations by developing and optimizing machine learning and statistical models using 3 km MODIS AODs: case study of Tehran, Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose In this study we aimed to develop an optimized prediction model to estimate a fine-resolution grid of ground-level PM2.5 levels over Tehran. Using remote sensing data to obtain fine-resolution grids of particulate levels in highly polluted environments in areas such as Middle East with the abundance of brightly reflecting deserts is challenging. Methods Different prediction models implementing 3 km AOD products from the MODIS collection 6 and various effective parameters were used to obtain a reliable model to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. In this regards, the linear mixed effect model (LME), multi-variable linear regression model (MLR), Gaussian process model (GPM), artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR) were developed and their performance were compared. Since the LME and GPM outperformed other models, they were further optimized based on meteorological and topographical variables. These models were used to estimate PM2.5 values over the highly polluted megacity, Tehran, Iran. Moreover, the influence of site effect term on the performance of different shapes of LME models was evaluated by considering the random intercept for sites. Results Results showed LME models without the site effect term were able to explain ground-level variabilities of PM2.5 concentrations in ranges of 60-66% (RMSE = 9.6 to 10.3 mu g/m(3)) and 35-41% (RMSE = 12.7 to 13.3 mu g/m(3)) during the model-fitting and cross-validation, respectively. By considering the site effect term, the performance of LME models during calibrations and validations improved by 20% and 50% on average, respectively (18.5% and 17% decrease in the RSME) as compared to LME models without the site effect term. The optimized shape of LME models had a good agreement during both model-fitting (R-2 of 0.76) and cross-validation (R-2 of 0.6). Site-specific and seasonal performances of all types of models revealed that LME models had highest R-2 values over all monitoring stations and all seasons during the cross-validation. LME models had the best performance in May and March compared to other months during the model-fitting and cross-validation. However, LME models had a significant weakness in predicting extreme values of PM2.5 during the cross-validation. Among all other types of models, GPM with the R-2 value of 0.59 and the RMSE of 10.2 mu g/m(3) had the best performance during the cross-validation. Conclusions While the best shape of LME and GPM had similar and reliable performances in predicting ground-level PM2.5 values during the cross-validation, GPM was able to predict extreme values of ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, which was the weakness of LME models and was an important issue in urban polluted environments. In this respect, GPM could be a good alternative for LME models for high levels of PM2.5 concentrations. The spatial distribution of estimated PM2.5 values represented that central parts of Tehran were the most polluted area over the studied region which was consistent with the ground-level recording PM2.5 data over monitoring stations.

TI  - Remotely piloted aircraft systems remote sensing can effectively retrieve ecosystem traits of alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau at a landscape scale
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem trait is a standardized description of biological features of a community, and it bridges individual plants and ecosystem. Conventionally most ecosystem trait data are collected from field survey and the generated data is hard to meet the requirements as set in the concept of ecosystem trait. To a great extent, remotely piloted aircraft systems (RPAS) remote sensing, which is capable of retrieving ecosystem traits across multiple scales, can overcome constraints in field plot survey. In this study, we selected alpine grassland ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), which is under-studied due to scarcity of field monitoring data, as the research target. A new data framework was proposed by integrating field plot and RPAS remote sensing data to map spatial patterns of ecosystem traits for the alpine grasslands. Across four landscapes on the TP, ecosystem traits of vegetation coverage (CVC), species number (CSN), individual number (CIN), above ground biomass (AGB), organic carbon content (OC%) and total nitrogen content (TN%) were retrieved. We also calculated Shannon's Diversity Index and Shannon's Evenness Index for each plot. The results showed that RPAS-based high spatial resolution RGB image is capable of predicting both physical and chemical ecosystem traits for alpine grasslands on the TP. Remote sensing on physical traits are overall more efficient than on chemical traits, with the highest R-2 of 0.86 and 0.48 for physical trait and chemical one, respectively. The bands of Red and Green contributed more to the prediction model than band of Blue did, and the spectral mean value played a greater role than the spectral standard deviation. Based on the retrieved results, a set of spatial patterns on ecosystem traits can be revealed. This study represents an advance on ecosystem trait study and can significantly improve our understanding on ecosystem functions of the alpine ecosystem on the TP.

TI  - Thinning leads to calving-style changes at Bowdoin Glacier, Greenland
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Ice mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet is the largest single contributor to sea level rise in the 21st century. The mass loss rate has accelerated in recent decades mainly due to thinning and retreat of its outlet glaciers. The diverse calving mechanisms responsible for tidewater glacier retreat are not fully understood yet. Since a tidewater glacier's sensitivity to external forcings depends on its calving style, detailed insight into calving processes is necessary to improve projections of ice sheet mass loss by calving. As tidewater glaciers are mostly thinning, their calving styles are expected to change. Here, we study calving behaviour changes under a thinning regime at Bowdoin Glacier, north-western Greenland, by combining field and remote-sensing data from 2015 to 2019. Previous studies showed that major calving events in 2015 and 2017 were driven by hydro-fracturing and meltundercutting. New observations from uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery and a GPS network installed at the calving front in 2019 suggest ungrounding and buoyant calving have recently occurred as they show (1) increasing tidal modulation of vertical motion compared to previous years, (2) absence of a surface crevasse prior to calving, and (3) uplift and horizontal surface compression prior to calving. Furthermore, an inventory of calving events from 2015 to 2019 based on satellite imagery provides additional support for a change towards buoyant calving since it shows an increasing occurrence of calving events outside of the melt season. The observed change in calving style could lead to a possible retreat of the terminus, which has been stable since 2013. We therefore highlight the need for high-resolution monitoring to detect changing calving styles and numerical models that cover the full spectrum of calving mechanisms to improve projections of ice sheet mass loss by calving.

TI  - Changes in coastline and coastal reclamation in the three most developed areas of China, 1980?2018
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - With dramatic coastline changes, developed coastal areas in China are seldom detected and compared in detail regarding the spatiotemporal evolution of coastline migration and coastal reclamation. This study detected and compared the spatiotemporal changes in coastline and coastal reclamation in three developed coastal areas: the Bohai Bay-Yellow River Estuary Zone (BHB-YREZ), the Yangtze River Estuary-Hangzhou Bay Zone (YRE-HZBZ) and the Pearl River Estuary Zone (PREZ). Landsat images from 1980, 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2018 were employed to derive the coastline and reclamation information for the three coastal areas. The ecological risk index was applied to explore the ecological risk characteristics of land use change in the reclamation areas. The results showed that the length of the coastlines in the BHB-YREZ, YRE-HZBZ and PREZ increased from 717.6 km, 716.3 km, and 519.6 km in 1980 to 1252.8 km, 822.6 km and 780.9 km in 2018, with annual change rates of 14.1 km/ year, 2.8 km/year and 6.9 km/year, respectively. 91.0%, 97.8%, 84.5% of the coastline in the BHB-YREZ, YREHZBZ and PREZ was artificial coastline by 2018, respectively. From 1980 to 2018, the total reclamation areas in the BHB-YREZ, YRE-HZBZ and PREZ were 2531.4 km2, 1145.5 km2, and 769.2 km2, respectively. After 2000, except for agricultural land and aquaculture ponds, ports, construction land and tied islands were the main reclaimed types in the BHB-YREZ, YRE-HZBZ and PREZ, respectively. The overall ecological risk in the BHBYREZ showed an increasing tendency during the past four decades, while in the YRE-HZBZ and PREZ, it rose from 1980 to 1990 to 2000?2010, and declined in 2010?2018. Coastal reclamation activities, especially construction land or ports, should be strictly and scientifically planned to protect the coastal environment.

TI  - Putting sea cucumbers on the map: projected holothurian bioturbation rates on a coral reef scale
T2  - CORAL REEFS
M3  - Article
AB  - Bioturbation of reef sediments aerates the upper sediment layers and releases organic material to benthic communities. Despite being the larger and more conspicuous bioturbators on coral reefs, the value of holothurians (sea cucumbers) to reef ecosystems is less often attributed to their ecosystem services than their value for fisheries. This may be because they are considered to have an insignificant effect on reef health relative to other animals. Here, we ground-truthed remote sensing data obtained from drone and satellite imagery to estimate the bioturbation rates of holothurians across the 19 km(2) Heron Island Reef in Queensland, Australia. Ex situ bioturbation rates of the most abundant holothurian, Holothuria atra, were assessed during 24-h feeding experiments. Using density measurements of holothurians across reef flat zones in a 27,000 m(2) map produced from drone imagery, we extrapolated bioturbation across the reef using satellite remote sensing data. Individual H. atra were estimated to produce approximately 14 kg of bioturbated sediment per year. On a reef scale (excluding the reef lagoon) and accounting for varying densities of holothurians across different reef zones, total bioturbation from holothurians at Heron Reef was estimated at over 64,000 metric tonnes per year, slightly more than the mass of five Eiffel Towers. These results highlight the scale of structural and biochemical impacts that holothurians have on reef flats and their importance to ecosystem functioning and services. Management of these animals on reefs is imperative as overharvesting would likely cause substantial negative effects on sedimentary ecosystems and their biogeochemistry in corals reefs.

TI  - Epidemiology of Pertussis in Individuals of All Ages Hospitalized With Respiratory Illness in South Africa, January 2013-December 2018
T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background. Policy recommendations on pertussis vaccination need to be guided by data, which are limited from low- and middle-income countries. We aimed to describe the epidemiology of pertussis in South Africa, a country with high human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence and routine pertussis vaccination for 6 decades including the acellular vaccine since 2009.Methods. Hospitalized patients of all ages were enrolled at 5 sentinel sites as part of a pneumonia surveillance program from January 2013 through December 2018. Nasopharyngeal specimens and induced sputum were tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for Bordetella pertussis. In addition, demographic and clinical information were collected. Incidence rates were calculated for 2013-2016, and multivariable logistic regression performed to identify factors associated with pertussis.Results. Over the 6-year period 19 429 individuals were enrolled, of which 239 (1.2%) tested positive for B. pertussis. Detection rate was highest in infants aged <6 months (2.8%, 155/5524). Mean annual incidence was 17 cases per 100 000 population, with the highest incidence in children <1 year of age (228 per 100 000). Age-adjusted incidence was 65.9 per 100 000 in HIV-infected individuals compared to 8.5 per 100 000 in HIV-uninfected individuals (risk ratio 30.4, 95% confidence interval: 23.0-40.2). Ten individuals (4.2%) with pertussis died; of which 7 were infants aged <6 months and 3 were immunocompromised adults.Conclusions. Pertussis continues to be a significant cause of illness and hospitalization in South Africa, despite routine vaccination. The highest burden of disease and death occurred in infants; however, HIV-infected adults were also identified as an important group at risk of B. pertussis infection.

TI  - The 10-m crop type maps in Northeast China during 2017-2019
T2  - SCIENTIFIC DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Northeast China is the leading grain production region in China where one-fifth of the national grain is produced; however, consistent and reliable crop maps are still unavailable, impeding crop management decisions for regional and national food security. Here, we produced annual 10-m crop maps of the major crops (maize, soybean, and rice) in Northeast China from 2017 to 2019, by using (1) a hierarchical mapping strategy (cropland mapping followed by crop classification), (2) agro-climate zone-specific random forest classifiers, (3) interpolated and smoothed 10-day Sentinel-2 time series data, and (4) optimized features from spectral, temporal, and texture characteristics of the land surface. The resultant maps have high overall accuracies (OA) spanning from 0.81 to 0.86 based on abundant ground truth data. The satellite estimates agreed well with the statistical data for most of the municipalities (R-2 >= 0.83, p<0.01). This is the first effort on regional annual crop mapping in China at the 10-m resolution, which permits assessing the performance of the soybean rejuvenation plan and crop rotation practice in China.

TI  - Synergistic use of hyperspectral imagery, Sentinel-1 and LiDAR improves mapping of soil physical and geochemical properties at the farm-scale
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Airborne imaging spectroscopy data provide soil and vegetation information over relatively large areas at high spatial resolutions (<5 m). We combined airborne hyperspectral data with space-borne data (LiDAR DEM and Sentinel-1) to map soil properties and investigate the contributions of the different sensor data to the mapping accuracy. The study was conducted on a 330-ha farm in south-central Wisconsin, USA, where soils are relatively young and soil variation is high. Seventy-three soil samples (0-10 cm depth) were taken from cropped fields before planting. The soil data were used with remote sensing data for mapping clay, silt, sand, total carbon (TC), Mg, Al, Si, Fe, Ca, Ti, Mn and Zr. Three types of variables were compared: (a) DEM + Sentinel-1 & 2, as these are easy-to-obtain, (b) hyperspectral data with high-spatial resolution, and (c) hyperspectral data + DEM + Sentinel-1, to evaluate if the prediction can be improved by combining hyperspectral data with DEM + Sentinel-1, and if combining DEM + Sentinel-1 with hyperspectral data had higher prediction accuracy than combination with Sentinel-2 data. The partial least square regression (PLSR) model was used for establishing relationships between soil and remote sensing data. It was found that airborne hyperspectral imaging can accurately map the spatial distributions of soil clay content, Si and Fe concentrations. Combining hyperspectral data with DEM and Sentinel-1 improved the performance of models for mapping a range of soil properties (e.g., clay, silt, sand, Al, Ti, Mn and Zr). Total C, Mg and Ca concentrations cannot be predicted from the combination of hyperspectral data, Sentinel-1 and terrain attributes. In a highly heterogeneous landscape, surface soil properties can be accurately mapped combining LiDAR DEM, Sentinel-1 and hyperspectral data.HighlightsAirborne imaging spectroscopy, DEM and Sentinel-1 were used to map surface soil properties.Hyperspectral data can accurately map clay, Si and Fe.Combining hyperspectral data with DEM, Sentinel-1 improved prediction accuracy of several soil properties.Total C, Mg and Ca cannot be predicted from hyperspectral data, DEM and Sentinel-1.

TI  - Revisiting the levels of Aerosol Optical Depth in south-southeast Asia, Europe and USA amid the COVID-19 pandemic using satellite observations
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The countries around the world are dealing with air quality issues for decades due to their mode of production and energy usages. The outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic and consequent global economic shutdown, for the first time, provided a base for the real-time experiment of the effect of reduced emissions across the globe in abetting the air pollution issue. The present study dealt with the changes in Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), a marker of air pollution, because of global economic shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. The study considered the countries in south and south-east Asia (SSEA), Europe and the USA for their extended period of lockdown due to coronavirus pandemic. Daily Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from Moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropospheric column density of NO2 and SO2 from Ozone monitoring instrument (OMI) sensors, including meteorological data such as wind speed (WS) and relative humidity (RH) were analyzed during the pre-lockdown (2017-2019) and lockdown periods (2020). The average AOD, NO2 and SO2 during the lockdown period were statistically compared with their pre-lockdown average using Wilcoxon-signed-paired-rank test. The accuracy of the MODIS-derived AOD, including the changing pattern of AOD due to lockdown was estimated using AERONET data. The weekly anomaly of AOD, NO2 and SO2 was used for analyzing the space-time variation of aerosol load as restrictions were imposed by the concerned countries at the different points of time. Additionally, a random forest-based regression (RF) model was used to examine the effects of meteorological and emission parameters on the spatial variation of AOD. A significant reduction of AOD (-20%) was obtained for majority of the areas in SSEA, Europe and USA during the lockdown period. Yet, the clusters of increased AOD (30-60%) was obtained in the south-east part of SSEA, the western part of Europe and US regions. NO2 reductions were measured up to 20-40%, while SO2 emission increased up to 30% for a majority of areas in these regions. A notable space-time variation was observed in weekly anomaly. We found the evidence of the formation of new particles for causing high AOD under high RH and low WS, aided by the downward vertical wind flow. The RF model showed a distinguishable relative importance of emission and meteorological factors among these regions to account for the spatial variability of AOD. Our findings suggest that the continued lockdown might provide a temporary solution to air pollution; however, to combat persistent air quality issues, it needs switching over to the cleaner mode of production and energy. The findings of this study, thus, advocated for alternative energy policy at the global scale.

TI  - Surface Deformation Measurement of the 2020 M<sub>w</sub> 6.4 Petrinja, Croatia Earthquake Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By the end of December 2020, an earthquake with Mw about 6.4 hit Sisak-Moslavina County, Croatia. The town of Petrinja was the most affected region with major power outage and many buildings collapsed. The damage also affected neighbor countries such as Bosnia and Herzegovina and Slovenia. As a light of this devastating event, a deformation map due to this earthquake could be generated by using remote sensing imagery from Sentinel-1 SAR data. InSAR could be used as deformation map but still affected with noise factor that could problematize the exact deformation value for further research. Thus in this study, 17 SAR data from Sentinel-1 satellite is used in order to generate the multi-temporal interferometry utilize Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers (StaMPS). Mean deformation map that has been compensated from error factors such as atmospheric, topographic, temporal, and baseline errors are generated. Okada model then applied to the mean deformation result to generate the modeled earthquake, resulting the deformation is mostly dominated by strike-slip with 3 meter deformation as right lateral strike-slip. The Okada sources are having 11.63 km in length, 2.45 km in width, and 5.46 km in depth with the dip angle are about 84.47 degrees and strike angle are about 142.88 degrees from the north direction. The results from this modeling can be used as learning material to understand the seismic activity in the latest 2020 Petrinja, Croatia Earthquake.

TI  - Assessment of erosion and hazard in the coastal areas of Selangor
T2  - GEOGRAFIA-MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIETY & SPACE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea level rise is often associated with climate change and global warming. The change in shoreline is a continuous process that occurs through various processes such as erosion, sedimentation, sea level rise, wave behaviour and land use. Rapid technological advancement has made it possible to quickly identify the shoreline changes through a combination of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) application and Remote Sensing technology. The current study aims to identify the criteria or characteristics of the coastal areas and identify the risks for potential hazards in the coastal areas of Selangor. The data used in this study are the topographic maps produced in 1984 and SPOT 5 satellite images taken in 2013. The results of this study show that the estimated total area of erosion is 2,558 hectares and the total area of accretion is 2,583 hectares. The areas in Pasangan, Tanjong Karang, Api-Api, Bagan Nakhoda Omar, Jeram, Pasir Panjang, Hujong Permatang, Kuala Selangor and Panchang Bedena are categorized as critical erosion areas. Risk assessment analysis was done to identify the risk levels of coastal erosion hazards. Results indicate that the risk level for human, social and economic components is low while the level for infrastructure components ranges between low and moderate. However, the risk for coastal erosion hazards for the environment is high. The results of this study provide the critical information required by government agencies to formulate policies and implement an Integrated Coastal Management Plan in the effort to effectively deal with climate change and sea level rise phenomenon.

TI  - Deep Learning Forecasts of Soil Moisture: Convolutional Neural Network and Gated Recurrent Unit Models Coupled with Satellite-Derived MODIS, Observations and Synoptic-Scale Climate Index Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed soil moisture forecasting through satellite-based sensors to estimate the future state of the underlying soils plays a critical role in planning and managing water resources and sustainable agricultural practices. In this paper, Deep Learning (DL) hybrid models (i.e., CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU) are designed for daily time-step surface soil moisture (SSM) forecasts, employing the gated recurrent unit (GRU), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), and convolutional neural network (CNN). To establish the objective model's viability for SSM forecasting at multi-step daily horizons, the hybrid CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU model is tested at 1st, 5th, 7th, 14th, 21st, and 30th day ahead period by assimilating a comprehensive pool of 52 predictor dataset obtained from three distinct data sources. Data comprise satellite-derived Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) repository a global, high-temporal resolution, unique terrestrial modelling system, and ground-based variables from Scientific Information Landowners (SILO) and synoptic-scale climate indices. The results demonstrate the forecasting capability of the hybrid CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU model with respect to the counterpart comparative models. This is supported by a relatively lower value of the mean absolute percentage and root mean square error. In terms of the statistical score metrics and infographics employed to test the final model's utility, the proposed CEEMDAN-CNN-GRU models are considerably superior compared to a standalone and other hybrid method tested on independent SSM data developed through feature selection approaches. Thus, the proposed approach can be successfully implemented in hydrology and agriculture management.

TI  - Comparison of Multicriteria Decision-Making Techniques for Groundwater Recharge Potential Zonation: Case Study of the Willochra Basin, South Australia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In semi-arid regions, groundwater resources play a crucial role in all economic, environmental, and social processes. However, the occurrence, movement, and recharge of these hidden and valuable resources vary from place to place. Therefore, better management practices and mapping of groundwater recharge potential zones are needed for the sustainable groundwater resources. For an example, groundwater resources in Willochra Basin are vitally important for drinking, irrigation, and stock use. This study shows the significance of the application of three decision-making approaches, including multi-influencing factor, analytical hierarchy process, and frequency ratio techniques in the identification of groundwater potential zones. A total of seven criteria, including lithology, slope, soil texture, land-use, rainfall, drainage density, and lineament density, were extracted from conventional and remote sensing data sources. The parameters and their assigned weights were integrated using Geographic Information System (GIS) software to generate recharge potential maps. The resultant maps were evaluated using the area under the curve method. The results showed that the southern regions of the Willochra Basin are more promising for groundwater recharge potential. The map produced using the frequency ratio model was the most efficient (84%), followed by the multi-influencing factor model (70%) and then the analytical hierarchy process technique (62%). The area under the curve method agreed when evaluated using published weights and rating values.

TI  - On the Utility of High-Resolution Soil Moisture Data for Better Constraining Thermal-Based Energy Balance over Three Semi-Arid Agricultural Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over semi-arid agricultural areas, the surface energy balance and its components are largely dependent on the soil water availability. In such conditions, the land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from the thermal bands has been commonly used to represent the high spatial variability of the surface evaporative fraction and associated fluxes. In contrast, however, the soil moisture (SM) retrieved from microwave data has rarely been used thus far due to the unavailability of high-resolution (field scale) SM products until recent times. Soil evaporation is controlled by the surface SM. Moreover, the surface SM dynamics is temporally related to root zone SM, which provides information about the water status of plants. The aim of this work was to assess the gain in terms of flux estimates when integrating microwave-derived SM data in a thermal-based energy balance model at the field scale. In this study, SM products were derived from three different methodologies: the first approach inverts SM, labeled hereafter as 'SMO20', from the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence derived from Sentinel-1 products in the water cloud model (WCM); the second approach inverts SM from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data based on machine learning algorithms trained on a synthetic dataset simulated by the WCM noted 'SME16'; and the third approach disaggregates the soil moisture active and passive SM at 100 m resolution using Landsat optical/thermal data 'SMO19'. These SM products, combined with the Landsat based vegetation index and LST, are integrated simultaneously within an energy balance model (TSEB-SM) to predict the latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes over two irrigated and rainfed wheat crop sites located in the Haouz Plain in the center of Morocco. H and LE were measured over each site using an eddy covariance system and their values were used to evaluate the potential of TSEB-SM against the classical two source energy balance (TSEB) model solely based on optical/thermal data. Globally, TSEB systematically overestimates LE (mean bias of 100 W/m(2)) and underestimates H (mean bias of -110 W/m(2)), while TSEB-SM significantly reduces those biases, regardless of the SM product used as input. This is linked to the parameterization of the Priestley Taylor coefficient, which is set to alpha(PT) = 1.26 by default in TSEB and adjusted across the season in TSEB-SM. The best performance of TSEB-SM was obtained over the irrigated field using the three retrieved SM products with a mean R-2 of 0.72 and 0.92, and a mean RMSE of 31 and 36 W/m(2) for LE and H, respectively. This opens up perspectives for applying the TSEB-SM model over extended irrigated agricultural areas to better predict the crop water needs at the field scale.

TI  - Application of remote sensing, GIS and geophysical techniques for groundwater potential development in the crystalline basement complex of Ondo State, Southwestern Nigeria
T2  - SUSTAINABLE WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remotely sensed and electrical resistivity data were employed to develop the groundwater potential of the hard-rock terrain of Ondo State, Southwestern Nigeria. Administrative map, Landsat ETM+, Aster DEM were acquired and processed to produce geomorphological map, lineament and lineament-intersection density maps. Electric sounding and groundwater yield data were also acquired. The electric sounding data were interpreted quantitatively. Aquifer thickness and coefficient of anisotropy were generated from geoelectric parameters (resistivities and thicknesses) deduced from the interpreted results of the electric sounding data. All these maps were reclassified into hydro-thematic maps and combined using weighted linear combination function in ArcGIS 10.5 software to develop a composite groundwater potential map. Groundwater yield data were used to establish the reliability of the groundwater potential map derived from the remotely sensed and geophysical data interpretation. Erosional and depositional landforms were identified in the area and these included: residual hill (677-980 m.a.s.l), pediment (452-677 m.a.s.l), pediplain (226-452 m.a.s.l) and pediplain with alluvium (74-226 m.a.s.l). The lineament density ranged from 0.00 to 69.48 km/km(2). The lineament-intersection density ranged between 0.00 and 72.92 km/km(2). The aquifer thicknesses varied from 0.2 to 79 m. The aquifer types identified from the study were the weathered layer (WL), weathered/fractured (unconfined) (W/F(u)), weathered/fractures (confined) (W/F(c)), weathered/fractured (unconfined)/fractured (confined) (W/F(u)/F(c)) and fractured confined aquifer (F(c)). The coefficient of anisotropy (coa) values ranged from 1.0 to 2.88 units. Four distinct groundwater potential zones: very low, low, moderate and high zones were identified. However, the study concluded that the groundwater potential rating of the study area was low to moderate.

TI  - The Impact of the Cultural Beliefs on Forming and Designing Spatial Organizations, Spaces Hierarchy, and Privacy of Detached Houses and Apartments in Jordan
T2  - SPACE AND CULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Cultural beliefs and architecture have been recognized as having a strong relationship. However, a gap in knowledge exists regarding the interaction between culture and spatial organization in domestic architecture. This research used case methods to explore the impact of cultural factors in forming and designing detached houses and apartments in Jordan. Specifically, this article aimed to explore the sociocultural impact of privacy on spatial hierarchy and spatial organization in order to ascertain sociospatial designs in Jordanian culture. The data were collected through a comprehensive analysis of plans, images, direct observation, and in-depth interviews with Jordanian household residents. The data were analyzed socially and spatially with regard to circulation, privacy, security, and spatial arrangement of indoor and outdoor spaces. This research found that cultural factors and overall traditions affect detached housing design more than apartment design in Jordan. Also, cultural beliefs and traditions in Jordan are strongly reflected in people's values, practices, activities, and the level of privacy needed in a given home. Therefore, privacy becomes a social, religious, and personal need that Jordanian domestic architecture should accommodate. Because culture shapes humans' worldviews, and then both culture and worldview build social and personal values to define lifestyle, clearly determine specific activities, and set residents' requirements for the design of the components of space requisite for cultural recognition. This research recommends that housing designers should adapt to the cultural practices, beliefs, and privacy needs of a given people when designing homes. Future research is needed to replicate the study for an authentic perspective on a cross-cultural basis.

TI  - Reducing Nonsentinel Harm Events due to Medication Errors by Using Mini-Root Cause Analysis and Action.
T2  - Global journal on quality and safety in healthcare
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Introduction: A full root cause analysis (RCA) such as that required following a sentinel event is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and expensive. This quality improvement project used a similar but abbreviated process (mini-RCA and action; mini-RCA2) in response to medication errors that caused less serious harm.Methods: In 2018, all medication errors that caused harm due to system failures but were not sentinel events were investigated by mini-RCA2. The incidence of similar medication errors reported in the year before and in the year after the introduction of mini-RCA2 was compared to determine the impact of this intervention. Similar events were identified by searching the safety reporting system database for reported medication errors by drug name (e.g., Humate P) and/or event type (e.g., prescribing error-omission of a patient's home medications on admission to hospital). The time and labor costs of this intervention were estimated.Results: Seven medication errors were investigated by mini-RCA2. More than 48 members of staff from 11 clinical and nonclinical departments contributed to the identification of 39 system failures and made 42 recommendations, of which 22 (52%) were implemented. This reduced the recurrence of reports of similar events from 35 (0.57%) to 21 (0.36%). Although this 0.21% absolute decrease did not achieve statistical significance, recurrence of similar harm events was reduced from 7 (0.11%) to 0 (p = 0.016). Benefits were greatest when the mini-RCA2 recommendations were fully implemented. This reduced the recurrence of similar events from 9 (0.21%) to 0 (p = 0.007). A total of 251 hours (mean ± SD, 35.9 ± 16.6 hours) were required for this intervention. The associated labor cost was Saudi Arabia Riyal (SAR) 34,181 (US $8256; mean SAR ± SD, 4883 ± 1302 [mean US $ ± SD, $2102 ± $561]).Conclusion: The use of mini-RCA2 to review medication errors provided a structured process to manage reported events, monitor the implementation of recommendations, and assess the effectiveness of implemented actions. The use of this rapid process to investigate errors that cause harm but are not sentinel events reduced recurrence of similar medication errors. Although the time and cost required for this intervention is not insignificant, the cumulative benefit to patients, healthcare professionals, and the organization are greater.

TI  - Validation and Comparison of Physical Models for Soil Salinity Mapping over an Arid Landscape Using Spectral Reflectance Measurements and Landsat-OLI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study focuses on the validation and comparison of eight different physical models for soil salinity mapping in an arid landscape using two independent Landsat-Operational Land Imager (OLI) datasets: simulated and image data. The examined and compared models were previously developed for different semi-arid and arid geographic regions around the world, i.e., Latino-America, the Middle East, North and East Africa and Asia. These models integrate different spectral bands and unlike mathematical functions in their conceptualization. To achieve the objectives of the study, four main steps were completed. For simulated data, a field survey was organized, and 100 soil samples were collected with various degrees of salinity levels. The bidirectional reflectance factor was measured above each soil sample in a goniometric laboratory using an analytical spectral device (ASD) FieldSpec-4 Hi-Res spectroradiometer. These measurements were resampled and convolved in the solar-reflective bands of the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor using a radiative transfer code and the relative spectral response profiles characterizing the filters of the OLI sensor. Then, they were converted in terms of the considered models. Moreover, the OLI image acquired simultaneously with the field survey was radiometrically preprocessed, and the models were implemented to derive soil salinity maps. The laboratory analyses were performed to derive electrical conductivity (EC-Lab) from each soil sample for validation and comparison purposes. These steps were undertaken between predicted salinity (EC-Predicted) and the measured ground truth (EC-Lab) in the same way for simulated and image data using regression analysis (p < 0.05), coefficient of determination (R-2), and root mean square error (RMSE). Moreover, the derived maps were visually interpreted and validated by comparison with observations from the field visit, ancillary data (soil, geology, geomorphology and water table maps) and soil laboratory analyses. Regardless of data sources (simulated or image) or the validation mode, the results obtained show that the predictive models based on visible- and near-infrared (VNIR) bands and vegetation indices are inadequate for soil salinity prediction in an arid landscape due to serious signals confusion between the salt crust and soil optical properties in these spectral bands. The statistical tests revealed insignificant fits (R-2 <= 0.41) with very high prediction errors (RMSE >= 0.65), while the model based on the second-order polynomial function and integrating the shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands provided the results of best fit, with the field observations (EC-Lab), yielding an R-2 of 0.97 and a low overall RMSE of 0.13. These findings were corroborated by visual interpretation of derived maps and their validation by comparison with the ground truthing.

TI  - Sentinel Node Biopsy in Ductal Carcinoma in Situ: Is it Justifiable?
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: For invasive breast cancer, sentinel node biopsy (SNB) is an acceptable alternative to axillary node clearance (ANC), although in the recent era, its role is under review. In ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), the benefit of SNB is even less well defined. Despite this, guidelines still recommend that it is performed in selected cases of DCIS. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of performing SNB in DCIS.Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of DCIS who underwent axillary staging with SNB between 2008-2019 in our large volume tertiary centre were identified and included in the study.Results: Out of the 48 patients who were identified, four patients had a positive SNB (8%). Two of those patients were found to have micro metastatic disease. None of the patients with a positive SNB had local or systemic recurrence (median follow up: 40 months). One non-breast cancer-related mortality was reported. Two patients were identified who had recurrent disease, one with an invasive recurrence in the breast, and the other with systemic recurrence in the form of bone disease. Both of these patients had a negative SNB.Conclusion: Our results confirm that performing axillary staging with SNB in DCIS is not justifiable, as it does not affect patient outcomes. This supports the emerging evidence that being more surgically conservative may decrease morbidity without affecting patient survival.

TI  - On the Spatial Patterns of Urban Thermal Conditions Using Indoor and Outdoor Temperatures
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The changing climate has introduced new and unique challenges and threats to humans and their environment. Urban dwellers in particular have suffered from increased levels of heat stress, and the situation is predicted to continue to worsen in the future. Attention toward urban climate change adaptation has increased more than ever before, but previous studies have focused on indoor and outdoor temperature patterns separately. The objective of this research is to assess the indoor and outdoor temperature patterns of different urban settlements. Remote sensing data, together with air temperature data collected with temperature data loggers, were used to analyze land surface temperature (outdoor temperature) and air temperature (indoor temperature). A hot and cold spot analysis was performed to identify the statistically significant clusters of high and low temperature data. The results showed a distinct temperature pattern across different residential units. Districts with dense urban settlements show a warmer outdoor temperature than do more sparsely developed districts. Dense urban settlements show cooler indoor temperatures during the day and night, while newly built districts show cooler outdoor temperatures during the warm season. Understanding indoor and outdoor temperature patterns simultaneously could help to better identify districts that are vulnerable to heat stress in each city. Recognizing vulnerable districts could minimize the impact of heat stress on inhabitants.

TI  - A note on radar signatures of hydrometeors in the melting layer as inferred from Sentinel-1 SAR data acquired over the ocean
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images acquired over the ocean often show radar signatures of rain, which are not easy to interpret. The scattering mechanisms causing radar signatures are usually attributed to surface scattering due to sea surface roughness variations caused by raindrops impinging onto the sea surface and/or by up- and downdraft winds. In this paper, we address another radar signature of rain, which is often observed in C-band (and also in X-band) SAR images, but whose origin has been a matter of debate in the ocean remote sensing community since long time and has not been solved yet. This radar signature consists of areas of very high radar backscatter (bright patches) at co- as well as well as at cross-polarization. This paper aims at providing evidence that it is not caused by surface scattering, but by volume scattering from wobbling, non-spherical, oblate hydrometeors within the melting layer. To this end, we first review the theory of radar backscattering from the melting layer as developed by D'Amico et al (1098) and then present historic radar backscatter data from the melting layer carried out by ground-based and airborne radars, which validate this theory. Then we show four representative Sentinel-1 SAR images acquired over the sea area close to Hong Kong and a SIR-C/X-SAR image acquired over the Gulf of Mexico, which show pronounced radar signatures of rain (bright patches) at co-polarization (VV) and cross-polarization (VH). The analysis of the SAR images yields the result that within the bright patches the ratio of the radar backscatter at cross-polarization to the one at co-polarization shows the same characteristics as the linear depolarization ratio (LDR) measured by radar meteorologist in radar backscattering from the melting layer. Furthermore, we show that radar signatures of rain due to volume scattering may interfere with co-polarization radar signatures of rain due to surface scattering. Thus, cross-polarization SAR images are better suited to detect radar backscattering from the melting layer than co-polarization SAR images, This investigation is of relevance for ocean surface wind retrieval using C-band SARs, since scattering at hydrometeors in the melting layer can cause significant errors in ocean wind retrieval. Areas with simultaneously high co- and cross-polarization NRCS values of around -10 dB and -20 dB, respectively, have to be flagged as areas where the conventional wind retrieval algorithm cannot be applied.

TI  - Multi-temporal analysis of urbanisation patterns as coastal development indicators: Eastern Mediterranean coast of Turkey
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural and anthmpogenic forces on Earth create changes in biophysical characteristics of landscapes in the forms of modifications or transformations. Since landscapes are composed of spatially configured patches of different land cover types, changes in the pattern composition and configuration may be used as indicators for identifying environmental trends and their underlying causes. To this end, pattern indices hold a strong potential to conceptualize landscape structure in many different ways. This study aims to analyse landscape changes in an urbanized coastal landscape in the eastern Mediterranean region of Turkey using pattern indices as development indicators. For this purpose, the spatial distribution of built-up areas was extracted for the years 1989, 1995, 2001, 2007 and 2019 using geo-referenced SPOT and Sentinel images. Eight landscape structure indices were calculated to demonstrate spatial and temporal diversity of area/edge, shape and aggregation characteristics of built-up patches. These indices are (1) class area (CA), (2) percentage of landscape (PL), (3) largest patch index (LPI), (4) edge density, (5) perimeter-area ratio (PARA), (6) fractal dimension (FRAC), (7) related circumscribing circle (RCC) and (8) percentage of like-adjacencies (PLADJ). The study area was divided into 215 grid-units to represent spatial diversity of development. The aforementioned indices were calculated separately for each of the units. The spatial distribution of built-up areas was also associated with land capability to assess land degradation trends. Results showed that much of the development occurred on Class I and II lands that are in fact prime agricultural areas. Results also suggest that the structure of building patches and the way that it changes vary between the coast and inland.

TI  - Detection of shadows in high spatial resolution ocean satellite data using DINEOF
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud shadows present in high spatial resolution remote sensing datasets can affect the quality of the data if they are not properly detected and removed. When working with ocean data, cloud shadows are often difficult to differentiate from non-shadow values, since they show similar spectral characteristics than water pixels. A methodology to detect cloud shadows over the ocean is proposed. The present approach combines a series of tests applied directly to the physical variables derived from the satellite measured radiances, and it therefore does not depend on the wavebands measured by a specific satellite sensor. The tests include a departure from an EOF basis calculated using DINEOF, a threshold test, a proximity to cloud test and a ray tracing test. The weighing of the different tests can be adapted to each case or domain of study. The results are compared to manually detected shadows and to another shadow detection method. The approach works with cloud shadows of all sizes, and also with very small objects shadows, like the shadows projected by offshore windmills.

TI  - The Unique Role of the Jason Geodetic Missions for high Resolution Gravity Field and Mean Sea Surface Modelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The resolutions of current global altimetric gravity models and mean sea surface models are around 12 km wavelength resolving 6 km features, and for many years it has been difficult to improve the resolution further in a systematic way. For both Jason 1 and 2, a Geodetic Mission (GM) has been carried out as a part of the Extension-of-Life phase. The GM for Jason-1 lasted 406 days. The GM for Jason-2 was planned to provide ground-tracks with a systematic spacing of 4 km after 2 years and potentially 2 km after 4 years. Unfortunately, the satellite ceased operation in October 2019 after 2 years of Geodetic Mission but still provided a fantastic dataset for high resolution gravity recovery. We highlight the improvement to the gravity field which has been derived from the 2 years GM. When an Extension-of-Life phase is conducted, the satellite instruments will be old. Particularly Jason-2 suffered from several safe-holds and instrument outages during the GM. This leads to systematic gaps in the data-coverage and degrades the quality of the derived gravity field. For the first time, the Jason-2 GM was "rewound" to mitigate the effect of the outages, and we evaluate the effect of "mission rewind" on gravity. With the recent successful launch of Sentinel-6 Michael Freilich (S6-MF, formerly Jason CS), we investigate the possibility creating an altimetric dataset with 2 km track spacing as this would lead to fundamental increase in the spatial resolution of global altimetric gravity fields. We investigate the effect of bisecting the ground-tracks of existing GM to create a mesh with twice the resolution rather than starting all over with a new GM. The idea explores the unique opportunity to inject Jason-3 GM into the same orbital plane as used for Jason-2 GM but bisecting the existing Jason-2 tracks. This way, the already 2-years Jason-2 GM could be used to create a 2 km grid after only 2 years of Jason-3 GM, rather than starting all over with a new GM for Jason-3.

TI  - Single bands leaf reflectance prediction based on fuel moisture content for forestry applications
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indices can be used to perform quantitative and qualitative assessment of vegetation cover. These indices exploit the reflectance features of leaves to predict their biophysical properties. In general, there are different vegetation indices capable of describing the same biophysical parameter. For instance, vegetation water content can be inferred from at least sixteen vegetation indices, where each one uses the reflectance of leaves in different spectral bands. Therefore, if the leaf moisture content, a vegetation index and the reflectance at the wavelengths to compute the vegetation index are known, then the reflectance in other spectral bands can be computed with a bounded error. The current work proposes a method to predict, by a machine learning regressor, the leaf reflectance (spectral signature) at specific spectral bands using the information of leaf moisture content and a single vegetation index of two tree species (Pinus radiata, and Eucalyptus globulus), which constitute 97.5% of the Valparai ' so forests in Chile. Results suggest that the most suitable vegetation index to predict the spectral signature is the Leaf Water Index, which using a Kernel Ridge Regressor achieved the best prediction results, with a RMSE lower than 0.022, and a average R2 greater than 0.95 for Pinus radiata and 0.81 for Eucalyptus globulus, respectively.

TI  - Cross-Calibration of Terra and Aqua MODIS Using RadCalNet
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments onboard the Terra and Aqua spacecraft have been successfully operating for nearly two decades and providing complementary observations of the Earth's land, ocean, and atmosphere. Although the two MODIS instruments view the entire Earth's surface once every 2-3 days, simultaneous views between them are limited due to their varying orbits. Therefore, the intercomparison between these two instruments has been previously performed using a transfer instrument [such as Advanced Very-high-resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)] or using lunar measurements normalized using a common model, such as the USGS Robotic Lunar Observatory (ROLO). In recent years RadCalNet, a Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) initiative, has provided SI-traceable Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectances from a coordinated network of instrumented land-based sites. RadCalNet facilitates a unique mechanism to perform cross-calibration of instruments by minimizing the uncertainties associated with overpass time differences. In this letter, the near-simultaneous TOA reflectance measurements from the Railroad Valley (RRV), US (RVUS) are used as a transfer to compare the on-orbit observations for the Terra and Aqua MODIS reflective solar bands (RSBs). Near-nadir overpasses from January 2013 to January 2019 are processed and matched up with near-simultaneous RadCalNet measurements. Results show that the visible (VIS)/near-infrared response (NIR) bands agree to within 2%, and the short-wave infrared (SWIR) bands agree to within 5%. Also discussed in this letter are the future efforts that will be undertaken to expand this comparison to include other instruments, other sites, and both nadir- and off-nadir views after compensation for bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) effects.

TI  - Classification and Observed Seasonal Phenology of Broadleaf Deciduous Forests in a Tropical Region by Using Multitemporal Sentinel-1A and Landsat 8 Data
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Broadleaf deciduous forests (BDFs) or dry dipterocarp forests play an important role in biodiversity conservation in tropical regions. Observations and classification of forest phenology provide valuable inputs for ecosystem models regarding its responses to climate change to assist forest management. Remotely sensed observations are often used to derive the parameters corresponding to seasonal vegetation dynamics. Data acquired from the Sentinel-1A satellite holds a great potential to improve forest type classification at a medium-large scale. This article presents an integrated object-based classification method by using Sentinel-1A and Landsat 8 OLI data acquired during different phenological periods (rainy and dry seasons). The deciduous forest and nondeciduous forest areas are classified by using NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) from Landsat 8 cloud-free composite images taken during dry (from February to April) and rainy (from June to October) seasons. Shorea siamensis Miq. (S. siamensis), Shorea obtusa Wall. ex Blume (S. obtusa), and Dipterocarpus tuberculatus Roxb. (D. tuberculatus) in the deciduous forest area are classified based on the correlation between phenology of BDFs in Yok Don National Park and backscatter values of time-series Sentinel-1A imagery in deciduous forest areas. One hundred and five plots were selected during the field survey in the study area, consisting of dominant deciduous species, tree height, and canopy diameter. Thirty-nine plots were used for training to decide the broadleaf deciduous forest areas of the classified BDFs by the proposed method, and the other sixty-six plots were used for validation. Our proposed approach used the changes of backscatter in multitemporal SAR images to implement BDF classification mapping with acceptable accuracy. The overall accuracy of classification is about 79%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.7. Accurate classification and mapping of the BDFs using the proposed method can help authorities implement forest management in the future.

T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article investigates the presence of a new interferometric signal in multilooked synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferograms that cannot be attributed to the atmospheric or Earth-surface topography changes. The observed signal is short-lived and decays with the temporal baseline; however, it is distinct from the stochastic noise attributed to temporal decorrelation. The presence of such a <italic>fading signal</italic> introduces a systematic phase component, particularly in short temporal baseline interferograms. If unattended, it biases the estimation of Earth surface deformation from SAR time series. Here, the contribution of the mentioned phase component is quantitatively assessed. The biasing impact on the deformation-signal retrieval is further evaluated. A quality measure is introduced to allow the prediction of the associated error with the fading signals. Moreover, a practical solution for the mitigation of this physical signal is discussed; special attention is paid to the efficient processing of Big Data from modern SAR missions such as Sentinel-1 and NISAR. Adopting the proposed solution, the deformation bias is shown to decrease significantly. Based on these analyses, we put forward our recommendations for efficient and accurate deformation-signal retrieval from large stacks of multilooked interferograms.

TI  - Synergy between Satellite Altimetry and Optical Water Quality Data towards Improved Estimation of Lakes Ecological Status
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - European countries are obligated to monitor and estimate ecological status of lakes under European Union Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) for sustainable lakes' ecosystems in the future. In large and shallow lakes, physical, chemical, and biological water quality parameters are influenced by the high natural variability of water level, exceeding anthropogenic variability, and causing large uncertainty to the assessment of ecological status. Correction of metric values used for the assessment of ecological status for the effect of natural water level fluctuation reduces the signal-to-noise ratio in data and decreases the uncertainty of the status estimate. Here we have explored the potential to create synergy between optical and altimetry data for more accurate estimation of ecological status class of lakes. We have combined data from Sentinel-3 Synthetic Aperture Radar Altimeter and Cryosat-2 SAR Interferometric Radar Altimeter to derive water level estimations in order to apply corrections for chlorophyll a, phytoplankton biomass, and Secchi disc depth estimations from Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument data. Long-term in situ data was used to develop the methodology for the correction of water quality data for the effects of water level applicable on the satellite data. The study shows suitability and potential to combine optical and altimetry data to support in situ measurements and thereby support lake monitoring and management. Combination of two different types of satellite data from the continuous Copernicus program will advance the monitoring of lakes and improves the estimation of ecological status under European Union Water Framework Directive.

TI  - Mapping Forest Disturbance Due to Selective Logging in the Congo Basin with RADARSAT-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense time series of stripmap RADARSAT-2 data acquired in the Multilook Fine mode were used for detecting and mapping the extent of selective logging operations in the tropical forest area in the northern part of the Republic of the Congo. Due to limited radiometric sensitivity to forest biomass variation at C-band, basic multitemporal change detection approach was supplemented by spatial texture analysis to separate disturbed forest from intact. The developed technique primarily uses multi-temporal aggregation of orthorectified synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery that are acquired before and after the logging operations. The actual change analysis is based on textural features of the log-ratio image calculated using two SAR temporal composites compiled of SAR scenes acquired before and after the logging operations. Multitemporal aggregation and filtering of SAR scenes decreased speckle and made the extracted textural features more prominent. The overall detection accuracy was around 80%, with some underestimation of the area of forest disturbance compared to reference based on optical data. The user's accuracy for disturbed forest varied from 76.7% to 94.9% depending on the accuracy assessment approach. We conclude that change detection utilizing RADARSAT-2 time series represents a useful instrument to locate areas of selective logging in tropical forests.

TI  - Optimum Spatial Resolution of Satellite- based Optical Sensors for Maximizing Classification Performance
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Optimum spatial resolution of satellite based optical sensors for maximizing classification performance is investigated. Also, classification performance assessment method considering spatial resolution of satellite based optical imagers is proposed. Optimum spatial resolution which makes the highest classification accuracy is determined from spatial frequency components, spectral features of objects and classification method. First, in this paper, based on the relationship between variance of pixels and classification accuracy, classification accuracy for Landsat Multiple Spectral Scanner: MSS images with various Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV) will be shown. In their connection, variance of pixel values for images with various IFOV will be clarified. Second, assuming the shape of boundary line between adjacent categories is circle, relationship among IFOV, ratio of Mixels and classification accuracy will be cleared under the supposition that the number of Mixels equals to that of misclassified pixels. Finally, it will be also shown that aforementioned relationships and optimum spatial resolution have been confirmed by using airborne based MSS data of Sayama district in Japan.

TI  - Shoreline Dynamics in East Java Province, Indonesia, from 2000 to 2019 Using Multi-Sensor Remote Sensing Data
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal regions are one of the most vulnerable areas to the effects of global warming, which is accompanied by an increase in mean sea level and changing shoreline configurations. In Indonesia, the socioeconomic importance of coastal regions where the most populated cities are located is high. However, shoreline changes in Indonesia are relatively understudied. In particular, detailed monitoring with remote sensing data is lacking despite the abundance of datasets and the availability of easily accessible cloud computing platforms such as the Google Earth Engine that are able to perform multi-temporal and multi-sensor mapping. Our study aimed to assess shoreline changes in East Java Province Indonesia from 2000 to 2019 using variables derived from a multi-sensor combination of optical remote sensing data (Landsat-7 ETM and Landsat-8 OLI) and radar data (ALOS Palsar and Sentinel-1 data). Random forest and GMO maximum entropy (GMO-Maxent) accuracy was assessed for the classification of land and water, and the land polygons from the best algorithm were used for deriving shorelines. In addition, shoreline changes were quantified using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS). Our results showed that coastal accretion is more profound than coastal erosion in East Java Province with average rates of change of +4.12 (end point rate, EPR) and +4.26 m/year (weighted linear rate, WLR) from 2000 to 2019. In addition, some parts of the shorelines in the study area experienced massive changes, especially in the deltas of the Bengawan Solo and Brantas/Porong river with rates of change (EPR) between -87.44 to +89.65 and -18.98 to +111.75 m/year, respectively. In the study areas, coastal erosion happened mostly in the mangrove and aquaculture areas, while the accreted areas were used mostly as aquaculture and mangrove areas. The massive shoreline changes in this area require better monitoring to mitigate the potential risks of coastal erosion and to better manage coastal sedimentation.

TI  - Using satellite data and machine learning to study conflict-induced environmental and socioeconomic destruction in data-poor conflict areas: The case of the Rakhine conflict
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper studies socioeconomic and environmental changes in the neighboring areas Bangladesh-Myanmar border from 2012 to 2019, thus covering the period before and after the 2017 Rakhine conflict in Myanmar and outflux of refugees across the border to Bangladesh. Given the scarcity and costliness of traditional data collection methods in such conflict areas, the paper uses a novel methodological model based on very-high-resolution satellite imagery, nighttime satellite imagery, and machine-learning algorithms to generate reliable and reusable data for comparative assessment of the impacts of the Rakhine conflict. Assessments of welfare and environmental risks using this approach can be accurate and scalable across different regions and times when other data are unavailable. Key findings are: the general livelihood situation has worsened and income sources shrunk in Rakhine; forced migration damaged the ecologically fragile regions in the two countries; the destruction of aquaculture wetland ecosystems is observed in Rakhine; the deforestation rate reached 20% in Rakhine and 13% on the Bangladeshi side of the border. The results can provide guidance to policymakers and international actors as they work to repatriate the victims of the conflict in Rakhine and minimize the conflict's security and environmental consequences. The methodology can be applied to other data-poor conflict and refugee areas in the world.

TI  - Daily Actual Evapotranspiration Estimation in a Mediterranean Ecosystem from Landsat Observations Using SEBAL Approach
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying actual evapotranspiration (ETa) over natural vegetation is crucial in evaluating the water status of ecosystems and the water-use patterns in local or regional hydrological basins. Remote sensing-based surface energy balance models have been used extensively for estimating ETa in agro-environments; however, the application of these models to natural ecosystems is still limited. The surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL) physical-based surface energy balance model was applied to estimate the actual evapotranspiration over a heterogeneous coverage of Mediterranean maquis in a natural reserve in Sardinia, Italy. The model was applied on 19 Landsat 5 and 8 images from 2009 to 2014, and the results were compared to the data of a micrometeorological station with eddy covariance flux measurements. Comparing the SEBAL-based evaporative fraction (?(S)) to the corresponding tower-derived evaporative fractions (?(T)) showed good flux estimations in the Landsat overpass time (Coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.77, root mean square error RMSE = 0.05 and mean absolute error MAE = 0.076). Three methods were evaluated for upscaling instantaneous latent heat flux (lambda E) to daily actual evapotranspiration (ETa,D). The upscaling methods use the evaporative fraction (?), the reference evapotranspiration fraction (EFr) and the ratio of daily to instantaneous incoming shortwave radiation (Rs(24)/Rs(i)) as upscaling factors under the hypothesis of diurnal self-preservation. A preliminary analysis performed using only in-situ measured data demonstrated that the three factors were relatively self-preserved during the daytime, and can yield good ETa,D estimations, particularly when obtained at near the Landsat scene acquisition time (approximate to 10:00 UTC). The upscaling factors obtained from SEBAL retrieved instantaneous fluxes, and some ancillary measured meteorological data were used to upscale SEBAL-estimated instantaneous actual lambda to daily ET. The ? EFr and Rs(24)/Rs(i) methods on average overestimated the measured ETa,D by nearly 20, 61 and 18%, respectively. The performance of the ? and Rs(24)/Rs(i) methods was considered satisfactory, bearing in mind the high variable ground cover and the inherent variability of the biome composition, which cannot be properly represented in the Landsat moderate spatial resolution. In this study, we tested the potential of the SEBAL model application in a complex natural ecosystem. This modeling approach will be used to represent the spatial dynamics of ET, which will be integrated into further environmental and hydrological applications.

TI  - Application of Optical Remote Sensing in Rubber Plantations: A Systematic Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) is a tropical tree crop cultivated for the industrial production of latex. The trees are tall, perennial and long-lived, and are typically grown in plantations. In most rubber-producing countries, smallholders account for more than 85% of plantation area. Traditional practices mean that it can be difficult to monitor rubber plantations for management purposes. To overcome issues associated with monitoring traditional practices, remote sensing approaches have been successfully applied in this field. However, information on this is lacking. Therefore, this study aims to document the current status, history, development and prospects for remote sensing applications in rubber plantations by using the PRISMA framework. The review focuses on the application of optical remote sensing data in rubber. In this paper, we discuss the current role of remote sensing on specific subject areas, namely mapping, change detection, stand age estimation, carbon and biomass assessment, leaf area index (LAI) prediction and disease detection. In addition, we elaborate on the benefits gained and challenges faced while adapting this technology. These include the availability and free access to satellite imagery as the greatest benefit and the presence of clouds as one of the toughest challenges. Finally, we highlighted four potential areas where future work can be done: (1) Advancements in remote sensing data, (2) algorithm enhancements, (3) emerging processing platforms, and (4) application to less studied subject areas. This paper gives insight into strengthening the potential of remote sensing for delivering efficient and long-term services for rubber plantations.

TI  - A simple, robust, and automatic approach to extract water body from Landsat images (case study: Lake Urmia, Iran)
T2  - JOURNAL OF WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Urmia is one of the largest saline lakes in the world, and has a great effect on its surrounding ecosystems as well as the economic, social, and even cultural condition of its basin inhabitants. Hence, continuous monitoring of lake area changes is necessary and unavoidable for better land management and prevention of its degradation. In this study, by using Landsat 8 images and by preforming some essential pre-processing tasks, the area of the lake was estimated using the number of traditional spectral indices and a new one and the automatic Otsu's thresholding method for 5 years (2013-2017). The results showed that this index shows more accurate results than other indices when estimating the area of the lake and can separate water class from land one with an average overall accuracy of 96%.

M3  - Article
AB  - Observation of surface water is a very important for studying hydrological processes and last advances in satellite-based optical remote sensors have promoted the field of sensing surface water of a certain area or from a catchment area. This paper has considered analysing data from satellite image and geographical information system (GIS) for a catchment area. Banat hydrographical area is situated in the western part and south-western part of Romania and Barzava River basin drains a relatively small area in Banat Hydrographical Area. GIS techniques were used for extract data NDWI, MNDWI, AWEI indexes from in Landsat-8 satellite in images to evaluate their performances for the extraction of surface water. This paper shows the monitoring of Barzava river basin based on the indices resulting from the processing of satellite images. The objective of this research was to extract the surface water bodies from the hydrographic basin of river Barzava. Then, these data are utilized for purpose finding correlation and regression equations between the reflectance of the satellite image and the water parameters. NDWI being an indicator of plant water stress, it is observed that for 2018 compared to 2019 the basin of the Barzava River was affected by the drought.

TI  - Role of emissions and meteorology in the recent PM<sub>2.5</sub> changes in China and South Korea from 2015 to 2018
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we examined the change rates of PM2.5 concentrations, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and the concentrations of PM2.5 precursors, such as SO2 and NO2, in China and South Korea using surface and satellite observations from 2015 to 2018. To quantify the impacts of the emissions and meteorology on the concentration changes, we performed a series of air quality simulations with year-specific meteorology and a fixed anthropogenic emissions inventory. The surface PM2.5 observations in China and South Korea decreased at rates of 9.1 and 4.3%/yr during the study period, respectively. The AODs from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) also decreased faster over China than the AODs over South Korea. For the PM2.5 decrease in China, the emission impact was more significant (73%) than the meteorology impact (27%). On the contrary, in South Korea, the emissions and meteorology impacts on PM2.5 reductions were similar (51% vs 49%). The SO2 concentration over China in 2018 significantly reduced to approximately half of the level in 2015. In turn, the sulfate concentration in Baengnyeong (BN), located in a downwind pathway from China to South Korea, decreased at a rate of 0.79%/month. However, the nitrate concentration in BN showed an increasing trend due to the non-linear chemical reactions among sulfate-nitrate-ammonium. The increased nitrate compensated for the reduced PM2.5 concentration from the sulfate decrease at BN. Additionally, the number of high (>50 mu g/m(3)) PM2.5 concentration days continuously decreased in China, but the number in South Korea increased. It is noted that emission reductions in an upwind area do not guarantee corresponding air quality improvement in the downwind area when complex secondary aerosol formation processes, as well as spatiotemporal changes in meteorology, are involved in the transboundary transport of air pollutants.

TI  - Comparison of Satellite- based PM<sub>2.5</sub> Estimation from Aerosol Optical Depth and Top-of-atmosphere Reflectance
T2  - AEROSOL AND AIR QUALITY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance are two useful sources of satellite data for estimating surface PM2.5 concentrations. Comparison of PM2.5 estimates between these two approaches remains to be explored. In this study, satellite observations of TOA reflectance and AOD from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8 geostationary satellite in 2016 over Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and meteorological data are used to estimate hourly PM2.5 based on four different machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest, extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting regression, and support vector regression). For both reflectance-based and AOD-based approaches, our cross validated results show that random forest algorithm achieves the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.75 and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 18.71 mu g m(-3) for the former and R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 15.69 mu g m(-3) for the later. Additionally, we find a large discrepancy in PM2.5 estimates between reflectance-based and AOD-based approaches in terms of annual mean and their spatial distribution, which is mainly due to the sampling difference, especially over northern YRD in winter. Overall, reflectance-based approach can provide robust PM2.5 estimates for both annual mean values and probability density function of hourly PM2.5. Our results further show that almost all population lives in non-attainment areas in YRD using annual mean PM2.5 from reflectance-based approach. This study suggests that reflectance-based approach is a valuable way for providing robust PM2.5 estimates and further for constraining health impact assessments.

TI  - Characterizing the climatic niche of mast seeding in beech: Evidences of trade-offs between vegetation growth and seed production
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Masting is a complex mechanism which is mainly driven by a combination of internal plant resources and climatic conditions. While the driving role of climate in masting is being intensively studied, the interplay among climate, seed production, vegetation growth and phenology still needs further investigation. The objectives of this study were to identify the climatic determinants of different levels of seed production and of NDVI-based vegetation growth and phenology in European beech, and to evaluate if exists a trade-off between these two plant processes. To answer these questions, we used a 25-year-long dataset of beech seed production. We exploited the concept of ecological niche assuming that a mast year can be modeled like a species with variable preferences for different resources, which are the underlying annual climatic conditions; we performed an Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA), a presence-only modeling tool conventionally used in zoology and botany, and used seasonal (spring, summer, autumn) Standardized Precipitation-Evaporation Index (SPEI) observations, considering the current year (y-0), and up to one (y-1) and two (y-2) years before the masting event. For analyzing the role of vegetation growth and phenology, we used seasonal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values and associated NDVI-based phenological metrics derived from Landsat imagery. Results indicated the driving role of climate for masting, especially in VHSP years. A moist summer and dry spring at y-2 and a dry summer at y-1 represented the main driving climatic conditions for masting; while a moist spring during the observation year represented the key condition for triggering higher intensities of seed production. Summer NDVI at y-0 and y-1 represented the variables discriminating best between masting and non-masting years and resulted as driven by opposite summer climatic conditions than seed production, thus indicating a trade-off between seed production and vegetation phenology. We concluded that reproduction and vegetation growth act as two different climate-dependent plant responses in beech, in a way that certain conditions through the years promote mast seeding and the opposite conditions favor vegetation growth. The understanding of climate-growth-masting relationships represents indispensable knowledge for providing a holistic view of masting mechanisms and developing adaptive forest management strategies in this species.

TI  - An index for tracking old-growth value in disturbance-prone forest landscapes
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests in their later stages of development attain attributes that support biodiversity and provide a variety of ecological benefits (e.g. clean water and carbon storage). Despite their values, old-growth forests are declining worldwide in part due to anthropogenic pressures. A persistent challenge to managing and conserving old-growth forest has been establishing a reliable method for measuring old-growth values across large landscapes at an appropriately fine ecological and spatial scale. Using data from a community-managed forest in central British Columbia, Canada, an Aerial Laser Scanning (ALS) based metric was developed, using a random forest modeling framework, to predict an old-growth index across the forest. Using this old-growth index, we estimated that forests with "Very-high" old-growth values cover 14.7% of the study area (18,183.2 ha), and that only 25% (4,545.9 ha) of this "very-high" old-growth value areas are current inside designated old-growth management areas (OGMAs). Additionally, the forests with "very-high" old-growth values that are currently inside OGMAs are fragmented, as only 1 out of 40 OGMAs have more than 50% of its area covered by forests with "Very-high" old-growth value. This research provides a clear ecological indicator that uses fine-scale remotely sensed data to measure old-growth and assess its conservation status within reserves. While the index developed is specific to the study site, the framework, is generic enough to be adapted to other forest types and ecosystems. More importantly, the identification of the amount and location of old-growth forests over the landscape can aid in the management and conservation of this rare resource and its services.

TI  - Sequence Braiding: Visual Overviews of Temporal Event Sequences and Attributes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporal event sequence alignment has been used in many domains to visualize nuanced changes and interactions over time. Existing approaches align one or two sentinel events. Overview tasks require examining all alignments of interest using interaction and time or juxtaposition of many visualizations. Furthermore, any event attribute overviews are not closely tied to sequence visualizations. We present Sequence Braiding, a novel overview visualization for temporal event sequences and attributes using a layered directed acyclic network. Sequence Braiding visually aligns many temporal events and attribute groups simultaneously and supports arbitrary ordering, absence, and duplication of events. In a controlled experiment we compare Sequence Braiding and IDMVis on user task completion time, correctness, error, and confidence. Our results provide good evidence that users of Sequence Braiding can understand high-level patterns and trends faster and with similar error. A full version of this paper with all appendices; the evaluation stimuli, data, and analysis code; and source code are available at osf.io/mq2wt.

TI  - Assessing Alpine Ecosystem Dynamics over the Great Himalayan Mountain Range, Kashmir: Earth Observation and Ecosystem Modeling
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpine vegetation distribution in the Greater Himalaya, Kashmir is preseted and its projected behavior under changing climate using LANDSAT TM (2002) and LANDSAT-8 (2014) data, mapped at 1:30000 scale and having spatial resolution of 30 m. The alpine vegetation in the region spans similar to 2990 km(2). SRTM DEM was used to delineate the spatial extents of the alpine landscapes (>2500 m asl). A total of nine land use classes which include Alpine pasture, Alpine scrubs, bare land, dense forest, exposed rocks, lakes, rivers, snow and sparse forest were identified in the area. The results reflect both positive and negative changes in all classes over time. Alpine pastures have increased 60.11 km(2) followed by Alpine scrubs, which have increased by 54.70 km(2). Exposed rocks have reduced to 29.22 km(2), while sparse forests have diminished by 23.62 km(2). Bare land has decreased by 14.64 km(2) and snow has declined by 2.04 km(2). Lakes in the area have shrunk by 0.84 km(2) and river by 0.02 km. The overall observed results revealed that Alpine pastures have increased by 17% followed by Alpine scrubs to 15%. The future climate projections from Worldclim (RCP 8.5) and other environmental data used in the MaxEnt model suggest increase in the suitable habitat for the shrub species by the mid of 21(st) century.

TI  - Calibration of Satellite Low Radiance by AERONET-OC Products and 6SV Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - For water quality monitoring using satellite data, it is often required to optimize the low radiance signal through the application of radiometric gains. This work describes a procedure for the retrieval of radiometric gains to be applied to OLI/L8 and MSI/S2A data over coastal waters. The gains are defined by the ratio of the top of atmosphere (TOA) reflectance simulated using the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum-vector (6SV) radiative transfer model, REF, and the TOA reflectance acquired by the sensor, MEAS, over AERONET-OC stations. The REF is simulated considering quasi-synchronous atmospheric and aquatic AERONET-OC products and the image acquisition geometry. Both for OLI/L8 and MSI/S2A the measured TOA reflectance was higher than the modeled signal in almost all bands resulting in radiometric gains less than 1. The use of retrieved gains showed an improvement of reflectance remote sensing, Rrs, when with ACOLITE atmospheric correction software. When the gains are applied an accuracy improvement of the Rrs in the 400-700 nm domain was observed except for the first blue band of both sensors. Furthermore, the developed procedure is quick, user-friendly, and easily transferable to other optical sensors.

TI  - Bankline dynamics and their effects on protected areas along the Brahmaputra river
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - This work addresses the effect of the Brahmaputra river on the land areas of 5 Protected Areas situated along its bankline. The Protected Areas- Dibru Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve, Kaziranga National Park, Orang National Park, Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary and Pani Dihing Wildlife Sanctuary, are subjected to bank erosion and accretion due to unstable bankline and dynamic nature of the Brahmaputra river. These Protected Areas harbour diverse wildlife species, for which integrity of habitat expanse is important. Quantification and spatial variation of bank erosion and accretion and identification of causative factors that are accountable for land area change have been investigated in GIS environment, using remote sensing data that spans over a period of 30 years (1987-2017). The results show that the Protected Areas located on the southern bank are more susceptible to bank erosion. While a decline in land area was observed in Dibru Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve (37.6%), Kaziranga National Park (5%) and Bura Chapori Wildlife Sanctuary (22.4%), a little increase in area occurred in Orang National Park (8.9%) and Pani Dihing Wildlife Sanctuary (4.8%). Analyses of equidistant reaches and grids displayed explicit information on spatial variation of activities in the Protected Areas. The braided nature of the river and the annual floodings are the primary causes for regularity in erosion and accretion. Other factors that influenced the activities in specific study areas were avulsion, thalweg shift of adjacent channels, channel abandonment, catastrophic floods, location, river flow direction, confluence and node points. This study highlights the land area status and the affected zones of the Protected Areas of ecological importance and provides an understanding of the drivers that will serve as a vital input to the authorities and other stakeholders.

TI  - Multi-Source EO for Dynamic Wetland Mapping and Monitoring in the Great Lakes Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetland managers, citizens and government leaders are observing rapid changes in coastal wetlands and associated habitats around the Great Lakes Basin due to human activity and climate variability. SAR and optical satellite sensors offer cost effective management tools that can be used to monitor wetlands over time, covering large areas like the Great Lakes and providing information to those making management and policy decisions. In this paper we describe ongoing efforts to monitor dynamic changes in wetland vegetation, surface water extent, and water level change. Included are assessments of simulated Radarsat Constellation Mission data to determine feasibility of continued monitoring into the future. Results show that integration of data from multiple sensors is most effective for monitoring coastal wetlands in the Great Lakes region. While products developed using methods described in this article provide valuable management tools, more effort is needed to reach the goal of establishing a dynamic, near-real-time, remote sensing-based monitoring program for the basin.

TI  - Updated inventory of glacier ice in New Zealand based on 2016 satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The only complete inventory of New Zealand glaciers was based on aerial photography starting in 1978. While there have been partial updates using 2002 and 2009 satellite data, most glaciers are still represented by the 1978 outlines in contemporary global glacier databases. The objective of this project is to establish an updated glacier inventory for New Zealand. We have used Landsat 8 OLI satellite imagery from February and March 2016 for delineating clean glaciers using a semi-automatic band ratio method and debris-covered glaciers using a maximum likelihood classification. The outlines have been checked against Sentinel-2 MSI data, which have a higher resolution. Manual post processing was necessary due to misclassifications (e.g. lakes, clouds), mapping in shadowed areas, and combining the clean and debris-covered parts into single glaciers. New Zealand glaciers cover an area of 794 +/- 34 km(2) in 2016 with a debris-covered area of 10%. Of the 2918 glaciers, seven glaciers are >10 km(2) while 71% is 40%. Only 15 glaciers are located on the North Island. For a selection of glaciers, we were able to calculate the area reduction between the 1978 and 2016 inventories.

TI  - Qualitative Rating of Lossy Compression for Aerial Imagery by Neutrosophic WASPAS Method
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The monitoring and management of consistently changing landscape patterns are accomplished through a large amount of remote sensing data using satellite images and aerial photography that requires lossy compression for effective storage and transmission. Lossy compression brings the necessity to evaluate the image quality to preserve the important and detailed visual features of the data. We proposed and verified a weighted combination of qualitative parameters for the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework to evaluate the quality of the compressed aerial images. The aerial imagery of different contents and resolutions was tested using the transform-based lossy compression algorithms. We formulated an MCDM problem dedicated to the rating of lossy compression algorithms, governed by the set of qualitative parameters of the images and visually acceptable lossy compression ratios. We performed the lossy compression algorithms' ranking with different compression ratios by their suitability for the aerial images using the neutrosophic weighted aggregated sum product assessment (WASPAS) method. The novelty of our methodology is the use of a weighted combination of different qualitative parameters for lossy compression estimation to get a more precise evaluation of the effect of lossy compression on the image content. Our methodology includes means of solving different subtasks, either by altering the weights or the set of aspects.

TI  - A 3-D Spatiotemporal Model for Remote Sensing Data Cubes
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite images from the same scene observed over time can be composed in an image stack, which could be modeled as a 3-D cube. To handle this type of remote sensing data, on the one side, unidimensional dynamical models have been considered, modeling each pixel separately along the time (pixel-based approach), and exploring the temporal correlation. On the other side, 2-D approaches have been considered to process each image at one date, exploring the spatial correlation. In this article, we propose a new 3-D autoregressive (AR) (3-D-AR) model useful for multitemporal image interpretation exploring the correlation in three dimensions altogether. The 3-D-AR model is statistically defined, and a robust parameter estimation method is discussed. The tools for filtering, forecasting, and detecting anomalies are also introduced. A Monte Carlo simulation study is performed to evaluate the finite signal length performance of the robust estimation and its sensitivity to outliers. The proposed model is applied to a multitemporal normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) image stack for filtering, prediction, and anomaly detection purposes. The numerical results show the importance of the proposed 3-D-AR model for spatiotemporal remote sensing data interpretation.

TI  - Uniting remote sensing, crop modelling and economics for agricultural risk management
T2  - NATURE REVIEWS EARTH & ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - The increasing availability of satellite data at higher spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions is enabling new applications in agriculture and economic development, including agricultural insurance. Yet, effectively using satellite data in this context requires blending technical knowledge about their capabilities and limitations with an understanding of their influence on the value of risk-reduction programmes. In this Review, we discuss how approaches to estimate agricultural losses for index insurance have evolved from costly field-sampling-based campaigns towards lower-cost techniques using weather and satellite data. We identify advances in remote sensing and crop modelling for assessing agricultural conditions, but reliably and cheaply assessing production losses remains challenging in complex landscapes. We illustrate how an economic framework can be used to gauge and enhance the value of insurance based on earth-observation data, emphasizing that even as yield-estimation techniques improve, the value of an index insurance contract for the insured depends largely on how well it captures the losses when people suffer most. Strategically improving the collection and accessibility of reliable ground-reference data on crop types and production would facilitate this task. Audits to account for inevitable misestimation complement efforts to detect and protect against large losses. Improvements in earth observation are enabling new approaches to assess agricultural losses, such as those resulting from adverse weather. This Review examines advances in the application of remotely sensed data and crop modelling in index-based insurance as well as opportunities to enhance the quality of index insurance programmes. Key pointsIn many developing regions, adverse weather can lead to food insecurity, reduced investments or distressed asset sales that ensnare people in a cycle of poverty.Tools to manage risk - such as well-designed insurance - can help people avoid the most severe possible consequences of bad weather and build confidence to invest in additional income-generating opportunities.In recent decades, governments and researchers across the globe have trialled approaches to inexpensively assess agricultural losses. Index-based insurance offers promise, but detecting losses cheaply and accurately remains challenging.Recent advances in crop modelling and remote sensing can improve index-based approaches by strengthening the link between indices and actual losses, as well as reducing programme costs.We provide an economic framework to evaluate indices, suggesting how the remote sensing and modelling communities can contribute to enhancing index insurance quality through better detection of adverse conditions.Promising opportunities to enhance index insurance programmes include inexpensively addressing heterogeneous conditions on the ground, such as employing audits, optimizing insurance zones, using new sensors or increasing contract flexibility.

TI  - Intelligent mapping of irrigated areas from Landsat 8 images using transfer learning
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING AND GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of reliable and up-to-date data in developing countries is a major obstacle to sustainable development. In Morocco, where groundwater withdrawals by farmers are very intensive and informal, maps describing and monitoring the extension of irrigated areas are scarce and labor-intensive to obtain. In this paper a novel transfer learning algorithm is proposed to map irrigated areas at different stages of an agricultural cycle from Landsat 8 images. The results obtained displays satisfactory performance over traditional machine learning algorithms.On a small dataset, we initially tested three well known deep learning architectures (SegNet, DenseNet and Unet). The results obtained were not satisfactory. So, to get high performance, we rely on a transfer learning architecture combining UNet with ResNet50 backbone (trained on 2012 ILSVRC ImageNet dataset) as a baseline after a phase where different configurations were tested.In the first part of this study, we compared the use of three optimization methods: Adam and two variants of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) associated with two techniques (Cyclical Learning Rate and Warm Restart) to find the optimal learning rate and then test the impact of data augmentation on the overall accuracies.Data augmentation had improved the overall accuracy for the three methods. Adam based method from 94% to 97% with mean IoU of 0,79 (for all land cover classes) and 0,86 for irrigated areas class. For SGD based methods, the overall accuracy had increased from 91% to 94% with mean IoU of 0,75 (for all land cover classes) and 0,82 for irrigated areas class. As we are interested in having irrigated areas maps at different key periods of the agricultural cycle, we also explored, in the second part of this study, the temporal generalization of the best model.

TI  - Aerosol-Cloud Interaction with Summer Precipitation over Major Cities in Eritrea
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents the spatiotemporal variability of aerosols, clouds, and precipitation within the major cities in Eritrea and it investigates the relationship between aerosols, clouds, and precipitation concerning the presence of aerosols over the study region. In Eritrea, inadequate water supplies will have both direct and indirect adverse impacts on sustainable development in areas such as health, agriculture, energy, communication, and transport. Besides, there exists a gap in the knowledge on suitable and potential areas for cloud seeding. Further, the inadequate understanding of aerosol-cloud-precipitation (ACP) interactions limits the success of weather modification aimed at improving freshwater sources, storage, and recycling. Spatiotemporal variability of aerosols, clouds, and precipitation involve spatial and time series analysis based on trend and anomaly analysis. To find the relationship between aerosols and clouds, a correlation coefficient is used. The spatiotemporal analysis showed larger variations of aerosols within the last two decades, especially in Assab, indicating that aerosol optical depth (AOD) has increased over the surrounding Red Sea region. Rainfall was significantly low but AOD was significantly high during the 2011 monsoon season. Precipitation was high during 2007 over most parts of Eritrea. The correlation coefficient between AOD and rainfall was negative over Asmara and Nakfa. Cloud effective radius (CER) and cloud optical thickness (COT) exhibited a negative correlation with AOD over Nakfa within the June-July-August (JJA) season. The hybrid single-particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT) model that is used to find the path and origin of the air mass of the study region showed that the majority of aerosols made their way to the study region via the westerly and the southwesterly winds.

TI  - Impact of Urban Land-Cover Changes on the Spatial-Temporal Land Surface Temperature in a Tropical City of Mexico
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has severe consequences on ecosystem processes, as well as on people's quality of life. It has been suggested that the loss of vegetation cover increases the land surface temperature (LST) due to modifications in biogeochemical patterns, generating a phenomenon known as "urban heat island" (UHI). The aim of this work was to analyze the effects of urban land-cover changes on the spatiotemporal variation of surface temperature in the tropical city of Merida, Mexico. To find these effects we used both detected land-cover changes as well as variations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Merida is ranked worldwide as one of the best cities to live due to its quality of life. Data from satellite images of Landsat were analyzed to calculate land use change (LUC), LST, and NDVI. LST increased ca. 4 degrees C in the dry season and 3 degrees C in the wet season because of the LUC. In addition, a positive relationship between the LST and the NDVI was observed mainly in the dry season. The results confirm an increase in the LST as a consequence of the loss of vegetation cover, which favors the urban heat island phenomenon.

TI  - GNSS Profile from the Greenland Korth Expeditions in the Context of Satellite Data
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last two decades, a small group of researchers repeatedly crossed the Greenland interior skiing along a 700-km long route from east to west, acquiring precise GNSS measurements at exactly the same locations. Four such elevation profiles of the ice sheet measured in 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2015 were differenced and used to analyze the surface elevation change. Our goal is to compare such locally measured GNSS data with independent satellite observations. First, we show an agreement in the rate of elevation change between the GNSS data and satellite radar altimetry (ERS, Envisat, CryoSat-2). Both datasets agree well (2002-2015), and both correctly display local features such as an elevation increase in the central part of the ice sheet and a sharp gradual decline in the surface heights above Jakobshavn Glacier. Second, we processed satellite gravimetry data (GRACE) in order for them to be comparable with local GNSS measurements. The agreement is demonstrated by a time series at one of the measurement sites. Finally, we provide our own satellite gravimetry (GRACE, GRACE-FO, Swarm) estimate of the Greenland mass balance: first a mild decrease (2002-2007: -210 +/- 29 Gt/yr), then an accelerated mass loss (2007-2012: -335 +/- 29 Gt/yr), which was noticeably reduced afterwards (2012-2017: -178 +/- 72 Gt/yr), and nowadays it seems to increase again (2018-2019: -278 +/- 67 Gt/yr).

TI  - Spruce budworm tree host species distribution and abundance mapping using multi-temporal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana; SBW) is the most destructive forest pest of northeastern Canada and United States. SBW occurrence as well as the extent and severity of its damage are highly dependent on the characteristics of the forests and the availability of host species namely, spruce (Picea sp.) and balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.). Remote sensing satellite imagery represents a valuable data source for seamless regional-scale mapping of forest composition. This study developed and evaluated new models to map the distribution and abundance of SBW host species at 20 m spatial resolution using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery in combination with several site variables for a total of 191 variables in northern New Brunswick, Canada using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. We found Sentinel-2 multi-temporal single spectral bands and numerous spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) yielded the classification of SBW host species with an overall accuracy (OA) of 72.6% and kappa coefficient (K) of 0.65. Incorporating Sentinel-1 SAR data with Sentinel-2 variables coupled with elevation, only marginally improved the performance of the model (OA: 73.0% and K: 0.66). The use of Sentinel-1 SAR data with elevation resulted in a reasonable OA of 57.5% and K of 0.47. These spatially explicit up-to-date SBW host species maps are essential for identifying susceptible forests, monitoring SBW defoliation, and minimizing forest losses from insect impacts at landscape scale in the current SBW outbreak in the region.

TI  - Factors Controlling Terminus Position of Hansbreen, a Tidewater Glacier in Svalbard
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE
M3  - Article
AB  - The mechanism of glacier recession and its climatic controls are complex processes that differ across the Arctic region. Here, we investigate factors influencing front variations of Hansbreen, a glacier terminated in Hornsund fjord (SW Svalbard). We apply remote sensing data to observe glacier front fluctuations between 1992 and 2015 and compare them to atmospheric and oceanographic data, sea water depth at the terminus and surface velocity. Rate of subglacial meltwater discharge approximated by the seasonal positive degree-day index (PDD) together with sea thermal conditions appear to be the main factors responsible for the fluctuations of the front of Hansbreen, while water depth at the front plays a secondary role. Taking into account ocean and air thermal conditions, the studied period has been divided into warm, cold and moderate years. The glacier retreated considerably throughout a bedrock overdeepening in the very warm period 2012-2014. This recession coincided with a slower ice flow due to intense subglacial runoff and increased submarine melting. The long-term retreat was interrupted by glacier advances in colder years, regardless of water depth at the front. The slower recession rate was the combined effect of decreased subglacial melting and increased glacier movement associated with lower subglacial runoff. Although the seasonal PDD is a good indicator of the front fluctuations, the duration of the retreat and advance periods are strongly correlated with the sea surface temperature. Expected climate warming and an increase of water temperature in the West Spitsbergen Current will stimulate further recession of Hansbreen in future.

TI  - Determining representative sample size for validation of continuous, large continental remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The validation of global remote sensing data comprises multiple methods including comparison to field measurements, cross-comparisons and verification of physical consistency. Physical consistency and cross-comparisons are typically assessed for all pixels of the entire product extent, which requires intensive computing. This paper proposes a statistically representative sampling approach to reduce time and efforts associated with validations of remote sensing data having big data volume. A progressive sampling approach, as typically applied in machine learning to train algorithms, combined with two performance measures, was applied to estimate the required sample size. The confidence interval (CI) and maximum entropy probability distribution were used as indicators to represent accuracy. The approach was tested on 8 continental remote sensing-based data products over the Middle East and Africa. Without the consideration of climate classes, a sample size of 10,000-100,000, dependent on the product, met the nominally set CI and entropy indicators. This corresponds to <0.01 % of the total image for the high-resolution images. All continuous datasets showed the same trend of CI and entropy with increasing sample size. The actual evapotranspiration and interception (ETIa) product was further analysed based on climate classes, which increased the sample size required to meet performance requirements, but was still determined to be significantly less than the entire dataset size. The proposed approach can significantly reduce the processing time while still providing a statistically valid representation of a large remote sensing dataset. This can be useful as more high-resolution remote sensing data becomes available.

TI  - Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasonography in the Diagnosis and Treatment Modulation of Breast Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - The aim of this paper is to highlight the role of contrast-enhanced ultrasound in breast cancer in terms of diagnosis, staging and follow-up of the post-treatment response. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is successfully used to diagnose multiple pathologies and has also clinical relevance in breast cancer. CEUS has high accuracy in differentiating benign from malignant lesions by analyzing the enhancement characteristics and calculating the time-intensity curve's quantitative parameters. It also has a significant role in axillary staging, especially when the lymph nodes are not suspicious on clinical examination and have a normal appearance on gray-scale ultrasound. The most significant clinical impact consists of predicting the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which offers the possibility of adjusting the therapy by dynamically evaluating the patient. CEUS is a high-performance, feasible, non-irradiating, accessible, easy-to-implement imaging method and has proven to be a valuable addition to breast ultrasound.

AB  - This paper compares the tropospheric moisture data records derived from High-resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) measurements from the years 2003 through 2013. Total Precipitable Water Vapor (TPW) and Upper Tropospheric Precipitable Water Vapor (UTPW) are derived using the infrared spectral bands in the CO2 and H2O absorption bands as well as in the atmospheric windows. Retrieval of TPW and UTPW uses a statistical regression algorithm performed using clear sky radiances (and Brightness Temperatures) measured over land and ocean for both day and night. The TPW and UTPW seasonal cycles of HIRS and MODIS observations are found to be in synchronization with zonal mean values for one degree latitude bands within 2.0 mm and 0.07 mm, respectively.

TI  - Challenges and outcomes in establishing a sentinel lymph node biopsy service for oral squamous cell carcinoma in a regional district specialist hospital
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF ORAL & MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - UK national guidelines in 2016 recommended that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) should be offered to patients with early oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). We review the establishment of an OSCC SLNB service with specific consideration to resources, service implications and patient outcomes. A review of processes was performed to identify key stages in establishing the service, and subsequently a retrospective cohort study consisting of 46 consecutive patients with T1/T2 N0 OSCC was undertaken. The key stages identified were: coordinating a nuclear medicine pathway and reliable cost-appropriate pathology service, constructing a Trust business case, and gaining approval of a new interventional service policy. A median (range) of 3.3 (1-8) sentinel nodes (SLN) were removed, with 17 patients having a positive SLN. The negative predictive value of SLNB was 100%, with 12 having a SLN outside the field if elective neck dissection (END) was planned. There was a significantly increased risk of a positive SLN with increasing depth of invasion (DOI) (p=0.007) and increased diameter (p=0.036). We also identified a longer-than-ideal time to completion neck dissection and inadequate ultrasound follow up of negative SLNB patients. Establishment of a service requires careful planning. Our results were in keeping with those reported in the literature, and showed that SLNB for OSCC has a high negative predictive value and can identify at-risk SLN outside the traditional END levels, even in well-lateralised tumours. Our findings show that DOI and size of SLN were significantly associated with a positive SLN, and also identified areas requiring improvement.

TI  - Potential of Sentinel-1 C-Band Time Series to Derive Structural Parameters of Temperate Deciduous Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the increasing occurrence of forest fires in the mid-latitudes and the alpine region, fire risk assessments become important in these regions. Fuel assessments involve the collection of information on forest structure as, e.g., the stand height or the stand density. The potential of airborne laser scanning (ALS) to provide accurate forest structure information has been demonstrated in several studies. Yet, flight acquisitions at the state level are carried out in intervals of typically five to ten years in Central Europe, which often makes the information outdated. The Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar mission provides freely accessible earth observation (EO) data with short revisit times of 6 days. Forest structure information derived from this data source could, therefore, be used to update the respective ALS descriptors. In our study, we investigated the potential of S-1 time series to derive stand height and fractional cover, which is a measure of the stand density, over a temperate deciduous forest in Austria. A random forest (RF) model was used for this task, which was trained using ALS-derived forest structure parameters from 2018. The comparison of the estimated mean stand height from S-1 time series with the ALS derived stand height shows a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.76 m and a bias of 0.09 m on a 100 m cell size, while fractional cover can be retrieved with an RMSE of 0.08 and a bias of 0.0. However, the predictions reveal a tendency to underestimate stand height and fractional cover for high-growing stands and dense areas, respectively. The stratified selection of the training set, which we investigated in order to achieve a more homogeneous distribution of the metrics for training, mitigates the underestimation tendency to some degree, yet, cannot fully eliminate it. We subsequently applied the trained model to S-1 time series of 2017 and 2019, respectively. The computed difference between the predictions suggests that large decreases in the forest height structure in this two-year interval become apparent from our RF-model, while inter-annual forest growth cannot be measured. The spatial patterns of the predicted forest height, however, are similar for both years (Pearson's R = 0.89). Therefore, we consider that S-1 time series in combination with machine learning techniques can be applied for the derivation of forest structure information in an operational way.

TI  - Evaluating disease outbreaks with syndromic surveillance using medical student clinical rotation patient encounter logs
T2  - JOURNAL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Context: While the data generated by medical students at schools that require electronic patient encounter logs is primarily used to monitor their training progress, it can also be a great source of public health data. Specifically, it can be used for syndromic surveillance, a method used to analyze instantaneous health data for early detection of disease outbreaks.Objective: To analyze how the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes input by medical students at the Edward Via College of Osteopathic Medicine into the Clinical Rotation Evaluation and Documentation Organizer (CREDO) patient encounter logging system could act as a new syndromic surveillance tool.Methods: A CREDO database query was conducted for ICD-10 codes entered between November 1, 2019 and March 13, 2020 using the World Health Organization's 2011 revised case definitions for Influenza Like Illness (ILI). During that period, medical students had an approximatedmean of 3,000 patient encounters per day from over 1,500 clinical sites. A cumulative sum technique was applied to the data to generate alert thresholds. Breast cancer, a disease with a stable incidence during the specified timeframe, was used as a control.Results: Total ILI daily ICD-10 counts that exceeded alert thresholds represented unusual levels of disease occurred 11 times from November 20, 2020 through February 28, 2020. This analysis is consistent with the COVID-19 pandemic timeline. The first statistically significant ILI increase occurred nine days prior to the first laboratory confirmed case in the country.Conclusion: Syndromic surveillance can be timelier than traditional surveillance methods, which require laboratory testing to confirm disease. As a result of this study, we are installing a real-time alert for ILI into CREDO, so rates can be monitored continuously as an indicator of possible future new infectious disease outbreaks.

TI  - Three Decades of Land Cover Change in East Africa
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Population growth rates in Sub-Saharan East Africa are among the highest in the world, creating increasing pressure for land cover conversion. To date, however, there has been no comprehensive assessment of regional land cover change, and most long-term trends have not yet been quantified. Using a designed sample of satellite-based observations of historical land cover change, we estimate the areas and trends in nine land cover classes from 1998 to 2017 in Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zambia. Our analysis found an 18,154,000 (+/- 1,580,000) ha, or 34.8%, increase in the area of cropland in East Africa. Conversion occurred primarily from Open Grasslands, Wooded Grasslands, and Open Forests, causing a large-scale reduction in woody vegetation classes. We observed far more conversion (by approximately 20 million hectares) of woody classes to less-woody classes than succession in the direction of increasing trees and shrubs. Spatial patterns within our sample highlight regional land cover conversion hotspots, such as the Central Zambezian Miombo Woodlands, as potential areas of concern related to the conservation of natural ecosystems. Our findings reflect a rapidly growing population that is moving into new areas, with a 43.5% increase in the area of Settlements over the three-decade period. Our results show the areas and ecoregions most impacted by three decades of human development, both spatially and statistically.

TI  - Maternal proximity to Central Appalachia surface mining and birth outcomes
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Maternal residency in Central Appalachia counties with coal production has been previously associated with increased rates of low birth weight (LBW). To refine the relationship between surface mining and birth outcomes, this study employs finer spatiotemporal estimates of exposure.Methods: We developed characterizations of annual surface mining boundaries in Central Appalachia between 1986 and 2015 using Landsat data. Maternal address on birth records was geocoded and assigned amount of surface mining within a 5 km radius of residence (street-level). Births were also assigned the amount of surface mining within residential ZIP code tabulation area (ZCTA). Associations between exposure to active mining during gestation year and birth weight, LBW, preterm birth (PTB), and term low birth weight (tLBW) were determined, adjusting for outcome rates before active mining and available covariates.Results: The percent of land actively mined within a 5 km buffer of residence (or ZCTA) was negatively associated with birth weight (5 km: beta = -14.07g; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -19.35, -8.79, P = 1.79 x 10(-7); ZCTA: beta = -9.93g; 95% CI = -12.54, -7.33, P = 7.94 x 10(-14)). We also found positive associations between PTB and active mining within 5 km (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.09, P = 1.43 x 10(-4)) and within ZCTA (OR = 1.04; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.06, P = 9.21 x 10(-8)). Positive relationships were also found between amount of active mining within 5 km or ZIP code of residence and LBW and tLBW outcomes.Conclusions: Maternal residency near active surface mining during gestation may increase risk of PTB and LBW.

TI  - Modelling Daily Gross Primary Productivity with Sentinel-2 Data in the Nordic Region-Comparison with Data from MODIS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The high-resolution Sentinel-2 data potentially enable the estimation of gross primary productivity (GPP) at finer spatial resolution by better capturing the spatial variation in a heterogeneous landscapes. This study investigates the potential of 10 m resolution reflectance from the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument to improve the accuracy of GPP estimation across Nordic vegetation types, compared with the 250 m and 500 m resolution reflectance from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). We applied linear regression models with inputs of two-band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) derived from Sentinel-2 and MODIS reflectance, respectively, together with various environmental drivers to estimate daily GPP at eight Nordic eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites. Compared with the GPP from EC measurements, the accuracies of modelled GPP were generally high (R-2 = 0.84 for Sentinel-2; R-2 = 0.83 for MODIS), and the differences between Sentinel-2 and MODIS were minimal. This demonstrates the general consistency in GPP estimates based on the two satellite sensor systems at the Nordic regional scale. On the other hand, the model accuracy did not improve by using the higher spatial-resolution Sentinel-2 data. More analyses of different model formulations, more tests of remotely sensed indices and biophysical parameters, and analyses across a wider range of geographical locations and times will be required to achieve improved GPP estimations from Sentinel-2 satellite data.

TI  - Decreased Anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions during the COVID-19 Pandemic Estimated from FTS and MAX-DOAS Measurements at Urban Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to ongoing reductions in economic activity and anthropogenic emissions. Beijing was particular badly affected by lockdown measures during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has significantly reduced the CO2 emission and toxic air pollution (CO and NO2). We use column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CO2 and CO (XCO2 and XCO) observed by a ground-based EM27/SUN Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS), the tropospheric NO2 column observed by MAX-DOAS and satellite remote sensing data (GOSAT and TROPOMI) to investigate the variations in anthropogenic CO2 emission related to COVID-19 lockdown in Beijing. The anomalies describe the spatio-temporal enhancement of gas concentration, which relates to the emission. Anomalies in XCO2 and XCO, and XNO2 (Delta XCO2, Delta XCO, and Delta XNO2) for ground-based measurements were calculated from the diurnal variability. Highly correlated daily XCO and XCO2 anomalies derived from FTS time series data provide the Delta XCO to Delta XCO2 ratio (the correlation slope). The Delta XCO to Delta XCO2 ratio in Beijing was lower in 2020 (8.2 ppb/ppm) than in 2019 (9.6 ppb/ppm). The Delta XCO to Delta XCO2 ratio originating from a polluted area was significantly lower in 2020. The reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emission was estimated to be 14.2% using FTS data. A comparable value reflecting the slowdown in growth of atmospheric CO2 over the same time period was estimated to be 15% in Beijing from the XCO2 anomaly from GOSAT, which was derived from the difference between the target area and the background area. The XCO anomaly from TROPOMI is reduced by 8.7% in 2020 compared with 2019, which is much smaller than the reduction in surface air pollution data (17%). Ground-based NO2 observation provides a 21.6% decline in NO2. The NO2 to CO2 correlation indicates a 38.2% decline in the CO2 traffic emission sector. Overall, the reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emission relating to COVID-19 lockdown in Beijing can be detected by the Bruker EM27/SUN Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) and MAX-DOAS in urban Beijing.

TI  - Within-city spatial and temporal heterogeneity of air temperature and its relationship with land surface temperature
T2  - LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using land surface temperatures (LST) derived from remotely sensed data, numerous studies have shown that not only urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas, but within urban areas, there are large spatial variations in temperature. Few studies, however, have investigated the spatial variation of air temperature within a city. Using air temperature data collected from 117 weather stations in Shenzhen for the year of 2017, we quantified the within-city spatial pattern of air temperature and its nocturnal and seasonal variability. We further investigated the quantitative relationship between air temperature and LST and compared their spatiotemporal patterns. We found that: 1) Air temperature varied greatly in space, showing very strong spatial heterogeneity and having large nocturnal and seasonal variability; 2) The spatial and temporal variation is more prominent during extreme heat days, during which the difference of hourly maximum temperature among stations could reach 8.7 degrees C around 16:00 and remain as high as 8.6 degrees C until 23:00, indicating that locations in cities with higher temperatures may suffer more intensive and longer excessive urban heat, and thereby global warming may exacerbate the difference in air temperature at the local scale; 3) LST had significantly positive correlations with air temperature, especially in the summer night, but their cool and hot spots did not always overlap in space. Results can enhance understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of the urban thermal environment and have practical implications on excessive urban heat mitigation and adaptation in an increasingly warming global climate.

TI  - Improved Radiometric and Spatial Capabilities of the Coastal Zone Imager Onboard Chinese HY-1C Satellite for Inland Lakes
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal zone imager (CZI) onboard HY-1C satellite provides a new data source to monitor the lake environments. Here, we provided a preliminary evaluation for the applications of CZI on inland lakes and a comparison with the in situ, Landsat-8 operational land imager (OLI), and Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI) measurements. First, the in-orbit signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were estimated based on homogenous ocean pixels. SNRs of CZI reached similar to 200:1 in the visible bands and similar to 150:1 at the near-infrared bands, which are comparable with the OLI and slightly higher than those of the MSI. Then, the performance of 6SV and fast line-of-sight atmospheric analysis of hypercubes (FLAASH) models on the retrievals of remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) from CZI measurements was evaluated. 6SV-derived R-rs showed higher accuracy than that of FLAASH, validated by the synchronous in situ (R-2 similar or equal to 0.50, absolute percent difference (APD) similar or equal to 20%) and OLI-derived R-rs (R-2 similar or equal to 0.75, APD similar or equal to 5%). Finally, the abilities of CZI to observe cyanobacterial bloom, suspended particular matter (SPM), and chlorophyll-a (Chla) were assessed. CZI-derived, the area of cyanobacterial bloom and SPM, showed good agreements with the results yielded by the OLI and MSI data on May 24, 2019, in Lake Taihu (R-2 = 0.68, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 9.68 mg/L, APD = 13.52% for SPM). While CZI only has four wide bands, Chla derived by CZI using an empirical algorithm was relatively consistent with MSI-derived values. CZI demonstrated a decent performance in monitoring the environments of large lakes, and it is expected to add the bands for atmospheric correction and further works in the small-medium lakes in the future.

TI  - Novelties of ultrasound imaging for endometrial cancer preoperative workup
T2  - MINERVA MEDICA
M3  - Review
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most frequent gynecological cancer. Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) plays a leading role in the preoperative workup and often is the first diagnostic instrumental examination. Despite expert hands' ultrasound is recommended to assess myometrial invasion in early stage EC, this method is a strictly operatordependent examination, and varying degrees of sensitivity and specificity have been reported. The present review aims to provide an update of ultrasound imaging in the preoperative work-up for EC patients.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A double-blind search was performed from May to September 2020. The following keywords: "ultrasound," "transvaginal ultrasound" and "endometrial cancer" were searched in Pubmed search engines, Scopus, and Web of Science. The Prisma statement was followed for the selection of the articles included.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: The initial search provided 958 studies, of which 11 were included in the analysis. non-English articles, not relevant to the purposes of this study, case reports and articles with fewer than 40 cases were excluded.CONCLUSIONS: TVU sensitivity and specificity in myometrial infiltration and cervical invasion is comparable to MRI but has lower costs, greater patient tolerability, and does not require contrast agents. An expert operator should perform the ultrasound examination in patients with suspected EC The presence of myometrial lesions, such as leiomyomas, could lower the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound, so special attention should be paid to patients with concomitant uterine lesions.

TI  - A Forecast Model Applied to Monitor Crops Dynamics Using Vegetation Indices (NDVI)
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation dynamics is very sensitive to environmental changes, particularly in arid zones where climate change is more prominent. Therefore, it is very important to investigate the response of this dynamics to those changes and understand its evolution according to different climatic factors. Remote sensing techniques provide an effective system to monitor vegetation dynamics on multiple scales using vegetation indices (VI), calculated from remote sensing reflectance measurements in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In this study, we use the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), provided from the MOD13Q1 V006 at 250 m spatial resolution product derived from the MODIS sensor. NDVI is frequent in studies related to vegetation mapping, crop state indicator, biomass estimator, drought monitoring and evapotranspiration. In this paper, we use a combination of forecasts to perform time series models and predict NDVI time series derived from optical remote sensing data. The proposed ensemble is constructed using forecasting models based on time series analysis, such as Double Exponential Smoothing and autoregressive integrated moving average with explanatory variables for a better prediction performance. The method is validated using different maize plots and one olive plot. The results after combining different models show the positive influence of several weather measures, namely, temperature, precipitation, humidity and radiation.

TI  - Surface Albedo Retrieval from 40-Years of Earth Observations through the EUMETSAT/LSA SAF and EU/C3S Programmes: The Versatile Algorithm of PYALUS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface albedo quantifies the fraction of the sunlight reflected by the surface of the Earth. This article presents the algorithm concepts for the remote sensing of this variable based on the heritage of several developments which were performed at Meteo France over the last decade and described in several papers by Carrer et al. The scientific algorithm comprises four steps: an atmospheric correction, a sensor harmonisation (optional), a BRDF (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function) inversion, and the albedo calculation. At the time being, the method has been applied to 11 sensors in the framework of two European initiatives (Satellite Application Facility on Land Surface Analysis-LSA SAF, and Copernicus Climate Change Service-C3S): NOAA-7-9-11-14-16-17/AVHRR2-3, SPOT/VGT1-2, Metop/AVHRR-3, PROBA-V, and MSG/SEVIRI. This work leads to a consistent archive of almost 40 years of satellite-derived albedo data (available in 2020). From a single sensor, up to three different albedo products with different characteristics have been developed to address the requirements of both, near real-time (NRT) (weather prediction with a demand of timeliness of 1 h) and climate communities. The evaluation of the algorithm applied to different platforms was recently made by Lellouch et al. and Sanchez Zapero et al. in 2020 which can be considered as companion papers. After a summary of the method for the retrieval of these surface albedos, this article describes the specificities of each retrieval, lists the differences, and discusses the limitations. The plan of continuity with the next European satellite missions and perspectives of improvements are introduced. For example, Metop/AVHRR-3 albedo will soon become the medium resolution sensor product with the longest NRT data record, since MODIS is approaching the end of its life-cycle. Additionally, Metop-SG/METimage will ensure its continuity thanks to consistent production of data sets guaranteed till 2050 by the member states of the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT). In the end, the common strategy which we proposed through the different programmes may offer an unprecedented opportunity to study the temporal trends affecting surface properties and to analyse human-induced climate change. Finally, the access to the source code (called PYALUS) is provided through an open access platform in order to share with the community the expertise on the satellite retrieval of this variable.

TI  - Displacement Analysis of Geothermal Field Based on PSInSAR And SOM Clustering Algorithms A Case Study of Brady Field, Nevada-USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of free and high temporal resolution satellite data and advanced SAR techniques allows us to analyze ground displacement cost-effectively. Our aim was to properly define subsidence and uplift areas to delineate a geothermal field and perform time-series analysis to identify temporal trends. A Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) algorithm was used to estimate vertical displacement in the Brady geothermal field located in Nevada by analyzing 70 Sentinel-1A Synthetic-Aperture Radar (SAR) images, between January 2017 and December 2019. To classify zones affected by displacement, an unsupervised Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm was applied to classify points based on their behavior in time, and those clusters were used to determine subsidence, uplift, and stable regions automatically. Finally, time-series analysis was applied to the clustered data to understand the inflection dates. The maximum subsidence is -19 mm/yr with an average value of -6 mm/yr within the geothermal field. The maximum uplift is 14 mm/yr with an average value of 4 mm/yr within the geothermal field. The uplift occurred on the NE of the field, where the injection wells are located. On the other hand, subsidence is concentrated on the SW of the field where the production wells are located. The coupling of the PSInSAR and the SOM algorithms was shown to be effective in analyzing the direction and pattern of the displacements observed in the field.

TI  - Cross-Shore Flow and Implications for Carbon Export in the California Current Ecosystem: A Lagrangian Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Eastern Boundary Current Upwelling Systems are regions of elevated primary production and carbon export and thus play a central role in the global carbon cycle. In these regions, nutrient upwelling occurs in a narrow region close to the coast, but primary production and carbon export are typically observed across a broader region. The fact that productive waters reach the open ocean has important consequences for the biological carbon pump, because such transport connects nutrient sources close to the coast to the deep carbon sinks of the offshore ocean. However, many aspects of this offshore transport are still not known. Here we address seasonal and interannual variability of upwelling-related cross-shore flows in the California current ecosystem (CCE) by employing Lagrangian diagnostics of horizontal transport inferred from satellite data. We define an advective age as the time a water parcel flowed offshore of the 500 m isobath. We find that the offshore extension of high Chl-a waters covaries with the age of a coastal water parcel, and is consistent with mesoscale circulation. Interannual variability in the offshore extent of older waters is primarily driven by mesoscale variability and covaries with large scale forcing by both ENSO and the NPGO. The measured ratio of in-situ new production: carbon export also covaries with water age, and tends to be 1 in younger and more balanced in older waters. Our results may help to parameterize the role of the finescale on the export of carbon in upwelling regions for climate resolving models.Plain Language Summary The California current ecosystem (CCE) is a region of strong coastal upwelling, elevated organic matter production and high carbon flux into the deep ocean, and potentially influential in the global carbon cycle. Previous studies have suggested that production and sinking are not balanced in the CCE: there is more production than sinking close to the coast and more sinking than production offshore. Our study uses satellite measurements to analyze cross-shore flows in the CCE and assess whether horizontal transport of water, nutrients, and plankton can reconcile this spatial imbalance. By following water parcel trajectories, we find that the time since a water parcel is transported from the coast to the offshore is a predictor of whether the water parcel is a net source of organic matter (greater new production than sinking) or a net sink (greater sinking than new production). We find that the offshore distance of water transport varies strongly from year to year and is related to known sources of climate forcing, including El Nino-Southern Oscillation and the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. Future organic matter exchanges between the coast and the offshore can be estimated thanks to covariability with these climate indices.

TI  - A Practical Satellite-Derived Vegetation Drought Index for Arid and Semi-Arid Grassland Drought Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In semi-arid pasture areas, drought may directly influence livestock production, cause economic losses, and accelerate the processes of desertification along with destructive human activities (i.e., overgrazing). The aim of this article is to analyze the disadvantages of several drought indices derived from remote sensing data and develop a new vegetation drought index (VDI) for monitoring of grassland drought with high temporal frequency (dekad) and fine spatial resolution (1 km). The site-based soil moisture data from the field campaign in 2014 and the fenced biomass values at nine sites from 2000 to 2015 were adopted for validation. The results indicate that the proposed VDI would better reflect the extent, severity, and changes of drought compared with single drought indices or the vegetation health index (VHI); specifically, the VDI is more closely related to site-based soil moisture, with R human increasing to approximately 0.07 compared with the VHI; and with normalized fenced biomass (NFB) values, with average R human increasing to approximately 0.11 compared with the VHI. However, the correlations between VHI and VDI with NFB values are relatively lower in desert steppe regions. Furthermore, regional drought-affected data (RDA) are used to ensure spatial consistency of the evaluation; the VDI map is in good agreement with the RDA map based on field measurements. The presented VDI shows reliable and stable drought monitoring ability, which will play an important role in the future drought monitoring of inland grassland.

TI  - Long-term exposures to ambient PM<sub>1</sub> and NO<sub>2</sub> pollution in relation to mild cognitive impairment of male veterans in China
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage of cognitive decline between normal ageing and dementia or Alzheimer's disease in the elderly. However, evidence is very limited in China for the association between air pollution and MCI. This study aims to examine the associations of long-term exposure to air pollution and MCI, using data from the Chinese Veteran Clinical Research Platform. A national investigation on mental health of veterans was conducted in 277 veteran communities in 18 cities across China. In total, 1,861 MCI cases and 3,188 controls were randomly selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy from December 2009 to December 2011. Participants' cognitive function was first assessed using the Mini Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in the Chinese version, and then further confirmed by clinical examination. Participants' mean exposures to PM1 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 1 mu m) and NO2 (nitrogen dioxide) during the 3 years before the investigation were estimated using satellite remote sensing data, meteorological variables and land use information. The association between historical exposure to air pollution and MCI was examined using Logistic regression. After controlling for individual-level and regional-level confounders, we found historical exposures to PM1 and NO2 significantly increased the risk of MCI. The odds ratios (ORs associated with per 10 mu g m(-3) increase in air pollution) and 95% confidence intervals for PM1 and NO2 were 1.08 (1.04, 1.13) and 1.07 (1.02, 1.13), respectively. In the multi-pollutant models, higher OR for PM1 while lower OR for NO2 were observed compared to single-pollutant models. High levels of PM1 and NO2 pollution significantly increased the risk of cognitive decline among male veterans in China. Given the causal air pollution-MCI relationship, good air quality may help to reduce the burden of mental disorders among elderly veterans in China.

TI  - The evapotranspiration and environmental controls of typical underlying surfaces on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - SCIENCES IN COLD AND ARID REGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - To reveal the characteristics of evapotranspiration and environmental control factors of typical underlying surfaces (alpine wetland and alpine meadow) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, a comprehensive study was performed via in situ observations and remote sensing data in the growing season and non-growing season. Evapotranspiration was positively correlated with precipitation, the decoupling coefficient, and the enhanced vegetation index, but was energy-limited and mainly controlled by the vapor pressure deficit and solar radiation at an annual scale and growing season scale, respectively. Compared with the non-growing season, monthly evapotranspiration, equilibrium evaporation, and decoupling coefficient were greater in the growing season due to lower vegetation resistance and considerable precipitation. However, these factors were restricted in the alpine meadow. The decoupling factor was more sensitive to changes of conductance in the alpine wetland. This study is of great significance for understanding hydro-meteorological processes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - Estimating seasonal water budgets in global lakes by using multi-source remote sensing measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal change in lake water storage (LWSsc) reflect periodic fluctuations of the basin-scale water balance. However, the role of LWSsc in regulating the water budget at the global scale has not yet been investigated based on straight-forward observations. Quantifying LWSsc is necessary, especially under the context of global change. Available in-situ measurements of lake water levels and volumes are still scarce. Therefore, the Global Surface Water datasets of Joint Research Centre and multi-source satellite altimetry datasets through mathematical statistics methods are used in this study to address this issue. We estimate the LWSsc of 463 lakes and reservoirs worldwide with areas greater than 10 km(2), which represent nearly 64% of the total global lake area and 93% of the total lake volume capacity. Results show that the global seasonal water storage variation of these examined water bodies is 1390.91 +/- 78.91 km(3), comprising 869.44 +/- 67.35 km(3) from lakes and 521.46 +/- 41.11 km(3) from reservoirs. The relatively large estimates of LWSsc are concentrated in North American and African basins. Among the watersheds, the seasonal fluctuations of lakes in the North American Lawrence basin make up the most substantial magnitude of 10.76% of the global LWSsc. The latitudinal direction zonality of LWSsc is relatively significant. The LWSsc is concentrated between 30 degrees N and 60 degrees N in the northern hemisphere and between the equator and 30 degrees S in the southern hemisphere. Considering the geographic similarity and climatological zonality, the global LWSsc estimates are also extrapolated to other lakes without direct satellite altimetry observations on the basis of the average rate of the examined lakes distributed in the same Koppen Geiger Climate Classification zones. The LWSsc is calculated with a consequence of 488.23 +/- 14.72 km(3) for these extrapolated lakes, indicating an estimate of 1357.67 +/- 68.94 km(3) for the LWSsc of the global natural lakes (>10 km2). This initial estimation of LWSsc at a global scale will greatly help the improvement of our understanding of the seasonal behavior of lakes and reservoirs in regulating global and regional water cycles and the contribution of terrestrial water storage to sea level rise.

TI  - Combining Sentinel-1 Interferometry and Ground-Based Geomatics Techniques for Monitoring Buildings Affected by Mass Movements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mass movements represent a serious threat to the stability of human structures and infrastructures, and cause loss of lives and severe damages to human properties every year worldwide. Built structures located on potentially unstable slopes are susceptible to deformations due to the displacement of the ground that at worst can lead to total destruction. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data acquired by Sentinel-1 satellites and processed by multi-temporal interferometric SAR (MT-InSAR) techniques can measure centimeter to millimeter-level displacement with weekly to monthly updates, characterizing long-term large-scale behavior of the buildings and slopes. However, the spatial resolution and short wavelength weaken the performance of Sentinel-1 in recognizing features (i.e., single buildings) inside image pixels and maintaining the coherence in mountainous vegetated areas. We have proposed and applied a methodology that combines Sentinel-1 interferometry with ground-based geomatics techniques, i.e., global navigation satellite system (GNSS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and terrestrial structure from motion photogrammetry (SfM), for fully assessing building deformations on a slope located in the north-eastern Italian pre-Alps. GNSS allows verifying the ground deformation estimated by MT-InSAR and provides a reference system for the TLS and SfM measurements, while TLS and SfM allow the behavior of buildings located in the investigated slope to be monitored in great detail. The obtained results show that damaged buildings are located in the most unstable sectors of the slope, but there is no direct relationship between the rate of ground deformation of these sectors and the temporal evolution of damages to a single building, indicating that mass movements cause the displacement of blocks of buildings and each of them reacts differently according to its structural properties. This work shows the capability of MT-InSAR, GNSS, TLS and SfM in monitoring both buildings and geological processes that affect their stability, which plays a key role in geohazard analysis and assessment.

TI  - Estimating Pasture Biomass Using Sentinel-2 Imagery and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective dairy farm management requires the regular estimation and prediction of pasture biomass. This study explored the suitability of high spatio-temporal resolution Sentinel-2 imagery and the applicability of advanced machine learning techniques for estimating aboveground biomass at the paddock level in five dairy farms across northern Tasmania, Australia. A sequential neural network model was developed by integrating Sentinel-2 time-series data, weekly field biomass observations and daily climate variables from 2017 to 2018. Linear least-squares regression was employed for evaluating the results for model calibration and validation. Optimal model performance was realised with an R-2 of approximate to 0.6, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of approximate to 356 kg dry matter (DM)/ha and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 262 kg DM/ha. These performance markers indicated the results were within the variability of the pasture biomass measured in the field, and therefore represent a relatively high prediction accuracy. Sensitivity analysis further revealed what impact each farm's in situ measurement, pasture management and grazing practices have on the model's predictions. The study demonstrated the potential benefits and feasibility of improving biomass estimation in a cheap and rapid manner over traditional field measurement and commonly used remote-sensing methods. The proposed approach will help farmers and policymakers to estimate the amount of pasture present for optimising grazing management and improving decision-making regarding dairy farming.

TI  - Neural Network Approach to Retrieving Ocean Subsurface Temperatures from Surface Parameters Observed by Satellites
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The extraction of physical information about the subsurface ocean from surface information obtained from satellite measurements is both important and challenging. We introduce a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) method to determine the subsurface temperature of the North Pacific Ocean by selecting the optimum input combination of sea surface parameters obtained from satellite measurements. In addition to sea surface height (SSH), sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface salinity (SSS) and sea surface wind (SSW), we also included the sea surface velocity (SSV) as a new component in our study. This allowed us to partially resolve the non-linear subsurface dynamics associated with advection, which improved the estimated results, especially in regions with strong currents. The accuracy of the estimated results was verified with reprocessed observational datasets. Our results show that the BPNN model can accurately estimate the subsurface (upper 1000 m) temperature of the North Pacific Ocean. The corresponding mean square errors were 0.868 and 0.802 using four (SSH, SST, SSS and SSW) and five (SSH, SST, SSS, SSW and SSV) input parameters and the average coefficients of determination were 0.952 and 0.967, respectively. The input of the SSV in addition to the SSH, SST, SSS and SSW therefore has a positive impact on the BPNN model and helps to improve the accuracy of the estimation. This study provides important technical support for retrieving thermal information about the ocean interior from surface satellite remote sensing observations, which will help to expand the scope of satellite measurements of the ocean.

TI  - Assessing land degradation induced by recreational activities in the Algodones Dunes, California using MODIS satellite imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigated spatial and temporal environmental changes associated with climatic variability and off-highway vehicle (OHV) activity in the Algodones Dunes, California, using time-series analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer imagery from 2001 to 2016. We compared changes in land cover, surface albedo, and surface temperatures between the Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area (ISDRA) and areas with no OHV activity in the North Algodones Dunes Wilderness area (NADW). Both areas showed a decreasing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and an increasing albedo from 2001 to 2016; however, ISDRA had a lower NDVI value and higher albedo compared to the adjacent NADW. Transects across these adjoining areas revealed substantial differences in daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures. ISDRA had an appreciably higher mean daytime temperature and a lower mean nighttime temperature compared to those within NADW. Results suggest direct association between increasing OHV activity and reduced vegetation cover, increased soil exposure, and higher daytime temperatures in the Algodones Dunes. We recommend enhanced monitoring of ecosystem and land use changes coupled with enhanced land use management to reduce the contributions of recreational OHV activity on land degradation and to maintain habitat for key species and ecosystems of interest in the dune field.

M3  - Editorial Material
AB  - A 70-year-old man had a posterior left thigh lesion confirmed to be biopsy-proven melanoma. The patient underwent wide excision and sentinel node biopsy, which showed absence of residual melanoma. Two years later, the patient noticed a subcentimeter subcutaneous lump in his thigh. Repeat excisional biopsy showed involvement of the surrounding soft tissue, consistent with a satellite lesion. Follow-up combined PET/CT revealed satellite nodules around the primary lesion, enabling confirmation of subcutaneous metastatic disease.The patient was subsequently started on nivolumab, an anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks PD-1 and is approved as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced metastatic melanoma. On the baseline scan prior to starting nivolumab, there were no CT findings that suggested metastatic disease, nor were there enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. Five months after initiation of nivolumab treatment, the first follow-up chest CT scan was performed and showed new findings in the mediastinum and bilateral lungs. The patient remained asymptomatic during the treatment period. Furthermore, the subcutaneous metastatic disease remained stable during the treatment period, and no other site of metastatic disease was noted on follow-up CT scans obtained during the first 5 months of treatment.The patient had no prior history of infectious or occupational exposures. During the nivolumab treatment cycle, his pertinent laboratory values and physical examination findings were unremarkable.

TI  - Pure Ductal Carcinoma In Situ of the Breast: Analysis of 270 Consecutive Patients Treated in a 9-Year Period
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Simple SummaryDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) accounts for 20 to 25% of all breast cancers and its incidence of progression to invasive ductal carcinoma is at least 13 to 50%. The aim of our retrospective observational analysis is to review the issues of this histological type of cancer. We confirmed in a wide population of 270 consecutive patients who underwent surgery in a single institute that the management of DCIS can be difficult and particularly complex. There are many variables to be taken into consideration such as the choice of the diagnostic and bioptical technique. This delicate management must be carried out in specialized centres such as Breast Units involving multiple professional figures to define and guarantee the best possible treatment for each patient.Introduction: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is an intraductal neoplastic proliferation of epithelial cells that are confined within the basement membrane of the breast ductal system. This retrospective observational analysis aims at reviewing the issues of this histological type of cancer. Materials and methods: Patients treated for DCIS between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2018 were identified from a retrospective database. The patients were divided into two groups of 5 years each, the first group including patients treated from 2009 to 2013, and the second group including patients treated from 2014 to 2018. Once the database was completed, we performed a statistical analysis to see if there were significant differences among the 2 periods. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism software for Windows, and the level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Results: 3586 female patients were treated for breast cancer over the 9-year study period (1469 patients from 2009 to 2013 and 2117 from 2014 to 2018), of which 270 (7.53%) had pure DCIS in the final pathology. The median age of diagnosis was 59-year-old (range 36-86). In the first period, 81 (5.5%) women out of 1469 had DCIS in the final pathology, in the second, 189 (8.9%) out of 2117 had DCIS in the final pathology with a statistically significant increase (p = 0.0001). From 2009 to 2013, only 38 (46.9%) were in stage 0 (correct DCIS diagnosis) while in the second period, 125 (66.1%) were included in this stage. The number of patients included in clinical stage 0 increased significantly (p = 0.004). In the first period, 48 (59.3%) specimen margins were at a greater or equal distance than 2 mm (negative margins), between 2014 and 2018; 137 (72.5%) had negative margins. Between 2014 and 2018 the number of DCIS patients with positive margins decreased significantly (p = 0.02) compared to the first period examined. The mastectomies number increased significantly (p = 0.008) between the 2 periods, while the sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) numbers had no differences (p = 0.29). For both periods analysed all the 253 patients who underwent the follow up are currently living and free of disease. We have conventionally excluded the 17 patients whose data were lost. Conclusion: The choice of the newest imaging techniques and the most suitable biopsy method allows a better pre-operative diagnosis of the DCIS. Surgical treatment must be targeted to the patient and a multidisciplinary approach discussed in the Breast Unit centres.

TI  - Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor Scene Select Mechanism Open Loop Operations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 8 (L8) spacecraft and its two instruments, the operational land imager (OLI) and thermal infrared sensor (TIRS), have been consistently characterized and calibrated since its launch in February 2013. These performance metrics and calibration updates are determined through the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Landsat image assessment system (IAS), which has been performing this function since its launch. The TIRS on-orbit geometric calibration procedures include TIRS-to-OLI alignment, TIRS sensor chip assembly (SCA) alignment, and TIRS band alignment. In December 2014, the TIRS instrument experienced an anomalous condition related to the instrument's ability to accurately measure the location of the scene select mechanism (SSM). The SSM is a rotating mirror that allows the instrument's field of view to be pointed at the Earth, for normal imaging, or at either deep space or an onboard black body, for radiometric calibration purposes. This anomalous condition in the SSM's position sensor made it necessary to implement a new mode of operation for this mirror, termed mode-0. Mode-0 involves operating the mirror in an open-loop control state during normal mission operations when acquiring Earth data. Closed-loop mode-4 is needed for directing the mirror towards the radiometric calibration targets and is used approximately once every two weeks to collect radiometric calibration data. Mode-0 is used for most operational imaging because it does not require SSM encoder data, thereby allowing the SSM encoder electronics to remain unpowered most of the time, reducing its use throughout the lifetime of the TIRS instrument, thus helping to preserve its nominal behavior during it use. This paper discusses the geometric calibration of the SSM mirror during its current normal mode-0 set of image operations, as its open-loop control allows the mirror to drift over time in its uncontrolled state and its effects on products. The results shown in this paper demonstrate that the ability to have ongoing updates to the modeling of the TIRS SSM mirror model, in both an automated fashion and with a set of more manual operations, allows accuracy that approaches mode-4 results within days from the start of a mode-0 event.

TI  - Usefulness of Global Root Zone Soil Moisture Product for Streamflow Prediction of Ungauged Basins
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Using modelling approaches to predict stream flow from ungauged basins requires new model calibration strategies and evaluation methods that are different from the existing ones. Soil moisture information plays an important role in hydrological applications in basins. Increased availability of remote sensing data presents a significant opportunity to obtain the predictive performance of hydrological models (especially in ungauged basins), but there is still a limit to applying remote sensing soil moisture data directly to models. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission provides global soil moisture data estimated by assimilating remotely sensed brightness temperature to a land surface model. This study investigates the potential of a hydrological model calibrated using only global root zone soil moisture based on satellite observation when attempting to predict stream flow in ungauged basins. This approach's advantage is that it is particularly useful for stream flow prediction in ungauged basins since it does not require observed stream flow data to calibrate a model. The modelling experiments were carried out on upstream watersheds of two dams in South Korea with high-quality stream flow data. The resulting model outputs when calibrated using soil moisture data without observed stream flow data are particularly impressive when simulating monthly stream flows upstream of the dams, and daily stream flows also showed a satisfactory level of predictive performance. In particular, the model calibrated using soil moisture data for dry years showed better predictive performance than for wet years. The performance of the model calibrated using soil moisture data was significantly improved under low flow conditions compared to the traditional regionalization approach. Additionally, the overall stream flow was also predicted better. In addition, the uncertainty of the model calibrated using soil moisture was not much different from that of the model calibrated using observed stream flow data, and showed more robust outputs when compared to the traditional regionalization approach. These results prove that the application of the global soil moisture product for predicting stream flows in ungauged basins is promising.

TI  - Comparison of Land Surface Temperature Algorithm Using Landsat-8 Data for South Korea
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land Surface Temperature (LST) is the radiological surface temperature which observed by satellite. It is very important factor to estimate condition of the Earth such as Global warming and Heat island. For these reasons, many countries operate their own satellite to observe the Earth condition.South Korea has many landcovers such as forest, crop land, urban. Therefore, if we want to retrieve accurate LST, we would use high-resolution satellite data.In this study, we made LSTs with 4 LST retrieval algorithms which are used widely with Landsat-8 data which has 30 m spatial resolution. We retrieved LST using equations of Price, Becker et al. Prata, Coll et al. and they showed very similar spatial distribution. We validated 4 LSTs with Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST data to find the most suitable algorithm. As a result, every LST shows 2.160 similar to 3.387 K of RMSE. And LST by Prata algorithm show the lowest RMSE than others. With this validation result, we choose LST by Prata algorithm as the most suitable LST to South Korea

An Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET)-based aerosol-type dataset was used as a target variable in a random forest (RF) model. The contributions of satellite input variables to the RF-based model were quantified to determine an optimal set of input variables. The new method, based on inputs of satellite variables, allows the classification of seven aerosol types: pure dust, dust-dominant mixed, pollution-dominant mixed aerosols, and pollution aerosols (strongly, moderately, weakly, and non-absorbing). The performance of the model was statistically evaluated using AERONET data excluded from the model training dataset. Model accuracy for classifying the seven aerosol types was 59%, improving to 72% for four types (pure dust, dust-dominant mixed, strongly absorbing, and non-absorbing). The performance of the model was evaluated against an earlier aerosol classification method based on the wavelength dependence of single-scattering albedo (SSA) and fine-mode-fraction values from AERONET. Typical wavelength dependences of SSA for individual aerosol types are consistent with those obtained for aerosol types by the new method. This study demonstrates that an RF-based model is capable of satellite aerosol classification with sensitivity to the contribution of non-spherical particles.

TI  - A Response of Snow Cover to the Climate in the Northwest Himalaya (NWH) Using Satellite Products
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Himalayan region is one of the most crucial mountain systems across the globe, which has significant importance in terms of the largest depository of snow and glaciers for fresh water supply, river runoff, hydropower, rich biodiversity, climate, and many more socioeconomic developments. This region directly or indirectly affects millions of lives and their livelihoods but has been considered one of the most climatically sensitive parts of the world. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variation in maximum extent of snow cover area (SCA) and its response to temperature, precipitation, and elevation over the northwest Himalaya (NWH) during 2000-2019. The analysis uses Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Terra 8-day composite snow Cover product (MOD10A2), MODIS/Terra/V6 daily land surface temperature product (MOD11A1), Climate Hazards Infrared Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) precipitation product, and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM product for the investigation. Modified Mann-Kendall (mMK) test and Spearman's correlation methods were employed to examine the trends and the interrelationships between SCA and climatic parameters. Results indicate a significant increasing trend in annual mean SCA (663.88 km(2)/year) between 2000 and 2019. The seasonal and monthly analyses were also carried out for the study region. The Zone-wise analysis showed that the lower Himalaya (184.5 km(2)/year) and the middle Himalaya (232.1 km(2)/year) revealed significant increasing mean annual SCA trends. In contrast, the upper Himalaya showed no trend during the study period over the NWH region. Statistically significant negative correlation (-0.81) was observed between annual SCA and temperature, whereas a nonsignificant positive correlation (0.47) existed between annual SCA and precipitation in the past 20 years. It was also noticed that the SCA variability over the past 20 years has mainly been driven by temperature, whereas the influence of precipitation has been limited. A decline in average annual temperature (-0.039 degrees C/year) and a rise in precipitation (24.56 mm/year) was detected over the region. The results indicate that climate plays a vital role in controlling the SCA over the NWH region. The maximum and minimum snow cover frequency (SCF) was observed during the winter (74.42%) and monsoon (46.01%) season, respectively, while the average SCF was recorded to be 59.11% during the study period. Of the SCA, 54.81% had a SCF above 60% and could be considered as the perennial snow. The elevation-based analysis showed that 84% of the upper Himalaya (UH) experienced perennial snow, while the seasonal snow mostly dominated over the lower Himalaya (LH) and the middle Himalaya (MH).

TI  - Estimation of land-use/land-cover changes associated with energy footprints and other disturbance agents in the Upper Peace Region of Alberta Canada from 1985 to 2015 using Landsat data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantification of Land-Use and Land-Cover (LULC) changes associated with energy extraction footprints plays an important role in reclamation performance assessment, compliance monitoring, and sustainable land management practices. For regulatory planning and decision making purposes, it is crucial to understand the types and representation of disturbance present on the landscape related to energy footprints (i.e., oil, gas, and coal mining activities), non-energy footprints (i.e., other infrastructure), cutblocks, and wildfire. In this study, Landsat multispectral datasets were analysed using advanced classification and unmixing algorithms to calculate LULC changes associated with these disturbance agents from 1985 to 2015 in the Upper Peace Region, one of the major oil and gas exploration sites in Alberta, Canada. Based on 5-year intervals throughout this 30-year study, seven epochal LULC maps and a cumulative land disturbance map were produced with 82 % and 89 % overall accuracies, respectively, based on extensive and multisource, independent validation. Assessment of multiple disturbance regimes and time-series trajectories with high accuracies in this complex environment was vital to document and quantify disturbance, vegetation re-establishment, succession, and reclamation. Results indicate that more than 60 % forest loss (coniferous and deciduous) occurred due to harvesting and less than 20 % forest loss occurred due to energy and non-energy footprints. An assessment of the current state showed 40-60 % of cutblocks and burned areas returned as immature forest and wetland and 15-20 % recovered to forest, accounting for successional processes that take time for the re-establishment of trees following disturbance. Out of total energy footprints, 8 % recovered as shrubland and 16 % recovered as forest, with almost no sign of vegetation recovery evident in non-energy footprints (e.g., urban and long term industrial land use). The highest area of land disturbance (3412 km(2)) was over coniferous forest with 5-year disturbance areas of 55 km(2), 65 km(2), 70 km(2), and 295 km(2), associated with, respectively, wildfire, energy development, non-energy footprints, and harvesting. This type of LULC investigation informs land-use threshold management for energy footprints by identifying and partitioning key disturbance agents into land use. Knowledge of change type and land use enables insights on long term implications of the changes present and serves to guide sustainable development, environmental protection, and informing forward looking land use future state simulations.

TI  - Present-day land subsidence rates, surface faulting hazard and risk in Mexico City with 2014-2020 Sentinel-1 IW InSAR
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Among the fastest sinking cities globally, the metropolitan area of Mexico City is the target of an unprecedented satellite investigation based on over 300 Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Interferometric Wide swath mode scenes acquired in 2014-2020. Two-pass differential Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and the parallelized Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) repeat-pass InSAR approach provide a complete account of spatial patterns, long-term trend and present-day settlement rates affecting the city. The 3D deformation field reveals that foremost is the role of the vertical velocity V-U, with peaks of -38.7 cm/year in Nezahualcoyotl, -32.0 cm/year in Gustavo A. Madero and Venustiano Carranza, and -39.1 cm/year in Iztapalapa. Settlement at the metropolitan Cathedral in Cuauhte ' moc is ongoing at up to -8.8 cm/year, consistently with the last six decades. Volcanic edifices mark ground stability "islets" inside the main subsidence bowls. East-west rates are limited, except for some horizontal strain (up to +/- 5 cm/year) within the subsidence bowls. Comparison with surface geology and geotechnical zoning confirms that aquitard compaction is the predominant process. The power relationship between V-U [cm/year] and the thickness of lacustrine clay deposits H-C [m] is: V-U = 1/76*H-C(1.8). The 2019-2020 deformation scenario shows that subsidence still involves most of Nezahualcoyotl, with -3.0 cm/month VU. A well-defined long-term deformation behaviour comes out from 2014-2019 InSAR time series and comparison with 2008-2020 GPS data. RMSE of 0.9 cm is found at MMX1 station deployed within the lacustrine unit, and 0.6 cm at TNGF station onto hard volcanic rocks. The sharpest subsidence gradients and angular distortions beta in 2017-2019 (up to over 1/400, i.e. 0.14 degrees) - thus the greatest vulnerability to surface faulting and cracking as a consequence of large tensile stress in the soil caused by differential settlement - are found at the foothills of Sierra de Santa Catarina, Penon del Marques, Cerro Chimalhuachi, Penon de los Banos and Sierra de Chichinautzin, where the transition unit is narrower (or absent). Faults and cracks develop where beta > 1/3000, i.e. 0.03%, in 2017-2019. The observed width of the influence zone (i.e. damage band), where beta is still significant to induce damage, is 250 m. Differential settlement and surface faulting could compromise the serviceability of housing and utility infrastructure. It is estimated that over 457,000 properties and 1.5 million inhabitants of the Valley of Mexico Metropolitan Area (ZMVM) are in zones at high to very high surface faulting risk, mainly in Iztapalapa, Tlahuac, Chimalhuacan and Chalco. Increased flood exposure due to formation of topographic depressions involves over 751,000 properties and -2.7 million inhabitants of the ZMVM, mainly in Nezahualcoyotl, Tlahuac, Venustiano Carranza, Iztapalapa, Gustavo A. Madero and Ecatepec de Morelos. These municipalities are often hit by catastrophic floods.

TI  - Exploitation of a New Short-Term Multimodel Photovoltaic Power Forecasting Method in the Very Short-Term Horizon to Derive a Multi-Time Scale Forecasting System
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The relentless spread of photovoltaic production drives searches of smart approaches to mitigate unbalances in power demand and supply, instability on the grid and ensuring stable revenues to the producer. Because of the development of energy markets with multiple time sessions, there is a growing need of power forecasting for multiple time steps, from fifteen minutes up to days ahead. To address this issue, in this study both a short-term-horizon of three days and a very-short-term-horizon of three hours photovoltaic production forecasting methods are presented. The short-term is based on a multimodel approach and referred to several configurations of the Analog Ensemble method, using the weather forecast of four numerical weather prediction models. The very-short-term consists of an Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average Model with eXogenous input (ARIMAX) that uses the short-term power forecast and the irradiance from satellite elaborations as exogenous variables. The methods, applied for one year to four small-scale grid-connected plants in Italy, have obtained promising improvements with respect to refence methods. The time horizon after which the short-term was able to outperform the very-short-term has also been analyzed. The study also revealed the usefulness of satellite data on cloudiness to properly interpret the results of the performance analysis.

TI  - Automatic water detection from multidimensional hierarchical clustering for Sentinel-2 images and a comparison with Level 2A processors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous monitoring of water surfaces is essential for water resource management. This study presents a nonparametric unsupervised automatic algorithm for the identification of inland water pixels from multispectral satellite data using multidimensional clustering and a high-performance subsampling approach for large scenes. Clustering analysis is a technique that is used to identify similar samples in a multidimensional data space. The spectral information and derived indices were used to characterize each scene pixel individually. A machine learning approach with random subsampling and generalization through a Na ve Bayes classifier was also proposed to make the application of complex algorithms to large scenes feasible. Accuracy was evaluated using an independent dataset that provides water bodies in 15 Sentinel-2 images over France acquired in different seasons and that covers a large range of water bodies and water colour types. The validation dataset covers a water surface of more than 1200 km(2) (approximately 12 million pixels) including over 80,000 water bodies outlined using a semiautomatic active learning method, which were manually revised. The classification results were compared to the water pixel classification using three of the major Level 2A processors (MAJA, Sen2Cor and FMask) and two of the most common thresholding techniques: Otsu and Canny-edge. An input mask was used to remove coastal waters, clouds, shadows and snow pixels. Water pixels were identified automatically from the clustering process without the need for ancillary or pretrained data. Combinations using up to three water indices (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index-MNDWI, Normalized Difference Water Index-NDWI and Multiband Water Index-MBWI) and two reflectance bands (B8 and B12) were tested in the algorithm, and the best combination was NDWI-B12. Of all the methods, our method achieved the highest mean kappa score, 0.874, across all tested scenes, with a per-scene kappa ranging from 0.608 to 0.980, and the lowest mean standard deviation of 0.091. Standard Otsu's thresholding had the worst performance due to the lack of a bimodal histogram, and the Canny-edge variation achieved an overall kappa of 0.718 when used with the MNDWI. For water masks provided by generic processors, FMask outperformed MAJA and Sen2Cor and obtained an overall kappa of 0.764. In-depth analysis shows a quick drop in performance for all of the methods in identifying water bodies with a surface area below 0.5 ha, but the proposed approach outperformed the second best method by 34% in this size class.

TI  - Parasitism and Predation on Sentinel Egg Masses of Three Stink Bug Species (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) in Native and Exotic Ornamental Landscapes
T2  - JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluated parasitism and predation on sentinel egg masses of three stink bug species, the spined soldier bug, Podisus maculiventris (Say), the brown stink bug, Euschistus servus (Say), and the invasive brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys (Stal), in ornamental landscapes composed of either native or exotic plants. This study also compared the species composition of parasitoids attacking two native stink bug species (P. maculiventris and E. servus) with those attacking the invasive BMSB on the same tree species in the same habitat. Overall, egg parasitism and predation were much higher on the two native stink bug species compared with BMSB, with an average parasitism rate of 20.6% for E. servus, 12.7% for P. maculiventris, and only 4.2% for H. halys and an average predation rate of 8.2% for E. servus,17.7% for P. maculiventris, and 2.3% for H. halys. Egg predation was also significantly higher on P. maculiventris than on E. servus eggs. Eight parasitoid species attacked sentinel stink bug eggs in the ornamental landscaped plots. Trissolcus euschisti (Ashmead) (Hymenoptera: Scelionidae) was the predominant parasitoid for all three stink bug species. There were no significant differences in parasitism and predation rates on any of the stink bug species between native and exotic plots. Therefore, there is no evidence that ornamental landscapes composed of native plants increased parasitism or predation rates of sentinel egg masses of two native stink bug species or the invasive BMSB, compared with those composed entirely of exotic plants.

TI  - New Insight Into the Onshore Intrusion of the Kuroshio Into the East China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Kuroshio Current, a vigorous western boundary current in the Pacific, is responsible for bringing high temperature, high salinity, and phosphate-rich open ocean water into the East China Sea (ECS) when it flows past Taiwan and generates a branch current, known as the Kuroshio Branch Current (KBC), which intrudes onto the continental shelf of the ECS. Based on observations and numerical modeling, a 1.5-layer reduced-gravity model is evaluated and modified to simulate the flow pattern of the Kuroshio intrusion (KI) northeast of Taiwan. We revised the analytical solution derived by Hsueh (1992), to conserve the horizontal momentum balance in the along-shelf and cross-shelf directions. The new analytical solution not only explains the KI angle but also addresses the KBC recirculation mechanism. To sustain the steady-state momentum balance in the area adjacent to the shelf break northeast of Taiwan, there must be a recirculation that plays the same role in vorticity dynamics as the combination of the joint effect of baroclinicity and relief, bottom friction, and nonlinear advection. Unlike previous studies, our results agree well with the observations and could account for seasonal variations in the KI direction. Moreover, the new model predicts a reasonable velocity maximum (0.42 m s(-1)) over the shelf break. Satellite data and numerical results confirm that the new solution reflects a reasonable estimation for KI direction. This theory may potentially be applied to regions with trenches or valleys with completely different flow patterns by using similar analytical methods.

TI  - Characterising Termite Mounds in a Tropical Savanna with UAV Laser Scanning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Termite mounds are found over vast areas in northern Australia, delivering essential ecosystem services, such as enhancing nutrient cycling and promoting biodiversity. Currently, the detection of termite mounds over large areas requires airborne laser scanning (ALS) or high-resolution satellite data, which lack precise information on termite mound shape and size. For detailed structural measurements, we generally rely on time-consuming field assessments that can only cover a limited area. In this study, we explore if unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based observations can serve as a precise and scalable tool for termite mound detection and morphological characterisation. We collected a unique data set of terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and UAV laser scanning (UAV-LS) point clouds of a woodland savanna site in Litchfield National Park (Australia). We developed an algorithm that uses several empirical parameters for the semi-automated detection of termite mounds from UAV-LS and used the TLS data set (1 ha) for benchmarking. We detected 81% and 72% of the termite mounds in the high resolution (1800 points m(-2)) and low resolution (680 points m(-2)) UAV-LS data, respectively, resulting in an average detection of eight mounds per hectare. Additionally, we successfully extracted information about mound height and volume from the UAV-LS data. The high resolution data set resulted in more accurate estimates; however, there is a trade-off between area and detectability when choosing the required resolution for termite mound detection Our results indicate that UAV-LS data can be rapidly acquired and used to monitor and map termite mounds over relatively large areas with higher spatial detail compared to airborne and spaceborne remote sensing.

TI  - Comparison of Support Vector Machines and Random Forests for Corine Land Cover Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover information is essential in European Union spatial management, particularly that of invasive species, natural habitats, urbanization, and deforestation; therefore, the need for accurate and objective data and tools is critical. For this purpose, the European Union's flagship program, the Corine Land Cover (CLC), was created. Intensive works are currently being carried out to prepare a new version of CLC+ by 2024. The geographical, climatic, and economic diversity of the European Union raises the challenge to verify various test areas' methods and algorithms. Based on the Corine program's precise guidelines, Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellite images were tested to assess classification accuracy and regional and spatial development in three varied areas of Catalonia, Poland, and Romania. The method is dependent on two machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The bias of classifications was reduced using an iterative of randomized training, test, and verification pixels. The ease of the implementation of the used algorithms makes reproducing the results possible and comparable. The results show that an SVM with a radial kernel is the best classifier, followed by RF. The high accuracy classes that can be updated and classes that should be redefined are specified. The methodology's potential can be used by developers of CLC+ products as a guideline for algorithms, sensors, and the possibilities and difficulties of classifying different CLC classes.

TI  - Multi-Sensor InSAR Assessment of Ground Deformations around Lake Mead and Its Relation to Water Level Changes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in subsurface water resources might alter the surrounding ground by generating subsidence or uplift, depending on geological and hydrogeological site characteristics. Improved understanding of the relationships between surface water storage and ground deformation is important for design and maintenance of hydraulic facilities and ground stability. Here, we construct one of the longest series of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) to date, over twenty-five years, to study the relationships between water level changes and ground surface deformation in the surroundings of Lake Mead, United States, and at the site of the Hoover Dam. We use the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) and Permanent scatterer interferometry (PSI) techniques over 177 SAR data, encompassing different SAR sensors including ERS1/2, Envisat, ALOS (PALSAR), and Sentinel-1(S1). We perform a cross-sensor examination of the relationship between water level changes and ground displacement. We found a negative relationship between water level change and ground deformation around the reservoir that was consistent across all sensors. The negative relationship was evident from the long-term changes in water level and deformation occurring from 1995 to 2014, and also from the intra-annual oscillations of the later period, 2014 to 2019, both around the reservoir and at the dam. These results suggest an elastic response of the ground surface to changes in water storage in the reservoir, both at the dam site and around the reservoir. Our study illustrates how InSAR-derived ground deformations can be consistent in time across sensors, showing the potential of detecting longer time-series of ground deformation.

TI  - SAR image wave spectra to retrieve the thickness of grease-pancake sea ice using viscous wave propagation models
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Young sea ice composed of grease and pancake ice (GPI), as well as thin floes, considered to be the most common form of sea ice fringing Antarctica, is now becoming the "new normal" also in the Arctic. A study of the rheological properties of GPI is carried out by comparing the predictions of two viscous wave propagation models: the Keller model and the close-packing (CP) model, with the observed wave attenuation obtained by SAR image techniques. In order to fit observations, it is shown that describing GPI as a viscous medium requires the adoption of an ice viscosity which increases with the ice thickness. The consequences regarding the possibility of ice thickness retrieval from remote sensing data of wave attenuation are discussed. We provide examples of GPI thickness retrievals from a Sentinel-1 C band SAR image taken in the Beaufort Sea on 1 November 2015, and three CosmoSkyMed X band SAR images taken in the Weddell Sea on March 2019. The estimated GPI thicknesses are consistent with concurrent SMOS measurements and available local samplings.

TI  - Extreme Waves in the Agulhas Current Region Inferred from SAR Wave Spectra and the SWAN Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The influence of the Agulhas Current on the wave field is investigated. The study is conducted by performing high resolution spectral wave model simulations with and without ocean currents. The validation of the numerical simulations is performed for the Significant Wave Height (Hs) using all possible satellite altimetry data available in the study region for a winter period of 2018. Wave spectra and extreme waves parameters are examined in places where waves and current are aligned in the Agulhas Current. Sentinel-1 (S1) wave mode Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) spectra are used to estimate the composites of the Hs and BFI (Benjamin-Feir Index). SAR computed BFI and Hs were compared with the respective composites obtained from the Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN) model. From the Hs composites using SAR data and modeled data, it can be concluded that the Hs maxima values are distributed in the Agulhas Current Retroflection (ACR) and also in the southern limit of the domain that is affected by the strong circumpolar winds around Antarctic. In addition, the BFI composites exhibit the highest values in the ACR and some few values are observed in the southern border as occurred with the Hs. The results of this study indicate that there is direct correlation between the Agulhas Current strength, the Hs and the BFI. It was found that the modeled directional wave spectra are broadened when the ocean current is considered in the simulation. The analysis of the modeled wave spectra is performed over eddies, rings and meanders in the Agulhas Current region. The transformation of the wave spectra due to current refraction is discussed based on the numerical simulations. The effect of the Agulhas Current on the spectral shape is explored. The spectral wave energy grows when the wave and the current are aligned, resulting in peaked, elongated and widened spectra. A decrease of the peak period was observed before the occurrence of maximum values of BFI, which characterize abnormal sea states.

TI  - Influenza and Respiratory Virus Surveillance, Vaccine Uptake, and Effectiveness at a Time of Cocirculating COVID-19: Protocol for the English Primary Care Sentinel System for 2020-2021
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) are commencing their 54th season of collaboration at a time when SARS-CoV-2 infections are likely to be cocirculating with the usual winter infections.Objective: The aim of this study is to conduct surveillance of influenza and other monitored respiratory conditions and to report on vaccine uptake and effectiveness using nationally representative surveillance data extracted from primary care computerized medical records systems. We also aim to have general practices collect virology and serology specimens and to participate in trials and other interventional research.Methods: The RCGP RSC network comprises over 1700 general practices in England and Wales. We will extract pseudonymized data twice weekly and are migrating to a system of daily extracts. First, we will collect pseudonymized, routine, coded clinical data for the surveillance of monitored and unexpected conditions; data on vaccine exposure and adverse events of interest; and data on approved research study outcomes. Second, we will provide dashboards to give general practices feedback about levels of care and data quality, as compared to other network practices. We will focus on collecting data on influenza-like illness, upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and suspected COVID-19. Third, approximately 300 practices will participate in the 2020-2021 virology and serology surveillance; this will include responsive surveillance and long-term follow-up of previous SARS-CoV-2 infections. Fourth, member practices will be able to recruit volunteer patients to trials, including early interventions to improve COVID-19 outcomes and point-of-care testing. Lastly, the legal basis for our surveillance with PHE is Regulation 3 of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002; other studies require appropriate ethical approval.Results: The RCGP RSC network has tripled in size; there were previously 100 virology practices and 500 practices overall in the network and we now have 322 and 1724, respectively. The Oxford-RCGP Clinical Informatics Digital Hub (ORCHID) secure networks enable the daily analysis of the extended network; currently, 1076 practices are uploaded. We are implementing a central swab distribution system for patients self-swabbing at home in addition to in-practice sampling. We have converted all our primary care coding to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) coding. Throughout spring and summer 2020, the network has continued to collect specimens in preparation for the winter or for any second wave of COVID-19 cases. We have collected 5404 swabs and detected 623 cases of COVID-19 through extended virological sampling, and 19,341 samples have been collected for serology. This shows our preparedness for the winter season.Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has been associated with a groundswell of general practices joining our network. It has also created a permissive environment in which we have developed the capacity and capability of the national primary care surveillance systems and our unique public health institute, the RCGP and University of Oxford collaboration.

TI  - Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in T3 and T4b Breast Cancer Patients: Analysis in a Tertiary Cancer Hospital and Systematic Literature Review
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer represents the most common type of cancer among women in the world. The presence and extent of axillary lymph node involvement represent an important prognostic factor. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is currently accepted for T1 and T2 with negative axillae (N0); however, many patients with T3-T4b tumors with N0 are often submitted to unnecessarily axillary lymph node dissection. Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective, observational study of patients treated for breast cancer between 2008 and 2015, with T3/T4b tumors and N0, who underwent SLNB. A systematic review of the literature was also carried out in 5 bases. Results: We analyzed 73 patients, and SLNB was negative for macrometastasis in 60.3% of the cases. With a mean follow-up of 45 months, no ipsilateral axillary local recurrence was observed. In the systematic review, only 7 articles presented data for analysis. Grouping these studies with the present series, the rate of N0 was 32.1% for T3 and 61.0% for T4b; grouping all studies (T3 and T4b n = 431) the rate was 32.5%. Conclusions: SLNB in T3/T4b tumors is a feasible and safe procedure from the oncological point of view, as it has not been associated with ipsilateral axillary relapse.

TI  - Exploring the Impact of Noise on Hybrid Inversion of PROSAIL RTM on Sentinel-2 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing (RS) of biophysical variables plays a vital role in providing the information necessary for understanding spatio-temporal dynamics in ecosystems. The hybrid approach to retrieve biophysical variables from RS by combining Machine Learning (ML) algorithms with surrogate data generated by Radiative Transfer Models (RTM). The susceptibility of the ill-posed solutions to noise currently constrains further application of hybrid approaches. Here, we explored how noise affects the performance of ML algorithms for biophysical trait retrieval. We focused on synthetic Sentinel-2 (S2) data generated using the PROSAIL RTM and four commonly applied ML algorithms: Gaussian Processes (GPR), Random Forests (RFR), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Multi-task Neural Networks (MTN). After identifying which biophysical variables can be retrieved from S2 using a Global Sensitivity Analysis, we evaluated the performance loss of each algorithm using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) with increasing noise levels. We found that, for S2 data, Carotenoid concentrations are uniquely dependent on band 2, Chlorophyll is almost exclusively dependent on the visible ranges, and Leaf Area Index, water, and dry matter contents are mostly dependent on infrared bands. Without added noise, GPR was the best algorithm (<0.05%), followed by the MTN (<3%) and ANN (<5%), with the RFR performing very poorly (<50%). The addition of noise critically affected the performance of all algorithms (>20%) even at low levels of added noise (approximate to 5%). Overall, both neural networks performed significantly better than GPR and RFR when noise was added with the MTN being slightly better when compared to the ANN. Our results imply that the performance of the commonly used algorithms in hybrid-RTM inversion are pervasively sensitive to noise. The implication is that more advanced models or approaches are necessary to minimize the impact of noise to improve near real-time and accurate RS monitoring of biophysical trait retrieval.

TI  - Grassland Mowing Detection Using Sentinel-1 Time Series: Potential and Limitations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grasslands encompass vast and diverse ecosystems that provide food, wildlife habitat and carbon storage. Their large range in land use intensity significantly impacts their ecological value and the balance between these goods and services. Mowing dates and frequencies are major aspects of grassland use intensity, which have an impact on their ecological value as habitats. Previous studies highlighted the feasibility of detecting mowing events based on remote sensing time series, a few of which using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. Although providing encouraging results, research on grassland mowing detection often lacks sufficient precise reference data for corroboration. The goal of the present study is to quantitatively and statistically assess the potential of Sentinel-1 C-band SAR for detecting mowing events in various agricultural grasslands, using a large and diverse reference data set collected in situ. Several mowing detection methods, based on SAR backscattering and interferometric coherence time series, were thoroughly evaluated. Results show that 54% of mowing events could be detected in hay meadows, based on coherence jumps. Grazing events were identified as a major confounding factor, as most false detections were made in pastures. Parcels with one mowing event in the summer were identified with the highest accuracy (71%). Overall, this study demonstrates that mowing events can be detected through Sentinel-1 coherence. However, the performances could probably be further enhanced by discriminating pastures beforehand and combining Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data for mowing detection.

TI  - A million kernels of truth: Insights into scalable satellite maize yield mapping and yield gap analysis from an extensive ground dataset in the US Corn
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop yield maps estimated from satellite data increasingly are used to understand drivers of yield trends and variability, yet satellite-derived regional maps are rarely compared with location-specific yields due to the difficulty of acquiring sub-field ground truth data at scale. In commercial agricultural systems, combine harvesters with onboard yield monitors collect real-time yield data during harvest with high spatial resolution, generating a large ground dataset. Here, we leveraged a yield monitor dataset of over one million maize field observations across the United States Corn Belt from 2008 to 2018 to evaluate the Scalable Crop Yield Mapper (SCYM). SCYM uses region-specific crop model simulations and climate data to interpret vegetation indices from satellite observations, thus enabling efficient sub-field yield estimation across large regions and multiple years without reliance on ground data calibration. We used the ground dataset to compare alternative SCYM model implementations, define minimum required satellite observation criteria, and evaluate the sensitivity of satellite-based yield estimates to on-the-ground variation in management, soil, and annual weather. We found that smoothing annual time series data with harmonic regression increased 30 m pixel-level accuracy from r(2) = 0.31 to 0.40 and reduced dependency on specific satellite observation timing, enabling robust yield estimation on 97% of annual maize area using only Landsat data. Agreement improved as the assessment was aggregated to field-level (r2 = 0.45) and county-level (r(2) = 0.69) scales, demonstrating the need for fine-resolution ground truth data to better assess sub-field level accuracy in high resolution products. We found that SCYM and ground data showed a similar yield response to management and environmental variation, particularly capturing linear and nonlinear responses to sowing density, soil water holding capacity, and growing season precipitation. However, sensitivity to factors like soil quality and planting date was muted for SCYM estimates compared to ground-based yields. Random forest models were able to match SCYM performance when trained on at least 1000 ground observations, but performed poorly when tested on years and locations not represented in the training data. Our results demonstrate that satellite yield maps can provide much-needed information on multidecadal yield trends and inform yield gap analyses.

TI  - Effect of curvature on hyperspectral reflectance images of cereal seed-sized objects
T2  - BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral imaging for quality and safety inspection of agricultural products is frequently confronted with the challenge of handling rounded surfaces. This challenge is especially noted when the objects are as small as cereal grains for which curvature with respect to the spatial dimension of a pixel is large. Diffusely reflected light from regions near the edges of a uniformly illuminated object the size of a wheat kernel will have its intensity reduced greatly, historically modelled by the Lambert Cosine Law, eponymously named after Johann Lambert of the sixteenth century, who theorised that the fraction of energy reflected from a spot on a matte surface is related to the declination angle of the observer. The current study was performed to compare the predicted Lambertian response of reflected light to actual measurement on curved surfaces of mathematically definable shapes, namely cylinders and prolate ellipsoids, with the latter introduced as an approximation to a wheat kernel. Carbon black-doped and sintered PTFE (0.16-0.99 nominal reflectance) cylinders of three diameters, with the smallest on par with the minor dimension of a wheat kernel, were scanned using a benchtop hyperspectral imaging system, as were dull gray-painted prolate spheroids of equivalent size and white wheat kernels. The analysis consisted of comparing the measured reflectances (940-1650 nm) from individual pixels along the curved surface with those determined according to the Lambert Cosine Law. The findings indicate that central pixels responded well to correction, with a greater departure from theory for pixels closest to the edges. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of IAgrE.

TI  - Continued Low Efficacy of Artemether-Lumefantrine in Angola in 2019
T2  - ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Biennial therapeutic efficacy monitoring is a crucial activity for ensuring the efficacy of currently used artemisinin- based combination therapy in Angola. Children with acute uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum infection in sentinel sites in the Benguela, Zaire, and Lunda Sul Provinces were treated with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and monitored for 28 days to assess clinical and parasitological responses. Molecular correction was performed using seven microsatellite markers. Samples from treatment failures were genotyped for the pfk13, pfcrt, and pfmdr1 genes. Day 3 clearance rates were >= 95% in all arms. Uncorrected day 28 Kaplan-Meier efficacy estimates ranged from 84.2 to 90.1% for the AL arms and 84.7 to 100% for the ASAQ arms. Corrected day 28 estimates were 87.6% (95% confidence interval [CI], 81 to 95%) for the AL arm in Lunda Sul, 92.2% (95% CI, 87 to 98%) for AL in Zaire, 95.6% (95% CI, 91 to 100%) for ASAQ in Zaire, 98.4% (95% CI, 96 to 100%) for AL in Benguela, and 100% for ASAQ in Benguela and Lunda Sul. All 103 analyzed samples had wild-type pfk13 sequences. The 76T pfcrt allele was found in most (92%; 11/12) ASAQ late-failure samples but in only 16% (4/25) of AL failure samples. The N86 pfmdr1 allele was found in 97% (34/35) of treatment failures. The AL efficacy in Lunda Sul was below the 90% World Health Organization threshold, the third time in four rounds that this threshold was crossed for an AL arm in Angola. In contrast, the observed ASAQ efficacy has not been below 95% to date in Angola, including this latest round.

TI  - An integrated simulation approach to the assessment of urban growth pattern and loss in urban green space in Kolkata, India: A GIS-based analysis
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban green space (UGS) is although play a vital role in the mitigation of negative impacts of urbanization, but it often abominably affected by the process of land-use land-cover (LULC) changes in an urban area. Thus, the present study aims to examine the loss in urban green space (UGS) in relation to LULC change by using a multi-temporal land-use transition scenario and to predict the loss of UGS in the future in the city Kolkata. Landsat satellite data (for years 1980, 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2018) were used for analysis. We have adopted three comparative land classification algorithms for the assessment of urban growth pattern. An integrated cellular automata-Markov chain (CA-MC) model was applied to simulate LULC dynamics and the state of UGS in 2025 and 2035. Land use dynamic degree index (LUDD), UGS change intensity index (CII) and UGS land index were used to measure the rate and speed of urban growth, the ratio of change of green space and UGS coverage in respect to the total area of all LULC types, respectively. To measure UGS availability, per-capita urban green space (PCG) was estimated. The model was validated using observed and simulated LULC map 2018. The standard Kappa coefficient value was 0.861 and overall level of agreement was 91.15%, which signifies the efficiency of this simulation. The result shows that the built-up areas were increased from 92.71 sq. km in 1980 to 148.30 sq. km in 2018 and predicted to increase 155.67 sq. km which will be about 84% of the total area. Correspondingly, the predicted results displayed that, vegetation and grassland area were decreased about (-) 17.42% and (-)11.69% for the period of 2025-2035, respectively. The present study provides some productive methodological approach for future LULC simulation research and also the findings of this study can help implement UGS management strategies not only for the Kolkata but other cities as well.

TI  - Pathological factors associated with non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in early stage cervical cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze the predictive factors for non-sentinel lymph node (non-SLN) metastasis in early-stage cervical cancer.Methods: We analyzed a series of 113 patients who underwent sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping for cervical cancer. The SLNs were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) when the hematoxylin-eosin stain was negative.Results: The overall bilateral detection rate was 81.5%, with a median of two SLNs resected. The study ultimately included 92 patients with SLNs that were mapped who had also undergone systematic pelvic lymph node dissection. Thirteen (14.1%) patients had positive SLNs, with a median of one positive SLN. Regarding the size of SLN metastasis, one (1.1%) had isolated tumor cells (ITC), seven (7.6%) had micrometastases, and five (5.4%) had macrometastases. Notably, 46.1% (6/13) had lymph node metastases detected only after IHC. Five (38.5%) cases had positive non-SLNs, with a median count of one positive lymph node. Parametrial invasion was the only risk factor for positive non-SLN (p = .045). Regarding the size of SLN metastasis, non-SLN involvement was present in the only case with ITC (1/1), 42.9% (3/7) of cases with micrometastases, and in 20% (1/5) with macrometastases.Conclusions: Our data suggest that parametrial invasion correlates with the risk of non-SLN metastasis in cervical cancer.

AB  - As part of an insect resistance management plan to preserve Bt transgenic technology, annual monitoring of target pests is mandated to detect susceptibility changes to Bt toxins. Currently Helicoverpa zea (Boddie) monitoring involves investigating unexpected injury in Bt crop fields and collecting larvae from non-Bt host plants for laboratory diet bioassays to determine mortality responses to diagnostic concentrations of Bt toxins. To date, this monitoring approach has not detected any significant change from the known range of baseline susceptibility to Bt toxins, yet practical field-evolved resistance in H. zea populations and numerous occurrences of unexpected injury occur in Bt crops. In this study, we implemented a network of 73 sentinel sweet corn trials, spanning 16 U.S. states and 4 Canadian provinces, for monitoring changes in H. zea susceptibility to Cry and Vip3A toxins by measuring differences in ear damage and larval infestations between isogenic pairs of non-Bt and Bt hybrids over three years. This approach can monitor susceptibility changes and regional differences in other ear-feeding lepidopteran pests. Temporal changes in the field efficacy of each toxin were evidenced by comparing our current results with earlier published studies, including baseline data for each Bt trait when first commercialized. Changes in amount of ear damage showed significant increases in H. zea resistance to Cry toxins and possibly lower susceptibility to Vip3a. Our findings demonstrate that the sentinel plot approach as an in-field screen can effectively monitor phenotypic resistance and document field-evolved resistance in target pest populations, improving resistance monitoring for Bt crops.

TI  - Estimation of Water Coverage in Permanent and Temporary Shallow Lakes and Wetlands by Combining Remote Sensing Techniques and Genetic Programming: Application to the Mediterranean Basin of the Iberian Peninsula
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This work aims to validate the wide use of an algorithm developed using genetic programing (GP) techniques allowing to discern between water and non-water pixels using the near infrared band and different thresholds. A total of 34 wetlands and shallow lakes of 18 ecological types were used for validation. These include marshes, salt ponds, and saline and freshwater, temporary and permanent shallow lakes. Furthermore, based on the spectral matching between Landsat and Sentinel-2 sensors, this methodology was applied to Sentinel-2 imagery, improving the spatial and temporal resolution. When compared to other techniques, GP showed better accuracy (over 85% in most cases) and acceptable kappa values in the estimation of water pixels (kappa >= 0.7) in 10 of the 18 assayed ecological types evaluated with Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 imagery. The improvements were especially achieved for temporary lakes and wetlands, where existing algorithms were scarcely reliable. This shows that GP algorithms applied to remote sensing satellite imagery can be a valuable tool to monitor water coverage in wetlands and shallow lakes where multiple factors cause a low resolution by commonly used water indices. This allows the reconstruction of hydrological series showing their hydrological behaviors during the last three decades, being useful to predict how their hydrological pattern may behave under future global change scenarios.

TI  - Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution Using Novel Dense-Sampling Networks
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Super-resolution (SR) techniques play a crucial role in increasing the spatial resolution of remote sensing data and overcoming the physical limitations of the spaceborne imaging systems. Though the convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have obtained good performance, they show limited capacity when coping with large-scale super-resolving tasks. The more complicated spatial distribution of remote sensing data further increases the difficulty in reconstruction. This article develops a dense-sampling super-resolution network (DSSR) to explore the large-scale SR reconstruction of the remote sensing imageries. Specifically, a dense-sampling mechanism, which reuses an upscaler to upsample multiple low-dimension features, is presented to make the network jointly consider multilevel priors when performing reconstruction. A wide feature attention block (WAB), which incorporates the wide activation and attention mechanism, is introduced to enhance the representation ability of the network. In addition, a chain training strategy is proposed to optimize further the performance of the large-scale models by borrowing knowledge from the pretrained small-scale models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and show that the DSSR outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both quantitative evaluation and visual quality.

TI  - European Wide Forest Classification Based on Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The constellation of two Sentinel-1 satellites provides an unprecedented coverage of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data at high spatial (20 m) and temporal (2 to 6 days over Europe) resolution. The availability of dense time series enables the analysis of the SAR temporal signatures and exploitation of these signatures for classification purposes. Frequent backscatter observations allow derivation of temporally filtered time series that reinforce the effect of changes in vegetation phenology by limiting the influence of short-term changes related to environmental conditions. Recent studies have already shown the potential of multitemporal Sentinel-1 data for forest mapping, forest type classification (coniferous or broadleaved forest) as well as for derivation of phenological variables at local to national scales. In the present study, we tested the viability of a recently published multi-temporal SAR classification method for continental scale forest mapping by applying it over Europe and evaluating the derived forest type and tree cover density maps against the European-wide Copernicus High Resolution Layers (HRL) forest datasets and national-scale forest maps from twelve countries. The comparison with the Copernicus HRL datasets revealed high correspondence over the majority of the European continent with overall accuracies of 86.1% and 73.2% for the forest/non-forest and forest type maps, respectively, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.83 for tree cover density map. Moreover, the evaluation of both datasets against the national forest maps showed that the obtained accuracies of Sentinel-1 forest maps are almost within range of the HRL datasets. The Sentinel-1 forest/non-forest and forest type maps obtained average overall accuracies of 88.2% and 82.7%, respectively, as compared to 90.0% and 87.2% obtained by the Copernicus HRL datasets. This result is especially promising due to the facts that these maps can be produced with a high degree of automation and that only a single year of Sentinel-1 data is required as opposed to the Copernicus HRL forest datasets that are updated every three years.

TI  - Small anomalies in dry-season greenness and chlorophyll fluorescence for Amazon moist tropical forests during El Nino and La Nina
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Amazon Basin, a major driver of atmospheric CO2 fluxes, is composed of moist tropical forest (> 2000 mm mean annual precipitation), seasonally moist tropical forests (< 2000 mm mean annual precipitation), croplands, and pastures. It is debated whether there is a dry-season increase in photosynthesis for moist forest and a large reduction in photosynthesis of tropical South America was recently cited as a major driver of the historically high atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the 2015/2016 El Nino. To address this debate and to gain insight into changes in dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis during El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, here we investigate (1) dry-season changes in satellite-based greenness, solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and photosynthesis during 2007-2017 and (2) anomalies of satellite-based dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis for two El Nino events (2009/2010 and 2015/2016) and two La Nina events (2007/2008 and 2010/2011). We hypothesize that satellite-based greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis of moist tropical forests should increase during the dry season, and find this to be the case using two MODIS BRDF-adjusted vegetation indices (EVI and NDVI), GOME-2 SIF data, and the Vegetation Photosynthesis Model (VPM). We also hypothesize that dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis should be anomalously high during the El Ninos, due to anomalously high photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and a relatively normal preceding wet season, and anomalously low during the La Ninas because these dry seasons were preceded by anomalously low amounts of wet-season precipitation. For this hypothesis, we present results for moist tropical forest and at the basin scale to determine if and by how much their anomalies differ. We find dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis of moist tropical forest and at the basin scale were statistically significantly lower than normal during the La Ninas, significantly higher than normal during the 2009/2010 El Nino, and were mixed for the 2015/2016 El Nino. Although statistically significant, the magnitudes of the dry-season anomalies were not substantial. Our findings provide additional evidence that photosynthesis of moist tropical Amazon forest increases during the dry season and narrows the potential drivers of perturbations to the atmospheric CO2 growth rate during the last four ENSO events, as anomalies in dry-season greenness, SIF, and photosynthesis during these ENSO events were minute.

TI  - Tropical Forest and Wetland Losses and the Role of Protected Areas in Northwestern Belize, Revealed from Landsat and Machine Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in land-use and land-cover, including both agricultural expansion and the establishment of protected areas, have altered the landscape pattern and extent of forest and wetland cover in the tropics. In Central America, land-use and land-cover change is also threatening the cultural resources of the region's ancient Maya heritage since many ancient sites have been degraded by burning, deforestation, and plowing. In this study of Orange Walk District of northern Belize, from the 1980s to the present, we used multitemporal Landsat data with a random forest classifier to reveal trends in land-use and land-cover change and the increasing loss of forest and wetlands. We develop a random forest classifier that is time-generalized to map land-use and land-cover across the entire Landsat record, including Landsat 4, 5, 7, and 8, with a single algorithm. Including multiyear and seasonal composites was important for obtaining cloud-free coverage and distinguishing between different land-use and land-cover types. Early deforestation (1984-1987) was in small patches scattered across the landscape and likely driven by small scale agriculture such as milpa and smaller area tractor and horse-drawn plowing. The establishment of protected areas in the late 1980s and early 1990s allowed for forest regrowth in these areas, while wetland losses were high at 15%. The transition to industrial agriculture in the 2000s, however, drove a 43.6% expansion of agriculture and a 7.5% loss of forest and a 28.2% loss of wetlands during the similar to 15 years. Protected areas initiated in the 1980s led to a nearly 100 km(2) decrease in agriculture from 1984-1987 to 1999-2001, and they became essential refugia for habitat and maintaining ecosystem services.

TI  - Tenuous Correlation between Snow Depth or Sea Ice Thickness and C- or X-Band Backscattering in Nunavik Fjords of the Hudson Strait
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Radar penetration in brine-wetted snow-covered sea ice is almost nil, yet reports exist of a correlation between snow depth or ice thickness and SAR parameters. This article presents a description of snow depth and first-year sea ice thickness distributions in three fjords of the Hudson Strait and of their tenuous correlation with SAR backscattering in the C- and X-band. Snow depth and ice thickness were directly measured in three fjords of the Hudson Strait from 2015 to 2018 in April or May. Bayesian linear regression analysis was used to investigate their relationship with RADARSAT-2 (C-band) or TerraSAR-X (X-band). Polarimetric ratios and the Cloude-Pottier decomposition parameters were explored along with the HH, HV and VV bands. Linear correlations were generally no higher than 0.3 except for a special case in May 2018. The co-polarization ratio did not perform better than the backscattering coefficients.

TI  - Evaluating the Lagrangian Evolution of Subtropical Low Clouds in GCMs Using Observations: Mean Evolution, Time Scales, and Responses to Predictors
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A Lagrangian framework is developed to show the daily-scale time evolution of low clouds over the eastern subtropical oceans. An identical framework is applied to two general circulation models (GCMs): the CAM5 and UKMET and a set of satellite observations. This approach follows thousands of parcels as they advect downwind in the subtropical trade winds, comparing cloud evolution in time and space. This study tracks cloud cover, in-cloud liquid water path (CLWP), droplet concentration N-d, planetary boundary layer (PBL) depth, and rain rate as clouds transition from regions with predominately stratiform clouds to regions containing mostly trade cumulus. The two models generate fewer clouds with greater N-d relative to observations. Models show stronger Lagrangian cloud cover decline and greater PBL deepening when compared with observations. In comparing frequency distributions of cloud variables over time, it is seen that models generate increasing frequencies of nearly clear conditions at the expense of overcast conditions, whereas observations show transitions from overcast to cloud amounts between 50% and 90%. Lagrangian decorrelation time scales (e-folding time tau) of cloud cover and CLWP are between 11 and 19 h for models and observations, although they are a bit shorter for models. A Lagrangian framework applied here resolves and compares the time evolution of cloud systems as they adjust to environmental perturbations in models and observations. Increasing subsidence in the overlying troposphere leads to declining cloud cover, CLWP, PBL depth, and rain rates in models and observations. Modeled cloud responses to other meteorological variables are less consistent with observations, suggesting a need for continuing mechanical improvements in GCMs.

TI  - Per-pixel land cover accuracy prediction: A random forest-based method with limited reference sample data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Given the importance of accuracy in land cover (LC) maps, several methods have been adopted to predict per-pixel land cover accuracy (PLCA) of classified remote sensing images. Such a PLCA map provides spatially-explicit accuracy information and is of paramount importance for both producers and end-users of LC maps to thoroughly understand the spatial distribution of accuracy. In this study, we proposed a simple yet powerful random forest (RF) based approach for PLCA mapping with limited reference sample data. The main assumption of the proposed approach is that the LC's misclassifications do not occur randomly, but rather exhibit some detectable characteristics which can be retrieved via the built model. With this approach, RF attempts to establish a nonlinear relationship between the accuracy and the same spectral bands used in LC classification. To confirm the proposed method as a consistent and practical approach for a variety of different settings, we evaluated it on five different classified remote sensing images derived from Landsat-8, Ikonos, and three Sentinel-2 images across different parts of Iran. In this manner, to validate the predictive capability of the RF-based method, we calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and several other statistical metrics, including sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy (ACC). Analysis of the average values of these metrics (AUROC = 0.88, SN = 95%, SP = 68%, PPV = 96%, NPV = 72%, and ACC = 95%) derived from the limited sample size datasets showed that the proposed model performs well in all case studies. The performance of the proposed model was further assessed through comparison against two benchmark methods, namely Gaussian kernel interpolation (GKI) and linear kernel interpolation (LKI). In conclusion, although our comprehensive evaluations revealed that RF, GKI, and LKI methods are promising approaches for PLCA mapping, RF outperformed both GKI and LKI in all of the experimental sites.

TI  - Anthropogenic Drivers of Mangrove Loss and Associated Carbon Emissions in South Sumatra, Indonesia
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Air Telang Protected Forest (ATPF) is one of the most dynamic and essential coastal forest landscapes in South Sumatra, Indonesia, because of its location between multiple river outlets, including the Musi catchment-Sumatra's largest and most dense lowland catchment area. While most ATPF areas are covered by mangroves, these areas have been experiencing severe anthropogenic-driven degradation and conversion. This study aims to evaluate land cover changes and associated carbon emissions in the ATPF over a 35-year period (1985-2020) by utilizing the available Landsat and Sentinel imagery from 1985, 2000, and 2020. Throughout the analysis period, we observed 63% (from 10,886 to 4059 ha) primary and secondary forest loss due to land use change. We identified three primary anthropogenic activities driving these losses, namely, land clearing for plantations and agriculture (3693 ha), coconut plantations (3315 ha), aquaculture (245 ha). We estimated that the largest carbon emissions were caused by coconut plantation conversion, with total carbon emissions of approximately 14.14 Mt CO2-eq. These amounts were almost 4 and 21 times higher than emissions from land clearing and aquaculture, respectively, as substantial soil carbon loss occurs once mangroves get transformed into coconut plantations. While coconut plantation expansion on mangroves could generate significant carbon stock losses and cleared forests become the primary candidate for restoration, our dataset could be useful for future land-based emission reduction policy intervention at a subnational level. Ultimately, our findings have direct implications for current national climate policies, through low carbon development strategies and emission reductions from the land use sector for 2030, as outlined in the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).

TI  - Physiological and behavioral responses of land molluscs as biomarkers for pollution impact assessment: A review
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Review
AB  - Environmental pollution caused by human activities is a global public health concern. This review discusses the impact of different types of pollutants such as pesticides, metals, nanoparticles and others on land molluscs. These molluscs are of great interest as good model organisms for studying biomarker responses in ecotoxicological monitoring programs. Several biomarkers are utilized to characterize and quantify the exposure and harmful impacts of various pollutants. In this review, we have identified physiological and behavioral endpoints (feeding, growth, avoidance, mucus secretion, locomotion and reproductive behavior) for the diagnosis of environmental pollution. The present review displays that all types of pollutants can disturb physiological and behavioral endpoints of gastropods, and these impacts depend on the matrix, exposure time and route as well as the type and concentration of the pollutants in the environment. We have also confirmed that terrestrial gastropods particularly snails as sentinel species could be used as potential bioindicator organisms for environmental quality assessment and thus for predicting potential hazards to human health.

TI  - Prediction of Combined Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index (CTEI) over Large River Basin Based on Machine Learning Approaches
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is a fundamental physical feature of the climate pattern worldwide. Over the past few decades, a natural disaster has accelerated its occurrence, which has significantly impacted agricultural systems, economies, environments, water resources, and supplies. Therefore, it is essential to develop new techniques that enable comprehensive determination and observations of droughts over large areas with satisfactory spatial and temporal resolution. This study modeled a new drought index called the Combined Terrestrial Evapotranspiration Index (CTEI), developed in the Ganga river basin. For this, five Machine Learning (ML) techniques, derived from artificial intelligence theories, were applied: the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, decision trees, Matern 5/2 Gaussian process regression, boosted trees, and bagged trees. These techniques were driven by twelve different models generated from input combinations of satellite data and hydrometeorological parameters. The results indicated that the eighth model performed best and was superior among all the models, with the SVM algorithm resulting in an R-2 value of 0.82 and the lowest errors in terms of the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) (0.33) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (0.20), followed by the Matern 5/2 Gaussian model with an R-2 value of 0.75 and RMSE and MAE of 0.39 and 0.21 mm/day, respectively. Moreover, among all the five methods, the SVM and Matern 5/2 Gaussian methods were the best-performing ML algorithms in our study of CTEI predictions for the Ganga basin.

TI  - Crop Water Requirements and Suitability Assessment in Arid Environments: A New Approach
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Efficient land and water management require the accurate selection of suitable crops that are compatible with soil and crop water requirements (CWR) in a given area. In this study, twenty soil profiles are collected to represent the soils of the study area. Physical and chemical properties of soil, in addition to irrigation water quality, provided data are utilized by the Agriculture Land Evaluation System for Arid and semi-arid regions (ALES-Arid) to determine crop suitability. University of Idaho Ref-ET software is used to calculate CWR from weather data while the Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land Model (SEBAL) is utilized to estimate CWR from remote sensing data. The obtained results show that seasonal weather-based CWR of the most suitable field crops (S1 and S2 classes) ranges from 804 to 1625 mm for wheat and berssem, respectively, and ranges from 778 to 993 mm in the vegetable crops potato and watermelon, respectively, under surface irrigation. Mean daily satellite-based CWR are predicted based on SEBAL ranges between 4.79 and 3.62 mm in Toshka and Abu Simbel areas respectively. This study provides a new approach for coupling ALES-Arid, Ref-ET and SEBAL models to facilitate the selection of suitable crops and offers an excellent source for predicting CWR in arid environments. The findings of this research will help in managing the future marginal land reclamation projects in arid and semi-arid areas of the world.

TI  - The Status of Air Quality in the United States During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Remote Sensing Perspective
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic has prompted global governments to take several measures to limit and contain the spread of the novel virus. In the United States (US), most states have imposed a partial to complete lockdown that has led to decreased traffic volumes and reduced vehicle emissions. In this study, we investigate the impacts of the pandemic-related lockdown on air quality in the US using remote sensing products for nitrogen dioxide tropospheric column (NO2), carbon monoxide atmospheric column (CO), tropospheric ozone column (O-3), and aerosol optical depth (AOD). We focus on states with distinctive anomalies and high traffic volume, New York (NY), Illinois (IL), Florida (FL), Texas (TX), and California (CA). We evaluate the effectiveness of reduced traffic volume to improve air quality by comparing the significant reductions during the pandemic to the interannual variability (IAV) of a respective reference period for each pollutant. We also investigate and address the potential factors that might have contributed to changes in air quality during the pandemic. As a result of the lockdown and the significant reduction in traffic volume, there have been reductions in CO and NO2. These reductions were, in many instances, compensated by local emissions and, or affected by meteorological conditions. Ozone was reduced by varying magnitude in all cases related to the decrease or increase of NO2 concentrations, depending on ozone photochemical sensitivity. Regarding the policy impacts of this large-scale experiment, our results indicate that reduction of traffic volume during the pandemic was effective in improving air quality in regions where traffic is the main pollution source, such as in New York City and FL, while was not effective in reducing pollution events where other pollution sources dominate, such as in IL, TX and CA. Therefore, policies to reduce other emissions sources (e.g., industrial emissions) should also be considered, especially in places where the reduction in traffic volume was not effective in improving air quality (AQ).

TI  - Landslide Hazard and Exposure Modelling in Data-Poor Regions: The Example of the Rohingya Refugee Camps in Bangladesh
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide hazards significantly affect economies and populations around the world, but locations where the greatest proportional losses occur are in data-poor regions where capacity to estimate and prepare for these hazards is most limited. Earth observation (EO) data can fill key knowledge gaps, and can be rapidly used in settings with lower analytical capacity. In this study, we describe a novel series of methods designed to analyze landslide susceptibility, hazard and exposure in the region in and around the Rohingya refugee camps in Bangladesh, where limited data is juxtaposed with a major humanitarian crisis. We demonstrate that a high degree of accuracy is possible even when estimating susceptibility of relatively small landslides. In the context of this example, we also explore how estimates of landslide hazard and exposure are most beneficial to decisions made by humanitarian stakeholders relevant to natural hazards and risk. The unique opportunity to work alongside humanitarian end-users has allowed us to produce focused products that can be tested while in development. In particular, we stress the importance of communicating the difference between a landslide "early warning system"-for which satellite data may be unsuitable at local scales-and a model that provides relative hazard estimates, where EO may be valuable. The toolbox of methods presented here could be used to generate landslide hazard and exposure maps in other data-poor regions around the globe.

TI  - Countrywide Monitoring of Ground Deformation Using InSAR Time Series: A Case Study from Qatar
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past few decades the country of Qatar has been one of the fastest growing economies in the Middle East; it has witnessed a rapid increase in its population, growth of its urban centers, and development of its natural resources. These anthropogenic activities compounded with natural forcings (e.g., climate change) will most likely introduce environmental effects that should be assessed. In this manuscript, we identify and assess one of these effects, namely, ground deformation over the entire country of Qatar. We use the Small Baseline Subset (SBAS) InSAR time series approach in conjunction with ALOS Palsar-1 (January 2007 to March 2011) and Sentinel-1 (March 2017 to December 2019) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) datasets to assess ground deformation and conduct spatial and temporal correlations between the observed deformation with relevant datasets to identify the controlling factors. The findings indicate: (1) the deformation products revealed areas of subsidence and uplift with high vertical velocities of up to 35 mm/yr; (2) the deformation rates were consistent with those extracted from the continuously operating reference GPS stations of Qatar; (3) many inland and coastal sabkhas (salt flats) showed evidence for uplift (up to 35 mm/yr) due to the continuous evaporation of the saline waters within the sabkhas and the deposition of the evaporites in the surficial and near-surficial sabkha sediments; (4) the increased precipitation during Sentinel-1 period compared to the ALOS Palsar-1 period led to a rise in groundwater levels and an increase in the areas occupied by surface water within the sabkhas, which in turn increased the rate of deposition of the evaporitic sediments; (5) high subsidence rates (up to 14 mm/yr) were detected over landfills and dumpsites, caused by mechanical compaction and biochemical processes; and (6) the deformation rates over areas surrounding known sinkhole locations were low (+/-2 mm/yr). We suggest that this study can pave the way to similar countrywide studies over the remaining Arabian Peninsula countries and to the development of a ground motion monitoring system for the entire Arabian Peninsula.

TI  - The Estimated Source of 2017 Pohang Earthquake Using Surface Deformation Modeling Based on Multi-Frequency InSAR Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An earthquake occurred on 17 November 2017 in Pohang, South Korea with a strength of 5.4 Mw. This is the second strongest earthquake recorded by local authorities since the equipment was first installed. In order to improve understanding of earthquakes and surface deformation, many studies have been conducted according to these phenomena. In this research, we will estimate the surface deformation using the Okada model equation. The SAR images of three satellites with different wavelengths (ALOS-2, Cosmo SkyMed and Sentinel-1) were used to produce the interferogram pairs. The interferogram is used as a reference for surface deformation changes by using Okada to determine the source of surface deformation that occurs during an earthquake. The Non-linear optimization (Levemberg-Marquadrt algorithm) and Monte Carlo restart was applied to optimize the fault parameter on modeling process. Based on the modeling results of each satellite data, the fault geometry is similar to 6 km length, similar to 2 km width and similar to 5 km depth. The root mean square error values in the surface deformation model results for Sentinel, CSK and ALOS are 0.37 cm, 0.79 cm and 1.47 cm, respectively. Furthermore, the results of this modeling can be used as learning material in understanding about seismic activity to minimize the impacts that arise in the future.

TI  - A New Model for three-dimensional Deformation Extraction with Single-track InSAR Based on Mining Subsidence Characteristics
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new model for three-dimensional deformation extraction of single-track interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) based on mining subsidence characteristics. The model is applied to address the problem of difficult-to-obtain three-dimensional surface deformations in a mining area with high-precision using single-track InSAR. In horizontal or near horizontal coal seam mining regions, land subsidence and horizontal movement are symmetrically distributed along the strike and dip directions of the working face. The proposed method uses this characteristic to calculate the three-dimensional component of surface deformation for the mining area by performing simple addition and subtraction operations on the line-of-sight (LOS) displacement of the symmetric points. Simulations using the developed model show that the root mean square error (RMSE) of the three-dimensional deformations in the vertical, east-west, and north-south directions are 6.9, 5.5 and 8.9 mm, respectively. Experiments were processed using the Sentinel-1A images, and the results show that the vertical displacement generated by the model is consistent with the leveling data. Based on the simulation analysis, it is found that this model can solve the three-dimensional mining deformations, for situations where the strike angle of the coal seam is not perpendicular to the satellite heading.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of Mega-Sports Events on Urbanization Focusing on Land-Use Changes Using a Scenario-Based Model
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mega-sports events have a profound impact on promoting the urbanization process, optimizing the urban spatial structure, and improving the competitiveness of the host city. Taking the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou 2022 (AGH) as an example, we used remote sensing data and a scenario-based model to simulate land-use changes and developments from 2005 to 2025. By setting two scenarios, natural development and AGH-driven development, we explored the impact of AGH on urban development and its driving factors. The results show that (1) cultivated land areas decreased by 369.96 km(2), while construction land areas increased by 488.33 km(2) among the main land-use types in Hangzhou from 2005 to 2020. Urban areas quickly expanded with the West Lake as the center. (2) Urban sprawl intensity under the AGH-driven scenario is expected to increase by 0.91% compared to in the natural-development scenario, indicating that hosting AGH would accelerate the expansion of urban land, particularly in districts set with sports venues such as Binjiang, Xiaoshan, and Yuhang. The strategic trend of supporting the Qiantang River is obvious. (3) Under the influence of AGH, the centroid of urban construction land shifted towards the southeast, and the spatial direction was remarkable. The construction of venues and supporting facilities, and construction land for public rail transit, are the main direct driving forces of urban expansion. The AGH enhances the pace of urbanization, significantly altering the urban spatial structure and helping the city achieve a major transition from the West Lake Era to the Qiantang River Era. Furthermore, our research can provide insights into other cities that will host mega-sports events.

TI  - OC-SMART: A machine learning based data analysis platform for satellite ocean color sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We introduce a new platform, Ocean Color - Simultaneous Marine and Aerosol Retrieval Tool (OC-SMART), for analysis of data obtained by satellite ocean color sensors. OC-SMART is a multi-sensor data analysis platform which supports heritage, current, and possible future multi-spectral and hyper-spectral sensors from US, EU, Korea, Japan, and China, including SeaWiFS, Aqua/MODIS, SNPP/VIIRS, ISS/HICO, Landsat8/OLI, DSCOVR/EPIC, Sentinel-2/MSI, Sentinel-3/OLCI, COMS/GOCI, GCOM-C/SGLI and FengYun-3D/MERSI2. The products provided by OC-SMART include spectral normalized remote sensing reflectances (R-rs values), chlorophyll_a (CHL) concentrations, and spectral in-water inherent optical properties (IOPs) including absorption coefficients due to phytoplankton (a(ph)), absorption coefficients due to detritus and Gelbstoff (a(dg)) and backscattering coefficients due to particulates (b(bp)). Spectral aerosol optical depths (AODs) and cloud mask results are also provided by OC-SMART.The goal of OC-SMART is to improve the quality of global ocean color products retrieved from satellite sensors, especially under complex environmental conditions, such as coastal/inland turbid water areas and heavy aerosol loadings. Therefore, the atmospheric correction (AC) and ocean IOP algorithms in OC-SMART are driven by extensive radiative transfer (RT) simulations in conjunction with powerful machine learning techniques. To simulate top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiances, we solve the radiative transfer equation pertinent for the coupled atmosphere-ocean system. For each sensor, we have created about 13 million RT simulations and comprehensive training datasets to support the development of the machine learning AC and in-water IOP algorithms. The results, as demonstrated in this paper, are very promising. Not only does OC-SMART improve the quality of the retrieved water products, it also resolves the negative water-leaving radiance problem that has plagued heritage AC algorithms. The comprehensive training datasets created using multiple atmosphere, aerosol, and ocean IOP models ensure global and generic applicability of OC-SMART.The use of machine learning algorithms makes OC-SMART roughly 10 times faster than NASA's SeaDAS platform. OC-SMART also includes an advanced cloud screening algorithm and is resilient to the contamination by weak to moderate sunglint and cloud edges. It is therefore capable of recovering large amounts of data that are discarded by other algorithms (such as those implemented in NASA's SeaDAS package), especially in coastal areas. OC-SMART is currently available as a standalone Python package or as a plugin that can be installed in ESA's Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP).

TI  - Ocean surface wind speed retrieval from C-band quad-polarized SAR measurements at optimal spatial resolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - This work investigates the effect of the resampling spatial resolution (RSR) on the retrieval of ocean surface wind speed from satellite-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. For this purpose, 358 RADARSAT-2(RS-2) fine-beam quad-polarized SAR images and in-situ National Data Buoy Centre (NDBC) and China State Oceanic Administration (SOA) buoy measurements from selected geographic locations are used in this paper. In order to obtain better accuracy SAR-retrieved wind speeds, CMOD5.N function, Z2011 polarization ratio (PR) model and C2PO model constitute the best models for VV-, HH- and cross-polarized SAR images, respectively. The resulting statistical analysis suggests that better accuracy wind speeds can be retrieved at somewhat coarser resolutions. The optimal RSR for the VV-, HH-, VH- and HV-polarized channels are 850, 1050,1350 and 1450 m, respectively, with RMSEs of 1.74, 2.03, 1.61 and 1.83 m/s.

TI  - Satellite image texture captures vegetation heterogeneity and explains patterns of bird richness
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Addressing global declines in biodiversity requires accurate assessments of key environmental attributes determining patterns of species diversity. Spatial heterogeneity of vegetation strongly affects species diversity patterns, and measures of vegetation structure derived from lidar and satellite image texture analysis correlate well with species richness. Our goal here was to gain a better understanding of why image texture explains bird richness, by linking field-based measures of vegetation structure directly with both image texture and bird richness. In addition, we asked how image texture compares with lidar-based canopy height variability, and how sensor resolution affects the explanatory power of image texture. We generated texture metrics from 30 m (Landsat 8) and 10 m (Sentinel-2) resolution Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) imagery from 2017 to 2019. We compared textures with vegetation metrics and bird richness data from 27 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) terrestrial field sites across the continental US. Both 30 and 10 m resolution texture metrics were strongly correlated with lidar-based canopy height variability (vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.64 and 0.80, respectively). Texture was moderately correlated with field-based metrics, including variability of vegetation height and tree stem diameter, and foliage height diversity (range vertical bar r vertical bar = 0.31-0.52). Generally, 10 m resolution texture had stronger correlations with lidar and field-based metrics than 30 m resolution texture. In univariate linear models of total bird richness, 10 m resolution texture metrics also had higher explanatory power (up to R-adj(2) = 0.45), than 30 m texture metrics (up to R-adj(2) = 0.31). Among all metrics evaluated, the 10 m homogeneity texture was the best univariate predictor of total bird richness. In multivariate bird richness models that combined texture with lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based metrics, both 30 m and 10 m resolution texture metrics were selected in top-ranked models and independently contributed explanatory power (up to R-adj(2) = 46%). Lidar-based canopy height variability was also selected in a top-ranked model of total bird richness, but independently contributed only 15% of the variance explained. Our results show satellite image texture characterized multiple features of structural and compositional vegetation heterogeneity, complemented more commonly used metrics in models of bird richness and for some guilds outperformed both lidar-based canopy height variability and field-based vegetation measurements. Ours is the first study to directly link image texture both to specific components of vegetation heterogeneity and to bird richness across multiple ecoregions and spatial resolutions, thereby shedding light on habitat features underlying the strong correlation between image texture and biodiversity.

TI  - Using Sentinel-2 and canopy height models to derive a landscape-level biomass map covering multiple vegetation types
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation biomass is a globally important climate-relevant terrestrial carbon pool and also drives local hy-drological systems via evapotranspiration. Vegetation biomass of individual vegetation types has been successfully estimated from active and passive remote sensing data. However, for many tasks, landscape-level biomass maps across several vegetation types are more suitable than biomass maps of individual vegetation types. For example, the validation of ecohydrological models and carbon budgeting typically requires spatially continuous biomass estimates, independent from vegetation type. Studies that derive biomass estimates across multiple vegetation or land-cover types to merge them into a single landscape-level biomass map are still scarce, and corresponding workflows must be developed. Here, we present a workflow to derive biomass estimates on landscape-level for a large watershed in central Chile. Our workflow has three steps: First, we combine field plot based biomass estimates with spectral and structural information collected from Sentinel-2, TanDEM-X and airborne LiDAR data to map grassland, shrubland, native forests and pine plantation biomass using random forest regressions with an automatic feature selection. Second, we predict all models to the entire landscape. Third, we derive a land-cover map including the four considered vegetation types. We then use this land-cover map to assign the correct vegetation type-specific biomass estimate to each pixel according to one of the four considered vegetation types. Using a single repeatable workflow, we obtained biomass predictions comparable to earlier studies focusing on only one of the four vegetation types (Spearman correlation between 0.80 and 0.84; normalized-RMSE below 16 % for all vegetation types). For all woody vegetation types, height metrics were amongst the selected predictors, while for grasslands, only Sentinel-2 bands were selected. The land-cover was also mapped with high accuracy (OA = 83.1 %). The final landscape-level biomass map spatially agrees well with the known biomass distribution patterns in the watershed. Progressing from vegetation-type specific maps towards landscape-level biomass maps is an essential step towards integrating remote-sensing based biomass estimates into models for water and carbon management.

TI  - Early-time Light Curves of Type Ia Supernovae Observed with TESS
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We present the early-time light curves of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) observed in the first six sectors of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data. Ten of these SNe were discovered by ASAS-SN, seven by ATLAS, six by ZTF, and one by Gaia. For nine of these objects with sufficient dynamic range (>3.0 mag from detection to peak), we fit power-law models and searched for signatures of companion stars. We found a diversity of early-time light-curve shapes, although most of our sources are consistent with fireball models where the flux increases as proportional to t(2). Three SNe displayed a flatter rise with flux proportional to t. We did not find any obvious evidence for additional structures, such as multiple power-law components, in the early rising light curves. For assumptions about the SN properties and the observer viewing angle (ejecta mass of 1.4 M, expansion velocity of 10(4) km s(-1), opacity of 0.2 cm(2) g(-1), and viewing angle of 45 degrees) and a further assumption that any companion stars would be in Roche lobe overflow, it is possible to place upper limits on the radii of any companion stars. Six of the nine SNe had complete coverage of the early-time light curves, and we placed upper limits on the radii of companion stars of less than or similar to 32 R for these SNe, less than or similar to 20 R for five of the six, and less than or similar to 4 R for two of the six. The small sample size did not allow us to put limits on the occurrence rate of companion stars in the progenitors of SNe Ia. However, we expect that TESS observed enough SNe in its two-year primary mission (26 sectors) to either detect the signature of a large companion (R > 20 R) or constrain the occurrence rate of such systems, at least for the fiducial SN properties adopted here. We also show that TESS is capable of detecting emission from a 1 R companion for an SN Ia within 50 Mpc and has a reasonable chance of doing so after about six years.

TI  - Spatiotemporal assessment of actual evapotranspiration using satellite remote sensing technique in the Nile Delta, Egypt
T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Egypt's Nile delta area is a wealthy land for growing Egypt's principal crops such as rice. Being at the end of the Nile River the water shortage problem is very serious. Thus, water resource maintenance is necessary by tracking Actual crop evapotranspiration (ETC). The main aim of the recent study is to evaluate the ETC over the Mit-Yazid command area based on remote sensing methods daily and seasonally by Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) technique using 18 Landsat 8 images during the 2017 and 2018 summer season. To evaluate the performance of SEBAL algorithm derived ETC (ETC-SEBAL) in the same conditions, Fao-Penman-Monteith method has been used, by applying several performance criteria. The results which revealed the acceptable accuracy of SEBAL algorithms with Landsat 8 images, are adequately accurate with an appropriate estimate of ETC's distribution across the study area with R-2 = 0.843% and RMSE around 0.264 mm/day. Additionally, a field water equilibrium has been assessed using the ETC-SEBAL obtained, and the results show that the seasonal ETC was generality provided with water surface supply by (87,5%). Moreover, a new summer crop pattern vision is assumed for agricultural cultivation to maximize the water-saving for the selected pilot study area. (C) 2020 The Authors.

TI  - Merging High-Resolution Satellite Surface Radiation Data with Meteorological Sunshine Duration Observations over China from 1983 to 2017
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface solar radiation (R-s) is essential to climate studies. Thanks to long-term records from the Advanced Very High-Resolution Radiometers (AVHRR), the recent release of International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) HXG cloud products provide a promising opportunity for building long-term R-s data with high resolutions (3 h and 10 km). In this study, we compare three satellite R-s products based on AVHRR cloud products over China from 1983 to 2017 with direct observations of R-s and sunshine duration (SunDu)-derived R-s. The results show that SunDu-derived R-s have higher accuracy than the direct observed R-s at time scales of a month or longer by comparing with the satellite R-s products. SunDu-derived R-s is available from the 1960s at more than 2000 stations over China, which provides reliable decadal estimations of R-s. However, the three AVHRR-based satellite R-s products have significant biases in quantifying the trend of R-s from 1983 to 2016 (-4.28 W/m(2)/decade to 2.56 W/m(2)/decade) due to inhomogeneity in satellite cloud products and the lack of information on atmospheric aerosol optical depth. To adjust the inhomogeneity of the satellite R-s products, we propose a geographically weighted regression fusion method (HGWR) to merge ISCCP-HXG R-s with SunDu-derived R-s. The merged R-s product over China from 1983 to 2017 with a spatial resolution of 10 km produces nearly the same trend as that of the SunDu-derived R-s. This study makes a first attempt to adjust the inhomogeneity of satellite R-s products and provides the merged high-resolution R-s product from 1983 to 2017 over China, which can be downloaded freely.

TI  - Compliant Force Sensor-Less Capture of an Object in Orbit
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AEROSPACE AND ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Space robots have been proposed to perform several tasks in orbit, such as repairing, refueling, and assembly. All those activities require the robot to interact with external objects in a safe and compliant form to avoid high impact forces that may damage the robot's components or the object to manipulate. Impedance controllers have demonstrated to be a suitable approach to perform similar tasks in ground. Therefore, implementing and analyzing impedance-based techniques in space is also worthy of study. Not only that, but also, methods that can reduce the number of components, weight and complexity should be considered. This article proposes the use of the disturbance observer for the design of an impedance controller to perform a safe capture of a target satellite by a space robot. First, the observer aids in the determination of the contact force between the servicer and the target. Later, once the almost perfect match between the actual and estimated contact force is demonstrated, the estimated force is used as input for an impedance controller with trajectory tracking. The advantages of estimating the contact force instead of measuring it are also discussed in the document. The design of the impedance control is performed such that the capturing process is compliant and safe, and, thus, it can help to advance toward an autonomous capture of space objects. A simulation experiment was set up to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the contact force is bounded and behaves smoothly in a spring-mass-damper-like manner, imposing a stable contact between the robot's end effector and the servicer's capturing spot.

TI  - Assessing Remote Sensing Vegetation Index Sensitivities for Tall Fescue (<i>Schedonorus arundinaceus</i>) Plant Health with Varying Endophyte and Fertilizer Types: A Case for Improving Poultry Manuresheds
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tall fescue (Schedonorus arundinaceus) is a common perennial forage in cattle pastures of the southeastern United States. A mutualistic fungal endophyte normally infects the grass and produces ergot alkaloids toxic to livestock, but fungal biotypes that have no ergot alkaloid production have been developed. Here remote sensing methods were used to assess plant health in 1 ha grazed paddocks with application amongst different combinations of fertilizer sources (inorganic and broiler litter) and endophyte associations (wild, novel-tall fescue MaxQ type with novel endophyte, and free). Broiler litter fertilization is common in the region due to the presence of many chicken farms. Moreover, broiler litter costs are comparable to inorganic fertilizer depending on distance from source to application. Incorporating remote sensing, we tested the sensitivity of three indices: normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and land surface water index (LSWI) to assess fescue plant health. Indices were obtained from satellite imagery provided by Landsat 7 ETM+ between the years 2005 and 2009. Sensitivity analytics suggested that LSWI was the optimum index to determine fescue plant health. The year experiencing drought (determined by annual precipitation) showed significant difference between fertilizer types (p = 0.05) and a nearly significant difference between endophyte associations (p = 0.08). There was no significant difference in years with normal or wet precipitation rates due to tall fescue endophyte association or type of fertilization. Limited availability of satellite imagery during parts of the five years of study might have influenced outcomes of statistical analyses. Nevertheless, the data and findings point to the potential use of satellite imagery in assessing grazingland tall fescue health and advancing the concept of poultry manureshed in the region or elsewhere where poultry manure production is extensive.

TI  - Mapping 20 Years of Urban Expansion in 45 Urban Areas of Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - By 2050, half of the net increase in the world's population is expected to reside in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), driving high urbanization rates and drastic land cover changes. However, the data-scarce environment of SSA limits our understanding of the urban dynamics in the region. In this context, Earth Observation (EO) is an opportunity to gather accurate and up-to-date spatial information on urban extents. During the last decade, the adoption of open-access policies by major EO programs (CBERS, Landsat, Sentinel) has allowed the production of several global high resolution (10-30 m) maps of human settlements. However, mapping accuracies in SSA are usually lower, limited by the lack of reference datasets to support the training and the validation of the classification models. Here we propose a mapping approach based on multi-sensor satellite imagery (Landsat, Sentinel-1, Envisat, ERS) and volunteered geographic information (OpenStreetMap) to solve the challenges of urban remote sensing in SSA. The proposed mapping approach is assessed in 17 case studies for an average F1-score of 0.93, and applied in 45 urban areas of SSA to produce a dataset of urban expansion from 1995 to 2015. Across the case studies, built-up areas averaged a compound annual growth rate of 5.5% between 1995 and 2015. The comparison with local population dynamics reveals the heterogeneity of urban dynamics in SSA. Overall, population densities in built-up areas are decreasing. However, the impact of population growth on urban expansion differs depending on the size of the urban area and its income class.

TI  - An Improved Segmentation Method for Automatic Mapping of Cone Karst from Remote Sensing Data Based on DeepLab V3+Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The South China Karst, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) natural heritage site, is one of the world's most spectacular examples of humid tropical to subtropical karst landscapes. The Libo cone karst in the southern Guizhou Province is considered as the world reference site for these types of karst, forming a distinctive and beautiful landscape. Geomorphic information and spatial distribution of cone karst is essential for conservation and management for Libo heritage site. In this study, a deep learning (DL) method based on DeepLab V3+ network was proposed to document the cone karst landscape in Libo by multi-source data, including optical remote sensing images and digital elevation model (DEM) data. The training samples were generated by using Landsat remote sensing images and their combination with satellite derived DEM data. Each group of training dataset contains 898 samples. The input module of DeepLab V3+ network was improved to accept four-channel input data, i.e., combination of Landsat RGB images and DEM data. Our results suggest that the mean intersection over union (MIoU) using the four-channel data as training samples by a new DL-based pixel-level image segmentation approach is the highest, which can reach 95.5%. The proposed method can accomplish automatic extraction of cone karst landscape by self-learning of deep neural network, and therefore it can also provide a powerful and automatic tool for documenting other type of geological landscapes worldwide.

TI  - Reciprocal translation between SAR and optical remote sensing images with cascaded-residual adversarial networks
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-INFORMATION SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the advantages of all-weather and all-day high-resolution imaging, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are much less viewed and used by general people because human vision is not adapted to microwave scattering phenomenon. However, expert interpreters can be trained by comparing side-by-side SAR and optical images to learn the mapping rules from SAR to optical. This paper attempts to develop machine intelligence that is trainable with large-volume co-registered SAR and optical images to translate SAR images to optical version for assisted SAR image interpretation. Reciprocal SAR-optical image translation is a challenging task because it is a raw data translation between two physically very different sensing modalities. Inspired by recent progresses in image translation studies in computer vision, this paper tackles the problem of SAR-optical reciprocal translation with an adversarial network scheme where cascaded residual connections and hybrid L1-GAN loss are employed. It is trained and tested on both spaceborne Gaofen-3 (GF-3) and airborne Uninhabited Airborne Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) images. Results are presented for datasets of different resolutions and polarizations and compared with other state-of-the-art methods. The Frechet inception distance (FID) is used to quantitatively evaluate the translation performance. The possibility of unsupervised learning with unpaired/unregistered SAR and optical images is also explored. Results show that the proposed translation network works well under many scenarios and it could potentially be used for assisted SAR interpretation.

TI  - PHRASEOLOGICAL UNITS AS MEANS OF EXPRESSING THE EMOTIVITY IN THE TATAR LANGUAGE
T2  - REVISTA ENTRELINGUAS
M3  - Article
AB  - Systematization and description of the arsenal of linguistic means of expressing emotions represent one of the major tasks for linguistics that returns nowadays to the theory of Wilhelm von Humboldt, which in the early XIXth century appealed to study the language in close connection with individual speakers. A logical interest of the researchers to the processes of manifestation of emotions in the language has resulted in the formation of a new scientific field - linguistics of emotions aimed at the emotional environment of the language. In the Tatar language human emotions are verbalized mostly by the phraseological units representing various mental states of a person, one's inner world. Studying means of expressing emotive vocabulary illustrated by the phraseological units provides an opportunity to present the whole complex of means of the language and the speech, as well as contribute to understanding the mentality and psychology of a Tatar language person. This article covers the Tatar phraseological units expressing negative connotation. The theme group "anger" represents the object of research. The authors have studied the emotional and appraisal semantics of the given group of phraseological units and attempted the revealing the specificity of the way of thinking and the worldview of the Tatar people. The analysis revealed that the phraseological units of the studied group are characterized by a great diversity of lexical, semantic, emotional and appraisal aspects. The emotional and appraisal volume of the phraseological units varies depending on the emotional state of the speaker and on his attitude to the addressee. Cultural and connotative semantics of the phraseological units is closely connected to the Tatar people's worldview which has formed and has been enriched throughout the life experience.

TI  - Impact of Water Level Fluctuations on Habitats of Wintering Migratory Birds Based on Multispectral Data
T2  - SPECTROSCOPY AND SPECTRAL ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shengjin Lake wetland in Anhui Provinceis a typical lake wetland which located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China. It is an ideal wintering place for wintering migratory birds, especially rare cranes. The construction of water conservancy facilities has changed the natural connection of Shengjin Lake, and the lake water level has been affected by changes. Human-made control, which in turn causes changes in the landscape pattern, affects the habitat of over wintering migratory birds. In order to explore the influence of water level fluctuations on overwintering migratory birds, in this paper land use types in Shengjin Lake were classified based on Landsat-8 (OLI) multispectral remotesensing images, water level data were combined and migratory bird population characteristics data were selected, the landscape patch spectral feature index was ranked, the water level change law of the Shengjin Lake wetland in different hydrological periods was analyzed, the spatiotemporal change characteristics of wetland landscape patch spectral characteristics were explored, the natural wetland landscape pattern and the habitat change pattern of overwintering migratory birds were explored. The results showed that spatially the large patches areas were dominant in the wet season, and the medium patches areas have reached the peak in the dry season. The landscape patterns were well distributed in the ebb and dry season. The overall landscape showed that the large patches areas were dominant, small and complex; the small patches distribution were scattered, huge and regular; and the small and medium patches areas were uniform and different. In terms of time, the landscape patterns were changed with the water level, the total numbers of patches were increased firstly and then decreased with the rising of water level, while the numbers of small patches were changed mostly and their stability was poor, which were easily affected by the fluctuation of water level. The shape indexes of large patches were influenced greatly by the water level, which the shape index of large patches was tended to be complicated when the water level raised. The shape indexes of large patches werethe largest in the flood period, and were tended to be long and narrow. The effects of landscape edge were tended to be obvious, and the heterogeneity of internal structure was decreased; the fragrance diversity index in the four hydrological periods were 1. 754 2 (Flood Period), 1. 571 7 (Wet Period), 1. 762 3 (Ebb Period), and 1. 790 1 (Dry Period) respectively. The indexes of fragrance diversity were decreased, and the diversity of landscape types were tended to be single. Winter migratory birds habitat areas were negative correlation with the water level, the areas of three types including grass land, mudflats and reed shoal were tradeoffs and long-term equilibrium. The grass land areas were accounted for the highest in the habitat area which played a leading role (68. 01%), the overall habitat areas were peaked in the late migratory birds wintering (in the dry season), which were benefited by wintering birds for foraging behavior activities. Based on this conclusion, it is suggested that artificially regulating the water level of Shengjin lake by controlling sluice during the dry season of over wintering (August to January of the following year) could increase the area of each habitat type and provide excellent habitat for over wintering migratory birds.

TI  - Characteristics of Saline Soil in Extremely Arid Regions: A Case Study Using GF-3 and ALOS-2 Quad-Pol SAR Data in Qinghai, China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is a global problem, which seriously damages the ecological environment and considerably reduces agricultural productivity, especially in arid regions. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used in remote sensing due to its weather and sunlight independence. Polarimetric SAR has great potential for large-scale mapping and monitoring salt-affected soils. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of saline soil in extremely arid regions using dual-band quadrature-polarimetric (quad-pol) SAR images acquired by GF-3 (C-band) and ALOS-2 (L-band). Firstly, the effectiveness of the modified dielectric mixing model and integral equation model (IEM) in describing saline soil is evaluated. Secondly, the potential relationships between polarimetric parameters and salinity are discussed in both the C- and L-band, respectively, such as co-polarization ratio, scattering entropy H, and scattering angle alpha. Finally, a linear regression model for monitoring salt content is established. The main contributions of this article are as follows: (1) Simulation results suggest that the radar backscattering coefficient is a weak function of salinity at low water content, but our experimental data show that soil salinity significantly contributes to the radar backscattering coefficient, which indicates the modified dielectric mixing model and IEM model is not applicable in extremely arid areas. (2) A negative correlation between the co-polarization ratio and salinity is observed, and the correlation coefficients are 0.64 (C-band) and 0.71 (L-band). Besides, scattering entropy and scattering angle exhibit a positive correlation with salinity in the C-band with correlation coefficients 0.686 and 0.669, respectively, whereas a negative correlation is found in the L-band with correlation coefficients 0.682 and 0.680, respectively. This can be attributed to the different penetration depths and sensitivity to the surface roughness of the electromagnetic waves at two frequencies. (3) A regression model for salinity estimating based on radar backscattering coefficient, co-polarization ratio, and scattering entropy is established, with a determination coefficient (R2) of 0.79 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.56%, allowing us to determine soil salinity from quad-pol SAR images without using backscattering models. Therefore, our results can be a reference for future soil salinity monitoring and inversion.

TI  - Evaluation of Penman-Monteith Model Based on Sentinel-2 Data for the Estimation of Actual Evapotranspiration in Vineyards
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Water scarcity is one of the most important problems of agroecosystems in Mediterranean and semiarid areas, especially for species such as vineyards that largely depend on irrigation. Actual evapotranspiration (ET) is a variable that represents water consumption of a crop, integrating climate and biophysical variables. Actual evapotranspiration models based on remote sensing data from visible bands of Sentinel-2, including Penman-Monteith-Stewart (RS-PMS) and Penman-Monteith-Leuning (RS-PML), were evaluated at different temporal scales in a Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard (Vitis vinifera L.) located in central Chile, and their performance compared with independent ET measurements from an eddy covariance system (EC) and outputs from models based on thermal infrared data from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8, such as Mapping EvapoTranspiration with high Resolution and Internalized Calibration (METRIC) and Priestley-Taylor Two-Source Model (TSEB-PT). The RS-PMS model showed the best goodness of fit for all temporal scales evaluated, especially at instantaneous and daily ET, with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 28.9 Wm(-2) and 0.52 mm day(-1), respectively, and Willmott agreement index (d(1)) values of 0.77 at instantaneous scale and 0.7 at daily scale. Additionally, both approaches of RS-PM model were evaluated incorporating a soil evaporation estimation method, one considering the soil water content (f(SWC)) and the other hand, using the ratio of accumulated precipitation and equivalent evaporation (f(Zhang)), achieving the best fit at instantaneous scale for RS-PMS f(SWC) method with relative root mean squared error (%RMSE) of 15.2% in comparison to 58.8% of f(Zhang). Finally, the relevance of the RS-PMS model was highlighted in the assessment and monitoring of vineyard drip irrigation in terms of crop coefficient (Kc) estimation, which is one of the methods commonly used in irrigation planning, yielding a comparable Kc to the one obtained by the EC tower with a bias around 9%.

TI  - Geospatial Modeling of Nitrogen and Carbon Content and Stock in the Forest Litter Horizons Based on Sentinel-2 Multi-Seasonal Satellite Imagery
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The capabilities of Sentinel-2 optical multispectral satellite data for modeling nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) contents, their ratio (C : N), and stocks in the litter horizons of forest soils were assessed. The study was conducted in the Bryansk Forest Nature Reserve and its buffer zone. The organic horizon samples were taken on 33 plots selected with due account for the tree species diversity of the reserve's forests. Two layers of the organic horizon-L and FH-were sampled separately. The main variables for geospatial modeling were derived from a time series of eight Sentinel-2 multi-seasonal satellite images. Basic terrain characteristics and pixel coordinates were also added to variables' stack. We used random forest to build regression models and the corresponding standard methods to assess their performance. The best results were obtained for the C : N ratio: the coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.71 with a scaled root-mean-square error RMSE = 12.5% in the L layer, and R-2 = 0.83 with RMSE = 10.6% in the FH layer. For other models, the values of R-2 ranged from 0.23 to 0.61, and the RMSE ranged from 15.8 to 48.6% with the least reliable results for the N and C stocks. Satellite-based variables were most informative for the contents of N and C, and, notably, for the C : N ratio. The most significant periods in the time series were early spring, summer, and snowy winter. To conclude, Sentinel-2 satellite imagery can be successfully used for estimation and mapping the contents and stocks of N and C in the forest soil organic horizon as a free and relevant alternative to thematic data on the species composition and related properties of stands.

TI  - A Global Climatology of Dust Aerosols Based on Satellite Data: Spatial, Seasonal and Inter-Annual Patterns over the Period 2005-2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A satellite-based algorithm is developed and used to determine the presence of dust aerosols on a global scale. The algorithm uses as input aerosol optical properties from the MOderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)-Aqua Collection 6.1 and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI)-Aura version v003 (OMAER-UV) datasets and identifies the existence of dust aerosols in the atmosphere by applying specific thresholds, which ensure the coarse size and the absorptivity of dust aerosols, on the input optical properties. The utilized aerosol optical properties are the multiwavelength aerosol optical depth (AOD), the Aerosol Absorption Index (AI) and the angstrom ngstrom Exponent (a). The algorithm operates on a daily basis and at 1 degrees x 1 degrees latitude-longitude spatial resolution for the period 2005-2019 and computes the absolute and relative frequency of the occurrence of dust. The monthly and annual mean frequencies are calculated on a pixel level for each year of the study period, enabling the study of the seasonal as well as the inter-annual variation of dust aerosols' occurrence all over the globe. Temporal averaging is also applied to the annual values in order to estimate the 15-year climatological mean values. Apart from temporal, a spatial averaging is also applied for the entire globe as well as for specific regions of interest, namely great global deserts and areas of desert dust export. According to the algorithm results, the highest frequencies of dust occurrence (up to 160 days/year) are primarily observed over the western part of North Africa (Sahara), and over the broader area of Bodele, and secondarily over the Asian Taklamakan desert (140 days/year). For most of the study regions, the maximum frequencies appear in boreal spring and/or summer and the minimum ones in winter or autumn. A clear seasonality of global dust is revealed, with the lowest frequencies in November-December and the highest ones in June. Finally, an increasing trend of global dust frequency of occurrence from 2005 to 2019, equal to 56.2%, is also found. Such an increasing trend is observed over all study regions except for North Middle East, where a slight decreasing trend (-2.4%) is found.

TI  - Timed Ang2-Targeted Therapy Identifies the Angiopoietin-Tie Pathway as Key Regulator of Fatal Lymphogenous Metastasis
T2  - CANCER DISCOVERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent clinical and preclinical advances have highlighted the existence of a previously hypothesized lymphogenous route of metastasis. However, due to a lack of suitable preclinical modeling tools, its contribution to long-term disease outcome and relevance for therapy remain controversial. Here, we established a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) fragment-based tumor model uniquely sustaining a functional network of intratumoral lymphatics that facilitates seeding of fatal peripheral metastases. Multiregimen survival studies and correlative patient data identified primary tumor-derived Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) as a potent therapeutic target to restrict lymphogenous tumor cell dissemination. Mechanistically, tumor-associated lymphatic endothelial cells (EC), in contrast to blood vascular EC, were found to be critically addicted to the Angiopoietin-Tie pathway. Genetic manipulation experiments in combination with single-cell mapping revealed agonistically acting Ang2-Tie2 signaling as key regulator of lymphatic maintenance. Correspondingly, acute presurgical Ang2 neutralization was sufficient to prolong survival by regressing established intratumoral lymphatics, hence identifying a therapeutic regimen that warrants further clinical evaluation.SIGNIFICANCE: Exploiting multiple mouse tumor models including a unique GEMM-derived allograft system in combination with preclinical therapy designs closely matching the human situation, this study provides fundamental insight into the biology of tumor-associated lymphatic EC and defines an innovative presurgical therapeutic window of migrastatic Ang2 neutralization to restrict lymphogenous metastasis.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on air pollution levels in East Asia
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study leverages satellite remote sensing to investigate the impact of the coronavirus outbreak and the resulting lockdown of public venues on air pollution levels in East Asia. We analyze data from the Sentinel-5P and the Himawari-8 satellites to examine concentrations of NO2, HCHO, SO2, and CO, and the aerosol optical depth (AOD) over the BTH, Wuhan, Seoul, and Tokyo regions in February 2019 and February 2020. Results show that most of the concentrations of pollutants are lower than those of February 2019. Compared to other pollutants, NO2 experienced the most significant reductions by almost 54%, 83%, 33%, and 19% decrease in BTH, Wuhan, Seoul, and Tokyo, respectively. The greatest reductions in pollutants occurred in Wuhan, with a decrease of almost 83%, 11%, 71%, and 4% in the column densities of NO2, HCHO, SO2, and CO, respectively, and a decrease of about 62% in the AOD. Although NO2, CO, and formaldehyde concentrations decreased in the Seoul and Tokyo metropolitan areas compared to the previous year, concentrations of SO2 showed an increase in these two regions due to the effect of transport from polluted upwind regions. We also show that meteorological factors were not the main reason for the dramatic reductions of pollutants in the atmosphere. Moreover, an investigation of the HCHO/NO2 ratio shows that in many regions of East China, particularly in Wuhan, ozone production in February 2020 is less NOX saturated during the daytime than it was in February 2019. With large reductions in the concentrations of NO2 during lockdown situations, we find that significant increases in surface ozone in East China from February 2019 to February 2020 are likely the result of less reaction of NO and O-3 caused by significantly reduced NOX concentrations and less NOX saturation in East China during the daytime.

TI  - Field Geometry and the Spatial and Temporal Generalization of Crop Classification Algorithms-A Randomized Approach to Compare Pixel Based and Convolution Based Methods
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the ongoing trend towards deep learning in the remote sensing community, classical pixel based algorithms are often outperformed by convolution based image segmentation algorithms. This performance was mostly validated spatially, by splitting training and validation pixels for a given year. Though generalizing models temporally is potentially more difficult, it has been a recent trend to transfer models from one year to another, and therefore to validate temporally. The study argues that it is always important to check both, in order to generate models that are useful beyond the scope of the training data. It shows that convolutional neural networks have potential to generalize better than pixel based models, since they do not rely on phenological development alone, but can also consider object geometry and texture. The UNET classifier was able to achieve the highest F1 scores, averaging 0.61 in temporal validation samples, and 0.77 in spatial validation samples. The theoretical potential for overfitting geometry and just memorizing the shape of fields that are maize has been shown to be insignificant in practical applications. In conclusion, kernel based convolutions can offer a large contribution in making agricultural classification models more transferable, both to other regions and to other years.

TI  - Comparison of Three Serological Methods for the Epidemiological Investigation of TBE in Dogs
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus is an emerging pathogen that causes severe infections in humans. Infection risk areas are mostly defined based on the incidence of human cases, a method which does not work well in areas with sporadic TBE cases. Thus, sentinel animals may help to better estimate the existing risk. Serological tests should be thoroughly evaluated for this purpose. Here, we tested three test formats to assess the use of dogs as sentinel animals. A total of 208 dog sera from a known endemic area in Southern Germany were tested in an All-Species-ELISA and indirect immunofluorescence assays (IIFA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sensitivity and specificity for both were determined in comparison to the micro-neutralization test (NT) results. Of all 208 samples, 22.1% tested positive in the micro-NT. A total of 18.3% of the samples showed characteristic fluorescence in the IIFA and were, thus, judged positive. In comparison to the micro-NT, a sensitivity of 78.3% and a specificity of 98.8% was obtained. In the ELISA, 19.2% of samples tested positive, with a sensitivity of 84.8% and a specificity of 99.4%. The ELISA is a highly specific test for TBE-antibody detection in dogs and should be well suited for acute diagnostics. However, due to deficits in sensitivity, it cannot replace the NT, at least for epidemiological studies. With even lower specificity and sensitivity, the same applies to IIFA.

TI  - In-Depth Verification of Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X Geolocation Accuracy Using the Australian Corner Reflector Array
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article shows how the array of corner reflectors (CRs) in Queensland, Australia, together with highly accurate geodetic synthetic aperture radar (SAR) techniques-also called imaging geodesy-can be used to measure the absolute and relative geometric fidelity of SAR missions. We describe, in detail, the end-to-end methodology and apply it to TerraSAR-X Stripmap (SM) and ScanSAR (SC) data and to Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath (IW) data. Geometric distortions within images that are caused by commonly used SAR processor approximations are explained, and we show how to correct them during postprocessing. Our results, supported by the analysis of 140 images across the different SAR modes and using the 40 reflectors of the array, confirm our methodology and achieve the limits predicted by theory for both Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X. After our corrections, the Sentinel-1 residual errors are 6 cm in range and 26 cm in azimuth, including all error sources. The findings are confirmed by the mutual independent processing carried out at University of Zurich (UZH) and German Aerospace Center (DLR). This represents an improvement of the geolocation accuracy by approximately a factor of four in range and a factor of two in azimuth compared with the standard Sentinel-1 products. The TerraSAR-X results are even better. The achieved geolocation accuracy now approaches that of the global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based survey of the CRs positions, which highlights the potential of the end-to-end SAR methodology for imaging geodesy.

TI  - Modelling Accessibility to Urban Green Areas Using Open Earth Observations Data: A Novel Approach to Support the Urban SDG in Four European Cities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cities are recognised as key enablers for the world's sustainable future. Urban sprawl and inefficient use of land are important issues significantly impacting the provision and use of open green spaces. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 11.7.1 aims at globally monitoring the amount of land that is dedicated by cities for public space. In Europe, the indicator "Share of urban population without green urban areas in their neighbourhood" is supposed to correspond to the SDG11.7.1 but is currently on-hold due to methodological issues and lack of data. Moreover, to efficiently assess public space conditions, timely and spatially disaggregated information is essential but not yet widely adopted by urban practitioners. Hereafter, we use a combination of satellite and crowdsourced Earth Observations (EO) to model physical accessibility to urban green spaces in four European cities. Findings suggest that it is technically feasible to derive information on the share of urban population without green urban areas in their neighbourhood. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology represents a consistent, valid, reliable, low-cost, timely and continuous source of information for sustainable urban development. Open and free EO data can be a good complement to enhance official and traditional statistics on urban areas facilitating EU reporting against the SDG indicator for better comparison between EU countries.

TI  - Identifying groundwater discharge zones in the Central Mackenzie Valley using remotely sensed optical and thermal imagery
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Landsat 4-5 Thematic Mapper, Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager, and RapidEye-3 data sets were used to identify potential groundwater discharge zones, via icings, in the Central Mackenzie Valley (CMV) of the Northwest Territories. Given that this area is undergoing active shale oil exploration and climatic changes, identification of groundwater discharge zones is of great importance both for pinpointing potential contaminant transport pathways and for characterizing the hydrologic system. Following the work of Morse and Wolfe (2015), a series of image algorithms were applied to imagery for the entire CMV and for the Bogg Creek watershed (a sub watershed of the CMV) for selected years between 2004 and 2017. Icings were statistically examined for all of the selected years to determine whether a significant difference in their spatial occurrence existed. It was concluded that there was a significant difference in the spatial distribution of icings from year to year (alpha = 0.05), but that there were several places where icings were recurring. During the summer of 2018, these recurrent icings, which are expected to be spring sourced, were verified using a thermal camera aboard a helicopter, as well as in situ measurements of hydraulic gradient, groundwater geochemistry, and electroconductivity. Strong agreement was found between the mapped icings and summer field data, making them ideal field monitoring locations. Furthermore, identifying these discharge points remotely is expected to have drastically reduced the field efforts that would have been required to find them in situ. This work demonstrates the value of remote sensing methods for hydrogeological applications, particularly in remote northern locations.

TI  - The Communicative-Pragmatic Aspect of the Use of Paradoxes in Oscar Wilde's Comedy <i>An Ideal Husband</i>
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA FILOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article investigates the communicative-pragmatic aspect of the use of paradoxes in Oscar Wilde's comedy An Ideal Husband. Here, paradox is viewed as an utterance syntactically represented by a phrase, one or several sentences which deny commonly accepted opinions and stereotypes. It is alogical, contradictory and interprets well-known and familiar things in an unusual way. The research has demonstrated that, in the play, paradoxical utterances are used, predominantly, in speech acts of two characters - Lord Goring and Mrs. Cheveley. As a rule, they use paradoxes in situations of speech conflict and, less frequently, in situations of non-conflict speech interaction. In a one-way speech conflict situation paradoxes help Lord Goring resist the oppression of his farther Lord Caversham, who employs a confrontation strategy in conversations with his son. The paradoxes distort the meaning or reduce the axiological and pragmatic significance of Lord Caversham's utterances, which, as a rule, are critical or evaluating remarks, directive questions and categorical statements distinguished by subjectivity and bias. Some of Lord Goring's paradoxes make the judgments, opinions and propositions of his father appear comic, thus, their correctness, seriousness or acceptability are denied. A mutual speech conflict is realized in interaction between Lord Goring and Mrs. Cheveley. Both the interlocutors are involved in confrontation and use the speech strategy of dominance in order to take the leading role in dialogue. The implementation of the dominance strategy is accomplished through a skillful use of paradoxical utterances. By means of paradoxes, the characters justify their own opinions and actions, deny the sincerity, acceptability and expediency of the interlocutor's views and propositions, give (negative) assessment of their opponents' personality and behavior. Paradoxical utterances are also employed in speech situations of non-confrontational nature within the framework of the dominance strategy (Mrs. Cheveley and Sir Robert Chiltern) and, to a lesser degree, the cooperation strategy (Lord Goring and Sir Robert Chiltern). In the first case, paradoxes function as hints manifesting the speaker's communicative intention to show her superiority based on the possession of some special knowledge in order to impact the emotions and actions of the interlocutor. In the second case, paradoxes are aimed at defusing a tense situation and forming an empathetic connection between the speakers. Quite often, the semantic content of paradoxes is determined by the communicative situation of their usage and the speaker's personality. Paradoxes are created in a certain communicative context and lose their relevance when taken out of this context. They also express a character's subjective opinion which is often formed under the influence of strong (negative) emotions, or reflect a character's worldview and philosophy of life.

M3  - Article
AB  - A list of North Atlantic polar lows was compiled for 2015-2017. A total of 131 polar lows were found by analyzing the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) infrared imagery and auxiliary information. The study region was additionally divided by the 20 degrees W meridian to assess possible differences in the polar lows occurring in the western and eastern parts of the region. The highest polar low activity was found over the Barents Sea and the northern Norwegian Sea. A large number of polar lows over this region were dual or multiple. When considering such systems as a single event, more polar lows were found in 2015 over the Labrador Sea and southern Davis Strait, which is the region with the second highest number of polar lows. High interannual variability of polar low frequency was noted, which was more pronounced in the western part of the region. During the analyzed period, the largest number of polar lows occurred in January for the western part of the region and in February for the eastern part. The main polar low parameters were similar within the region, with the mean values slightly higher in the western part of the region, but all extreme high values were observed in the eastern part.

TI  - Analyzing the Spatiotemporal Uncertainty in Urbanization Predictions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With the availability of computational resources, geographical information systems, and remote sensing data, urban growth modeling has become a viable tool for predicting urbanization of cities and towns, regions, and nations around the world. This information allows policy makers, urban planners, environmental and civil organizations to make investments, design infrastructure, extend public utility networks, plan housing solutions, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Despite its importance, urban growth models often discard the spatiotemporal uncertainties in their prediction estimates. In this paper, we analyzed the uncertainty in the urban land predictions by comparing the outcomes of two different growth models, one based on a widely applied cellular automata model known as the SLEUTH CA and the other one based on a previously published machine learning framework. We selected these two models because they are complementary, the first is based on human knowledge and pre-defined and understandable policies while the second is more data-driven and might be less influenced by any a priori knowledge or bias. To test our methodology, we chose the cities of Jiaxing and Lishui in China because they are representative of new town planning policies and have different characteristics in terms of land extension, geographical conditions, growth rates, and economic drivers. We focused on the spatiotemporal uncertainty, understood as the inherent doubt in the predictions of where and when will a piece of land become urban, using the concepts of certainty area in space and certainty area in time. The proposed analyses in this paper aim to contribute to better urban planning exercises, and they can be extended to other cities worldwide.

TI  - Multi-Temporal Land Surface Temperature and Vegetation Greenness in Urban Green Spaces of Puebla, Mexico
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban heat island (UHI) effect is a global problem that is likely to grow as a result of urban population expansion. Multiple studies conclude that green spaces and waterbodies can reduce urban heat islands. However, previous studies often treat urban green spaces (UGSs) as static or limit the number of green spaces investigated within a city. Cognizant of these shortcomings, Landsat derived vegetation and land surface temperature (LST) metrics for 80 urban green spaces in Puebla, Mexico, over a 34-year (1986-2019) and a 20-year (2000-2019) period were studied. To create a photo library, 73 of these green spaces were visited and the available land cover types were recorded. Green spaces with Indian laurel were found to be much greener and vegetation index values remained relatively stable compared to green spaces with mixed vegetation cover. Similarly, green spaces with large waterbodies were cooler than those without water. These results show that larger green spaces were significantly cooler (p < 0.01) and that size can explain almost 30% of temperature variability. Furthermore, green spaces with higher vegetation index values were significantly cooler (p < 0.01), and the relationship between greenness and temperature strengthened over time.

AB  - BackgroundThe rising incidence of visceral leishmaniasis due to Leishmania infantum requires novel methods to control transmission by the sand fly vector. Indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS) against these largely exophilic / exophagic vectors may not be the most effective method. A synthetic copy of the male sex-aggregation pheromone of the key vector species Lutzomyia longipalpis in the Americas, was co-located with residual pyrethroid insecticide, and tested for its effects on vector abundance, hence potential transmission, in a Brazilian community study.MethodsHouses within eight defined semi-urban blocks in an endemic municipality in Brazil were randomised to synthetic pheromone + insecticide or to placebo treatments. A similar number of houses located >100m from each block were placebo treated and considered as "True Controls" (thus, analysed as three trial arms). Insecticide was sprayed on a 2.6m(2) surface area of the property boundary or outbuilding wall, co-located within one metre of 50mg synthetic pheromone in controlled-release dispensers. Vector numbers captured in nearby CDC light traps were recorded at monthly intervals over 3 months post intervention. Recruited sentinel houses under True Control and pheromone + insecticide treatments were similarly monitored at 7-9 day intervals. The intervention effects were estimated by mixed effects negative binomial models compared to the True Control group.ResultsDose-response field assays using 50mg of the synthetic pheromone captured a mean 4.8 (95% C.L.: 3.91, 5.80) to 6.3 (95% C.L.: 3.24, 12.11) times more vectors (female Lu. longipalpis) than using 10mg of synthetic pheromone. The intervention reduced household female vector abundance by 59% (C.L.: 48.7, 66.7%) (IRR = 0.41) estimated by the cross-sectional community study, and by 70% (C.L.: 56.7%, 78.8%) estimated by the longitudinal sentinel study. Similar reductions in male Lu. longipalpis were observed. Beneficial spill-over intervention effects were also observed at nearby untreated households with a mean reduction of 24% (95% C.L.: 0.050%, 39.8%) in female vectors. The spill-over effect in untreated houses was 44% (95% C.L.: 29.7%, 56.1%) as effective as the intervention in pheromone-treated houses. Ownership of chickens increased the intervention effects in both treated and untreated houses, attributed to the suspected synergistic attraction of the synthetic pheromone and chicken kairomones. The variation in IRR between study blocks was not associated with inter-household distances, household densities, or coverage (proportion of total households treated).ConclusionsThe study confirms the entomological efficacy of the lure-and-kill method to reduce the abundance of this important sand fly vector in treated and untreated homesteads. The outcomes were achieved by low coverage and using only 1-2% of the quantity of insecticide as normally required for IRS, indicating the potential cost-effectiveness of this method. Implications for programmatic deployment of this vector control method are discussed.Author summaryThe predominant sand fly vector of the intracellular parasite Leishmania infantum, that causes human and canine visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas, is Lutzomyia longipalpis. Vector control tools to reduce transmission are needed. A sex-aggregation pheromone released by male Lu. longipalpis attracts female conspecifics which facilitates blood-feeding and transmission. This study, conducted in Brazil, quantifies the effects of community deployment of a synthetic version of the sex-aggregation pheromone, in a controlled-release dispenser, and co-located with lethal insecticide applied to a small area of the household compound or outbuilding wall. 50mg synthetic pheromone dispensers were used since they attracted substantially more vectors than 10mg dispensers. Deploying this novel lure-and-kill method to houses in eight replicate study blocks in two suburban endemic areas, demonstrated that it reduces vector numbers at both pheromone + insecticide treated houses, and neighbouring untreated houses. The presence of chickens (a known additional attraction to blood-seeking female Lu. longipalpis) increased the beneficial effects of the intervention. The method used only 1-2% of the quantity of insecticide necessary for IRS for an average sized house. The results demonstrate the efficacy and potential cost-effectiveness of this novel lure-and-kill control method.

TI  - Permuted Spectral and Permuted Spectral-Spatial CNN Models for PolSAR-Multispectral Data based Land Cover Classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is a challenge to develop methods which can process the polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) and multispectral (MS) data modalities together without losing information from either for remote sensing applications. This paper presents a study which attempts to introduce novel deep learning-based remote sensing data processing frameworks that utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in both spatial and spectral domains to perform land cover (LC) classification with PolSAR-MS data. Also since earth observation remotely sensed data have usually larger spectral depth than normal camera image data, exploiting the spectral information in remote sensing (RS) data is crucial as well. In fact, convolutions in the sub-spectral space are intuitive and alternative to the process of feature selection. Recently, researchers have gained success in exploiting the spectral information of RS data, especially the hyperspectral data with CNNs. In this paper, exploitation of the spectral information in the PolSAR-MS data via a permuted localized spectral convolution along with localized spatial convolution is proposed. Further, the study in this paper also establishes the significance of performing permuted localized spectral convolutions over non-localized or localized spectral convolutions. Two models are proposed, namely a permuted local spectral convolutional network (Perm-LS-CNN) and a permuted local spectral-spatial convolutional network (Perm-LSS-CNN). These models are trained on ground truth class data points measured directly on the terrain. The evaluation of the generalization performance is done using ground truth knowledge on selected well-known regions in the study areas. Comparison with other popular machine learning classifiers shows that the Perm-LSS-CNN model provides better classification results in terms of both accuracy and generalization.

TI  - Impact of restaging lymphadenectomy after sentinel node biopsy on endometrial cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY AND REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Approximately 10 % of patients with an intra-operative diagnosis of low-risk endometrial cancer (EC) will be upstaged after a definitive histological evaluation of hysterectomy and bilateral adnexectomy samples. This study aimed to explore the results associated with the performance of pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy for restaging after upstaging/upgrading these patients, and to compare those who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) in the first procedure with those who did not.Materials and methods: This retrospective cohort study included 27 patients diagnosed with low-risk EC (based on the criteria of the European Society of Medical Oncology/European Society of Gynecological Oncology/European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology), who underwent surgical laparoscopic restaging due to upstaging based on the final histological result at Hospital Universitario Donostia from April 2013 to September 2018. Surgical and oncological results were compared between patients who underwent hysterectomy and double adnexectomy without any additional procedures (SNB-; n = 17) and patients who also underwent pelvic&aortic sentinel node biopsysen (SNB+; n = 10). The main outcome evaluated in the study was intra-operative complications. Secondary outcomes were mean operative time, length of hospital stay, number of nodes obtained, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS).Results: The median duration of restaging surgery was 240 [interquartile range (IQR) 180-300) min in the SNB(-) group and 300 (IQR 247.5-330) min in the SNB(+) group; this difference was significant (onesided Student's t-test, p = 0.0295). With regard to intra-operative complications, there were 17.65 % and 40 % in the SNB(-) and SNB(+) groups, respectively, all of which were vascular; this difference was not significant. There were no significant difference in the length of hospital stay, number of pelvic nodes obtained, PFS or OS between the groups.Conclusion: Women with EC who require lymph node restaging due to upstaging, and have previously undergone SNB, experience more surgical complications and a longer operative time. The authors advise against performing second restaging surgery in these patients. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Use of Sentinel-1 Multi-Configuration and Multi-Temporal Series for Monitoring Parameters of Winter Wheat
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study aims to investigate the potential of multi-configuration Sentinel-1 (S-1) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images for characterizing four wheat parameters: total fresh mass (TFM), total dry mass (TDM), plant heights (He), and water content (WC). Because they are almost independent on the weather conditions, we have chosen to use only SAR. Samples of wheat parameters were collected over seven fields (three irrigated and four rainfed fields) in Southwestern France. We first analyzed the temporal behaviors of wheat parameters (He, TDM, TFM and WC) between February and June 2016. Then, the temporal profiles of the S-1 backscattering coefficients (VV, VH), the difference (VH - VV), the sum of the polarizations (VH + VV) and their cumulative values are analyzed for two orbits (30 and 132) during the wheat-growing season (from January to July 2016). After that, S-1 signals were statistically compared with all crop parameters considering the impact of pass orbit, irrigation and two vegetative periods in order to identify the best S-1 configuration for estimating crop parameters. Interesting S-1 backscattering behaviors were observed with the various wheat parameters after separating irrigation impacts and vegetative periods. For the orbit 30 (mean incidence angle of 33.6 degrees); results show that the best S-1 configurations (with coefficient of determination (R-2) > 0.7) were obtained using the VV and VH + VV as a function of the He, TDM and WC, over irrigated fields and during the second vegetative period. For the orbit 132 (mean incidence angle of 43.4 degrees), the highest dynamic sensitivities (R-2 > 0.8) were observed for the VV and VH + VV configurations with He, TDM and TFM over irrigated fields during the first vegetative period. Overall, the sensitivity of S-1 data to wheat variables depended on the radar configuration (orbits and polarizations), the vegetative periods and was often better over irrigated fields in comparison with rainfed ones. Significant improvements of the determination coefficients were obtained when the cumulative (VH + VV) index was considered for He (R-2 > 0.9), TDM (R-2 > 0.9) and TFM (R-2 > 0.75) for irrigated fields, all along the crop cycle. The estimate of WC was more limited (R-2 > 0.6) and remained limited to the second period of the vegetation cycle (from flowering onwards). Whatever parameters were considered, the relative errors never exceeded 23%. This study has shown the importance of considering the agricultural practices (irrigation) and vegetative periods to effectively monitor some wheat parameters with S-1 data.

TI  - Impact of Land Use Change on Non-Point Source Pollution in a Semi-Arid Catchment under Rapid Urbanisation in Bolivia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in pollution pressure exerted on the Rocha River in Bolivia from diffuse sources were assessed using potential non-point pollution indexes (PNPI) for 1997 and 2017. PNPI is a simple, low-effort, time- and resource-saving method suitable for data-scarce regions, as it works at catchment level with commonly available geographical data. Land use type (obtained by Landsat imagery classification), runoff (determined by runoff coefficient characterisation) and distance to river network (calculated at perpendicular distance) were each transformed into corresponding indicators to determine their relative importance in generating pollution. Weighted sum, a multi-criteria analysis tool in the GIS environment, was used to combine indicators with weighting values. Different weighting values were assigned to each of the indicators resulting in a set of six equations. The results showed that higher PNPI values corresponded to human settlements with high population density, higher runoff values and shorter distance to river network, while lower PNPI values corresponded to semi-natural land use type, lower runoff coefficient and longer distances to river. PNPI values were positively correlated with measured nitrate and phosphate concentrations at six sub-catchment outlets. The correlation was statistical significant for phosphate in 2017. Maps were produced to identify priority source areas that are more likely to generate pollution, which is important information for future management.

TI  - Integrating MODIS and Landsat Data for Land Cover Classification by Multilevel Decision Rule
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - In some cloudy and rainy regions, the cloud cover is high in moderate-high resolution remote sensing images collected by satellites with a low revisit cycle, such as Landsat. This presents an obstacle for classifying land cover in cloud-covered parts of the image. A decision fusion scheme is proposed for improving land cover classification accuracy by integrating the complementary information of MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) time series data with Landsat moderate-high spatial resolution data. The multilevel decision fusion method includes two processes. First, MODIS and Landsat data are pre-classified by fuzzy classifiers. Second, the pre-classified results are assembled according to their assessed performance. Thus, better pre-classified results are retained and worse pre-classified results are restrained. For the purpose of solving the resolution difference between MODIS and Landsat data, the proposed fusion scheme employs an object-oriented weight assignment method. A decision rule based on a compromise operator is applied to assemble pre-classified results. Three levels of data containing different types of information are combined, namely the MODIS pixel-level and object-level data, and the Landsat pixel-level data. The multilevel decision fusion scheme was tested on a site in northeast Thailand. The fusion results were compared with the single data source classification results, showing that the multilevel decision fusion results had a higher overall accuracy. The overall accuracy is improved by more than 5 percent. The method was also compared to the two-level combination results and a weighted sum decision rule-based approach. A comparison experiment showed that the multilevel decision fusion rule had a higher overall accuracy than the weighted sum decision rule-based approach and the low-level combination approach. A major limitation of the method is that the accuracy of some of the land covers, where areas are small, are not as improved as the overall accuracy.

TI  - Effectively Extracting Iceberg Freeboard Using Bi-Temporal Landsat-8 Panchromatic Image Shadows
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The freshwater flux from icebergs into the Southern Ocean plays an important role in the global climate through its impact on the deep-water formation. Large uncertainties exist in the ice volume transported by Southern Ocean icebergs due to the sparse spatial and temporal coverage of observations, especially observations of ice thickness. The iceberg freeboard is a critical geometric parameter for measuring the thickness of an iceberg and then estimating its volume. This study developed a new, highly efficient shadow-height method to precisely measure the freeboard of various icebergs surrounded by sea ice using Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager 15-m bi-temporal panchromatic image shadows at low-solar-elevation angles. We evaluated and validated shadow length precision according to bi-temporal measurements and comparison with the measurements from the unmanned aerial vehicle. We determined freeboard precision according to shadow length precision and solar elevation angle. In our case study area, 4832 available freeboard measuring points with shadow length precision better than 2 pixels covered 376 icebergs with sizes ranging from 0.002 to 0.7 km(2) and with freeboard ranging from 2.3 to 83.4 m. At the solar elevation angles of 5.2 degrees, the freeboard precision of 64.1% data could reach 1 m and 86.9% could reach 2 m. Our proposed method effectively filled in the data gap of existing freeboard measurement methods.

TI  - Thermal Summer Diurnal Hot-Spot Analysis: The Role of Local Urban Features Layers
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was focused on the metropolitan area of Florence in Tuscany (Italy) with the aim of mapping and evaluating thermal summer diurnal hot- and cool-spots in relation to the features of greening, urban surfaces, and city morphology. The work was driven by Landsat 8 land surface temperature (LST) data related to 2015-2019 summer daytime periods. Hot-spot analysis was performed adopting Getis-Ord Gi* spatial statistics applied on mean summer LST datasets to obtain location and boundaries of hot- and cool-spot areas. Each hot- and cool-spot was classified by using three significance threshold levels: 90% (LEVEL-1), 95% (LEVEL-2), and 99% (LEVEL-3). A set of open data urban elements directly or indirectly related to LST at local scale were calculated for each hot- and cool-spot area: (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), (2) tree cover (TC), (3) water bodies (WB), (4) impervious areas (IA), (5) mean spatial albedo (ALB), (6) surface areas (SA), (7) Shape index (SI), (8) Sky View Factor (SVF), (9) theoretical solar radiation (RJ), and (10) mean population density (PD). A General Dominance Analysis (GDA) framework was adopted to investigate the relative importance of urban factors affecting thermal hot- and cool-spot areas. The results showed that 11.5% of the studied area is affected by cool-spots and 6.5% by hot-spots. The average LST variation between hot- and cold-spot areas was about 10 degrees C and it was 15 degrees C among the extreme hot- and cool-spot levels (LEVEL-3). Hot-spot detection was magnified by the role of vegetation (NDVI and TC) combined with the significant contribution of other urban elements. In particular, TC, NDVI and ALB were identified as the most significant predictors (p-values < 0.001) of the most extreme cool-spot level (LEVEL-3). NDVI, PD, ALB, and SVF were selected as the most significant predictors (p-values < 0.05 for PD and SVF; p-values < 0.001 for NDVI and ALB) of the hot-spot LEVEL-3. In this study, a reproducible methodology was developed applicable to any urban context by using available open data sources.

TI  - Differential optical-path approach to improving the performance of Multiple-Slit Streak Tube Imaging LiDAR
T2  - MEASUREMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A new Multiple-Slit Streak Tube Imaging LiDAR (MS-STIL) system based on differential optical path is proposed, with mathematical model of this system established and verified. Multiple simulations are conducted before drawing the conclusions. Determining the position of the low sensitivity peak point of traditional streak spot in the traditional system is converted to determining the position of a high sensitivity zero-crossing line of differential streak spot in the proposed system, where the optimal sensitivity of zero-crossing line can be obtained by adjusting the differential length of optical path and the sweeping speed of streak tube. The background noise is effectively suppressed in the proposed system, with higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the proposed system at same distance detection. The improvements above render higher three-dimensional imaging accuracy of the proposed system than the traditional system.

TI  - Why does the public support or oppose agricultural nutrient runoff regulations? The effects of political orientation, environmental worldview, and policy specific beliefs
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This research examines public acceptability of regulations to reduce agricultural nutrient runoff and curb Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). We tested the effects of two novel policy specific beliefs including support for farmers' autonomy and support for external accountability. We also simultaneously tested the direct and indirect effects of political orientation and environmental worldview through a Direct Effect Model and a Mediation Model using structural equation modelling. Survey data were collected from 729 Ohio residents collected in November 2018. The specific regulatory policy measure we targeted is fines on excessive agricultural runoff. As hypothesized, autonomy beliefs negatively affect, and accountability positively affect support for fines. Both models revealed good fits. the direct effects of environmental worldviews political orientation were not supported. Instead, environmental worldviews indirectly increased support for fines through increased accountability beliefs and diminished autonomy beliefs. From the results, we suggest that when proposing suitable regulations for specific sites, policy makers and interest groups should be aware of differences in public support for farmer autonomy and external accountability, and that such differences are likely rooted in environmental worldviews. The study also suggests a need for coupled ecological and social studies that assess the likelihood of regional agricultural producers voluntarily adopting conservation practices and forecast the effectiveness of potential accountability measures.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability in the Glacier Snowline Altitude across High Mountain Asia and Potential Driving Factors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The glacier snowline altitude (SLA) at the end of the melt season is an indicator of the glacier equilibrium line altitude and can be used to estimate glacier mass balance and reconstruct past climate. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal variability in glacier SLA across High Mountain Asia, including the Altai Mountains, Karakoram Mountains, Western Himalayas, Gongga Mountains, Tian Shan, and Nyainqentanglha Mountains, over the past 30 years (1989-2019) to better elucidate the state of these mountain glaciers. Remote-sensing data are processed to delineate the glacier SLA across these mountainous regions, and nearby weather station data are incorporated to determine the potential relationships between SLA and temperature/precipitation. The mean SLAs across the Altai and Karakoram mountains ranged from 2860 +/- 169 m to 3200 +/- 152 m and from 5120 +/- 159 m to 5320 +/- 240 m, respectively, with both regions experiencing an average increase of up to 137 m over the past 30 years. Furthermore, the mean glacier SLAs across the Western Himalayas and Gongga Mountains increased by 190-282 m over the past 30 years, with both regions experiencing large fluctuations. In particular, the mean glacier SLA across the Western Himalayas varied from 4910 +/- 190 m in 1989 to 5380 +/- 164 m in 2000, and that across the Gongga Mountains varied from 4960 +/- 70 m in 1989 to 5330 +/- 100 m in 2012. Correlation analyses between glacier SLA and temperature/precipitation suggest that temperature is the primary factor influencing glacier SLA across these High Mountain Asia glaciers. There is a broad increase in glacier SLA from the Altai Mountains to the Karakoram Mountains, with a decrease in glacier SLA with decreasing latitude across the Himalayas; the maximum SLA occurs near the northern slopes of the Western Himalayas. The glacier SLA is lower on the eastern side of the Tibetan Plateau and exhibits a longitudinal distribution pattern. These results are expected to provide useful information for evaluating the state of High Mountain Asia glaciers, as well as their response and feedback to climate change.

TI  - Assessing the Potential of Geostationary Himawari-8 for Mapping Surface Total Suspended Solids and Its Diurnal Changes
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean color sensors, typically installed on polar-orbiting satellites, have been used to monitor oceanic processes for last three decades. However, their temporal resolution is not considered to be adequate for monitoring highly dynamic oceanic processes, especially when considering data gaps due to cloud contamination. The Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) onboard the Himawari-8, a geostationary satellite operated by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA), acquires imagery every 10 min at 500 m to 2000 m spatial resolution. The AHI sensor with three visible, one near-infrared (NIR), and two shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands displays good potential in monitoring oceanic processes at high temporal resolution. This study investigated and identified an appropriate atmospheric correction method for AHI data; developed a model for Total Suspended Solids (TSS) concentrations estimation using hyperspectral data and in-situ measurements of TSS; validated the model; and assessed its potential to capture diurnal changes using AHI imagery. Two image-based atmospheric correction methods, the NIR-SWIR method and the SWIR method were tested for correcting the AHI data. Then, the new model was applied to the atmospherically corrected AHI data to map TSS and its diurnal changes in the Pearl River Estuary (PRE) and neighboring coastal areas. The results indicated that the SWIR method outperformed the NIR-SWIR method, when compared to in-situ water-leaving reflectance data. The results showed a good agreement between the AHI-derived TSS and in-situ measured data with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85, mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.1 mg/L, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.9 mg/L, and average percentage difference (APD) of 30% (TSS range 1-40 mg/L). Moreover, the diurnal variation in the turbidity front, using the Normalized Suspended Material Index (NSMI), showed the capability of AHI data to track diurnal variation in turbidity fronts, due to high TSS concentrations at high temporal frequency. The present study indicates that AHI data with high image capturing frequency can be used to map surface TSS concentrations. These TSS measurements at high frequency are not only important for monitoring the sensitive coastal areas but also for scientific understanding of the spatial and temporal variation of TSS.

TI  - Land-Lake Linkage and Remote Sensing Application in Water Quality Monitoring in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, USA
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The state of water quality of lakes is highly related to watershed processes which will be responsible for the delivery of sediment, nutrients, and other pollutants to receiving water bodies. The spatiotemporal variability of water quality parameters along with the seasonal changes were studied for Lake Okeechobee, South Florida. The dynamics of selected four water quality parameters: total phosphate (TP), total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), total suspended solid (TSS), and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) were analyzed using data from satellites and water quality monitoring stations. Statistical approaches were used to establish correlation between reflectance and observed water quality records. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data (2000 and 2007) and Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) in 2015 in dry and wet seasons were used in the analysis of water quality variability in Lake Okeechobee. Water quality parameters were collected from twenty-six (26) monitoring stations for model development and validation. In the regression model developed, individual bands, band ratios and various combination of bands were used to establish correlation, and hence generate the models. A stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) approach was employed and the results showed that for the dry season, higher coefficient of determination (R-2) were found (R-2 = 0.84 for chl-a and R-2 = 0.67 for TSS) between observed water quality data and the reflectance data from the remotely-sensed data. For the wet season, the R-2 values were moderate (R-2 = 0.48 for chl-a and R-2 = 0.60 for TSS). It was also found that strong correlation was found for TP and TKN with chl-a, TSS, and selected band ratios. Total phosphate and TKN were estimated using best-fit multiple linear regression models as a function of reflectance data from Landsat TM and OLI, and ground data. This analysis showed a high coefficient of determination in dry season (R-2 = 0.92 for TP and R-2 = 0.94 for TKN) and in wet season (R-2 = 0.89 for TP and R-2 = 0.93 for TKN). Based on the findings, the Multiple linear regression (MLR) model can be a useful tool for monitoring large lakes like Lake Okeechobee and also predict the spatiotemporal variability of both optically active (Chl-a and TSS) and inactive water (nutrients) quality parameters.

TI  - An auto-encoder based classifier for crop mapping from multitemporal multispectral imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Crop mapping is a challenging task due to the spatial, spectral, and temporal variations within the cropland. These variations cause high intra-class and low inter-class variability problems. In this study, inspired by Deep Learning (DL) techniques, two Auto-Encoder (AE)-based learning schemes are proposed to exploit the spatio-temporal features in order to increase the stability of remotely sensed data classification for crop mapping. The first strategy is based on stacking the spatio-spectral features of different imaging dates to provide spatio-temporal spectral features and then feeding them as input to the Stacked AEs (SAEs). The spatio-spectral features are achieved by stacking the spectral features of all pixels in a Neighbourhood Window (NW) in each imaging date. The second strategy is an ensemble learning scheme, in which the base classifiers are SAEs trained considering different NW sizes. This method has an advantage such that while using the neighbourhood information, it maintains the classification accuracy in the boundary areas. To evaluate the performance of the proposed strategies, they were compared to the conventional classifiers, namely Linear Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Gaussian SVM, and Random Forest (RF). In addition, the effect of different train data sampling strategies and different proportions of train data on the classification performance was examined. The proposed ensemble (EN) strategy with a configuration of combining three NW sizes of 1, 3, and 5 pixels (i.e., 'AE, EN (1, 3, 5)') reached the highest accuracy in all experiments. Notably, in the experiment with a set of four imaging dates and 5.0% train data, it achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 95.26%, the Kappa coefficient (K) of 0.94, and the average class accuracy of 92.16%.

TI  - Data Assimilation of AOD and Estimation of Surface Particulate Matters over the Arctic
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, more accurate information on the levels of aerosol optical depth (AOD) was calculated from the assimilation of the modeled AOD based on the optimal interpolation method. Additionally, more realistic levels of surface particulate matters over the Arctic were estimated using the assimilated AOD based on the linear relationship between the particulate matters and AODs. In comparison to the MODIS observation, the assimilated AOD was much improved compared with the modeled AOD (e.g., increase in correlation coefficients from -0.15-0.26 to 0.17-0.76 over the Arctic). The newly inferred monthly averages of PM10 and PM2.5 for April-September 2008 were 2.18-3.70 mu g m(-3) and 0.85-1.68 mu g m(-3) over the Arctic, respectively. These corresponded to an increase of 140-180%, compared with the modeled PMs. In comparison to in-situ observation, the inferred PMs showed better performances than those from the simulations, particularly at Hyytiala station. Therefore, combining the model simulation and data assimilation provided more accurate concentrations of AOD, PM10, and PM2.5 than those only calculated from the model simulations.

TI  - Implementation of an Improved Water Change Tracking (IWCT) Algorithm: Monitoring the Water Changes in Tianjin over 1984-2019 Using Landsat Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tianjin is the largest open city along the coastline in Northern China, which has several important wetland ecosystems. However, no systematic study has assessed the water body changes over the past few decades for Tianjin, not to mention their response to human activities and climate change. Here, based on the water change tracking (WCT) algorithm, we proposed an improved water change tracking (IWCT) algorithm, which could remove built-up shade noise (account for 0.4%similar to 6.0% of the final water area) and correct omitted water pixels (account for 1.1%similar to 5.1% of the final water area) by taking the time-series data into consideration. The seasonal water product of the Global Surface Water Data (GSWD) was used to provide a comparison with the IWCT results. Significant changes in water bodies of the selected area in Tianjin were revealed from the time-series water maps. The permanent water area of Tianjin decreased 282.5 km(2) from 1984 to 2019. Each time after the dried-up period, due to government policies, the land reclamation happened in Tuanbo Birds Nature Reserve (TBNR), and, finally, 12.6 km(2) of the lake has been reclaimed. Meanwhile, 488.6 km(2) of land has been reclaimed from the sea along the coastal zone in the past 16 years at a speed of 28.74 km(2) yr(-1) in the Binhai New Area (BHNA). The method developed in this study could be extended to other sensors which have similar band settings with Landsat; the products acquired in this study could provide fundamental reference for the wetland management in Tianjin.

TI  - Sea Ice Image Classification Based on Heterogeneous Data Fusion and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea ice is one of the typical causes of marine disasters. Sea ice image classification is an important component of sea ice detection. Optical data contain rich spectral information, but they do not allow one to easily distinguish between ground objects with a similar spectrum and foreign objects with the same spectrum. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data contain rich texture information, but the data usually have a single source. The limitation of single-source data is that they do not allow for further improvements of the accuracy of remote sensing sea ice classification. In this paper, we propose a method for sea ice image classification based on deep learning and heterogeneous data fusion. Utilizing the advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in terms of depth feature extraction, we designed a deep learning network structure for SAR and optical images and achieve sea ice image classification through feature extraction and a feature-level fusion of heterogeneous data. For the SAR images, the improved spatial pyramid pooling (SPP) network was used and texture information on sea ice at different scales was extracted by depth. For the optical data, multi-level feature information on sea ice such as spatial and spectral information on different types of sea ice was extracted through a path aggregation network (PANet), which enabled low-level features to be fully utilized due to the gradual feature extraction of the convolution neural network. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, two sets of heterogeneous sentinel satellite data were used for sea ice classification in the Hudson Bay area. The experimental results show that compared with the typical image classification methods and other heterogeneous data fusion methods, the method proposed in this paper fully integrates multi-scale and multi-level texture and spectral information from heterogeneous data and achieves a better classification effect (96.61%, 95.69%).

TI  - Forest cover dynamics in Palas Valley Kohistan, Hindu Kush-Himalayan Mountains, Pakistan
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest cover change in the mountainous region is driven by a variety of anthropogenic and natural factors. The Hindu Kush-Himalayan Mountains has experienced a considerable vegetation cover change due to intensive human activities, such as population growth, proximate causes, accessibility, unstable political situations, government policy failure and poverty. The present study seeks to find out the impact of population growth and road network expansion on forest cover of Palas valley based on remotely sensed data and employing geospatial techniques. Changes in forest cover were determined by classifying time-series satellite images of Landsat and Sentinel 2A. The images of October 1980, 2000, 2010 and 2017 were classified into six land cover classes and then the impact of population growth and accessibility on forest cover was analyzed. Furthermore, forest cover and land-use change detection map was prepared using classified images of 1980 and 2017. The data were collected mainly from field visits (ground verification), census reports, Communication and Works Department, Kohistan. Satellite imageries were obtained from the United States Geological Survey's websites and classified in ERDAS imagine 2014 and ESRI ArcGIS 10.2.1 using supervised classification-maximum likelihood algorithm. Result of this study revealed that a substantial reduction in forest cover has taken place mainly in the proximity of human settlements. On the average, during the study period, annually more than 460 hectares of forest area has been converted into other uses.

TI  - Agricultural Monitoring Using Polarimetric Decomposition Parameters of Sentinel-1 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The time series of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are commonly and successfully used to monitor the biophysical parameters of agricultural fields. Because, until now, mainly backscatter coefficients have been analysed, this study examines the potentials of entropy, anisotropy, and alpha angle derived from a dual-polarimetric decomposition of Sentinel-1 data to monitor crop development. The temporal profiles of these parameters are analysed for wheat and barley in the vegetation periods 2017 and 2018 for 13 fields in two test sites in Northeast Germany. The relation between polarimetric parameters and biophysical parameters observed in the field is investigated using linear and exponential regression models that are evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-2) and the root mean square error (RMSE). The performance of single regression models is furthermore compared to those of multiple regression models, including backscatter coefficients in VV and VH polarisation as well as polarimetric decomposition parameters entropy and alpha. Characteristic temporal profiles of entropy, anisotropy, and alpha reflecting the main phenological changes in plants as well as the meteorological differences between the two years are observed for both crop types. The regression models perform best for data from the phenological growth stages tillering to booting. The highest R-2 values of the single regression models are reached for the plant height of wheat related to entropy and anisotropy with R-2 values of 0.64 and 0.61, respectively. The multiple regression models of VH, VV, entropy, and alpha outperform single regression models in most cases. R-2 values of multiple regression models of plant height (0.76), wet biomass (0.7), dry biomass (0.7), and vegetation water content (0.69) improve those of single regression models slightly by up to 0.05. Additionally, the RMSE values of the multiple regression models are around 10% lower compared to those of single regression models. The results indicate the capability of dual-polarimetric decomposition parameters in serving as meaningful input parameters for multiple regression models to improve the prediction of biophysical parameters. Additionally, their temporal profiles indicate phenological development dependent on meteorological conditions. Knowledge about biophysical parameter development and phenology is important for farmers to monitor crop growth variability during the vegetation period to adapt and to optimize field management.

TI  - Satellite-Based Personal UV Dose Estimation
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Epidemiology and public health research relating to solar ultraviolet (UV) exposure usually relies on dosimetry to measure UV doses received by individuals. However, measurement errors affect each dosimetry measurement by unknown amounts, complicating the analysis of such measurements and their relationship to the underlying population exposure and the associated health outcomes. This paper presents a new approach to estimate UV doses without the use of dosimeters. By combining new satellite-derived UV data to account for environmental factors and simulation-based exposure ratio (ER) modelling to account for individual factors, we are able to estimate doses for specific exposure periods. This is a significant step forward for alternative dosimetry techniques which have previously been limited to annual dose estimation. We compare our dose estimates with dosimeter measurements from skiers and builders in Switzerland. The dosimetry measurements are expected to be slightly below the true doses due to a variety of dosimeter-related measurement errors, mostly explaining why our estimates are greater than or equal to the corresponding dosimetry measurements. Our approach holds much promise as a low-cost way to either complement or substitute traditional dosimetry. It can be applied in a research context, but is also fundamentally well-suited to be used as the basis for a dose-estimating mobile app that does not require an external device.

TI  - Impact of COVID-19 lockdown on NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub> and PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations and assessing air quality changes in Baghdad, Iraq
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Covid-19 was first reported in Iraq on February 24, 2020. Since then, to prevent its propagation, the Iraqi government declared a state of health emergency. A set of rapid and strict countermeasures have taken, including locking down cities and limiting population's mobility. In this study, concentrations of four criteria pollutants, NO2, O-3, PM2.5 and PM10 before the lockdown from January 16 to February 29, 2020, and during four periods of partial and total lockdown from March 1 to July 24, 2020, in Baghdad were analysed. Overall, 6, 8 and 15% decreases in NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations, respectively in Baghdad during the 1st partial and total lockdown from March 1 to April 21, compared to the period before the lockdown. While, there were 13% increase in O-3 for same period. During the 2nd partial lockdown from June 14 to July 24, NO2 and PM2.5 decreases 20 and 2.5%, respectively. While, there were 525 and 56% increase in O-3 and PM10, respectively for same period. The air quality index (AQI) improved by 13% in Baghdad during the 1st partial lockdown from March 1 to April 21, compared to its pre-lockdown. The results of NO2 tropospheric column extracted from the Sentinel-5P satellite shown the NO2 emissions reduced up to 35 to 40% across Iraq, due to lockdown measures, between January and July, 2020, especially across the major cities such as Baghdad, Basra and Erbil. The lockdown due to COVID-19 has drastic effects on social and economic aspects. However, the lockdown also has some positive effect on natural environment and air quality improvement.
