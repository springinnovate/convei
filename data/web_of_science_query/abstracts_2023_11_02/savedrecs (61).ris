TI  - Adaptively truncated clutter-statistics-based variability index constant false-alarm-rate detector in SAR imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Since sea clutter samples are often contaminated by high-intensity outliers, target detection in nonhomogeneous sea clutter environments is challenging. An adaptively truncated clutter-statistics-based variability index constant false-alarm-rate (TSVI-CFAR) detector of Gaussian clutter in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is proposed. The proposed method is designed to improve the CFAR detection performance in a heterogeneous multitarget environment. TSVI-CFAR consists of three stages, i.e., clutter truncation, statistical parameter estimation, and CFAR detection. In the clutter truncation stage, the high-intensity outliers in the background window are eliminated through an adaptive threshold-based clutter truncation method. In the statistical parameter estimation stage, the parameters can be accurately estimated through the maximum-likelihood estimator. In the detection stage, the clutter background is categorized using the adaptively truncated clutter. Different types of CFAR detection methods are applied to the pixels under test of the categorized backgrounds. TSVI-CFAR has a higher detection rate and a low observed false alarm rate. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated using Gaofen-3 SAR data and Envisat-ASAR data. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Discrete-binary configuration of metaheuristic algorithms for RFM optimization in the case of limited GCPs
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Metaheuristic algorithms have been widely used in determining optimum rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs). By eliminating a number of unnecessary RPCs, these algorithms increase the accuracy of geometric correction of high-resolution satellite images. To this end, these algorithms use ordinary least squares and a number of ground control points (GCPs) to estimate RPCs. Due to the cost of GCP collection, using limited GCPs has become an attractive topic in various research studies. A configuration for RPC estimation using metaheuristic algorithms, namely, discrete-binary configuration for rational function model (DBRFM), is presented to find the optimal number and combination of RPCs in the case of limited GCPs. Based on the fact that the maximum number of RPCs is twice the number of GCPs, the particle/chromosome in the proposed configuration is composed of two binary and discrete parts. This configuration not only is compatible with the nature of the metaheuristic algorithms but also significantly reduces the search space. The proposed method has been tested on various types of remotely sensed data sets. The results of the experiments indicate the superiority of the DBRFM in comparison with the traditional binary configuration of metaheuristic algorithms.

TI  - Pre-flight calibration of a multi-angle polarimetric satellite sensor directional polarimetric camera
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - The directional polarimetric camera (DPC), developed by Anhui Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Science, is a satellite sensor used to observe the polarization and directionality of the earth's reflectance. It acquires the two-dimensional image of the earth with a large field of view (118.74 degrees) and a high spatial resolution (3.3 km) in 8 spectral bands. The first DPC was successfully launched onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite in May 2018, subject to the Chinese high-resolution earth observation program. In this paper, a set of systematic and complete pre-flight calibrations of the DPC are proposed to ensure the effective characterization for in-flight calibration, so as to ensure the accuracy of DPC measured radiation polarization data and the reliability of inversion results. Since the geometric calibration method of the DPC has been presented in an early companion paper [Appl. Opt. 59 226 (2020)], this paper will not introduce it in detail. Instead, the geometric calibration results of each spectral band together with a discussion on the origin of differences between spectral bands are analyzed, and the error analysis of the method is conducted. The results of the DPC geometric calibration is that the residuals of all spectral bands are less than 0.1 pixel. For radiometric calibration, the radiometric models of non-polarized bands and polarized bands are derived in detail, respectively, and the specific calibration methods with error analysis, equipment, and main results with their related accuracies for each parameter of the radiometric models are described. To verify the accuracy of calibration parameters, a series of polarization detection accuracy verification experiments based on a non-polarized radiation source, a polarizing system, and a natural scene were carried out. The experimental results show that the maximum deviation of degree of polarization between the set values of the polarizing system and measured values of the DPC at the corresponding positions of four field of view angles of 0, 15, 30, and 45 degrees of each polarized spectral band is 0.009, 0.004, and 0.003, respectively. The average error in measuring the degree of polarization of a non-polarized light source by all pixels in the three polarized bands is 0.0043, 0.0046, and 0.0037, respectively. And the relative deviations of each field of view are within 0.020 when the DPC and CE318N simultaneously measure the DoLP of sky. All of these prove the effectiveness of the pre-flight calibration.

TI  - New insights on Kimberlite emplacement around the Bundelkhand Craton using integrated satellite-based remote sensing, gravity and magnetic data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study attempts a conjugate analysis of satellite-based remote sensing, gravity, and magnetic data for evaluation of structures and tectonic for new insights on Kimberlite emplacement around the Bundelkhand Craton. Initially, Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) data has been enhanced using high-pass filtering for the delineation of lineaments. A combined lineament density map has been prepared from the processed Landsat image, Bouguer gravity, and RTP (Reduction to pole) magnetic data, which are further correlated with the reported Kimberlite/Lamproite pipes. The depth to the lithospheric Mantle of the study area has been estimated from EIGEN6C4 Bouguer gravity data using the Parker-Oldenburg algorithm. The association of the reported Kimberlite/Lamproite pipes in the study area have been analyzed with the i) composite lineament density map, ii) different mantle blocks of high and low Moho depths, iii) lithospheric mantle density, and iv) tectonic setting. Some new potential zones for Kimberlite/Lamproites emplacement have been identified based on the integrated analysis of the above mentioned parameters.

TI  - Superpixel-based imaging for residential area detection of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The precise and efficient location of residential areas using high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery is a popular research area in the field of Earth observation. Most of the existing approaches are supervised or semisupervised and use data training. Among the unsupervised approaches, corner density-based mapping using kernel density estimate has been widely employed to predict the presence of built-up areas. However, it is computationally time-consuming and the statistical threshold segmentation makes it difficult to obtain a stable and accurate output. To overcome this deficiency, a new two-stage object-oriented residential area extraction scheme was designed. First, a set of corners was extracted using the Gabor filter bank with structural tensor analysis to indicate candidate buildings. Then, instead of pixel units, our method takes superpixel-based image partitions as the primary calculation elements, and an object-oriented weighted sparse spatial voting technique was proposed to accelerate the generation of a residential area presence index. It was demonstrated that the superpixel-based voting strategy was not only efficient in accelerating the calculation process, but it also reduced the false negative rate in the final detection result. Second, a graph-cut method was employed to address the residential area segmentation by integrating a density map as a prior cue that preserves the boundary accuracy better than traditional statistical threshold methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method was evaluated using a series of experiments on the sets of high-resolution Google Earth, IKONOS, and GaoFen-2 (GF2) satellite imagery. The results showed that the proposed approach outperforms the existing algorithms in terms of computational speed and accuracy. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Corrected human papillomavirus vaccination rates for each birth fiscal year in Japan
T2  - CANCER SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In Japan, the serious adverse events after human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination were widely reported in the media. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW) announced the suspension of the governmental recommendation of HPV vaccine in 2013, and the inoculation rate has since sharply declined. The estimated inoculation rate for each birth fiscal year (FY) announced by the MHLW and the actual numbers for each birth FY surveyed by local governments were very different. In particular, the cumulative vaccination rate of girls born in FY2000 was regarded to be as high as 42.9% by the Council of the MHLW. However, this estimation included a confusion. When the suspension of the governmental recommendation was announced in FY2013, the girls born in FY2000 turned 13 years old, the targeted starting age of the HPV vaccination. The vaccination rate of this generation is considered to be quite low. The numbers were recalculated in this study. This study revealed that the real vaccination rate is only 14.3%. Female individuals born in or after FY2000 have been confirmed to be exposed to the same cervical cancer risk as before the HPV vaccine was introduced in Japan.

TI  - Monkeypox virus emergence in wild chimpanzees reveals distinct clinical outcomes and viral diversity
T2  - NATURE MICROBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monkeypox is caused by an emerging zoonotic virus. This study describes a detailed investigation into monkeypox outbreaks in chimpanzees through non-invasive environmental sampling, virus genomics, pathology, behavioural ecology and dietary metabarcoding.Monkeypox is a viral zoonotic disease on the rise across endemic habitats. Despite the growing importance of monkeypox virus, our knowledge on its host spectrum and sylvatic maintenance is limited. Here, we describe the recent repeated emergence of monkeypox virus in a wild, human-habituated western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus, hereafter chimpanzee) population from Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Through daily monitoring, we show that further to causing its typical exanthematous syndrome, monkeypox can present itself as a severe respiratory disease without a diffuse rash. By analysing 949 non-invasively collected samples, we identify the circulation of at least two distinct monkeypox virus lineages and document the shedding of infectious particles in faeces and flies, suggesting that they could mediate indirect transmission. We also show that the carnivorous component of the Tai chimpanzees' diet, mainly consisting of the sympatric monkeys they regularly hunt, did not change nor shift towards rodent consumption (the presumed reservoir) before the outbreaks, suggesting that the sudden emergence of monkeypox virus in this population is probably due to changes in the ecology of the virus itself. Using long-term mortality surveillance data from Tai National Park, we provide evidence of little to no prior viral activity over at least two decades. We conclude that great ape sentinel systems devoted to the longitudinal collection of behavioural and health data can help clarify the epidemiology and clinical presentation of zoonotic pathogens.

TI  - The Use of Periareolar Topical Lidocaine Jelly After Needle Localization May Reduce Pain of Subsequent Lymphoscintigraphy
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - PurposeTechnetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid (99mTc-SC) breast lymphoscintigraphy is commonly performed to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in patients diagnosed with breast carcinoma undergoing lumpectomy. The purpose of this report is to describe how the use of 2% topical lidocaine jelly immediately after the completion of needle localization and prior to scintigraphy may substantially reduce pain associated with the injection of 99mTc-SC.Materials and methodsThis was a quality improvement project. Patients were asked to score the severity of pain associated with the periareolar 99mTc-SC injections for sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy. In order to decrease the discomfort, topical lidocaine was applied to the periareolar skin after the completion of the needle localization, but prior to transferring the patient from the mammography room to the nuclear medicine department for the 99mTc-SC injections. At the time of 99mTc-SC injection, patients were asked to score the pain of injection from 0 (none) to 10 (worst).ResultsThe average pain score of the women who did not receive topical lidocaine jelly was 8 (range: 59). In the 10 women who received topical lidocaine jelly after needle localization, the average pain score was 2.5 (range: 1-5). Interestingly, the pain score for women who discussed the possible use of lidocaine jelly with the radiologists but still did not receive topical lidocaine jelly was also low at 6.5. For patients who received the lidocaine jelly only five minutes prior to injection, the average pain score was 6.ConclusionThe application of lidocaine jelly after the conclusion of needle localization, with a 15-40-minute delay prior to periareolar injections with 99mTc-SC for sentinel node lymphoscintigraphy, appears to substantially reduce the pain associated with the injection of 99mTc-SC.

TI  - Malignant melanoma The role of BRAF inhibition in malignant melanoma
T2  - ONKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The discovery of the BRAF mutation and its role in the pathogenesis of melanoma led to the establishment of targeted therapy with so-called BRAF and MEK inhibitors, which have significantly improved the disease course and prognosis of patients with metastatic melanoma with BRAF mutations. Materials and methods The relevant literature was analyzed and summarized. Results In addition to the microscopic tumor thickness of the primary tumor, histological evidence of ulceration and microscopic or macroscopic lymph node involvement of the sentinel lymph node and downstream lymph nodes are prognostically relevant. In high-risk patients (starting from stage IIC), molecular genetic analyses of the tumor material should be immediately performed to identify relevant mutations such as BRAF and, thereby, potential therapy options. Since the third and fourth quarters of 2018, respectively, both the PD-1 inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab and the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib have been available in Germany for tumor-free patients in the adjuvant situation (stage III). The "triple therapy" approach aims to combine the advantages of both treatment options, i.e., an often rapid response of targeted therapy with the long-lasting therapeutic response of immunotherapy. Conclusion Targeted therapy is an important therapeutic option in both the adjuvant and metastatic situation. Still, treatment in clinical trials represents the best chance for patients to benefit in the long-term from ongoing innovative therapy concepts.

TI  - Long-term outcome of pT1a-b, cN0 breast cancer without axillary dissection or staging: a prospective observational study of 1543 women
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The implementation of screening programmes in Sweden during the mid-1990s increased the number of small node-negative breast cancers. In this era before staging by sentinel node biopsy, routine axillary dissection for staging of early breast cancer was questioned owing to the increased morbidity and lack of perceived benefit. The long-term risk of axillary recurrence when axillary staging is omitted remains unclear.Methods This prospective observational multicentre cohort study included Swedish women diagnosed with breast cancer between 1997 and 2002. The patients had clinically node-negative, pT1a-b, grade I-II tumours. No axillary staging or dissection was performed. The primary outcome was ipsilateral axillary recurrence and survival.Results A total of 1543 patients were included. Breast-conserving surgery (BCS) was performed in 94 center dot 0 per cent and the rest underwent mastectomy. After surgery, 58 center dot 1 per cent of the women received adjuvant radiotherapy, 11 center dot 9 per cent adjuvant endocrine therapy and 31 center dot 5 per cent did not receive any adjuvant treatment. After a median follow-up of 15 center dot 5 years, 6 center dot 4 per cent developed contralateral breast cancer and 16 center dot 5 per cent experienced a recurrence. The first recurrence was local in 116, regional in 47 and distant in 59 patients. The breast cancer-specific survival rate was 93 center dot 7 per cent after 15 years. There were no differences in overall or breast cancer-specific survival between patients who received adjuvant radiotherapy and those who did not. Only 3 center dot 0 per cent of patients had an axillary recurrence, which was isolated in only 1 center dot 0 per cent.Conclusion Axillary surgery can safely be omitted in patients with low-grade, T1a-b, cN0 breast cancers. This large prospective cohort with 15-year follow-up had a very low incidence of axillary recurrences and high breast cancer-specific survival rate.

TI  - Fore-warning of early season agricultural drought condition over Indian region - a fractional wetness approach
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Fore-warning plays an essential role for effective drought mitigation planning. A new approach, i.e. fractional wetness (f(w)), has been proposed towards fore-warning of early season agricultural drought over Indian region. The optimum soil moisture triggers the subsequent crop sowing activities that has been conceptualized in this approach. Shortwave Angle Slope Index (SASI) images derived from time-series (2001-2012) MODIS data was used for fractional-wetness (f(w)) computation. f(w) is the surrogate indicator for the percentage moisture available for a given time, based on its long-term range. The zone-wise f(w)thresholds was developed to estimate the area-favourable-for-crop-sowing (AFCS), which was validated with subsequent months' crop-planted-area derived from fractional vegetation cover (f(c)). The mean absolute error (MAE) was found to be similar to 5.73% of the agricultural area. The present methodology is capable of fore-warning the agricultural-drought one month prior to the traditional method. Moreover, the comparison of predicted AFCS with all India food-grains area corroborates the feasibility of proposed approach in quantifying the agricultural-drought, in terms of its intensity, extent and progression.

TI  - Geospatial assessment of urban sprawl and landslide susceptibility around the Nainital lake, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslide is one of the challenges faced by mountainous regions due to natural phenomena and human activity. Nainital district in the state of Uttarakhand is one of the popular tourist spots in India. It is situated in a lesser Himalayan belt facing experiences number of landslides every year. This region comes under the Main Boundary Thrust and Main Central Thrust which are considered to be very sensitive for landslides. Landslide susceptibility mapping is a proficient tool to identify vulnerable zones for landslides. Remote sensing and geographic information system are very effective tools for collecting, analysing and interpreting land use data, and on the other hand, multi-criteria valuation (MCE) allows users for decision-making by considering various factors affecting the process of the landslide. The MCE technique was applied considering present land use/land cover, slope, drainage, lithology, geomorphology, and type of soil. Overlay analysis and land susceptibility mapping was carried out for the area around the Nainital lake. The study concludes with hot spot analysis and recommends mitigation measures like geotextiles, retaining walls and strict building by-laws for preventing landslides.

Unsupervised ship detection methods have a complex set of rules, while supervised methods, such as deep learning approaches, consume substantial time and manpower to make training samples. We demonstrate that ships in an SAR image can be detected by a weakly supervised convolutional neural network that combines new deep learning technology called class activation mapping with the conditional random field. Our model is trained using only SAR images with two global labels, namely, "ship" and "nonship," and produces three types of output: ship location heatmap, ship bounding box, and pixel-level segmentation product. Experiments on Chinese Gaofen-3 fine strip SAR images validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves higher detection accuracy and more intelligent detection characteristics.

TI  - Revealing 35 years of landcover dynamics in floodplains of trained lowland rivers using satellite data
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lacking substantial erosive and sedimentation forces, regulated rivers allow their floodplains to become overgrown with forest, increasing the flood risk of the hinterland. In the Netherlands, floodplains have therefore been subjected to interventions, like clear cutting, lowering and creation of side channels, and management, consisting of grazing and mowing. However, the comprehension of how those activities influence landcover dynamics is lacking. The aim of this study is therefore to investigate long-term landcover dynamics of a regulated river system through the lens of remote sensing. What transitions between landcover classes can be observed? And how (if) do management and interventions impact succession and retrogression of landcover classes? The study area comprised the upstream part of the Dutch Rhine River, its three branches and five adjacent floodplains. Satellite data (LandSat 5 and 8), encompassing a 35-year period (1984-2018), were used for studying landcover dynamics. Landcover classification was based on seven classes: water, built-up area, bare substrate, grass, herbaceous vegetation, shrubs and forest. Retrogression was highest for the landcover classes obstructing water flow (shrubs, forest and herbaceous vegetation), succession was most frequent on bare substrate, and water and grass were the most stable landcover classes. The regulated nature of the system became apparent from the spatial and temporal cacophony of landcover dynamics which differ from those of natural meandering rivers. This study showed that satellite data are useful for analyzing the impact of human activities within floodplains of regulated rivers and may assist in floodplain management aimed at combining water safety and nature policies.

TI  - Heidegger's Theory of Truth and its Importance for Quality of Qualitative Research
T2  - JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY OF EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - When reliability and validity were introduced as validation criteria for empirical research in the human sciences, quantitative research methods prevailed, and theory of science relied on neopositivism (Vienna Circle) or postpositivism (scientific realism). Within this worldview, notions of reliability and validity as criteria of scientific goodness were introduced. Reliability and validity were associated with the correspondence theory of truth, which is mostly ill-suited to the needs of qualitative research. For that reason, qualitative research must look for other kinds of validation criteria. The article elaborates the problems arising when the correspondence theory of truth is used as an ultimate criterion in evaluating qualitative research and proposes Heidegger's hermeneutical or alethetical idea of truth as a more suitable approach.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Patterns of Impervious Surface Area and Water Quality Response in the Fuxian Lake Watershed
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The increase of urbanization level has led to the rapid increase of impervious surface area (ISA). The aim of this work is to clarify the relationship between the ISA and water quality and lay a foundation for the improvement and protection of the water quality in the basin. Taking the Fuxian Lake Basin in Yunnan Province as an example, based on the Landsat ETM+ remote sensing image and the Gram-Schmidt (GS) image fusion algorithm, the four-terminal model and the linear spectral mixture model (LSMM) were used to extract the impervious surface of the watershed from 2006 to 2015. And statistical methods were used to distinguish its relationship with water quality. The results show that the four-terminal model and the linear spectral mixture model can effectively extract the impervious surface information of the Fuxian Lake Basin. The average root mean square error (RMS) of the image decomposition results from 2006 to 2015 was less than 0.02. In the past 10 years, the ISA has changed significantly in the Fuxian Lake Basin. The ISA showed an overall upward trend from 2006 to 2015. It increased from 24.73 km(2) in 2006 to 35.14 km(2) in 2015, an increase of 10.81 km(2). From the value anomaly, the ISA in 2006 and 2009 is lower than the multiyear average, and those in the other years are higher than the multiyear average. The percentage of ISA in the basin was significantly positively correlated with Chemical Oxygen Demand-Mn (CODMn) and total phosphorus (TP) (r is 0.772, 0.763), and the correlation in the flooding season was greater than that in the dry season. The ISA threshold for water quality deterioration is around 10% in the Fuxian Lake Basin. Reducing ISA coverage, controlling ISA to less than 10%, and preventing nonpoint source pollution during flooding season will be the best measures to effectively improve the water quality environment in the basin.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variations of the Water Loss and Gain Status at the Monthly Scale in Songnen Plain From 1961 to 2016
T2  - Journal of Ecology and Rural Environment
M3  - Article
AB  - Under the background of climate warming, it is a very realistic and important issue facing China that how to accurately analyze the water loss and gain status of agricultural ecosystems. In order to explore the water loss and gain status at the monthly scale in Songnen Plain, remote sensing data, long-time series meteorological data and soil data were used as base date. In this study, water loss and gain models, trend analysis and wavelet analysis were employed to analyze the spatial and temporal variations of water loss and gain status of Songnen Plain in each month of the crop growth cycle (May to September) from 1961 to 2016. The results show that; (1) From 1961 to 2016, the average potential evapotranspiration during the crop growth cycle was between 432.8 and 605.8 mm in Songnen Plain, and its general variation trend was -0.51 mm.a(-1). The monthly variation trends from May to September were -0.27, -0.16, -0.09, -0.03 and 0.02 mm.a(-1), respectively. (2) The water deficit in the study area was most severe in May and June. The areas with high water deficit were mainly located in the central and western parts of the Songnen Plain, with frequencies between 30% and 50%. The second serious occurred in September, and the areas with high water deficit were located in the northeast, and its frequency was between 20% and 30%. The water deficit was lightest in July and August. (3) According to the periodic regularity and change trend of water loss and gain status, each month showed a clear periodic change on the time scale of 15 years. In addition, from May to July the water loss and gain status showed a periodic downward trend, while for August and September the water loss and gain status showed an upward trend.

TI  - Influence of land use/land cover changes on surface temperature and its effect on crop yield in different agro-climatic regions of Indian Punjab
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is an important indicator of the earth's environmental analysis which is significantly affected by changes in land use/land cover (LULC). The Landsat 5, 7 and 8 satellite data of January and September of the years 1991, 2001, 2011 and 2016 was used to study the impact of LULC changes on LST and its effect on crop yield (rice and wheat) in SBS Nagar, Ludhiana and Bathinda districts representing three different agro-climatic zones of Punjab (India). The Landsat satellite imageries were classified for the major LULC classes (water, vegetation [including agriculture and forest], built-up and bare soil) in each district using different spectral indices. The results showed that vegetation is the key land provider for built-up development in SBS Nagar and Ludhiana districts, whereas bare soil and water bodies were the main contributor of land for expansion of built-up and vegetation over the years in Bathinda district. Compared with 1991, the surface temperature of all the land cover features has increased over the years and the increase in temperature was higher for built-up features. Among different districts, the rate of increase was highest in Ludhiana district due to higher urban sprawl. The increase in temperature was higher in the direction where land use has been changed from agriculture, bare soil and forest to urban. The air temperature in agro-climatic regions of Punjab can be estimated from LST by multiplying it with a factor of 0.86. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was significantly positively correlated with rice and wheat yield, but significantly negatively correlated with LST. It is concluded that there is potential link between LULC and crop yield via impacts on horizontal surface temperature gradients which can be differentiated from Landsat data.

TI  - A national fuel type mapping method improvement using sentinel-2 satellite data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite the fact that wildland fires have always been an integral part of many ecosystems, their increased frequency and intensity have reinforced the need of fire managers for updated and highly accurate information associated with the spatial distribution of forest fuels. In 2015, a fuel type mapping method was developed in the framework of the "National Observatory of Forest Fires (NOFFi)" project resulting in the generation of a national fuel type map. In this study, we aimed at examining the potential of the newly available Sentinel-2 satellite images for the improvement of the NOFFi's mapping method in terms of accuracy and update effectiveness of the national fuel type map. Results demonstrate Sentinel-2 data will likely improve the resolution and reliability of national fuel type maps, increasing mapping efficiency for operational purposes.

TI  - Assessment of winter season land surface temperature in the Himalayan regions around the Kullu area in India using landsat-8 data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we propose a modified thresholds method for the determination of land surface emissivity (LSE) for snow covered mountainous areas. The conventional Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholds method (NDVITHM) does not discriminate the snow covered pixels with soil pixels in assigning the LSE based on NDVI thresholds. In the proposed approach, we incorporate different thresholding rules based on the Normalized Differenced Snow Index and the S3 index for incorporating separability in the LSE for the snow covered pixels. The LSE thus derived is used to determine the land surface temperature using the Single Channel Method. The approach was evaluated for a study area around the Kullu Valley in the lower Indian Himalayas for a dataset of the winter season of Landsat-8 multispectral data. The observed coefficient of determination values indicated that the proposed method yielded better results with respect to the conventional NDVITHM approach.

AB  - The classification of land cover is the first step in the analysis and application of remote sensing data in land resources. How to solve the multi-category image recognition and meet certain precision is a key issue in remote sensing image research, which has very important theoretical significance and practical application value. In this study, the algorithm is improved on the basis of convolutional neural network, and experiments are carried out on multi-source remote sensing images with different geomorphologies taken under three different weather conditions to verify the effectiveness and scalability of the improved convolutional neural network. The research results show that the improved algorithm proposed in this paper has certain results in remote sensing image classification and can provide theoretical reference for subsequent related research.

TI  - Design of Advanced Offner-Type Convex Grating Spectral Radiation Calibration Optical System
T2  - ACTA OPTICA SINICA
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we propose a design method of advanced Offner-type convex grating spectral radiation calibration light source optical system to solve the problem of low energy output in case of digital tunable light sources. Further, we theoretically deduce the relation between slit and astigmatism of the Offner-type spectral imaging structure based on the theory of ray tracing. The residual astigmatism in the large slit of the Offner-type spectral imaging system is compensated using a double cylindrical lens. Using the proposed method, a traditional Offner-type spectral imaging system with a slit length of 0.1 mm and an advanced Offner-type spectral imaging system with a slit length of 8 mm arc designed having the same spectral range from 500 to 800 nm. The results indicate that the advanced Offner-type spectral imaging system exhibits good image quality and that the root mean square (RMS) radius of full field of view spot diagram is less than 8.1 mu m; the RMS radius along the Y direction is less than 6.7 mu m, which is within the size of a single pixel. The smile is 6.2% of the size of a single pixel, whereas color distortion is 5.8% of the size of a single pixel; thus, spectral overlapping and spectral offset arc diminished. Therefore, the proposed method has some research significance and engineering value to ensure the improved precision of spectral radiometric calibration in case of remote sensing instruments.

TI  - Energy stores and mercury concentrations in a common minnow (spottail shiner, <i>Notropis hudsonius</i>) associated with a peaking hydroelectric dam
T2  - RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Peaking hydroelectric facilities release water from dams to match energy production with demand, often on a daily cycle. These fluctuating flows downstream can exert several potential stressors on organisms that may inhibit their growth, indirectly causing higher contaminant concentrations through reduced growth dilution. We collected spottail shiner (Notropis hudsonius) at two sites upstream and two sites downstream of a peaking hydroelectric dam in east-central Saskatchewan, Canada, and compared their body condition, triglyceride concentrations, and mercury concentrations. Condition decline was observed in one of two downstream sites from August to September, and the lowest triglyceride concentrations were consistently found downstream of the dam where hydropeaking had the most perceptible effects on the shoreline. Mercury concentrations were significantly greater at both downstream sites relative to upstream. Despite these results, inconsistencies in response parameters across sites and time limited our ability to isolate the effects of hydropeaking as a causative agent and suggest indirect effects such as shifts in algal and macroinvertebrate communities may be responsible for our observations. These results suggest that hydroelectric power generation may indirectly increase mercury concentrations in downstream fish, but more research will be required to determine the specific mechanisms by which this occurs. The results and data also provide useful insights into the physiology of wild spottail shiner populations, which can help to inform the development of these fish as a North American sentinel species.

TI  - Calculation of the Vertical Velocity in the Asian Summer Monsoon Anticyclone Region Using the Thermodynamic Method With <i>in situ</i> and Satellite Data
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Correctly calculating the vertical velocity of the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA) region is helpful for accurately knowing the ozone stratosphere-troposphere exchange, so as to explore the variation of ozone in the ASMA region. Therefore, the vertical velocity over the ASMA in June, July, August, and September 2012 and 2016 was calculated using the thermodynamic method, which may avoid the deviations produced by the kinematics method using the mass continuity equation. In order to improve the accuracy, we used high-resolution heating rate datasets obtained via the radiation model in Canadian Atmospheric Global Climate Model called CanAM4.3_RAD based on in situ observations and revised satellite data from MLS/AIRS. The vertical velocity calculated by the thermodynamic method (V-T) is then compared with the data from ERA-Interim (VERA-I). In the daytime, values of V-T were similar to VERA-I and were dominated by ascending motion, although V-T showed descending motion at the western edge of the ASMA below 100 hPa. The intensity of V-T was slightly smaller than that of VERA-I at lower levels (200-100 hPa) over the ASMA region and significantly weaker above 100 hPa. The situation was more complex at night. Both V-T and VERA-I showed the convergence of vertical wind at 150 hPa and the divergence at 80 hPa, but V-T had a smaller standard deviation. V-T showed descending in the western and northern ASMA, but VERA-I only descended in the west. The descending motion in the west, seen in both V-T and VERA-I, is produced by the heating difference between the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the Iranian Plateau. The difference of the two vertical velocities in the northern ASMA may indicate the different understandings of the local Hadley Circulation and local Brewer-Dobson Circulation.

TI  - Mapping the status of the North American beaver invasion in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the presence and environmental impact of invasive species is the starting point for research on management and nature conservation. North American beavers (Castor canadensis) were introduced to Argentina from Canada in 1946, and the species has been identified as a major agent of environmental change in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago in the Anthropocene. We studied the invasion status (distribution and density) of beavers through analyses of the dam densities in the Tierra del Fuego landscapes. We identified beaver dams with a GIS using visual interpretation of high-resolution aerial imagery from Microsoft Bing, Google Earth and HERE and related them to natural environmental gradients. These factors comprised geographic (vegetation zones and distance to streams), climatic (temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and net primary productivity) and topographic (elevation and slope) data. The datasets (dams and factors) were combined, and the data from the different zonation classes were subsequently compared using ANOVAs and Tukey's mean comparison tests. Deviations from the mean density (x mean density-x total mean density) were calculated to visualize the deviations for the studied factors. The datasets were also evaluated using principal component analyses (PCA). Our results showed a total of 206,203 beaver dams (100,951 in Argentina and 105,252 in Chile) in the study area (73,000 km(2)). The main island of Tierra del Fuego presented a greater degree of invasion (73.6% of the total study area) than the rest of the archipelago, especially in areas covered by mixed-evergreen and deciduous forests. The studied geographic, climatic and topographic factors showed positive trends (higher beaver preference) with beaver spread, which were all significant (p < 0.05) when compared across the landscape. Although beavers are flexible in their habitat use, our empirical records showed that they had marked preferences and were positively influenced by the most productive forests. Here, we describe a scientific panorama that identified the drivers of species invasion based on satellite data and the available ecological datasets. The identification of such drivers could be useful for developing new tools for management and/or control strategies of the beavers in the Tierra del Fuego archipelago.

AB  - The appearance of phytoplankton blooms within sea ice cover is of high importance considering the upper ocean primary production that controls the biological pump, with implications for atmospheric CO2 and global climate. Satellite-derived chlorophyll a concentration showed unprecedented phytoplankton blooms in the Maud Rise polynya, Southern Ocean, with chlorophyll a reaching up to 4.67 mg m(-3) during 2017. Multi-satellite data indicated that the bloom appeared for the first time since the entire mission records started in 1978. An Argo float located in the polynya edge provided evidence of bloom conditions in austral spring 2017 (chlorophyll a up to 5.47 mg m(-3)) compared to the preceding years with prevailing low chlorophyll a. The occurrence of bloom was associated with the supply of nutrients into the upper ocean through Ekman upwelling (driven by wind stress curl and cyclonic ocean eddies) and improved light conditions of up to 61.9 einstein m(-2) d(-1). The net primary production from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer chlorophyll-based algorithm showed that the Maud Rise polynya was as productive as the Antarctic coastal polynyas, with carbon fixation rates reaching up to 415.08 mg C m(-2) d(-1). The study demonstrates how the phytoplankton in the Southern Ocean (specifically over the shallow bathymetric region) would likely respond in the future under warming climate conditions and continued melting of Antarctic sea ice.

TI  - Chronology and climate sensitivity of the post-LGM glaciation in the Dunagiri valley, Dhauliganga basin, Central Himalaya, India
T2  - BOREAS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we reconstruct the style and timing of the late Quaternary glaciation pattern in a monsoon-influenced precipitation-deprived region (Dhauliganga basin) of the Central Himalaya, India. We present detailed glacial geomorphological mapping, aided by topographic maps, satellite data, Google Earth images, global positioning system survey, and fieldwork (2012-2016), supported by optically stimulated luminescence dating. Our estimations for the magnitude and timing of glaciations in the Dunagiri Glacier valley suggest five sets of glacial advances. The oldest and most extensive glaciation in the valley is Dunagiri Glacial Stage-I (DGS-I), represented by a discontinuous moraine ridge that extends down to similar to 10 km (similar to 2700 m a.s.l.) from the present-day snout and formed 13 +/- 3 ka ago. The DGS-II stage is present in the form of a small moraine ridge (similar to 3000 m a.s.l.) that formed 10 +/- 2 ka ago. The DGS-III and DGS-IV glacial stages are 5-6 and 3.5 ka old, respectively. The youngest stage (DGS-V) of glaciation belongs to the neoglaciation episode similar to 1 ka old. DGS-I was the most extensive glaciation in the valley and corresponds to the global Last Glacial Maximum. The glaciation pattern has been correlated with the estimates of present-day glacial sensitivity to climate and explained as forcing factors sensitive to temperature and/or precipitation changes in the region. The observations based on prevailing climate correlations aided with available glacial chronologies underline the fact that the glacial valleys situated in precipitation-deprived regions have preserved a delayed response of glaciations to regional climatic events. Estimates for the timing and pattern of glaciation in the present study suggest a different glacial response for modern climatic changes than previously assumed. We suggest that individual glacier advances differ regionally and, therefore, should not be interpreted as being reflective of a change in the whole geographical belt.

TI  - Genetic parameters across milking frequency for first lactation milk production traits in New Zealand
T2  - NEW ZEALAND JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In New Zealand cows are usually milked twice a day (TAD), however milking cows once-a-day (OAD) for the entire lactation is steadily increasing. This study aimed to estimate genetic correlations (r(g)) for milk production traits across TAD and OAD milking frequency (MF) environments from first lactation cows. Lactation yields of milk (MY), fat (FY) and protein (PY), and somatic cell score (SCS) of progeny from 1126 sires that were herd-tested during 2008-2012 were analysed. The r(g) estimates of the same trait expressed in the two MF were lower than unity but greater than 0.80. Genetic correlation between MY and PY across MF environments was high (0.79), moderate between MY and PY with FY (0.43-0.51), and low when the estimation involved SCS (<0.15). The results show that genetic evaluations made in TAD should include the GxMF effects, and although these effects are not expected to cause significant reductions in the efficiency of selection programmes in OAD systems for milk production traits in New Zealand dairy cattle. These estimates presented in this study can be used to predict genetic progress for the dairy population milked OAD when sires proven with daughters milked TAD are used in OAD herds.

TI  - Assessing Land Use-Land Cover Change and Its Impact on Land Surface Temperature Using LANDSAT Data: A Comparison of Two Urban Areas in India
T2  - EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the spatial and temporal changes in land use and patterns of vegetation and its impacts on land surface temperature (LST) in two Indian cities. Specifically the motivation behind this study is to examine whether a correlation exists between these parameters for the two cities. Indian cities are facing tremendous pressures of rapid urbanization altering the country's land use patterns. This in turn has significantly altered the country's land surface temperature over the years. This study investigates the changes in the land use, land cover and surface temperature in two Indian cities of Surat and Bharuch over a period of 2 decades using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS datasets. The study also examines changes in vegetation pattern during this period using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and investigates the correlation between LST and NDVI. Additionally, the study examines the spatial patterns of LST by mapping the directional profiles of LST. Results of the study reveal that over time both the cities have witnessed a dramatic growth in built-up area, systematic reduction in green space and increase in LST. There is 85% increase in built-up area in Surat in the past 2 decades and 31% increase in built-up area in Bharuch during the same period. At the same time, mean surface temperature in Surat has shown an increase of 2.42 degrees C per decade while in Bharuch the mean surface temperature has increased by 2.13 degrees C per decade. Moreover, examination of correlation between LST and NDVI showed a negative relation between the two parameters. Directional profiles showed a continued increase in temperature from 2008 to 2016 from North to South direction Surat indicating an increased urbanization in that direction. Also, new peaks were observed in the profile of Surat for 2008 and 2016 in the north-south direction indicating urban expansion particularly in the southern part of the city. Moreover, substantial growth has taken place in the central part of the city and along the banks of the rivers Tapi and Narmada. This study will be helpful in investigations that address the challenges of urbanization in Surat and Bharuch by assisting local government officials, land management professionals and planners to determine areas where growth must be curbed to avoid further environmental degradation thereby assisting in systematic urban planning practices.

TI  - Could Ultrasound-Based Radiomics Noninvasively Predict Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer?
T2  - JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives This work aimed to investigate whether quantitative radiomics imaging features extracted from ultrasound (US) can noninvasively predict breast cancer (BC) metastasis to axillary lymph nodes (ALNs).Methods Presurgical B-mode US data of 196 patients with BC were retrospectively studied. The cases were divided into the training and validation cohorts (n = 141 versus 55). The elastic net regression technique was used for selecting features and building a signature in the training cohort. A linear combination of the selected features weighted by their respective coefficients produced a radiomics signature for each individual. A radiomics nomogram was established based on the radiomics signature and US-reported ALN status. In a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, areas under the curves (AUCs) were determined for assessing the accuracy of the prediction model in predicting ALN metastasis in both cohorts. The clinical value was assessed by a decision curve analysis.Results In all, 843 radiomics features per case were obtained from expert-delineated lesions on US imaging in this study. Through radiomics feature selection, 21 features were selected to constitute the radiomics signature for predicting ALN metastasis. Area under the curve values of 0.778 and 0.725 were obtained in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, indicating moderate predictive ability. The radiomics nomogram comprising the radiomics signature and US-reported ALN status showed the best performance for ALN detection in the training cohort (AUC, 0.816) but moderate performance in the validation cohort (AUC, 0.759). The decision curve showed that both the radiomics signature and nomogram displayed good clinical utility.Conclusions This pilot radiomics study provided a noninvasive method for predicting presurgical ALN metastasis status in BC.

TI  - Modelling of land surface temperature changes as determinant of urban heat island and risk of heat-related conditions in the Wassa West Mining Area of Ghana
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent times, land surface temperature and its associated effect urban heat island (UHI) has attracted massive research and public attention due to their effects on the environment, climate and public health. Specifically, UHI adversely affects the quality of life of city dwellers in the form of thermal discomfort, resulting in a rise in energy consumption to mitigate the effects of the increase in surface temperature. Therefore, studying the presence, extent, spatial distribution and changes in surface temperature is essential as it could generate meaningful and useful information for sustainable urban planning. This research used four multi-temporal Landsat images covering three decades to examine surface temperature changes and urban heat islands in the Wassa West areas of south-western Ghana. The research was implemented through the application of several mathematical models, remote sensing and GIS techniques to determine land surface temperature variations over the study period. The results of the study showed a consistent rise in surface temperature over the 30-year period. For instance, in 1990, the minimum and maximum surface temperatures were 14.96 degrees C and 27.17 degrees C, respectively. In 2020, the minimum and maximum temperatures had increase to 24.22 degrees C and 31.23 degrees C, respectively. A consistent decline in the vegetation of the study was equally observed over the period, and this was attributed to the increase in urban settlements and large-scale mining activities in the study area. The results further indicated that low surface temperatures were observed in rural areas with high vegetation, whereas high surface temperature values were consistently observed in areas with impervious surface covers such as mining and urban areas, suggesting the presence of the UHI phenomenon. The study identifies environmentally critical areas in the study areas warranting the urgent attention of society and specific measures that could contribute to reducing the fast increase in surface temperature and mitigate the risk of heat-related conditions has been discussed.

TI  - Remotely monitoring ecosystem respiration from various grasslands along a large-scale east-west transect across northern China
T2  - CARBON BALANCE AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Grassland ecosystems play an important role in the terrestrial carbon cycles through carbon emission by ecosystem respiration (R-e) and carbon uptake by plant photosynthesis (GPP). Surprisingly, given R-e occupies a large component of annual carbon balance, rather less attention has been paid to developing the estimates of R-e compared to GPP. Results Based on 11 flux sites over the diverse grassland ecosystems in northern China, this study examined the amounts of carbon released by R-e as well as the dominant environmental controls across temperate meadow steppe, typical steppe, desert steppe and alpine meadow, respectively. Multi-year mean R-e revealed relatively less CO2 emitted by the desert steppe in comparison with other grassland ecosystems. Meanwhile, C emissions of all grasslands were mainly controlled by the growing period. Correlation analysis revealed that apart from air and soil temperature, soil water content exerted a strong effect on the variability in R-e, which implied the great potential to derive R-e using relevant remote sensing data. Then, these field-measured R-e data were up-scaled to large areas using time-series MODIS information and remote sensing-based piecewise regression models. These semi-empirical models appeared to work well with a small margin of error (R-2 and RMSE ranged from 0.45 to 0.88 and from 0.21 to 0.69 g C m(-2) d(-1), respectively). Conclusions Generally, the piecewise models from the growth period and dormant season performed better than model developed directly from the entire year. Moreover, the biases between annual mean R-e observations and the remotely-derived products were usually within 20%. Finally, the regional R-e emissions across northern China's grasslands was approximately 100.66 Tg C in 2010, about 1/3 of carbon fixed from the MODIS GPP product. Specially, the desert steppe exhibited the highest ratio, followed by the temperate meadow steppe, typical steppe and alpine meadow. Therefore, this work provides a novel framework to accurately predict the spatio-temporal patterns of R-e over large areas, which can greatly reduce the uncertainties in global carbon estimates and climate projections.

TI  - Driving forces of land surface temperature anomalous changes in North America in 2002-2018
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The land surface temperature (LST) changes in North America are very abnormal recently, but few studies have systematically researched these anomalies from several aspects, especially the influencing forces. After reconstructing higher quality MODIS monthly LST data (0.05 degrees * 0.05 degrees) in 2002-2018, we analyzed the LST changes especially anomalous changes and their driving forces in North America. Here we show that North America warmed at the rate of 0.02 degrees C/y. The LST changes in three regions, including frigid region in the northwestern (0.12 degrees C/y), the west coast from 20 degrees N-40 degrees N (0.07 degrees C/y), and the tropics south of 20 degrees N (0.04 degrees C/y), were extremely abnormal. The El Nino and La Nina were the main drivers for the periodical highest and lowest LST, respectively. The North Atlantic Oscillation was closed related to the opposite change of LST in the northeastern North America and the southeastern United States, and the warming trend of the Florida peninsula in winter was closely related to enhancement of the North Atlantic Oscillation index. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation index showed a positive correlation with the LST in most Alaska. Vegetation and atmospheric water vapor also had a profound influence on the LST changes, but it had obvious difference in latitude.

TI  - Comparison between simulated SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations using satellite emission data and Pemex emission inventories in Tabasco, Mexico
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents a comparison of SO2 concentrations simulated by a dispersion model, using as input both emission data inventories of the Mexican petroleum company Petroleos Mexicanos and emissions estimated by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on board of the Aura satellite, contrasting results with data measured by an on-ground sensor located in the city of Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico, during the month of February 2013. The emissions used came from both oil extraction facilities located in the Gulf of Mexico and oil installations located on land. The days selected to be modeled were those when the winds had a northern component, and there was an observable emission detected by the Aura satellite coming from the emission sources. Evaluation analysis of the results showed that satellite data overestimate SO2 concentration, while the inventories of Petroleos Mexicanos underestimate it. Good correlations (r, r(2), and concordance index) were observed between simulated and measured concentrations when the winds had a high frequency of directions of northern component and not-so weak speeds. It is recommended that Mexican oil company calculates more precise and updated emission inventories, considering not only a higher sulfur content of the gas emitted to the atmosphere and its combustion process but also from other existing sources of SO2 emission in this region.

TI  - Families' Experiences of Deaths After Police Contact in the United States: Perceptions of Justice and Injustice
T2  - INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE REVIEW
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines deaths after police contact (DAPC) in the United States using qualitative research undertaken with families who lost loved ones after police contact. It aims to understand their perceptions of the processes they go through in the aftermath of these deaths and how this affects their worldview. The article uses the principles of procedural justice and belief in a just world (BJW) to consider how these experiences affect families' views of justice and injustice in the United States. Key findings are that families perceive police and criminal justice system processes to be procedurally unjust in cases of DAPC and that their BJW is significantly affected as a result of the outcomes they experience. It further argues that there is a racial dimension to these experiences, as White participants appeared to feel these effects more keenly than Black and Mixed-Heritage participants.

TI  - Finding Plastic Patches in Coastal Waters using Optical Satellite Data
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellites collecting optical data offer a unique perspective from which to observe the problem of plastic litter in the marine environment, but few studies have successfully demonstrated their use for this purpose. For the first time, we show that patches of floating macroplastics are detectable in optical data acquired by the European Space Agency (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellites and, furthermore, are distinguishable from naturally occurring materials such as seaweed. We present case studies from four countries where suspected macroplastics were detected in Sentinel-2 Earth Observation data. Patches of materials on the ocean surface were highlighted using a novel Floating Debris Index (FDI) developed for the Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI). In all cases, floating aggregations were detectable on sub-pixel scales, and appeared to be composed of a mix of seaweed, sea foam, and macroplastics. Building first steps toward a future monitoring system, we leveraged spectral shape to identify macroplastics, and a Naive Bayes algorithm to classify mixed materials. Suspected plastics were successfully classified as plastics with an accuracy of 86%.

TI  - Estimating adoption and impacts of agricultural management practices in developing countries using satellite data. A scoping review
T2  - AGRONOMY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - Development and dissemination of sustainable practices are key to enhance agricultural productivity in developing countries and to curtail potential negative externalities. Rigorous adoption/impact evaluations provide valuable lessons to enhance the capacity of agricultural research-for-development (R4D) systems in this context. Conventional evaluation studies rely solely on farm-household surveys for data. Generation of survey data however requires considerable financial and human capital, and the process often misses several important explanatory variables, ignores the longer-term impacts, and suffers from measurement errors. Complementary data sources are explored to make the evaluations more robust and rigorous. Here we review 54 studies that used satellite data to estimate adoption and impact of agricultural practices in developing countries. Some evidence on successful application of satellite data in high-income countries is also provided. The main findings of the paper are threefold: (1) satellite data have been successfully used to detect agricultural practices, such as cropping intensity, tillage, crop residue cover, irrigation, and soil and water conservation; (2) only a few studies have estimated the yield impacts of agricultural practices, although the estimation of crop yields with satellite data is fairly developed; and (3) only a small number of studies have explored impact estimation beyond the biophysical sphere. Estimation of certain environmental impacts of agricultural practices is possible through satellite data, although only a few studies have carried it out. Not many have assessed the economic impacts of interventions. We conclude that satellite data analysis allows information access with little delay and over longer periods, provide a unique set of variables over wide geographies, and reduce measurement error in certain variables. However, more interdisciplinary research is necessary to speed up the uptake of this alternative data source in R4D evaluations.

TI  - Sea-ice edge is more important than closer open water access for foraging Adelie penguins: evidence from two colonies
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel species, like Adelie penguins, have been used to assess the impact of environmental changes, and their link with sea ice has received considerable attention. Here, we tested if foraging Adelie penguins from 2 colonies in East Antarctica target the distant sea-ice edge or take advantage of closer open waters that are readily available near their colony. We examined the foraging behaviour of penguins during the incubation trips of females in 2016 and males in 2017, using GPS tracking and diet data in view of daily sea-ice data and bathymetry. In 2016-2017, sea-ice cover was extensive during females' trips but flaw leads and polynyas were close to both study sites. Sea ice receded rapidly during males' trips in 2017-2018. Despite close open water near both colonies in both years, females and males preferentially targeted the continental slope and the sea-ice edge to forage. In addition, there was no difference in the diet of penguins from both colonies: all penguins fed mostly on Antarctic hill and males also foraged on Antarctic silverfish. Our results highlight the importance of the sea-ice edge for penguins, an area where food abundance is predictable. It is likely that resource availability was not sufficient in closer open water areas at such an early stage in the breeding season. The behaviours displayed by the penguins from both colonies were similar, suggesting a common behaviour across colonies in Terre Adelie, although additional sites would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  - Transcriptome analysis reveals differential immune related genes expression in <i>Ruditapes philippinarum</i> under hypoxia stress: potential HIF and NF-κB crosstalk in immune responses in clam
T2  - BMC GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Hypoxia is an important environmental stressor in aquatic ecosystems, with increasingly impacts on global biodiversity. Benthic communities are the most sensitive parts of the coastal ecosystem to eutrophication and resulting hypoxia. As a filter-feeding organism living in the seafloor sediment, Ruditapes philippinarum represents an excellent "sentinel" species to assess the quality of marine environment. In order to gain insight into the molecular response and acclimatization mechanisms to hypoxia stress in marine invertebrates, we examined hypoxia-induced changes in immune-related gene expression and gene pathways involved in hypoxia regulation of R. philippinarum. Results We investigated the response of the Manila clam R. philippinarum to hypoxia under experimental conditions and focused on the analysis of the differential expression patterns of specific genes associated with hypoxia response by RNA-seq and time course qPCR analysis. A total of 75 genes were captured significantly differentially expressed, and were categorized into antioxidant/oxidative stress response, chaperones/heat shock proteins, immune alteration, and cell proliferation/apoptosis. Fourteen hypoxia responsive genes were validated significantly up/down regulated at different time 0, 2, 5, and 8 d in gills of R. philippinarum in hypoxia challenged group. Functional enrichment analysis revealed the HIF signaling pathway and NF-kappa B signaling pathway play pivotal roles in hypoxia tolerance and resistance in R. philippinarum. Conclusion The HIF signaling pathway and NF-kappa B signaling pathway play a critical role in hypoxia tolerance and resistance in Manila clam. The immune and defense related genes and pathways obtained here gain a fundamental understanding of the hypoxia stress in marine bivalves and provide important insights into the physiological acclimation, immune response and defense activity under hypoxia challenge. The reduced metabolism is a consequence of counterbalancing investments in immune defense against other physiological processes.

TI  - Empirically based minimalistic model for representing seasonal phytoplankton dynamics
T2  - MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Supported by chl a satellite data in the North Atlantic (and phytoplankton division rates computed from that data), the disturbance-recovery hypothesis for the initiation of phytoplankton blooms posits that the change in chl a concentration is proportional to the relative change in the phytoplankton division rate. We used this hypothesis, introduced by Behrenfeld, as a principal model assumption and constructed a non-autonomous ordinary differential equation model for seasonally varying chl a concentrations. Our quantitative comparison between model simulations and in situ measurements of chl a and primary production collected from a Swedish fjord was 2-fold: first, using approximate Bayesian computations, we found distributions of values for the 3 model parameters that best described the chl a data. Then, we validated our model by comparing the simulated (not fitted) division rate to the division rate determined from the data. Our minimalistic model was able to capture (1) the yearly trend in the chl a concentration, (2) the pattern of growth and decline in the phytoplankton division rate, and (3) the decreasing trend in the relative change of the division rate exhibited in the data for several individual years. Moreover, the modeling efficiency was positive (between 0.3 and 0.9 with an average of 0.63) for all 11 yr included in this study. We conclude that the change in chl a concentration being proportional to the relative change in the division rate is a possible explanation for the bloom dynamics in the Gullmar fjord. In addition, our work provides a simple and empirically based differential equation for representing yearly dynamics of primary production, e.g. for generating ecological hypotheses using models of other trophic levels.

TI  - Spatiotemporal changes of vegetation and land surface temperature in the refugee camps and its surrounding areas of Bangladesh after the Rohingya influx from Myanmar
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - In August 24, 2017, a massive outbreak took place in the Rakhine state of Myanmar which triggered a huge refugee influx to the Teknaf Peninsula, Bangladesh. To settle the refugees, makeshift camps were built in large numbers destroying huge amount of forest areas near the existing Kutupalong and Nayapara camps. Refugees have been encroaching the nearby forest covers to collect fuelwood and other purposes. These forest destructions have put the wildlife and biodiversity of the system in a substantial pressure as well as altering the land surface temperature (LST). This paper has examined the extent of vegetation change and the changes of LST from 2017 to 2019 throughout Kutupalong and Balukhali camp and adjacent areas using Landsat 8 images. Random forest algorithm and Plank equation were applied on images to identify vegetation change and LST, respectively. The overall and kappa accuracies for the maps of 2017 are 96% and 92%, respectively, while it stands at 94% and 88% for the 2019 image. Results derived from the analysis suggest that an estimated 1876 hectares of forested lands have been decreased in the study area. LST of the study area increased spatially throughout the whole region with a maximum value of 34 degrees C which is significantly higher than the pre-influx period. If this trend of forest-clearing activities continues, the place will become barren land soon and the LST will also increase. All these factors will ultimately trigger the climate change impacts and biodiversity loss of the area.

TI  - Modeling water quality impacts from hurricanes and extreme weather events in urban coastal systems using Sentinel-2 spectral data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional water quality measurements are nearly impossible during and immediately after extreme storms due to dangerous conditions. In this study, remotely sensed reflectance is used to develop a regression equation that quantifies total suspended solids (TSS) in near real-time after Hurricane Harvey. The application focused specifically on sediment loading and deposition and its potential impacts on the Houston Ship Channel and Galveston Bay riverine-estuarine system. The European Space Agency's Sentinel-2 satellite captured images at critical points in the storm's progression, necessitating the development of a new algorithm for this relatively new satellite mission. Several linear regressions were analyzed with the goal of developing a simple one- or two-band equation, and the final model uses the red and near infrared bands (R-2 = 0.74). Results show that record flows during Harvey delivered unprecedented suspended sediment loads to the Gulf of Mexico at concentrations above 125 mg/L with a mean concentration of 43 mg/L across the bay. The study findings demonstrated that it took up to 11 days after the storm for sediment transport to abate.

TI  - Monitoring tropical forests under a functional perspective with satellite-based vegetation optical depth
T2  - GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring ecosystem functions in forests is a priority in a climate change scenario, as climate-induced events may initially alter the functions more than slow-changing attributes, such as biomass. The ecosystem functional properties (EFPs) are quantities that characterize key ecosystem processes. They can be derived by point observations of gas and energy exchanges between the ecosystems and the atmosphere that are collected globally at FLUXNET flux tower sites and upscaled at ecosystem level. The properties here considered describe the ability of ecosystems to optimize the use of resources for carbon uptake. They represent functional forest information, are dependent on environmental drivers, linked to leaf traits and forest structure, and influenced by climate change effects. The ability of vegetation optical depth (VOD) to provide forest functional information is investigated using 2011-2014 satellite data collected by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission and using the EFPs as reference dataset. Tropical forests in Africa and South America were analyzed, also according to ecological homogeneous units. VOD jointly with water deficit information explained 93% and 87% of the yearly variability in both flux upscaled maximum gross primary productivity and light use efficiency functional properties, in Africa and South America forests respectively. Maps of the retrieved properties evidenced changes in forest functional responses linked to anomalous climate-induced events during the study period. The findings indicate that VOD can support the flux upscaling process in the tropical range, affected by high uncertainty, and the detection of forest anomalous functional responses. Preliminary temporal analysis of VOD and EFP signals showed fine-grained variability in periodicity, in signal dephasing, and in the strength of the relationships. In selected drier forest types, these satellite data could also support the monitoring of functional dynamics.

TI  - The Role of Religious Orientation in Worldview Conflict
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR THE PSYCHOLOGY OF RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldview conflict is a regular part of life. We typically encounter information that disagrees with or disconfirms the way we understand and make sense of the world. People usually respond negatively to such experiences; however, do responses depend, in part, on people's individual religious beliefs or orientations? We tested whether religious orientation (i.e., intrinsic, quest, religious fundamentalism) and religious involvement moderated the effects of worldview disagreement. Employing an experience sampling design, participants (N = 328) from three institutions across two countries completed responses five times per day for three days. They indicated whether or not they had experienced any religious or political worldview disagreement and completed indicators of their emotional responses, well-being, and humanity-esteem. Results indicated that across most indicators, religious orientation does not moderate the effects of worldview disagreement. Rather, regardless of religious orientation, people responded similarly. We discuss implications and suggestions for future research.

TI  - Agricultural drought early warning from geostationary meteorological satellites: concept and demonstration over semi-arid tract in India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing data from Indian geostationary satellites (Kalapana-1, INSAT 3A) were used for the first time for early warning of agricultural drought and forewarning of crop vigour. An Early warning indicator (EWI) was developed from operational product of rainfall and reference evapotranspiration from observations of Kalpana-1 very high resolution radiometer (VHRR). The effectiveness of EWI was evaluated for the two drought years (2009 and 2012). The positive correlation (r = 0.66-0.68 for 2009 and r = 0.64-0.70 for 2012) between the EWI in the month of June-July and standardized precipitation index-1 (SPI-1) averaged over administrative unit (called district) indicates that EWI can be used successfully for drought early warning. Lag-response behaviour between EWI and crop vigour in terms of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LAI (leaf area index) over cropland was studied. Systematic patterns emerged for 30 days lag period between negative EWI and NDVI at both grid-scale (0.25 degrees) and at district level. Linear relations were found between 10-day EWI and NDVI or LAI at 30 days lag during June-July period. Linear models were developed to forewarn crop vigour which was validated with realized NDVI from INSAT 3A charge-coupled device (CCD) observations within 95% accuracy. The EWI is recommended as potential indicator for early-season agricultural drought assessment and can be used for sub-district scale with finer scale rainfall and evaporation products from advanced next-generation geostationary meteorological satellites.

TI  - Phytotoxicity Assessment of Copper Oxide Nanoparticles on the Germination, Early Seedling Growth, and Physiological Responses in <i>Oryza sativa</i> L.
T2  - BULLETIN OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The increasing utilization of copper oxide nanoparticles (CuO NPs) and their release into the environment has made it imperative to elucidate their impact on the ecological system including plants. However, their potential toxic impact and mechanisms on plant growth are still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CuO NPs and released Cu ions on seed germination and early seedling growth, as well as physiological and biochemical parameters of Oryza sativa. The results showed that CuO NPs at high concentration significantly inhibited seed germination and early seedling growth. The toxicity of CuO NPs originated from the particulate NPs rather than the released Cu2+. The phytotoxicity of CuO NPs to rice seed germination and seedling growth probably induced by high Cu accumulation along with the lignification and oxidative damage. The work presented here will increase our knowledge of phytotoxicity of CuO NPs.

TI  - Fusing adjacent-track InSAR datasets to densify the temporal resolution of time-series 3-D displacement estimation over mining areas with a prior deformation model and a generalized weighting least-squares method
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODESY
M3  - Article
AB  - Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) technology can be used to observe high spatial resolution one-dimensional (1-D) deformation along the line-of-sight direction from a single-track synthetic aperture radar (SAR) dataset. With the aid of multi-track InSAR data or a prior model, InSAR can be extended to infer 3-D deformation information, but the temporal resolution is generally limited. This paper presents an InSAR-based method to retrieve high spatio-temporal resolution 3-D displacements over mining areas (hereafter referred to as the MTI-based method). The core idea of the proposed method is to enhance the temporal resolution of the time-series 3-D displacement estimates by fusing multi-track InSAR observations and a prior model. Firstly, we retrieve high spatial resolution 3-D mining displacements from single-track InSAR 1-D deformation observations, with the assistance of the prior deformation model. By applying this approach to multi-track InSAR data over the same area, we obtain much denser 3-D mining displacement samples in time than those derived from a single-track InSAR dataset. Secondly, we propose a generalized weighted least-squares method to integrate the denser 3-D displacement samples, to solve the high temporal resolution 3-D mining displacements, in which the rank deficiency needs to be tackled. Finally, time-series 3-D mining displacements at the chronological dates of all the available multi-track SAR images are estimated. The Yungang coal mining area of China was selected to test the proposed method using two adjacent-track ALOS PALSAR-1 datasets. Compared with the single-track InSAR-derived results, the proposed method not only significantly improves the temporal resolution of the monitoring results by 42.6%, obtaining more detailed 3-D displacements, but it also provides important data support for understanding and modeling the distinctive kinematics of mining deformation and assessing mining-related geohazards. What is more, the core idea of the proposed method will be beneficial to high spatio-temporal resolution 3-D deformation estimation in other geophysical processes.

TI  - Axillary lymph node dissection is not obligatory in breast cancer patients with biopsy-proven axillary lymph node metastasis
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The ACOSOG Z0011 trial demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is unnecessary in select patients with cT1-2N0 tumors undergoing breast-conserving therapy with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). However, patients with preoperatively confirmed ALN metastasis were not included and may be subjected to unnecessary ALND. The aim of this study is to identify patients who can be considered for ALND omission when the preoperative ALN biopsy results are positive. Methods Breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative ALN biopsy and primary surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Among patients with positive ALN biopsy results, clinicopathological and imaging characteristics were compared according to LN disease burden (1-2 positive LNs vs. >= 3 positive LNs). Results A total of 542 patients were included in the analysis. Among them, 225 (41.5%) patients had a preoperative positive ALN biopsy. More than 40% of the patients (n = 99, 44.0%) with a positive biopsy had only 1-2 positive ALNs. The association between nodal burden and imaging factors was strongest when >= 2 suspicious LNs were identified on PET/CT images (HR 8.795, 95% CI 4.756 to 13.262). More than one imaging modality showing >= 2 suspicious LNs was also strongly correlated with >= 3 positive ALNs (HR 5.148, 95% CI 2.881 to 9.200). Conclusions Nearly half of patients with a preoperative biopsy-proven ALN metastasis had only 1-2 positive LNs on ALND. Patients meeting ACOSOG Z0011 criteria with only one suspicious LN on PET/CT or those presenting with few abnormal ALNs on only one imaging modality appear appropriate for SLNB and consideration of ALND omission.

TI  - On the use of remote sensing to map the proliferation of aquaculture ponds and to investigate their effect on local climate, perspectives from the Claise watershed, France
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ponds, as landscape features, are known to regulate climate. Since ponds proliferate or recede due to natural or anthropogenic factors, a variation of pond numbers implies a variation of their climatic effect. Accordingly, this study investigates the impact of ponds on the local climate of the French Claise watershed. The latter was chosen because it contains a pond dense zone and a pondless zone. This repartition makes the Claise an adequate context to reveal the climatic impact of ponds even in the same landscape. To study the pond-climate effect, the parallel evolution of pond numbers variation and subsequent climatic impact must be tracked. Therefore, the remote sensing-derived Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was extracted from LANDSAT images with different acquisition dates to track changes in pond numbers with time. When compared with a pond map established from aerial photography interpretation, the LANDSAT NDWI map revealed an accuracy of 85.74% for pond count and 75% for pond spatial allocation. This validation showed that NDWI is suitable for mapping the proliferation of ponds through time. In order to study the parallel evolution of the climatic effect, the land surface temperature (LST) index was extracted for each LANDSAT map. LST maps revealed that as a result of pond number variation, surface temperatures varied accordingly. A comparison of air temperatures between the ponded zone and pondless zones also revealed that pond zones had lower air temperatures than their direct surroundings. Accordingly, ponds were shown to buffer local microclimates even within the same landscape.

AB  - Postoperative stroke after cardiac surgery is an ominous complication. Clinical manifestations range from cognitive disturbances and altered states of consciousness to focal neurological deficits. Stroke is also a well-documented risk of catheter-based cardiac interventions. Recently, the growth of transcatheter procedures has led to the increasing development of devices that are designed to minimize neurological events during valve implantation. In this video tutorial we demonstrate how to transfer a catheter-based cerebral protection technology into an open cardiac surgical intervention. The operation shown in this tutorial was an aortic valve replacement and the cerebral protection device implanted was the Sentinel Cerebral Protection System (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA).

T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been an unprecedented challenge to the global health care system. Tools that can improve the focus of surveillance efforts and clinical decision support are of paramount importance.Objective: The aim of this study was to illustrate how new medical informatics technologies may enable effective control of the pandemic through the development and successful 72-hour deployment of the Honghu Hybrid System (HHS) for COVID-19 in the city of Honghu in Hubei, China.Methods: The HHS was designed for the collection, integration, standardization, and analysis of COVID-19-related data from multiple sources, which includes a case reporting system, diagnostic labs, electronic medical records, and social media on mobile devices.Results: HHS supports four main features: syndromic surveillance on mobile devices, policy-making decision support, clinical decision support and prioritization of resources, and follow-up of discharged patients. The syndromic surveillance component in HHS covered over 95% of the population of over 900,000 people and provided near real time evidence for the control of epidemic emergencies. The clinical decision support component in HHS was also provided to improve patient care and prioritize the limited medical resources. However, the statistical methods still require further evaluations to confirm clinical effectiveness and appropriateness of disposition assigned in this study, which warrants further investigation.Conclusions: The facilitating factors and challenges are discussed to provide useful insights to other cities to build suitable solutions based on cloud technologies. The HHS for COVID-19 was shown to be feasible and effective in this real-world field study, and has the potential to be migrated.

TI  - Dispersal of female and male <i>Aedes aegypti</i> from discarded container habitats using a stable isotope mark-capture study design in South Texas
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aedes aegypti is the main vector of arboviral diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika. A key feature for disease transmission modeling and vector control planning is adult mosquito dispersal. We studied Ae aegypti adult dispersal by conducting a mark-capture study of naturally occurring Ae. aegypti from discarded containers found along a canal that divided two residential communities in Donna, Texas, USA. Stable isotopes were used to enrich containers with either C-13 or N-15. Adult mosquitoes were collected outdoors in the yards of households throughout the communities with BG Sentinel 2 traps during a 12-week period. Marked mosquito pools with stable isotopes were used to estimate the mean distance travelled using three different approaches (Net, Strip or Circular) and the probability of detecting an isotopically marked adult at different distances from the larval habitat of origin. We consistently observed, using the three approaches that male (Net: 220m, Strip: 255m, Circular: 250m) Ae. aegypti dispersed further in comparison to gravid (Net: 135m, Strip: 176m, Circular: 189m) and unfed females (Net: 192m, Strip: 213m, Circular: 198m). We also observed that marked male capture probability slightly increased with distance, while, for both unfed and gravid females, such probability decreased with distance. Using a unique study design documenting adult dispersal from natural larval habitat, our results suggest that Ae. aegypti adults disperse longer distances than previously reported. These results may help guide local vector control authorities in their fight against Ae. aegypti and the diseases it transmits, suggesting coverage of 200m for the use of insecticides and innovative vector control tools.

TI  - Rapid flood inundation mapping by differencing water indices from pre- and post-flood Landsat images
T2  - FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Following flooding disasters, satellite images provide valuable information required for generating flood inundation maps. Multispectral or optical imagery can be used for generating flood maps when the inundated areas are not covered by clouds. We propose a rapid mapping method for identifying inundated areas based on the increase in the water index value between the pre- and post-flood satellite images. Values of the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Modified NDWI (MNDWI) will be higher in the post-flood image for flooded areas compared to the pre-flood image. Based on a threshold value, pixels corresponding to the flooded areas can be separated from non-flooded areas. Inundation maps derived from differencing MNDWI values accurately captured the flooded areas. However the output image will be influenced by the choice of the pre-flood image, hence analysts have to avoid selecting pre-flood images acquired in drought or earlier flood years. Also the inundation maps generated using this method have to be overlaid on the post-flood satellite image in order to orient personnel to landscape features. Advantages of the proposed technique are that flood impacted areas can be identified rapidly, and that the pre-existing water bodies can be excluded from the inundation maps. Using pairs of other satellite data, several maps can be generated within a single flood which would enable emergency response agencies to focus on newly flooded areas.

TI  - Modeling land cover change dynamic using a hybrid model approach in Qeshm Island, Southern Iran
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Multiple factors including natural and human-induced ones lead to land cover change in the landscape. Therefore, identifying the pattern of land cover change can help inform land-use management and prevent associated issues which can affect the natural resources of the landscape. The aim of this study is to assess land cover change in the Qeshm Island in southern Iran by combining the resulting outputs of multiple modeling methods, cellular automata (CA), Markov chains, and artificial neural networks (ANN) based on land cover maps for the years 1996, 2006, and 2016 that have been extracted from satellite imagery (Landsat 5, 7, and 8). In order to evaluate the accuracy of modeling, the Kappa coefficient was calculated to be 0.8. Then, land cover changes for 2025 were predicted by a hybrid model (CA-Markov-ANN). The results indicate that the classes of built-up areas, vegetation, and mangrove forests have changed more significantly from 1996 to 2016 compared with other classes. Land cover maps generated in this study showed that built-up areas have grown significantly in recent decades due to the region's growing population and development of ports, commercial, and industrial areas. Due to the climate change, the land area covering vegetation has decreased dramatically. The size of the mangrove forests has increased over the time period of the study (1996-2025). The findings of this study can inform land-use planning decisions by providing them with a comprehensive overview of land cover conditions in the future.

TI  - Flood Inundation Mapping and Impact Assessment Using Multi-Temporal Optical and SAR Satellite Data: a Case Study of 2017 Flood in Darbhanga District, Bihar, India
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Flooding is a recurrent hazard in east Gangetic plains, largely on account of natural factors that pose risks to life and property. Bagmati and Burhi Gandak rivers draining parts of North Bihar causes substantial flooding owing to higher rainfall. This comprehensive study was carried out to map near real-time flood inundation using multi-temporal Sentinel-1A (SAR) and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer Near Real-Time (MODIS NRT) flood data (Optical and 3-day composite) over Darbhanga district of North Bihar during August and September 2017. Floodwater pixels were extracted using the binarization technique, wherein the threshold was applied as -22.5, -23.4, -23.8 and - 22.7 over VH polarization image. The key results revealed that during peak flooding stage (23rd August), 13% of areas were submerged based on SAR data, whereas overestimation by >20% was estimated using MODIS data. As shown in the composite flood inundated map, the inundated patches are quite similar in both the optical and SAR based data. Notably, there were higher flood patches observed in the central, northern, and western parts of the district due to the presence of more water channels in those regions. Our findings suggested that agriculture patches of similar to 392 sq.km area were inundated due to flood followed by vegetation clutters (16.07 sq.km) and urban (8.46 sq.km). These results indicated the impact of floodwater on agriculture and urban patches. These findings are crucial for policymakers to assess flood impacts. It can be inferred that flood prognosis using SAR data will lead to spatial accuracy and can be improved when coupling with various hydro-meteorological parameters and hydrological models.

TI  - Ocean surface current retrieval at Hangzhou Bay from Himawari-8 sequential satellite images
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean surface currents play a key role in the earth's climate. They affect virtually all processes occurring in the ocean and can also directly affect many important socio-economic activities. Himawari-8 meteorological satellite has an international advanced geostationary orbit imager sensor, AHI, with high time resolution and spatial coverage, Himawari-8 can be used to observe the subtle changes in marine environments. In this study, we used Himawari-8 data received from the Joint Receiving Station for Satellite Remote Sensing of Xiamen University to retrieve coastal currents in Hangzhou Bay. Particularly, the Maximum Correlation Coefficient (MCC) and the Generalized Hough Transform (GHT) methods were used to retrieve them respectively The retrieved sea surface currents are analyzed and verified by the numerical model data of the Taiwan Strait current forecasting system (TFOR). The results show that (1) the Himawari-8 satellite data can be used to effectively estimate the ocean current; (2) The results of the two methods are in agreement with each other, and the error in the current measured using the GHT method is smaller in the Yangtze estuary and offshore areas, where the turbidity characteristic front is stronger.

TI  - Could Vegetation Index be Derive from Synthetic Aperture Radar? - The Linear Relationship between Interferometric Coherence and NDVI
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to many factors in the physical properties of the ground surface, the corresponding interferometric coherence values change dynamically over time. Among these factors, the roles of the vegetation and its temporal variation have not yet been revealed so far. In this paper, synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel-1) data and optical remote sensing (Landsat TM) images over four whole seasons are employed to reveal the relationship between the interferometric coherence and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) at five sites that have ground deformation due to mining in Henan province, China. The result showed: (1) As for the village area with few vegetation cover, the related coherence values are significantly higher than that in the farm land area with high densities of vegetation in the spring and summer, which indicates that the subsidence by mining in few vegetation cover area is easier to be monitored; (2) Linear regression coefficients (R2) between the interfereometric coherence values and the NDVI values is 0.62, which indicate the interferometric coherence values and the NDVI values change reversely in both farm land and village areas over the year. It suggests months between November and March with lower NDVI value are more suitable for deformation detecting. Therefore, the interfereometric coherence values can be used to detect the density of vegetation, while NDVI values can be reference for elucidating when the traditional differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) could be effectively used.

TI  - High Resolution Water Column Phytoplankton Composition Across the Atlantic Ocean From Ship-Towed Vertical Undulating Radiometry
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Different phytoplankton groups dominate ocean biomes and they drive differently the marine food web and the biogeochemical cycles. However, their distribution over most parts of the global ocean remains uncertain due to limitations in the sampling resolution of currently available in situ and satellite data. Information below surface waters are especially limited because satellite sensors only provide information on the first optical depth. We present measurements obtained during Polarstern cruise PS113 (May-June 2018) across the Atlantic Ocean from South America to Europe along numerous transects. We measured the hyperspectral underwater radiation field continuously over several hours from a vertical undulating platform towed behind the ship. Equivalent measurements were also taken at specific stations. The concentrations of phytoplankton pigments were determined on discrete water samples. Via diagnostic pigment analysis we derived the phytoplankton group chlorophyll a concentration (Chla) from this pigment data set. We obtained high resolution phytoplankton group Chla data from depth resolved apparent optical properties derived from the underwater radiation data by applying an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to the spectral data set and subsequently developing regression models using the pigment based phytoplankton group Chla and selected EOF modes. To our knowledge, this is the first data set with high horizontal coverage (50-150 km) and resolution (similar to 1 km) that is also resolved vertically for the Chla of major taxonomic phytoplankton groups. Subsampling with 500 permutations for cross validation verified the high robustness of our estimates to enable predictions of seven different phytoplankton groups' Chla and of total Chla (R-2 and median percent differences of the cross validation are within 0.45-0.68 and 29-53%, respectively). Our depth resolved phytoplankton groups' Chla data reflect well the different biogeochemical provinces within the Atlantic Ocean transect and follow the distributions encountered by previous point observations. This verifies the high quality of our retrievals and provides the prospect to put similar radiometers on profiling floats or gliders which would enable the large-scale collection of vertically resolved phytoplankton data at much improved horizontal coverage relative to discrete sampling.

TI  - Surface soil moisture estimation at high spatial resolution by fusing synthetic aperture radar and optical remote sensing data
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The difficulty of accurate and large-scale measurement for surface parameters limits the regional surface soil moisture (SSM) estimation using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Moreover, the coarse resolution of soil moisture products generated by existing methods, which fuse SAR and passive microwave products, cannot fully satisfy the requirement of specific regional applications. To solve this problem, an SAR-optical data fusion method for soil moisture estimation (SOFSME) based on a cascade neural network is proposed in this study. SOFSME obtains surface parameters from historical soil moisture images and related environmental images to estimate a SSM image with high resolution at large scale from Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data. Validation experiments in single and multiple land-use type areas showed that the SOFSME performed best on bare soil areas with a median root mean square error of 0.0203. The median universal image quality index of estimated soil moisture image was 0.1454, which was better for single cropland areas than multi-land-use type areas. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a median value of 0.7645 in both experiments. These results showed that the SOFSME had high accuracy, availability, and stability in regional soil moisture estimation. Compared with existing methods, the SOFSME can provide high-quality soil moisture images and does not directly depend on field measurement data. Thus, the proposed SOFSME method is of great value for high-resolution soil moisture estimation in more regional applications. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Accuracy and inter-analyst agreement of visually estimated sea ice concentrations in Canadian Ice Service ice charts using single-polarization RADARSAT-2
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares the accuracy of visually estimated ice concentrations by eight analysts at the Canadian Ice Service with three standards: (i) ice concentrations calculated from automated image segmentation, (ii) ice concentrations calculated from automated image segmentation that were validated by the analysts, and (iii) the modal ice concentration estimate by the group. A total of 76 predefined areas in 67 RADARSAT-2 images are used in this study. Analysts overestimate ice concentrations when compared to all three standards, most notably for low ice concentrations (1/103/10). The spread of ice concentration estimates is highest for middle concentrations (5/10, 6/10) and smallest for the 9/10 ice concentration. The overestimation in low concentrations and high variability in middle concentrations introduce uncertainty into the ice concentration distribution in ice charts. The uncertainty may have downstream implications for numerical modelling and sea ice climatology. Interanalyst agreement is also measured to determine which classifier's ice concentration estimates (analyst or automated image segmentation) disagreed the most. It was found that one of the eight analysts disagreed the most, followed second by the automated segmentation algorithm. This suggests high agreement in ice concentration estimates between analysts at the Canadian Ice Service. The high agreement, but consistent overestimation, results in an overall accuracy of ice concentration estimates in polygons to be 39 %, 95% CI [34 %, 43 %], for an exact match in the ice concentration estimate with calculated ice concentration from segmentation and, 84 %, 95% CI [80 %, 87 %], for the +/- 1 ice concentration category. Only images with high contrast between ice and open water and well-defined floes are used: true accuracy is expected to be lower than what is found in this study.

TI  - Assessment of Shoreline Changes using Historical Satellite Images and Geospatial Analysis along the Lake Salda in Turkey
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study was performed along the shorelines of Lake Salda in Turkey during the elapsed period from 1975 to 2019 in order to detect shoreline changes. Within this framework, geographic information system, digital shoreline analysis system, Modified Normalized Difference Water Index, and multi-temporal satellite images were utilized. The measurement of shoreline displacement was mainly divided into six analysis regions. In digital shoreline analysis system, several statistical parameters such as end point rate, linear regression rate, shoreline change envelope, and net shoreline movement were computed to measure the rates of shoreline displacement in terms of erosion and accretion. The maximum shoreline change between 1975 and 2019 was determined as 556.45 m by shoreline change envelope parameter. The maximum shoreline change was 16.35 m/year by end point rate parameter and 12.91 m/year by linear regression rate parameter. While erosion has been observed in 3rd, 4th and 6th segments, accretion has been observed in other segments. When all the transects were taken into consideration, an accretion observed. The results indicate that there is a decrease in area of the lake. Experiment results show that integrated use of multi-temporal satellite images and statistical parameters are very effective and useful for shoreline change analysis. It is thought that the structures such as irrigation pond and dam that are built on the streams that recharge the lake and average rainfall and average temperature conditions are the main reasons of the fluctuations and changes in the shorelines.

TI  - Post-outbreak African horse sickness surveillance: A scenario tree evaluation in South Africa's controlled area
T2  - TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - An African horse sickness (AHS) outbreak occurred in March and April 2016 in the controlled area of South Africa. This extended an existing trade suspension of live equids from South Africa to the European Union. In the post-outbreak period ongoing passive and active surveillance, the latter in the form of monthly sentinel surveillance and a stand-alone freedom from disease survey in March 2017, took place. We describe a stochastic scenario tree analysis of these surveillance components for 24 months, starting July 2016, in three distinct geographic areas of the controlled area. Given that AHS was not detected, the probability of being free from AHS was between 98.3% and 99.8% assuming that, if it were present, it would have a prevalence of at least one infected animal in 1% of herds. This high level of freedom probability had been attained in all three areas within the first 9 months of the 2-year period. The primary driver of surveillance outcomes was the passive surveillance component. Active surveillance components contributed minimally (<0.2%) to the final probability of freedom. Sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of infected horses showing clinical signs was an important parameter influencing the system surveillance sensitivity. The monthly probability of disease introduction needed to be increased to 20% and greater to decrease the overall probability of freedom to below 90%. Current global standards require a 2-year post-incursion period of AHS freedom before re-evaluation of free zone status. Our findings show that the length of this period could be decreased if adequately sensitive surveillance is performed. In order to comply with international standards, active surveillance will remain a component of AHS surveillance in South Africa. Passive surveillance, however, can provide substantial evidence supporting AHS freedom status declarations, and further investment in this surveillance activity would be beneficial.

TI  - New developments in breast cancer surgery
T2  - GYNAKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical treatment together with systemic treatment and irradiation forms an elementary treatment pillar in the therapy of breast cancer. All three pillars must optimally work together in order to achieve the best possible rate of curing. Under primary systemic treatment (PST) planning of the operation should consider the primary tumor volume before beginning treatment. The aim should be a primary R0 resection in order to avoid a second operation. According to study results an exact pre-PST and presurgical marking technique combined with intraoperative sonographic guidance and specimen imaging reduce the rate of second operations. Prophylactic operations, for example in patients bearing mutations, are established components of the treatment spectrum of large modern breast surgery centers. The techniques for reconstructive breast surgery are continuously being extended with a view to a long-term high quality of life. In implant surgery the prepectoral pocket is receiving more attention compared to the retropectoral pocket. Currently the nodal status represents an important prognostic factor and an indicator for adjuvant systemic treatment and radiotherapy; however, in the future the importance of nodal status regarding treatment decisions will decrease. Studies that are already completed or still ongoing have investigated the avoidance of any kind of axillary surgery. A complete axillary lymph node dissection should now be avoided in cases of clinically negative axillary lymph nodes and 1-2 involved sentinel lymph nodes with breast-conserving surgery and adequate systemic treatment and radiotherapy. Although not yet completely clarified, a decrease of axillary surgery in the context of primary neoadjuvant systemic treatment is also to be expected.

TI  - Changing Occurrences of Fall Blooms Associated With Variations in Phytoplankton Size Structure in the Pacific Arctic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Phytoplankton blooms in the Pacific Arctic have been characterized as a huge single bloom in spring. However, several studies have reported recent increases in the occurrence of fall blooms during the period after dissipation of the spring bloom. Here, we explored spatiotemporal variations in the occurrence of fall blooms in the region, using satellite remote-sensing data for 2003-2017. Seasonal time-series variation in satellite-derived chlorophyll-a concentrations (chla) was modeled using a Gaussian function to distinguish whether a peak in chla was evident in fall; an occurrence of a fall bloom was recognized if the model detected the presence of a chla peak in fall. In addition, phytoplankton size structure was estimated from the satellite data to examine the influence of fall blooms on seasonal variations in the size structure. The results indicate that fall blooms occurred in a wide area of the Pacific Arctic, and larger phytoplankton were predominant during fall blooms relative to the phytoplankton present before/after the bloom or in the absence of a fall bloom. Examining interannual variation in occurrences of fall blooms revealed clear increasing and decreasing trends in the southern Chukchi Sea and the St. Lawrence Island polynya region, respectively, possibly associated with temporal variations in atmospheric forcing as well as in the water-column structure. Because the cell sizes of phytoplankton largely determine their sinking rate, temporal trends in the occurrence of fall blooms modulating seasonal variations in phytoplankton size structure could significantly influence marine ecosystems. These results suggest that spatiotemporal monitoring of phytoplankton communities not only in spring but also after the spring period or the dissipation of the spring bloom would improve our understanding about processes causing variations within marine ecosystems, as might occur in the Pacific Arctic.

TI  - Ferrocene-modified peptides as inhibitors against insulin amyloid aggregation based on molecular simulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B
M3  - Article
AB  - Peptide-based inhibitors have gradually been implicated as drugs for treating protein folding diseases because of their favorable biocompatibility and low toxicity. To develop potential therapeutic strategies for amyloid-related disorders, short peptides modified by Fc, ferrocene-l-Phe-l-Phe (Fc-FF) and ferrocene-l-Phe-l-Tyr (Fc-FY), were used as inhibitors for the investigation of the aggregation behavior of insulin. Firstly, molecular docking predicted the interaction between both Fc-peptides and insulin. Then, the experimental data from ThT, DLS, CD and TEM confirmed that Fc-FF and Fc-FY effectively inhibited insulin fibrillation and disaggregated mature insulin fibrils. Based on a dose-dependent manner, both Fc-peptides can strongly inhibit insulin fibrillation, extend lag phase time, reduce final fibril formation (beyond 99% by Fc-peptides of 400 mu M), decrease the formation of high-content beta-sheet structures and reduce the size of insulin fibrils. Additionally, we found that compared with Fc-FY, the better inhibitory effect of Fc-FF at concentration below 400 mu M was mainly resulted from the difference in pi-pi interaction and hydrogen bonds between Fc-peptides and insulin, according to molecular dynamics analysis. Our results demonstrated Fc-peptides, Fc-FF and Fc-FY, may play effective roles in the development of new therapeutic drugs or strategies for amyloid-related disorders, and the molecular dynamics simulation may be helpful for designing appropriate inhibitors of anti-amyloidosis diseases.

TI  - Distribution of rocks in Pinarbasi Ophiolite from central Anatolia (Turkey) based on analysis of ASTER and Landsat-8 data
T2  - GEOLOGICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Late Cretaceous Pinarbasi Ophiolite (PO), located at central Turkey is represented by distinct rock types (e.g., harzburgite, dunite, pyroxenite, gabbro) that can be observed in many ophiolites around the world. In this study, the classification of rock types of PO in the Eastern Tauride Belt (Turkey) was made using the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer and Landsat-8 satellite images. The developed colour-band ratio composite images together with principal component analysis and minimum noise fraction transformations implemented to the remote sensing data efficiently delineate the spatial distribution of pyroxenites, metamorphic sole rocks, and gabbros in the study area. In addition, a body of serpentinized dunites, pyroxenites, metamorphic sole rocks, and listwaenites that has not been recognized before was identified within PO using remote sensing techniques. The promising results of the image processing were verified by detailed field observations and petrographic analysis. The satellite-based remote sensing approaches of this work can be applicable for mapping ophiolitic rock types in PO in particular as well as other ophiolites from similar geographical regions around the world.

TI  - Adjuvant Therapy is Effective for Melanoma Patients with a Positive Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Who Forego Completion Lymphadenectomy
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Multiple adjuvant therapies for melanoma have been approved since 2015 based on randomized trials demonstrating improvements in recurrence-free survival (RFS) with adjuvant therapy after surgical resection of high-risk disease. Inclusion criteria for these trials required performance of a completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for positive sentinel lymph node (pSLN) disease. Objective We aimed to describe current practice for adjuvant therapies in patients with pSLN without CLND (active surveillance [AS]), and to evaluate recurrence in these patients. Methods Melanoma patients with pSLN between 2016 and 2019 were identified at two institutions. Demographic information, disease and treatment characteristics, and recurrence details were reviewed retrospectively. Patients were stratified by recurrence and patient-, treatment- and tumor-related characteristics were compared using Fisher's exact test and t test for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Results Overall, 245 SLN biopsies were performed, of which 36 (14.7%) were pSLN. Of 36 pSLN, 4 underwent CLND and 32 underwent AS, of whom 22 (68.8%) received adjuvant therapy with the anti-programmed death-1 (PD1) inhibitor nivolumab (16/22), anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor ipilimumab (3/22), or BRAF/MEK inhibitors (3/22). At a median follow up of 13.3 months, 7/32 (21.9%) patients on AS recurred, including 4/22 (18.2%) who received adjuvant therapy and 3/10 (30.0%) who did not. Tumor ulceration was significantly associated with recurrence. While not significant, acral lentiginous subtype appeared more common among those with recurrence. Conclusion The majority (68.8%) of patients with pSLN managed without CLND were treated with adjuvant therapy. The 1-year RFS for patients managed with adjuvant therapy without CLND was 82%, which is similar to modern adjuvant therapy trials requiring CLND.

TI  - Geographical variations in gross primary production and evapotranspiration of paddy rice in the Korean Peninsula
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The quantification of canopy photosynthesis and evapotranspiration of crops (ETc) is essential to appreciate the effects of environmental changes on CO2 flux and water availability in agricultural ecosystems and crop productivity. This study simulated the canopy photosynthesis and ET processes of paddy rice (Oryza sativa) based on the development of physiological modules (i.e., gross primary production [GPP] and ETc) and their incorporation into the GRAMI-rice model that uses remote sensing data. We also projected spatiotemporal variations in the GPP, ET, yield, and biomass of paddy rice at maturity using the updated GRAMI-rice model combined with geostationary satellite images to identify the relationships of canopy photosynthesis and ETc with crop productivity. GPP and ET data for paddy rice were obtained from three KoFlux sites in South Korea in 2015 and 2016. Vegetation indices were acquired from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOCI) of the Communication Ocean and Meteorological Satellite (COMS) from 2012 to 2017 and integrated into GRAMI-rice. GPP and ETc estimates using GRAMI-rice were in close agreement with flux tower estimates with Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency ranges of 0.40-0.79 for GPP and 0.49-0.62 for ETc. Also, GRAMI-rice was reasonably well incorporated with the COMS GOCI imagery and reproduced spatiotemporal variations in the GPP and ET of rice in the Korean peninsula. The current study results demonstrate that the updated GRAMI-rice model with the canopy photosynthesis and ETc modules is capable of reproducing spatiotemporal variations in CO2 assimilation and ET of paddy rice at various geographical scales and for regions of interest that are observable by satellite sensors (e.g., inaccessible North Korea).

TI  - Air quality disturbance zone mapping in greater Cochin region of Kerala state, India using geoinformatics
T2  - SPATIAL INFORMATION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Air quality disturbance zones of the Greater Cochin region (Kerala, India) for the years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017 along with air quality assessment and dispersion modelling using in situ measurements and mathematical models, have been investigated in this report. Landsat-8 satellite with OLI and TIRS sensors on board were used for the analysis. The ground based in situ measurements (pollutant parameters) were also obtained from the Kerala state pollution control board. Zonal statistics analysis was performed in various combinations especially air quality disturbance zones with respect to land use/land cover and administrative units for various years. The air quality disturbance zone index (AQDZI) values observed indicated that 38.16% of the study area in 2014 belonged to very good category, 22.94% to good category, 32.37% to moderate category and 6.53% to poor category. In 2015, 56.78% of study area belonged to very good category and 43.221% to good category while in the year 2016 very good category of AQDZI values occupied an area of 45.284% and good category AQDZI values occupied an area of 54.72%. In 2017, 99.834% of the study area belonged to good category and 1.233% to moderate category. Results obtained from zonal statistics revealed that the poor air quality was observed in built up area and good air quality at rubber plantation in all the four selected years. In the case of administrative units, Kochi Corporation experienced poor air quality during all the years studied and Mulanthuruthy grama-panchayath experienced good air quality during most of the years except in 2016.

TI  - Long-term trends (1958-2017) in snow cover duration and depth in the Pyrenees
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the temporal variability and changes in snow cover duration and the average snow depth from December to April in the Pyrenees at 1,500 and 2,100 m a.s.l. for the period 1958-2017. This is the first such analysis for the entire mountain range using SAFRAN-Crocus simulations run for this specific purpose. The SAFRAN-Crocus simulations were evaluated for the period 1980-2016 using 28 in situ snow depth data time series, and for the period 2000-2017 using MODIS observations of the snow cover duration. Following confirmation that the simulated snow series satisfactorily reproduced the observed evolution of the snowpack, the Mann-Kendall test showed that snow cover duration and average depth decreased during the full study period, but this was only statistically significant at 2,100 m a.s.l. The temporal evolution in the snow series indicated marked differences among massifs, elevations, and snow variables. In general, the most western massifs of the French Pyrenees underwent a greater decrease in the snowpack, while in some eastern massifs the snowpack did not decrease, and in some cases increased at 1,500 m a.s.l. The results suggest that the trends were consistent over time, as they were little affected by the start and end year of the study period, except if trends are computed only starting after 1980, when no significant trends were apparent. Most of the observed negative trends were not correlated with changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns during the snow season. This suggests that the continuous warming in the Pyrenees since the beginning of the industrial period, and particularly the sharp increase since 1955, is a major driver explaining the snow cover decline in the Pyrenees.

TI  - Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of meningitis epidemics outside the belt: the case of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Bacterial meningitis remains a major threat for the population of the meningitis belt. Between 2004 and 2009, in the countries of this belt, more than 200,000 people were infected with a 10% mortality rate. However, for almost 20 years, important meningitis epidemics are also reported outside this belt. Research is still very poorly developed in this part of the word like in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), which experiences recurrent epidemics. This article describes for the first time the spatio-temporal patterns of meningitis cases and epidemics in DRC, in order to provide new insights for surveillance and control measures. Methods Based on weekly suspected cases of meningitis (2000-2012), we used time-series analyses to explore the spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease. We also used both geographic information systems and geostatistics to identify spatial clusters of cases. Both using conventional statistics and the Cleveland's algorithm for decomposition into general trend, seasonal and residuals, we searched for the existence of seasonality. Results We observed a low rate of biological confirmation of cases (11%) using soluble antigens search, culture and PCR. The main strains found are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis (A and C) serogroups. We identified 8 distinct spatial clusters, located in the northeastern and southeastern part of DRC, and in the capital city province, Kinshasa. A low seasonal trend was observed with higher incidence and attack rate of meningitis during the dry season, with a high heterogeneity in seasonal patterns occurring across the different districts and regions of DRC. Conclusion Despite challenges related to completeness of data reporting, meningitis dynamics shows weak seasonality in DRC. This tends to suggest that climatic, environmental factors might be less preponderant in shaping seasonal patterns in central Africa. The characterization of 8 distinct clusters of meningitis could be used for a better sentinel meningitis surveillance and optimization of vaccine strategy in DRC. Improving biological monitoring of suspected cases should be a priority for future eco-epidemiological studies to better understand the emergence and spread of meningitis pathogens, and the potential ecological, environmental drivers of this disease.

TI  - The Landmark Series: Adjuvant Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Radiation therapy represents a cornerstone of breast cancer treatment both for patients undergoing breast conservation and for those receiving mastectomy. Trials evaluating breast-conserving therapy have established the benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy in terms of both local control and breast cancer mortality, whereas trials evaluating post-mastectomy radiation therapy have demonstrated improved survival for appropriately selected patients. More recent trials have confirmed that axillary node dissection can be omitted for patients who have positive sentinel nodes with no impairment at locoregional recurrence and improved outcomes. Additionally, new studies have validated the finding that the addition of regional nodal irradiation to patients with limited nodal disease provides improved outcomes. With a growing focus on treatment de-intensification, studies evaluating partial-breast irradiation with brachytherapy and external beam have demonstrated outcomes comparable with those of whole-breast irradiation, whereas further study is needed regarding intraoperative radiation therapy. This study reviews these landmark studies to present a roadmap for how adjuvant radiation therapy is used to treat breast cancer patients at this time.

TI  - Comparative analysis of atmospheric radiative transfer models using the Atmospheric Look-up table Generator (ALG) toolbox (version 2.0)
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric radiative transfer models (RTMs) are software tools that help researchers in understanding the radiative processes occurring in the Earth's atmosphere. Given their importance in remote sensing applications, the intercomparison of atmospheric RTMs is therefore one of the main tasks used to evaluate model performance and identify the characteristics that differ between models. This can be a tedious tasks that requires good knowledge of the model inputs/outputs and the generation of large databases of consistent simulations. With the evolution of these software tools, their increase in complexity bears implications for their use in practical applications and model intercomparison. Existing RTM-specific graphical user interfaces are not optimized for performing intercomparison studies of a wide variety of atmospheric RTMs. In this paper, we present the Atmospheric Look-up table Generator (ALG) version 2.0, a new software tool that facilitates generating large databases for a variety of atmospheric RTMs. ALG facilitates consistent and intuitive user interaction to enable the running of model executions and storing of RTM data for any spectral configuration in the optical domain. We demonstrate the utility of ALG in performing intercomparison studies of radiance simulations from broadly used atmospheric RTMs (6SV, MODTRAN, and libRadtran) through global sensitivity analysis. We expect that providing ALG to the research community will facilitate the usage of atmospheric RTMs to a wide range of applications in Earth observation.

TI  - Influence of sequential tropical cyclones on phytoplankton blooms in the northwestern South China Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOLOGY AND LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Upper ocean responses to the passage of sequential tropical cyclones over the northwestern South China Sea (SCS) in 2011 were investigated using satellite remote sensing data, Argo reanalysis data, and an array of mooring data. We found that the sea surface low temperature region lasted for more than 38 days and two phytoplankton blooms occurred after the passage of sequential tropical cyclones. The upper ocean cooling reached 2-5 degrees C with a right-side bias was observed along the typhoon track to about 200 km. The maintenance of low temperature region and the two phytoplankton blooms were mainly driven by upwelling and near-inertial turbulence mixing induced by the sequential tropical cyclones. The first phytoplankton bloom appeared on the 7(th) day after the passage of the three tropical cyclones, and the chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration increased by 226%, which may be mainly driven by typhoons induced upwelling. The second phytoplankton bloom occurred on the 30(th) day, the chl-a concentration increased by 290%. Further analysis suggested that only the typhoons with similar characteristics as Nesat and Nalgae can induce strong near-inertial oscillation (NIO). Strong turbulent mixing associated with the near-inertial baroclinic shear instability lasted for 26 days. The measured mean eddy diffusivity in the upper ocean was above 10(-4) m(2)/s after typhoon Nesat. Enhancement of the turbulent mixing in the upper ocean helped to transport nutrient-rich cold waters from the deep layer to the euphotic layer, and is a major mechanism for the long-term maintenance of low temperature region as well as the second phytoplankton bloom.

TI  - First observation of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide from the Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite.
T2  - Light, science & applications
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - The Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) is the first Chinese satellite-borne UV-Vis spectrometer aiming to measure the distribution of atmospheric trace gases on a global scale. The EMI instrument onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite was launched on 9 May 2018. In this paper, we present the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column density (VCD) retrieval algorithm dedicated to EMI measurement. We report the first successful retrieval of tropospheric NO2 VCD from the EMI instrument. Our retrieval improved the original EMI NO2 prototype algorithm by modifying the settings of the spectral fit and air mass factor calculations to account for the on-orbit instrumental performance changes. The retrieved EMI NO2 VCDs generally show good spatiotemporal agreement with the satellite-borne Ozone Monitoring Instrument and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (correlation coefficient R of ~0.9, bias <50%). A comparison with ground-based MAX-DOAS (Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) observations also shows good correlation with an R of 0.82. The results indicate that the EMI NO2 retrieval algorithm derives reliable and precise results, and this algorithm can feasibly produce stable operational products that can contribute to global air pollution monitoring.

AB  - Remote sensing: Tuned-up satellite identifies pollutant hot spots Improvements to a high-resolution spectrometer onboard China's recently-launched GaoFen-5 (GF-5) satellite can give researchers a new tool to assess atmospheric trace gases. Cheng Liu from the University of Science and Technology of China and his colleagues reported the first successful retrieval of nitrogen dioxide from the GF-5 orbiter thanks to crucial adjustments to calibration algorithms. The satellite's payload Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) uses visible spectroscopic measurements to detect nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere, which can be used to identify the spatial distribution of pollution emissions on the Earth. To overcome on-orbit issues including detector saturation, the team has optimized the spectral retrieval settings by spectral precalibration, fitting wavelength adjustment, reference spectrum selection, etc. Comparisons to other satellite and ground measurements revealed the optimization effort yielded reliable results for monitoring pollution levels.The Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) is the first Chinese satellite-borne UV-Vis spectrometer aiming to measure the distribution of atmospheric trace gases on a global scale.

The retrieved EMI NO2 VCDs generally show good spatiotemporal agreement with the satellite-borne Ozone Monitoring Instrument and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (correlation coefficient R of similar to 0.9, bias < 50%). A comparison with ground-based MAX-DOAS (Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) observations also shows good correlation with an R of 0.82. The results indicate that the EMI NO2 retrieval algorithm derives reliable and precise results, and this algorithm can feasibly produce stable operational products that can contribute to global air pollution monitoring.

TI  - Approaching mindful multicultural case formulation; Rogers, Yalom, and existential phenomenology
T2  - PERSON-CENTERED AND EXPERIENTIAL PSYCHOTHERAPIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Narrow or restricted case formulation considerations can limit therapeutic effectiveness, limit the lived base of evidence guiding psychotherapy, and contribute to psychotherapist microaggressions. Notably, Person-Centered Therapy (PCT) and existential phenomenology have, in combination, actively maintained that the cultural landscapes or interconnected world horizons of historical, contextual, and sociocultural matters are inseparable from lived experience. In what can be understood as mindfulness perspectives in their own right, the non-judgmental and presence-centered emphases of PCT and existential phenomenology are suited for mindful and meditative attunement to socioculturally diverse clients. This article sets out to begin providing a basis for person-world centered case formulation themes that are mindfully and meditatively linked with a psychotherapist's depthful ontological attunement and cultural or contextual pan-experiential attunement to clients. These interdependent forms of Humanistic Existential Psychotherapy (HEP) attunement can open onto multiculturally informed person-world centered themes that may contribute to experiential restructuring and sociocultural self-actualization. As a way to enhance HEP's sociocultural sensitivity, existential givens, phenomenological themes, and multicultural worldview values are integratively re-visioned as Sociocultural Lifeworld Themes.

TI  - Variability of lake surface water temperature: a case study during El Nino and La Nina events over the Himalayan lake region
T2  - PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake surface water temperature (LSWT) is sensitive to long-term changes in thermal structure of lakes. This paper investigates the association of LSWT with meteorological parameters and its impact during El Nino and La Nina events over the Himalayan lake region, using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data from 2001 to 2017. The observed daytime rates of change of LSWT was -0.05 degrees C/year whereas it was +0.01 degrees C/year for nighttime. The cooling of lake during daytime could be attributed to increase in rainfall and decrease in solar radiation, whereas increase in nighttime LSWT is due to increasing lowest temperature. The variability in LSWT with respect to meteorological variables during El Nino Southern Oscillation period was highest for cold phase than warm phase. There was only 1% increase in LSWT in the El Nino years (2002 and 2009), due to decreased rainfall by 95% and 56% respectively. On the other hand, the LSWT decreased in strong La Nina years of 2007 (2%) and 2010 (6%) due to the drastically increased rainfall, decreased maximum temperature and solar radiation. The correlation revealed that, in addition to the increase in temperature, the LSWT warming is consistent with the decrease in rainfall and increase in solar radiation.

TI  - Exploiting the capabilities of Sentinel-2 and RapidEye for predicting grass nitrogen across different grass communities in a protected area
T2  - APPLIED GEOMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The primary indicator of forage quality in any rangeland environment is grass nitrogen. Remote sensing has been used to map grass quality by predicting nitrogen in order to facilitate effective management and conservation of rangeland ecosystems. Using Telperion Game Reserve as the study site, this study sought to understand the extent to which the application of Sentinel-2 (S2) MSI sensor, together with new red edge bands and vegetation indices can improve the estimation accuracy of grass nitrogen (N) at a landscape scale when compared to the RapidEye sensor. This study was particularly interested in understanding if animal distribution in a rangeland environment is significantly correlated to grass quality across different grass communities at a landscape level. The performances of the simple ratios (SR), normalised vegetation difference indices (NDVI) and random forest (RF) regression models were evaluated and used to map and predict grass nitrogen concentration. The results indicate that the model developed using the SR indices could predict nitrogen with a meanR(2)of 0.92 for S2 data and 0.53 from RapidEye data using combined models. The results also showed that nitrogen maps from remote sensing could be used to explain animal aggregation and grazing patterns at a landscape level.

TI  - Feasibility of internal inguinoperitoneal drainage after inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in vulvar cancer
T2  - ARCHIVES OF GYNECOLOGY AND OBSTETRICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose Despite the introduction of sentinel node biopsy in patients with vulvar cancer, still approximately 50% of all patients have to undergo an inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy. This is associated with a high incidence of postoperative complications, which may be influenced by inguinal drain management. The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of a new surgical technique regarding drain management with an inguinoperitoneal drainage. Methods A retrospective analysis of 21 vulvar cancer patients with inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy was conducted. A silicone drain was circularly placed with the perforated end in the groin and the other end in the space of Douglas. The removal after 3 months was performed under local anesthesia. All patients were questioned during clinical follow-up regarding their personal experiences with the procedure, the occurrence of complications, and side effects using a clinical questionnaire. Results In 100% of the patients, the procedure was feasible. Regarding the number of groin punctures due to lymphocyst formation, 15 (71.4%) patients did not need any intervention and 3 (14.3%) patients needed 1-3 punctures. The patient satisfaction with the internal drainage was ranked as good by 17 (81.0%) patients and as moderate by 1 (4.8%) patient. In 3 (14.3%) patients, information about the number of groin punctures and the patient satisfaction were missing. Conclusion Inguinoperitoneal drainage after inguinofemoral lymphadenectomy in vulvar cancer patients is feasible and safe and a patient satisfaction of 81% is promising. For definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of this technique, further investigations and prospective multicenter trials are needed.

TI  - Disruption of carotene biosynthesis leads to abnormal plastids and variegated leaves in <i>Brassica napus</i>
T2  - MOLECULAR GENETICS AND GENOMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Leaf color is an important characteristic of normal chloroplast development. Variegated plants have green- and white-sectored leaves, which can be used to identify important pathways and molecular mechanisms of chloroplast development. We studied two Brassica napus variegation mutants from same one variegated ancestor, designated ZY-4 and ZY-8, which have different degrees of variegation. When grown in identical conditions, the ratio of white sectors in ZY-4 leaves is higher than in ZY-8. In both mutants, the cells in green sectors contain normal chloroplasts; while, the cells in white sectors contain abnormal plastids. Seedling chloroplasts ultrastructure of both mutants showed that the biogenesis of chloroplasts was blocked in early stages; delayed development and structual damage in ZY-4 were more serious than in ZY-8. Employing bulked segregant analysis(BSA), two bulks (BY142 and BY137) from BC2F1 lines derived from ZY-4 and ZS11, and one bulk (BY56) from BC2F1 lines derived from ZY-8 and ZS11, and screening by Brassica 60K SNP BeadChip Array, showed the candidate regions localized in chromosome A08 (BY142), C04 (BY137), and A08 (BY56), respectively. Transcriptome analysis of five seedling development stages of ZY-4, ZY-8, and ZS11 showed that photosynthesis, energy metabolism-related pathways and translation-related pathways were important for chloroplast biogenesis. The number of down- or up-regulated genes related to immune system process in ZY-4 was more than in ZY-8. The retrograde signaling pathway was mis-regulated in both mutants. DEG analysis indicated that both mutants showed photooxidative damages. By coupling transcriptome and BSA CHIP analyses, some candidate genes were identified. The gene expression pattern of carotene biosynthesis pathway was disrupted in both mutants. However, histochemical analysis of ROS revealed that there was no excessive accumulation of ROS in ZY-4 and ZY-8. Taken together, our data indicate that the disruption of carotene biosynthetic pathways leads to the variegation phenotypes of ZY-4 and ZY-8 and there are some functions that can compensate for the disruption of carotene biosynthesis in ZY-4 and ZY-8 to reduce ROS and prevent seedling mortality.

TI  - Measurement of land surface temperature from oblique angle airborne thermal camera observations
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a novel airborne remote sensing method using thermal imaging to directly georeference and calculate Earth surface temperature with a high spatiotemporal resolution. A tethered balloon is used to elevate an uncooled thermal camera in the field. When deployed, images with oblique view angles of the surrounding Earth surface are collected. Images recorded from a field environmental monitoring campaign in a northern Canadian mining facility are processed with open source software, and it is shown that they successfully represent the diurnal and spatial surface temperature variations within the facility. Furthermore, in comparison to MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite images, the approach results in a median absolute error of 0.64 K, with a bias and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.5 K and 5.45 K, respectively.

TI  - Cloud and cloud shadow masking for Sentinel-2 using multitemporal images in global area
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sentinel-2 data provided the opportunity for complementary data to existing missions including Landsat and SPOT. In this study, multitemporal cloud masking (MCM) used to detect cloud and cloud shadow masking for Landsat 8 was improved to detect cloud and cloud shadow for Sentinel-2 data. This improvement takes advantages of the spectral similarity between Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2. To assess the reliability of the new MCM algorithm, several data selected from different environments such as sub-tropical South, tropical, and sub-tropical North were evaluated. Moreover, these data have heterogeneous land cover and variety of cloud types. In visual assessment, the algorithm can detect cloud and cloud shadow accurately. In the statistical assessment, the user's and producer's accuracies of sample in sub-tropical environments of cloud masking was 99% and 96%, respectively, and cloud shadow masking was 99% and 98%, respectively. In addition, the user's and producer's accuracies of sample in tropical environments of cloud masking was 100% and 95%, respectively, and cloud shadow masking was 100% and 92%, respectively. Compared to Fmask, MCM has higher accuracies in most of the results of cloud and cloud shadow masking in both sub-tropical and tropical environments. The results showed that the improved-MCM algorithm can detect cloud and cloud shadow for Sentinel-2 data accurately in all scenarios and the accuracies are significantly high.

TI  - How to account for endmember variability in spectral mixture analysis of night-time light imagery?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Night-Time light imagery has become a very popular data source for monitoring the intensity of human activity in urban environments. Subpixel information is required in many applications, however, the widely used low-spatial-resolution night-time light imagery suffers from the mixed-pixel problem. In this paper, using the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) data, we presented the first spectral mixture analysis (SMA) on night-time light imagery. Specifically, we proposed to define two endmembers (light and dark) for endmember selection. In order to address the severe endmember variability problem caused by the various light sources and intensities, we adopted the Bayesian SMA (BSMA) method which is based on Bayes' theorem. The results indicate that the approach can obtain subpixel light fraction accurately with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17 and a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.95. Although BSMA achieved similar results with the traditional linear SMA, BSMA allows one to determine the uncertainty of the estimated fraction as a distribution.

TI  - Estimating natural grassland biomass by vegetation indices using Sentinel 2 remote sensing data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of natural grassland biomass was carried out in a region located in the Brazilian Pampa, using field and remote sensing data and statistical models. The study was conducted in a grassland with a rotational grazing system, with grazing rest interval based on accumulated thermal sums 375 and 750 Degrees Day (DD). One image of the MSI (MultiSpectral Instrument) sensor aboard the Sentinel-2 satellite was evaluated and calibrated by 57 sampled biomass units collected in the field. Initially, the image was preprocessed, with extraction of the reflectance values of the Sentinel-2 bands, re-sampling of the pixels to 20 metres and calculation of vegetation indices. Data statistical analyses indicated significant correlations between field and remote sensing data. Multiple linear regression analyses were applied at each grazing rest interval using the remote sensing variables as predictors (independent) of the biomass (dependent). Among the variables, it is important to highlight the significant correlation of the red-edge bands with the biomass. The equations for estimating green biomass-presented coefficients of determination (R-2) of R-2 = 0.51 for the rest interval 375 DD and R-2 = 0.65 for the rest interval 750 DD, while the senescent and total biomass generated adjustments with R-2 <= 0.50 for the two rest intervals. Biomass estimates results were satisfactory, regardless of the interval evaluated. Sampling schemes at different seasons of the year and further spectral and field variables (spectral and biomass) are suggested to improve even more the accuracy of the estimates.

TI  - Remote sensing: generation of long-term kelp bed data sets for evaluation of impacts of climatic variation
T2  - ECOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A critical tool in assessing ecosystem change is the analysis of long-term data sets, yet such information is generally sparse and often unavailable for many habitats. Kelp forests are an example of rapidly changing ecosystems that are in most cases data poor. Because kelp forests are highly dynamic and have high intrinsic interannual variability, understanding how regional-scale drivers are driving kelp populations-and particularly how kelp populations are responding to climate change-requires long-term data sets. However, much of the work on kelp responses to climate change has focused on just a few, relatively long-lived, perennial, canopy-forming species. To understand how kelp populations with different life history traits are responding to climate-related variability, we leverage 35 yr of Landsat satellite imagery to track the population size of an annual, ruderal kelp, Nereocystis luetkeana, across Oregon. We found high levels of interannual variability in Nereocystis canopy area and varying population trajectories over the last 35 yr. Surprisingly, Oregon Nereocystis population sizes were unresponsive to a 2014 marine heat wave accompanied by increases in urchin densities that decimated northern California Nereocystis populations. Some Oregon Nereocystis populations have even increased in area relative to pre-2014 levels. Analysis of environmental drivers found that Nereocystis population size was negatively correlated with estimated nitrate levels and positively correlated with winter wave height. This pattern is the inverse of the predicted relationship based on extensive prior work on the perennial kelp Macrocystis pyrifera and may be related to the annual life cycle of Nereocystis. This article demonstrates (1) the value of novel remote sensing tools to create long-term data sets that may challenge our understanding of nearshore marine species and (2) the need to incorporate life history traits into our theory of how climate change will shape the ocean of the future.

TI  - Assessing the Threat of Incel Violence
T2  - STUDIES IN CONFLICT & TERRORISM
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, increasingly serious incidents of violence have been committed by young men predominantly in the United States and Canada who self-identify as incels (involuntary celibates). Although these attacks often specifically target women, the principal source of their animus, men as well as children have been among the casualties in the series of shootings and vehicular homicides that have occurred at universities, high schools, and on city streets. Although, the incel worldview is not obviously political, its core ethos entails the subjugation and repression of a group and its violence is designed to have far-reaching societal effects. Accordingly, incel violence arguably conforms to an emergent trend in terrorism with a more salient hate crime dimension that necessitates greater scrutiny and analysis-especially as it spreads to Europe and shows similarities to and has nascent connections with other terrorist movements.

TI  - Quantifying the impacts of human water use and climate variations on recent drying of Lake Urmia basin: the value of different sets of spaceborne and in situ data for calibrating a global hydrological model
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - During the last decades, the endorheic Lake Urmia basin in northwestern Iran has suffered from declining groundwater tables and a very strong recent reduction in the volume of Lake Urmia. For the case of Lake Urmia basin, this study explores the value of different locally and globally available observation data for adjusting a global hydrological model such that it can be used for distinguishing the impacts of human water use and climate variations. The WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) was for the first time calibrated against multiple in situ and spaceborne data to analyze the decreasing lake water volume, lake river inflow, loss of groundwater, and total water storage in the entire basin during 2003-2013. The calibration process was done using an automated approach including a genetic algorithm (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Then the best-performing calibrated models were run with and without considering water use to quantify the impact of human water use. Observations encompass remote-sensing-based time series of annual irrigated areas in the basin from MODIS, monthly total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE satellites, and monthly lake volume anomalies. In situ observations include time series of annual inflow into the lake and basin averages of groundwater level variations based on 284 wells. In ad- dition, local estimates of sectoral water withdrawals in 2009 and return flow fractions were utilized. Calibration against MODIS and GRACE data alone improved simulated inflow into Lake Urmia but inflow and lake volume loss were still overestimated, while groundwater loss was underestimated and seasonality of groundwater storage was shifted as compared to observations. Lake and groundwater dynamics could only be simulated well if calibration against groundwater levels led to an adjustment of the fractions of human water use from groundwater and surface water. Thus, in some basins, globally available satellite-derived observations may not suffice for improving the simulation of human water use. According to WGHM simulations with 18 optimal parameter sets, human water use was the reason for 52 %-57 % of the total basin water loss of about 10 km(3) during 2003-2013, for 39 %-43 % of the Lake Urmia water loss of about 8 km(3), and for up to 87 %-90 % of the groundwater loss. Lake inflow was 39 %-45 % less than it would have been without human water use. The study shows that even without human water use Lake Urmia would not have recovered from the significant loss of lake water volume caused by the drought year 2008. These findings can support water management in the basin and more specifically Lake Urmia restoration plans.

TI  - Changes in the soil erosion status in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin from 2001 to 2014 and the impacts of erosion on the water quality of lakes and reservoirs
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) was used to obtain the soil erosion intensity distribution in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLYB), where the input data included a digital elevation model (DEM) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing products. Changes in the soil erosion intensity throughout the MLYB were analysed from 2001 to 2014, and the potential influences of these changes on the local water quality of lakes and reservoirs were revealed. This investigation is the first to reveal the spatial and temporal changes in soil erosion throughout the MLYB. The results indicated that from 2001 to 2014, most of the MLYB was characterized by slight and light soil erosion levels, whereas relatively few areas exhibited intensive to severe soil erosion. Soil erosion in the MLYB displayed a decreasing trend from 2001 to 2014; over 80% of the region displayed a decreasing soil erosion intensity change rate, indicating that soil conservation in most of the MLYB has improved over the past 14 years. However, 12.8% of the area presented an increasing change rate, and the region with the maximum increasing change rate was located mainly in the lower Yangtze basin. Furthermore, spatial heterogeneities were found in the soil erosion intensities throughout the MLYB: soil erosion improved in the upper and middle regions of the MLYB, whereas soil erosion worsened in the lower regions of the MLYB. Among the sub-basins of the MLYB, obvious soil erosion occurred most frequently in the Hanjiang basin and least frequently in the Taihu basin. A driving force analysis showed that the influence of precipitation on soil erosion is more evident than that of human activities in all sub-basins except the Dongting basin. A correlation analysis between soil erosion and water turbidity/water transparency showed that 45.9% of the decreasing water turbidity is correlated with decreasing soil erosion and that 42.5% of the increasing water turbidity might be influenced by increasing soil erosion. Decreased soil erosion might be responsible for the improved water transparency for 50% of the lakes, whereas increased soil erosion is correlated with a decrease in water transparency for over 50% of the lakes.

TI  - Optimization of multi-scale segmentation of satellite imagery using fractal geometry
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - After decades of research, optimal scale selection for image segmentation remains a key scienti?c problem in image analysis. In order to contribute to a solution, a new method was developed in this research, based on the use of fractal dimension as an indicator of optimality. First, the image is partitioned according to the rank-size rule (stemming from the Zipf's law), to detect a set of scales corresponding to constant fractal dimension over image rescaling; these scales are defined as 'optimal'. Then, the detected scales are transferred to the segmentation process through the projection of every partition head group to the entire image; this can be seen as a topological transformation. The Fractal Net Evolution Assessment (FNEA) is applied as a segmentation algorithm. The new method was structured as a mathematical proposition, then proved and finally was experimented with three types of satellite imagery (namely, Sentinel-2, RapidEye, and WorldView2) in four study areas with diverse land uses. In all cases, the method achieved to indicate those scales at which fractal dimension remains constant, therefore, the optimal scales. The results were verified visually and showed to be successful. Also, they were compared to pre-existing classification data, revealing high correlation between fractal dimension and classification accuracy. The new method is considered to be a generic, fully quantitative, straightforward, objective, rapid, robust, and easy to apply image segmentation tool.

TI  - An efficient model for the prediction of SMAP sea surface salinity using machine learning approaches in the Persian Gulf
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) is a pre-eminent parameter in oceanology causing extreme climate and weather events such as floods and droughts. Therefore, knowledge discovery of SSS is increasingly becoming a fundamental problem in recent years. However, not only the inadequacy of in-situ SSS data in large ocean basins are hampering conduction of detailed analyses of patterning SSS variations but also conventional data-gathering techniques for SSS estimation are often too expensive and time-consuming to meet the amount of data required in SSS estimation studies. Conversely, the brand-new Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission could provide validated SSS data along with its main objective soil moisture retrieval. As a result, collecting a candidate data set of surface's parameters as inputs to SSS with the aid of Pearson correlation and Boruta feature selection techniques, this paper aims to study the predictive skills of machine learning approaches to estimate SMAP radiometer SSS in the Persian Gulf region from April 2015 to April 2017. Thus, four machine learning methods including Support Vector Regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and gradient boosting machine (GBM) were adopted to model the SSS. Two approaches of GBM and RF provided scarcely equivalent predictions for both the calibration and validation data sets that were distinguishably substantiated by experimental results and simulations, nonetheless, slightly superior results were attained with the GBM model by correlation coefficient (r) = 0.734, root mean squared error (RMSE) = 0.906 and mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.627. The findings demonstrate promising SSS estimation from SMAP, which could provide a baseline to perceive the large-scale changes in SSS.

TI  - Long-term spatial distribution of vegetation and sand movement following the commencement of landscape conservation activities to curb grassland encroachment at the Tottori Sand Dunes natural monument (Vegetation and sand movement in the Tottori Sand Dunes)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - San'in Kaigan Geopark is recognized as a United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Global Geopark, and the Tottori Sand Dunes in the park are designated as a Natural Monument of Japan. In 1900, the area that constitutes the Tottori Sand Dunes was part of a vast coastal sand dune system. However, the encroachment of grasslands (grasslandisation) became a significant threat to the area and by 1991 about 42% of the surfaces of the sand dunes were covered with vegetation. This prompted the initiation of landscape conservation activities, primarily weeding, in 1994. We analysed the spatial distribution of sand movement based on aerial land survey data captured intermittently since 1964, and propose a method for evaluation of the vegetation cover ratio per 30 x 30-m cell (pixel polygons; PPs), based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) photographs and satellite data. Our analysis showed that the inland slope of the second row of sand dunes has shifted landward by around 30 m due to extremely high deposition rates. The third row of sand dunes has also moved inland. Thus, the Oigo-suribachi Basin has gradually been buried along the coast due to significant sand sedimentation along the inland slope of the third row of sand dunes. We analysed the spatial distribution of the vegetation cover ratio on 9 May 1990, when the area of the encroaching grasslands was largest. A vegetated area with a vegetation cover ratio exceeding 0.40 extended from the first row of sand dunes to the west of the windbreaks located in the sand dune area. In the area in close proximity to the first row of sand dunes, the vegetation cover ratio was 0.51 in 1990 and reached 0.56 in 1995. However, it decreased rapidly to 0.14 by 1996, and since 2000 it has fluctuated within the range of 0.01-0.13.

TI  - Snow depth in Dhundi: an estimate based on weighted bias corrected differential phase observations of dual polarimetric bi-temporal Sentinel-1 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The studies on snow depth comprise a crucial area of research in the Indian Himalayas, where the seasonal snow cover primarily drives the rivers and significant water resources. In this paper, the initial estimates of the line of sight displacement obtained using differential interferometric phase in VV and VH polarizations using Sentinel-1 bi-temporal dual polarimetric SAR data corresponding to snow covered and snow free land cover, are improved by applying bias corrections for the snow phase and for residual errors in displacement derived from the corrected snow phase. The bias for the snow phase is computed from the observed phase in VV and VH polarizations for the snow free area and the bias for the residual errors is computed by observing the stationary pixels identified in the snow free area using a digital elevation model. The snow depth is computed as a weighted sum of the corrected displacements in the VV and VH polarization, with the weights derived using the local incidence angle. The snow depth results based on the proposed approach was evaluated with respect to field measurements and a coefficient of determination of 0.628 was observed with an improvement of similar to 0.4 as compared to the displacement observed in the VV and VH channel using the conventional method.

TI  - A global regression method for thermal sharpening of urban land surface temperatures from MODIS and Landsat
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperatures (LST) in urban landscapes are typically more heterogeneous than can be monitored by the spatial resolution of satellite-based thermal infrared sensors. Thermal sharpening (TS) methods permit the disaggregation of LST based on finer-grained multispectral information, but there is continued debate over which spectral indices are most appropriate for urban TS, and how they should be configured in a predictive regression framework. In this study, we evaluate the stability of various TS kernels with respect to LST at different spatial (Landsat 8) and diurnal (MODIS) scales, and present a new TS method, global regression for urban thermal sharpening (SGRUTS), based on these findings. Of the spectral indices examined, the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) and the normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI) were the most spatially stable for Landsat 8 and MODIS overall. Kernel performance varied diurnally, with the index-based impervious surface index (IBI) and broadband alpha selected for 1030 h, NDBI and NMDI selected for 1330 h, and IBI and NMDI selected for 2230 h and 130 h, respectively. Over a range of field-validated metrics, the SGRUTS scheme comprising a two-factor interaction between NDBI and NMDI was competitive with the best alternative TS models compared. This SGRUTS model is essentially a refinement of the Enhanced Physical Method for urban applications in terms of kernel selection and configuration, and has interpretative advantages over more complex statistical schemes.

TI  - Monitoring spatiotemporal variability of water quality parameters Using Landsat imagery in Choghakhor International Wetland during the last 32 years
T2  - ANNALES DE LIMNOLOGIE-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LIMNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Use of Landsat is of importance in monitoring and assessment of long-term changes of water quality in freshwater ecosystems, especially in small water bodies. In this study, over a 32-year period (1985-2017), the changes in water surface temperature (WST), secchi disk transparency (SDT), and chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration were estimated at the Choghakhor wetland using Landsat imagery. Based on WST three detectable temperature zones can be observed within the wetland aquatic environment where the highest amount was observed in thermal strips. The results showed Chl-a concentration volatility in different periods in the wetland as well as its long-term increasing trend. The western part of the wetland, as compared to other areas, was affected by these changes, which could be due to the human activity concentrated in this area. In contrast (SDT) showed a decreasing trend during this period that was consistent with the observed changes in Chl-a concentration. This could be due to an increase in organic matter load and suspended solids in the water body of wetland during this time. Comparison of the extracted satellite data with the field data showed the least RMSE and high R-2. Also, ANOVA results showed significant spatio-temporal differences between the studied parameters in Choghakhor wetland (p < 0.05). The present study can help to detect long-term changes in Choghakhor wetland and help toward moving to optimal management and protection of this wetland.Mapping the spatio-temporal distribution for Chl-a, SDT, and WST with remotely sensed data would be helpful for management of freshwater ecosystems (here the wetland). According to the results of this study, large changes in these parameters were observed in the Choghakhor wetland during the period 1985-2017 and reflect the ecological conditions in the wetland. Considering that this first study with a new approach to the region, it can be used as a comprehensive guideline for remote monitoring as a viable tool for monitoring wetlands.

TI  - Determining Bathymetry of Shallow and Ephemeral Desert Lakes Using Satellite Imagery and Altimetry
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water volume estimates of shallow desert lakes are the basis for water balance calculations, important both for water resource management and paleohydrology/climatology. Water volumes are typically inferred from bathymetry mapping; however, being shallow, ephemeral, and remote, bathymetric surveys are scarce in such lakes. We propose a new, remote-sensing-based, method to derive the bathymetry of such lakes using the relation between water occurrence, during >30 year of optical satellite data, and accurate elevation measurements from the new Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2). We demonstrate our method at three locations where we map bathymetries with similar to 0.3 m error. This method complements other remotely sensed, bathymetry-mapping methods as it can be applied to: (a) complex lake systems with subbasins, (b) remote lakes with no in-situ records, and (c) flooded lakes. The proposed method can be easily implemented in other shallow lakes as it builds on publically accessible global data sets.

TI  - Fine-Scale Variability of Observed and Simulated Surface Albedo Over the Southern Great Plains
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface albedo can be highly variable in both space and time. The Department of Energy's Holistic Interactions of Shallow Clouds, Aerosols, and Land-Ecosystems field study provides a unique opportunity to characterize the variability of surface albedo over the Southern Great Plains of the United States using integrated tower, aircraft, and satellite observations. The primary advantage of the aircraft and satellite observations is the ability to examine the spatial distribution of surface albedo over a large area, while the tower measurements have the ability to examine both diurnal and day-to-day variability at a single location. In general, consistency was found between the broadband (BB) albedo measured from the surface, air, and space. There was a small increase from 0.186 to 0.194 in the aircraft BB surface albedo between May and September (about 4% change), while the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer black-sky BB surface albedo increased from 0.151 to 0.166 over the same period (about 10% change), while the standard deviations in the aircraft and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer BB albedo were similar. The largest seasonal differences in the aircraft BB albedo were found for areas with winter wheat or forest, while areas with pasture or grasses showed a smaller seasonal diversity. The Weather Research and Forecasting model was used to simulate the BB surface albedo. In comparison with the aircraft and satellite observations, the Weather Research and Forecasting-simulated BB surface albedo had no seasonal change and a much narrower distribution.

TI  - Tracing 'Third Pole' ice meltwater contribution to the Himalayan rivers using oxygen and hydrogen isotopes
T2  - GEOCHEMICAL PERSPECTIVES LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming is adversely affecting the melting rates of Himalayan glaciers, which feed a number of large river systems in the Indian sub-continent. Regional scale assessment of glaciers and their link to rivers are mostly quantified using remote sensing data and modelling techniques. Here we present an alternative stable water isotope modelling approach. New oxygen and hydrogen isotopes (O-18/O-16 and H-2/H-1, expressed as delta O-18 and delta D) data from the headwater of Indus River were analysed with a comprehensively compiled delta O-18 and delta D dataset of Himalayan rivers to quantify the volumetric flow of glacier ice meltwater in the headwaters of the rivers Indus, Ganges, and Brahmaputra. The isotope mixing model reveals that the discharge weighted annual average glacier ice meltwater contribution in headwaters (>2000 m) of the Indus, the Ganges, and the Brahmaputra are 47 +/- 13 %, 44 +/- 13 %, and 29 +/- 10 %, respectively, which corresponds to a minimum of 33.5 +/- 6.5 Gt yr(-1) of melted ice mass. Our results show that annual glacier ice meltwater contributions vary across the river basins, with Indus River receiving the highest contribution. We conclude that stable water isotope modelling is an alternative approach to study regional scale glacier-river interactions to address the future impact of climate change over glaciated Himalayan catchments.

TI  - Grounding Line Retreat of Denman Glacier, East Antarctica, Measured With COSMO-SkyMed Radar Interferometry Data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Denman Glacier, East Antarctica, holds an ice volume equivalent to a 1.5 m rise in global sea level. Using satellite radar interferometry from the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, we detect a 5.4 0.3 km grounding line retreat between 1996 and 2017-2018. A novel reconstruction of the glacier bed topography indicates that the retreat proceeds on the western flank along a previously unknown 5 km wide, 1,800 m deep trough, deepening to 3,400 m below sea level. On the eastern flank, the grounding line is stabilized by a 10 km wide ridge. At tidal frequencies, the grounding line extends over a several kilometer-wide grounding zone, enabling warm ocean water to melt ice at critical locations for glacier stability. If warm, modified Circumpolar Deep Water reaches the sub-ice-shelf cavity and continues to melt ice at a rate exceeding balance conditions, the potential exists for Denman Glacier to retreat irreversibly into the deepest, marine-based basin in Antarctica.Plain Language Summary Using satellite radar data from the Italian COSMO-SkyMed constellation, we document the grounding line retreat of Denman Glacier, a major glacier in East Antarctica that holds an ice volume equivalent to a 1.5 m global sea level rise. The grounding line is retreating asymmetrically. On the eastern flank, the glacier is protected by a subglacial ridge. On the western flank, we find a deep and steep trough with a bed slope that makes the glacier conducive to rapid retreat. If warm water continues to induce high rates of ice melt near the glacier grounding zone, the potential exists for Denman Glacier to undergo a rapid and irreversible retreat, with major consequences for sea level rise.

TI  - On-orbit installation matrix calibration and its application on AGRI of FY-4A
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Image navigation is a primary process for on-orbit optical payloads involving environmental disaster monitoring, meteorological observation, and the positioning and tracking of space-aeronautics targets. However, because they are affected by solar illumination and orbital heat flux, as well as shock and vibration during launch, the installation structures between the instruments and satellite platform, especially for geostationary satellites, will inevitably generate a displacement resulting in the reduction of positioning accuracy. During the application of FengYun-4A (FY-4A), it is found that the further away from the subsatellite point, the greater the positioning error of Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) on FY-4A will be. The positioning error can reach 14 pixels at the Arabian Peninsula in operational images. In addition, compared with orbital and attitude measurement errors, long-term observations show that the installation matrix is likely to be the most significant factor determining the navigation accuracy of AGRI. Therefore, an on-orbit installation matrix calibration approach as well as a high-precision navigation algorithm is proposed to modify the positioning error of AGRI. Experimental results show that the navigation error of the processed images corrected by the proposed method can be reduced to 1.3 pixels, which greatly improves the navigation procession of AGRI. In general, this method could be a supplement to the correction of positioning error for geostationary payloads. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Scholars of color turn to womanism: Countering dehumanization in the academy
T2  - EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY AND THEORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The article draws on critiques in political theory and morality to argue that womanism, a worldview rooted in Black women's lives and history, provides an alternative conceptual framework to prevailing Eurocentric thinking for promoting socially just institutions of higher education. Presupposing a positioned, encultured, and embodied account of identity, womanism's social change perspective holds transformative promise. It forgrounds in Black women's penchant for reaching solutions that promote communal balance, affirm one's humanity and attend to the spiritual dimension (Phillips, 2006). Directed first towards scholars of color, we assert that fostering inclusivity, communalist values and acknowledged intersectionality offers an ethic of the embodied self. As a corollary, it argues for a universal that recommends at least two guiding principles for a pedagogical philosophy. It is, first, one oriented towards a love of self and second towards placing all disciplines within a cultural-historical context. In the first principle, there is potential for nothing less than suspending the symbolic and ontological violence to one's sense of belonging in academia. In the second principle, such an understanding can position scholars of color to actively re-narrate their fields. As illustrations, we focus on three academic fields of education, theology in higher education, and criminal justice.

TI  - Burgeoning study of sentinel-node analysis on management of early gastric cancer after endoscopic submucosal dissection
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY
M3  - Review
AB  - Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) represents an organ-preserving alternative to surgical resection of early gastric cancer. However, even with ESD yielding en-bloc resection specimens, there are concerns regarding tumor spread such as with larger lesions, ulcerated lesions, undifferentiated pathology and submucosal invasion. Sentinel node navigational surgery (SNNS) when combined with ESD offers a minimally invasive alternative to the traditional extended gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy if lack of lymph node spread can be confirmed. This would have a clear advantage in terms of potential complications and quality of life. However, SNNS, though useful in other malignancies such as breast cancer and melanoma, may not have a sufficient sensitivity for malignancy and negative predictive value in EGC to justify this as standard practice after ESD. The results of SNNS may improve with greater standardization and more involved dissection, technological innovations and more experience and validation such that the paradigm for post-ESD resection of EGC may change and include SNNS.

TI  - Global Estimates of Reach-Level Bankfull River Width Leveraging Big Data Geospatial Analysis
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent progress in remote sensing has snapshotted unprecedented numbers of river planform geometry, providing opportunity to revisit the oversimplified channel shape parameterizations in global hydrologic models. This study leveraged two recent Landsat-derived global river width databases and created a reach-level width dataset to measure the validity of model parameterizations at similar to 1.6 million kilometers of rivers in length. By showing state-of-the-art parameterization schemes only capture 30-40% of the width variance globally, we developed a machine learning (ML) approach surveying 16 environmental covariates, which considerably improved the predictive power (R-2 = 0.81 and 0.77 for two testing cases). Beyond the commonly discussed upstream basin conditions, ML revealed that local physiographic factors and human interference are also important covariates for width variability. Finally, we applied the ML model to estimate bankfull river width, creating a new reach-level dataset for use in global hydrodynamic modeling.Plain Language Summary Large-scale river models typically parameterize channel shapes (e.g., bankfull width) based on discharge or drainage area with a power law model or stream order with look-up tables. These highly simplified representations reflect our limited understanding of spatial variability of channel shapes, leading to great uncertainty in global river modeling. Using the most up-to-date global snapshots of channel planform geometry derived from satellite images, this study revisited state-of-the-art channel shape parameterizations used in large-scale river models. We also used a machine learning approach to improve the predictive power for the width spatial variability. Results from this study can complement the understanding of downstream hydraulic geometry from a data mining viewpoint, which also informs the improvement of channel shape parameterization in models.

TI  - Channel Network Control on Seasonal Lake Area Dynamics in Arctic Deltas
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The abundant lakes dotting arctic deltas are hotspots of methane emissions and biogeochemical activity, but seasonal variability in lake extents introduces uncertainty in estimates of lacustrine carbon emissions, typically performed at annual or longer time scales. To characterize variability in lake extents, we analyzed summertime lake area loss (i.e., shrinkage) on two deltas over the past 20 years, using Landsat-derived water masks. We find that monthly shrinkage rates have a pronounced structured variability around the channel network with the shrinkage rate systematically decreasing farther away from the channels. This pattern of shrinkage is predominantly attributed to a deeper active layer enhancing near-surface connectivity and storage and greater vegetation density closer to the channels leading to increased evapotranspiration rates. This shrinkage signal, easily extracted from remote sensing observations, may offer the means to constrain estimates of lacustrine methane emissions and to develop process-based estimates of depth to permafrost on arctic deltas.Plain Language Summary The numerous lakes and ponds on arctic deltas emit large quantities of methane, but changes in lake area over spring and summer confound emission estimates. We studied summertime changes in lake area in two deltas over the past 20 years and found that lake area shrank at a higher rate closer to river channels on the delta. Thicker vegetation which increases water loss and a deeper unfrozen soil layer which stores more water underground closer to the channels are likely contributors to the observed higher shrinkage rates. This information can be used to improve estimates of methane emissions from lakes on arctic deltas, to monitor future changes in a warming climate, and to develop physically based models of depth to permafrost on arctic deltas.

TI  - Spatial and seasonal variability of surface particulate inorganic carbon and relationship with particulate organic carbon in the Yellow-Bohai Sea
T2  - JOURNAL OF OCEANOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate carbon is one of the major carbon forms in seawater, thus plays an important role in the carbon cycle. Limited small scale studies showed that particulate inorganic carbon (PIC) content was much higher than particulate organic carbon (POC) in the Yellow River Estuary. This study is to test the hypothesis that surface PIC is significantly higher than POC in the Yellow-Bohai Sea (YBS). Using the PIC and POC data derived from MODIS-Aqua during 2002-2016, we find that mean PIC:POC ratio is similar to 2 in the water column for the whole YBS. Overall, PIC is significantly higher in the nearshore waters (> 600 mg m(-3)) than in the offshore, with the lowest found in the center of the south Yellow Sea (< 100 mg m(-3)). There is a tongue shaped area with year-around high PIC value (> 600 mg m(-3)) near the Old Yellow river estuary where POC level is not so high comparing with other sections. Surface PIC in the YBS shows a strong seasonality, i.e., highest in winter and lowest in summer, which is largely attributable to strong sediment resuspension in winter and strong stratification in summer. Our analyses indicate that sediment resuspension and water exchange are dominant factors regulating the seasonal and spatial variability of PIC in the YBS.

TI  - Annual oil palm plantation maps in Malaysia and Indonesia from 2001 to 2016
T2  - EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - Increasing global demand of vegetable oils and biofuels results in significant oil palm expansion in southeastern Asia, predominately in Malaysia and Indonesia. The land conversion to oil palm plantations has posed risks to deforestation (50 % of the oil palm was taken from forest during 1990-2005; Koh and Wilcove, 2008), loss of biodiversity and greenhouse gas emission over the past decades. Quantifying the consequences of oil palm expansion requires fine-scale and frequently updated datasets of land cover dynamics. Previous studies focused on total changes for a multi-year interval without identifying the exact time of conversion, causing uncertainty in the timing of carbon emission estimates from land cover change. Using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets, we produced an annual oil palm area dataset (AOPD) at 100 m resolution in Malaysia and Indonesia from 2001 to 2016. We first mapped the oil palm extent using PALSAR and PALSAR-2 data for 2007-2010 and 2015-2016 and then applied a disturbance and recovery algorithm (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend - BFAST) to detect land cover change time points using MODIS data during the years without PALSAR data (2011-2014 and 2001-2006). The new oil palm land cover maps are assessed to have an accuracy of 86.61 % in the mapping step (2007-2010 and 2015-2016). During the intervening years when MODIS data are used, 75.74 % of the detected change time matched the timing of actual conversion using Google Earth and Landsat images. The AOPD revealed spatiotemporal oil palm dynamics every year and shows that plantations expanded from 2.59 to 6.39 x 10(6) ha and from 3.00 to 12.66 x 10(6) ha in Malaysia and Indonesia, respectively (i.e. a net increase of 146.60 % and 322.46 %) between 2001 and 2016. The higher trends from our dataset are consistent with those from the national inventories, with limited annual average difference in Malaysia (0.2 x 10(6) ha) and Indonesia (-0.17 x 10(6) ha). We highlight the capability of combining multiple-resolution radar and optical satellite datasets in annual plantation mapping to a large extent by using image classification and statistical boundary-based change detection to achieve long time series. The consistent characterization of oil palm dynamics can be further used in downstream applications. The annual oil palm plantation maps from 2001 to 2016 at 100 m resolution are published in the Tagged Image File Format with georeferencing information (GeoTIFF) at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3467071 (Xu et al., 2019).

TI  - Least Square Based Iteration Approach for Agricultural Soil Moisture Retrieval Using Multi-Sensor Data
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objective of this study is to develop a robust soil moisture retrieval approach using multi-sensor remote sensing data. Firstly, the water cloud model was employed to eliminate the vegetation effects on SAR observations over vegetated areas, thus to obtain the bare soil backscatter associated with soil moisture. Then, against the underdetermined system for soil moisture retrieval, the advanced integral equation model and calibrated integral equation model were integrated to construct soil moisture retrieval scheme in combination with multi-sensor SAR observations. Through the above processing the influences of vegetation and surface roughness can be minimized in the developed soil moisture retrieval scheme. Finally, the least square based iteration approach was applied to derive soil moisture with multi-sensor SAR observations as inputs. Based on the field measurements and multi-sensor SAR data (C-band and X-band). acquired on June 2015 and October 2015 over Hebei agricultural areas, quantitative evaluation of the developed approach was implemented. The results indicate that accurate soil moisture was obtained by the developed approach over corn covered area and bare agricultural area. In comparison with the results obtained by LUT method, the least square based iteration approach achieved better estimations for soil moisture.

TI  - Korea's Sipjangsaeng Iconography: The Quest for Longevity and Immortality in the Visual Arts of the Joseon Dynasty
T2  - ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL-JAPAN FOCUS
M3  - Article
AB  - This article introduces Korea's sipjangsaeng iconography in the visual arts, including its proliferation in Joseon's elite and folk contexts, its codification in the painted screens of the court, and its application in works of art held at various international museums. It considers how Chinese motifs came to be used so widely in Korea; which individuals or groups commissioned and produced the sipjangsaeng design; and why, despite its resolutely Neo-Confucian worldview, the Joseon dynasty played host to the proliferation of a genre emanating largely from a Daoist tradition. To address these questions, it investigates the transnational, ideological, and social contexts that gave rise to Korea's distinctive sipjangsaeng imprint on the longevity theme and highlights the intrinsic importance of symbolism to Korea's cultural heritage, and its contribution to the articulation of artistic identity and difference in East Asian visual culture.

TI  - Deprovincialization as a key correlate of ideology, prejudice, and intergroup contact
T2  - PERSONALITY AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper aimed to examine deprovincialization, defined as a less ingroup-centric worldview fostering openness to other cultures and outgroups, and to test its relationships with personality, cognitive styles, values, political ideologies, intergroup contact, and prejudice. In Study 1, we proved the factorial validity of the Cultural Deprovincialization Scale (CDS), an instrument specifically designed to assess a growing acceptance of other peoples and cultures following intergroup encounters, and we provided evidence for its construct validity by exploring its nomological net. People scoring higher on the CDS were more extraverted, agreeable, open to experience, cognitively flexible, and scored lower on social dominance orientation, right-wing authoritarianism, and nationalism. Moreover, deprovincialized people reported higher scores on positive contact, lower scores on negative contact, better outgroup attitudes, and lower levels of prejudice. In Study 2, using a longitudinal design, we tested the within- and between-individual associations that deprovincialization had with positive and negative intergroup contact, outgroup attitudes, and prejudice. Both between-individual and within-individual variations in positive and negative contact predicted time-varying deprovincialization, whereas between-individual and within-individual variations in deprovincialization predicted time-varying outgroup attitudes and prejudice, controlling for age, gender, and social dominance orientation, and also for contact when deprovincialization was a predictor.

TI  - Interannual variations of environmental factors and the effects on larval fish habitats in the Upper Gulf of California during early summer
T2  - CONTINENTAL SHELF RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - To define the larval fish habitat distributions in the Upper Gulf of California and their response to interannual environmental variability, satellite and hydrographic data and zooplankton samples, from three cruises made in early summer (June 2008, June 2010, and June 2013) were analyzed. Monthly averages of SST satellite data from June 2002 to June 2017 indicated negative anomalies during June 2008 and 2010. In spite of this, a recurrent larval fish habitat was defined in the shallowest (<39 m) and saltiest (>36.5 g kg(-1)) part of the northern UGC. The indicator species of this habitat were the demersal fishes Gobulus crescentalis and Cynoscion othonopterus. A second habitat associated with an oxygenated stratification front (>4.8 mu mol kg(-1)) located in the middle of the UGC, was defined during Junes with SST negative anomalies (2008 and 2010); with Opisthonema spp. being the indicator species. In the southern part of the UGC, sampling station groups were defined with different indicator species. This could be related to the variability of the adjacent circulation of the Northern Gulf of California, and the influence of remote ocean conditions that could be impacting the pelagic ecosystem.

TI  - Near room temperature spin reorientation and temperature evolution of magnetic structure in Mn substituted HoFeO<sub>3</sub>
T2  - JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS
M3  - Article
AB  - Magnetic structure and spin reorientation transition of 45% Mn substituted HoFeO3 have been investigated using bulk magnetization, neutron powder diffraction and specific heat capacity techniques. These studies confirm the presence of antiferromagnetic ordering of Fe/Mn sublattice below 336 K. The spin reorientation (SR) transition (T-SR similar to 290 K) where the magnetic structure changes from Gamma(4)(A(x), F-y, G(z)) to Gamma(1)(G(x), C-y, A(z)) is confirmed by Rietveld analysis of neutron diffraction patterns taken at various temperatures. Though the spin reorientation (SR) transition is happening at 290 K, the system is found to be in mixed Gamma(4)(A(x), F-y, G(z)) + Gamma(1)(G(x), C-y, A(z)) phase from room temperature to 275 K. Below 275 K, the sample exhibits a pure Gamma(1)(G(x), C-y, A(z)) structure in which the weak ferromagnetic component is absent. Bulk magnetization and specific heat capacity measurements also confirm the Neel temperature and spin reorientation transitions and support the neutron diffraction analysis.

TI  - Satellite mapping of PM<sub>2.5</sub> episodes in the wintertime San Joaquin Valley: a "static" model using column water vapor
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The use of satellite aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from imaging spectrometers has been successful in quantifying and mapping high-PM2.5 (particulate matter with a mass < 2.5 mu m diameter) episodes for pollution abatement and health studies. However, some regions have high PM2.5 but poor estimation success. The challenges in using AOT from imaging spectrometers to characterize PM2.5 worldwide was especially evident in the wintertime San Joaquin Valley (SJV). The SJV's attendant difficulties of high-albedo surfaces and very shallow, variable vertical mixing also occur in other significantly polluted regions around the world. We report on more accurate PM2.5 maps (where cloudiness permits) for the whole winter period in the SJV (19 November 2012-18 February 2013). Intensive measurements by including NASA aircraft were made for several weeks in that winter, the DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from COlumn and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) California mission.We found success with a relatively simple method based on calibration and checking with surface monitors and a characterization of vertical mixing, and incorporating specific understanding of the region's climatology. We estimate PM2.5 to within similar to 7 mu g m(-3) root mean square error (RMSE) and with R values of similar to 0.9, based on remotely sensed multi-angle implementation of atmospheric correction (MAIAC) observations, and certain further work will improve that accuracy. Mapping is at 1 km resolution. This allows a time sequence of mapped aerosols at 1 km for cloud-free days. We describe our technique as a "static estimation." Estimation procedures like this one, not dependent on well-mapped source strengths or on transport error, should help full source-driven simulations by deconstructing processes. They also provide a rapid method to create a long-term climatology.Essential features of the technique are (a) daily calibration of the AOT to PM2.5 using available surface monitors, and (b) characterization of mixed layer dilution using column water vapor (CWV, otherwise "precipitable water"). We noted that on multi-day timescales both water vapor and particles share near-surface sources and both fall to very low values with altitude; indeed, both are largely removed by precipitation. The existence of layers of H2O or aerosol not within the mixed layer adds complexity, but mixed-effects statistical regression captures essential proportionality of PM2.5 and the ratio variable (AOT / CWV). Accuracy is much higher than previous statistical models and can be extended to the whole Aqua satellite data record. The maps and time series we show suggest a repeated pattern for large valleys like the SJV - progressive stabilization of the mixing height after frontal passages: PM2.5 is somewhat more determined by day-by-day changes in mixing than it is by the progressive accumulation of pollutants (revealed as increasing AOT).

TI  - Nationwide crop yield estimation based on photosynthesis and meteorological stress indices
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - There is considerable demand for nationwide grain yield estimation during the cropping season by growers, grain marketers, grain handlers, agricultural businesses, and market brokers. In this paper, we developed a semi-empirical model (Crop-SI) to estimate the yield of the three major crops in the dryland Australian wheatbelt by combining a radiation use efficiency approach with meteorology driven Stress Indices (SI) at critical crop growth stages (e.g., anthesis and grain filling). These crop-specific SI (e.g., drought, heat and cold stress) help explain the impact of high spatial agro-environmental heterogeneity, which lead to substantial improvement in grain yield prediction. Crop-SI explains 87%, 69% and 83% of the observed field-scale grain yield variability with root mean square error of similar to 0.4, 0.4 and 0.5 t/ha for canola, wheat, and barley, respectively. At the pixel-level, Crop-SI reduces the relative error in grain yield estimation to 34%, 25%, and 20% for canola, wheat, barley, respectively, compared to two benchmark models. By incorporating water- and temperature-driven stresses, Crop-SI's predictive skill in highly variable environments is enhanced. As such, it paves the way for the next generation of agricultural systems models, knowledge products and decision support tools that need to operate at various scales.

TI  - Afforestation promotes the enhancement of forest LAI and NPP in China
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent national wide afforestation in China are playing an increasingly significant role in the global greening trend and CO2 mitigation. However, the long term knowledge of spatiotemporal pattern of plantation forests (PF) is essential to understand the continuability and sustainability of the PF contribution and its spatiotemporal pattern comparing to nature forests (NF). Here we combined an inventory based map of PF, three up-to-date remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) datasets, and a process-based terrestrial biogeochemical model to investigate the interannual variabilities (IAVs) and trends of LAI and net primary productivity (NPP) of natural and plantation forests in China, from 1982 to 2014. We found that PF possessed similar spatiotemporal patterns as those of NF, while they exhibited a greater enhancement of both LAI and NPP since 2000. The total proportions of LAI and NPP in the plantation areas increased from 22% to 23.4%, and 22% to 22.8% from 1982 to 2014, respectively. Although different datasets provided diverse rates, an increasing trend was in agreement. The spatially-explicit analysis also illustrated that the increasing proportions were primarily contributed by the Southern sub-regions, particularly the Southwest and South sub-regions, while the PF in Northern sub-regions (e.g., Inner Mongolia and Northeast) even showed a decreasing contribution trend. The quantitative outputs from this study supported that PF promoted the greening trend in China since the 21st century. However, we also argued that the swift increase in LAI and NPP by PF should mainly result from the growing number of tree plantations and the rapid growth of newly planted forests. The proper management of PF is, therefore, an essential task for the maintenance and long-term improvement of their ecosystem services.

TI  - Monitoring clearcutting and subsequent rapid recovery in Mediterranean coppice forests with Landsat time series
T2  - ANNALS OF FOREST SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Key message This work analyses the rate of recovery of the spectral signal from clearcut areas of coppice Mediterranean forests using Landsat Time Series (LTS). The analysis revealed a more rapid rate of spectral signal recovery than what was found in previous investigations in boreal and temperate forests. Context The rate of post-disturbance vegetation recovery is an important component of forest dynamics. Aims In this study, we analyze the recovery of the spectral signal from forest clearcut areas in Mediterranean conditions when the coppice system of forest management is applied. Methods We used LTS surface reflectance data (1999-2015).We generated an annual reference database of clearcuts using visual interpretation and local forest inventory data, and then derived the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) spectral trajectories for these clearcuts. From these spectral trajectories, we calculated the Years to Recovery or Y2R, the number of years it takes for a pixel to return to within a specified threshold (i.e., 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%) of its pre-disturbance value. Spectral recovery rates were then corroborated using measures of canopy height derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Results The coppice system is associated with rapid recovery rates when compared to rates of recovery from seeds or seedlings in temperate and boreal forest conditions. We found that the Y2R derived from the spectral trajectories of post-clearcut NBR and NDVI provided similar characterizations of rapid recovery for the coppice system of forest management applied in our study area. The ALS measures of canopy height indicated that the Y2R metric accurately captured the rapid regeneration of coppice systems. Conclusion The rapid rate of spectral recovery associated with the coppice system is 2-4 years, which contrasts with values reported in boreal and temperate forest environments, where spectral recovery was attained in approximately 10 years. NBR is an effective index for assessing rapid recovery in this forest system.

TI  - Mapping national-scale aquaculture ponds based on the Google Earth Engine in the Chinese coastal zone
T2  - AQUACULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Aquaculture plays a key role in addressing global food security and nutrition issues. However, the rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry has imposed tremendous pressure on coastal environments in some developing countries. The aquaculture industry in China is the largest worldwide. However, to date, we know little about the spatial distribution of aquaculture ponds. This study proposed an efficient method for mapping aquaculture ponds on a national scale using Landsat 8 images based on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. We integrated spectral, spatial characteristics and morphological operations to construct a decision tree classifier that was successfully used to extract the aquaculture pond regions in the Chinese coastal zone in 2017, with an overall accuracy of 0.96 (0.94-0.97, 95% confidence interval) and kappa coefficient of 0.82. When compared with the results of visual interpretation and other relevant studies, our method exhibited good consistency. The results provided a detailed spatial distribution of the aquaculture ponds in the Chinese coastal zone and revealed that the total area of aquaculture ponds is approximately 15632.64 km(2) (14386.98 km(2)-17924.95 km(2), 95% confidence interval), which is mainly concentrated in the Bohai Rim, Jiangsu Coastal Plain, and Guangdong coastal region. This work demonstrated that this method can generate high-quality datasets of the spatial distribution of aquaculture ponds and could map the global aquaculture ponds distribution.

TI  - Detecting spatiotemporal changes of large-scale aquaculture ponds regions over 1988-2018 in Jiangsu Province, China using Google Earth Engine
T2  - OCEAN & COASTAL MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although the aquaculture industry is a major supplier of aquatic products used as protein sources for humans, the rapid expansion of aquaculture in recent decades has led to numerous environmental problems in coastal and lakeside areas. Nonetheless, the spatiotemporal understanding of aquaculture ponds is limited, despite playing a crucial role in the management, planning, and development within the aquaculture industry. Remote sensing images can be used to acquire information pertaining to aquaculture; however, the automatic identification of aquaculture ponds remains an important challenge due to their complex spectral and spatial characteristics. This study utilized a decision-tree classifier using Landsat data derived from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform to automatically identify large-scale aquaculture ponds in Jiangsu Province through seven time slices between 1988 and 2018. The results showed that the area allocated to aquaculture ponds in Jiangsu Provinces has continually increased from 660.29 km(2) in 1988 to 4097.95 km(2) in 2018, and three regions with dense aquaculture pond distributions have developed in the coastal zone, as well as in the south and center of Jiangsu Province. The area devoted to aquaculture ponds grew exponentially from 1988 to 2003 and later experienced a slower growth rate. Moreover, inland aquaculture pond areas began to decrease since 2013; however, a rapid expansion endures in the coastal area. Socio-economic development and industry policies are the main drivers of aquaculture growth; however, the strengthening of national environmental protection policies in the 21st century has contributed to a slowdown in these trends.

TI  - Effect of an environmental flow on vegetation growth and health using ground and remote sensing metrics
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the effectiveness of environmental flow deliveries along rivers requires monitoring vegetation. Monitoring data are often collected at multiple spatial scales. For riparian vegetation, optical remote sensing methods can estimate growth responses at the riparian corridor scale, and field-based measures can quantify species composition; however, the extent to which these different measures are duplicative or complementary is important to understand when planning monitoring programmes with limited resources. In this study, we analysed riparian vegetation growth in the delta of the Colorado River in response to an experimental pulse flow. Our goal was to compare ground-based measurements of vegetation structure and composition with satellite-based Landsat radiometric variables, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). We made this comparison in 21 transects following the delivery of 131.8 million cubic meters (mcm) of water in the stream channel during the spring of 2014 as a pulse flow and 38.4 mcm as base flows. Vegetation cover increased 14% and NDVI increased 0.02 (15%) by October 2015, and both variables returned to pre-pulse flow values in October 2016. Observed changes in vegetation structure and composition did not persist after the second year. The highest increase in vegetation cover in October 2014 and October 2015 resulted from species that could respond rapidly to additional water such as reeds (Arundo donax and Phragmites australis), cattail (Typha domingensis), and herbaceous plants. Dominant shrubs, saltcedar (Tamarix spp.) and arrowweed (Pluchea sericea), both indicative of nonrestored habitats showed variable increases in cover, and native trees (Salicaceae family) presented low increases (1%). The strong NDVI-vegetation cover relationship indicates that NDVI is appropriate to detect changes at the riparian corridor scale but needs to be complemented with ground data to determine the contributions by different species to the observed trends.

TI  - The interruption of longitudinal hydrological connectivity causes delayed responses in dissolved organic matter
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydrology is the main driver of dissolved organic matter (DOM) dynamics in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams. However, it is still unclear how the timing and the spatial variation in flow connectivity affect the dynamics of DOM and inorganic solutes.This study focuses on the impact of flow cessation on the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of DOM quantity and quality along an intermittent stream. We monitored a headwater intermittent stream at high spatial and temporal frequencies during a summer drying episode and analysed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its spectroscopic properties, inorganic solutes and dissolved CO2. The drying period determined the disruption of the fluvial continuum with a recession of stream continuum at a rate of similar to 60 m/d and the gradual formation of a patched system of isolated pools of different sizes. Our results showed that the period of time that had elapsed since isolated pool formation (CI-days) was an essential factor for understanding how drying shaped the biogeochemistry of the fluvial system. Overall, drying caused a high DOC concentration and an increase in the humic-like fluorescence signal. Additionally, solutes showed contrasting responses to hydrological disconnection. Electrical conductivity, for instance, is a clear "sentinel" of the fragmentation process because it starts to increase before the hydrological disruption occurs. In contrast, DOC. most spectroscopic DOM descriptors and CO2 showed delayed responses of approximately 5-21 days after the formation of isolated pools. Furthermore, the spatial location and volume of each isolated pool seemed to exert a significant impact on most variables. In contrast, the temperature did not follow a dear pattern. These findings indicate that the fragmentation of longitudinal hydrological connectivity does not induce a single biogeochemical response but rather stimulates a set of solute-specific responses that generates a complex biogeochemical mosaic in a single fluvial unit.

TI  - Evaluation of Water Quality Parameters in Marshes Zone Southern of Iraq Based on Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques
T2  - WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Al-Hawizeh Marsh is considered a major marsh in the south of Iraq with a longitude of 47 degrees 32 ''-47 degrees 45 '' and latitude of 31 degrees 30 ''-31 degrees 42 '', length of 80 km and width of 30 km, while the depth is from 1.5 to 4 m. It has a significant impact on the ecosystem and provides habitat for several types of living creatures. The surface water and the agricultural lands surrounding this marsh suffered from high level degrees of salinity. In the last decades, radical deterioration of water quality in this marsh happened because of the post-war-related events and several human activities. Landsat-8 data was used to predict and evaluate the spatial variation and map distributions of the salinity, SO4 and CaCO3 within Al-Hawizeh Marsh during the two seasons in the year 2017 based on the development of salinity and minerals mathematical equations. The evaluated values for salinity, SO4 and CaCO3 are found to be minimal in winter and maximum in autumn. The values of correlation coefficient (R-2) between the real data and the equation results for the salinity, SO4 and CaCO3 during the two seasons are 0.95, 0.96 and 0.92, respectively.

TI  - A keystone species, European aspen (<i>Populus tremula</i> <i>L</i>.), in boreal forests: Ecological role, knowledge needs and mapping using remote sensing
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Review
AB  - European aspen (Populus tremula L.) is a keystone species in boreal forests that are dominated by coniferous tree species. Both living and dead aspen trees contribute significantly to the species diversity of forest landscapes. Thus, spatial and temporal continuity of aspen is a prerequisite for the long-term persistence of viable populations of numerous aspen-associated species. In this review, we collate existing knowledge on the ecological role of European aspen, assess the knowledge needs for aspen occurrence patterns and dynamics in boreal forests and discuss the potential of different remote sensing techniques in mapping aspen at various spatiotemporal scales. The role of aspen as a key ecological feature has received significant attention, and studies have recognised the negative effects of modern forest management methods and heavy browsing on aspen occurrence and regeneration. However, the spatial knowledge of occurrence, abundance and temporal dynamics of aspen is scarce and incomprehensive. The remote sensing studies reviewed here highlight particularly the potential of three-dimensional data derived from airborne laser scanning or photogrammetric point clouds and airborne imaging spectroscopy in mapping European aspen, quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) and other Populus species. In addition to tree species discrimination, these methods can provide information on biophysical, biochemical properties and even genetic diversity of aspen trees. Major obstacles in aspen detection using remote sensing are the low proportion and scattered occurrence of European aspen in boreal forests and the overlap of spectral and/or structural properties of European aspen and quaking aspen with some other tree species. Furthermore, the suitability of remote sensing data for aspen mapping and monitoring depends on the geographical coverage of data, the availability of multitemporal data and the costs of data acquisition. Our review highlights that integration of ecological knowledge with spatiotemporal information acquired by remote sensing is key to understanding the current and future distribution patterns of aspen-related biodiversity.

TI  - Indocyanine green is superior to blue colorimetric method for identifying sentinel lymph nodes during laparoscopic surgery for uterine malignancies: a pilot study
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF GYNAECOLOGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim: The objective of this study was to compare indocyanine green (ICG) and blue colorimetric methods for detection of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) during laparoscopic surgery for uterine malignancies. Materials and Methods: Over a two years and 3months period, laparoscopic surgery was performed on 16 cases of uterine malignancies using near infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging of ICG tracer uptake to direct SLN biopsy (NIR-FI-SLNB). ICG was injected into the uterine cervix prior to surgery. For comparison of detection efficacy, blue dye used for traditional colorimetric method was injected concurrently into 14 of these 16 cases. After pneumoperitoneum, we opened the retroperitoneum to laparoscopically identify the SLN. After biopsy of the SLN, a systemic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed. Results: Using ICG, we were able to identify SLN in 15/16 cases (93.7%), and achieved bilateral pelvic mapping in 12/16 (75%). With the blue dye, we were also able to identify SLN in only 64.3% of the 14 cases so tested, and bilateral pelvic mapping in only 14.3%. There were no intraoperative complications during any of the procedures. For conducting a laparoscopic bilateral SLN biopsy, we found that use of ICG was significantly superior to the blue colorimetric method (14.3% vs. 75%, p = 0.0009). Conclusions: These pilot data provide suggestive evidence that the laparoscopic NIR fluorescence imaging for SLN biopsy provide superior efficacy, compared to the traditional blue colorimetric method, without additional complications.

TI  - Road network drives urban ecosystems-a longitudinal analysis of impact of roads in the central Himalaya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates spatio-temporal paradigm of the impact of road networks on urban ecosystem dynamics (UED) by analysing the composition and configuration of land use land cover (LULC) and land surface temperatures (LST) derived from Landsat data for the years 2000 and 2017. The results indicate a positive association between road network and built-up land showing higher concentration of built-up land closer to the road network. This increase in grey infrastructure has led to an increase in the maximum LST by 6 degrees C to 7.5 degrees C along primary and tertiary roads, whereas 4 degrees C to 5 degrees C along secondary roads. Rapid intensification of road network along with the associated disproportionate changes in LULC and LST are deemed to be the major contributors to UED. Findings from this study will serve as baseline for examining the influence of road network on regional urban growth and assist in sustainable road infrastructure planning.

TI  - Distributive relationship of anchorage force relative to reinforcement and headed bars
T2  - ENGINEERING STRUCTURES
M3  - Article
AB  - When using headed bars, the distributive relationship of anchorage force between reinforcement and headed bars is crucial. This study conducted pull-out tests on 120 specimens, categorized into 24 groups, with a cross-sectional area of 150 x 150 mm, and the parameters considered were diameter (d), yield strength of reinforcement (f(y)), embedment length (l(ah)), and strength grades of concrete (f(cg)). The corresponding programs were proposed and verified based on test results. The concept of a stable development length (l(as)) was proposed as the critical length to determined whether the headed bars entered a working state. An analysis indicated that the ratio of las to d increased linearly with the ratio of fy to the tensile strength of concrete (f(t,m)), and decreased nonlinearly with the ratio of the protective thickness (c) to d. A formula was established for l(as) using two independent variables. l(as) and the critical development length (l(ac)) were determined to be 1.28 times and 0.66 times the general development length (l(a)), respectively. A further analysis demonstrated that the ratio of the pressure of headed bars (F-p) to fy and the ratio of lah to las were only related to the ratio of c to d. Thus, the distributive relationship of the anchorage force between the reinforcement and the headed bars was obtained.

TI  - Classification of multitemporal Sentinel-2 data for field-level monitoring of rice cropping practices in Taiwan
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Cadastral information of rice fields is important for monitoring cropping practices in Taiwan due to official initiatives. Remote sensing based rice monitoring has been a challenge for years because the size of rice fields is small, and crop mapping requires information of crop phenology, relating to spatiotemporal resolution of satellite data. This study aims to develop an approach for mapping rice-growing areas at field level using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data in Taiwan. The data were processed for 2018, following four main steps: (1) construct time-series Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI), (2) noise filtering of the time-series data using wavelet transform, (3) rice crop classification using information of crop phenology, and (4) parcel-based accuracy assessment of the mapping results. The parcel-to-parcel comparisons between mapping results and ground reference data indicated satisfactory results. These findings were confirmed by close agreement between satellite-derived rice area and government's statistics. Although some factors, including mixed-pixel issues and cloud-cover effects, lowered the mapping accuracies of townships along the coastline, this study has demonstrated the efficacy of using multitemporal Sentinel-2 data to create a reliable database of rice-growing areas over a large and heterogeneous region. Such a quantitative information was important for updating rice crop maps and monitoring cropping practices. (C) 2020 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Estimation of spatially continuous daytime particulate matter concentrations under all sky conditions through the synergistic use of satellite-based AOD and numerical models
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) products are one of main predictors to estimate ground-level particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) concentrations. Since AOD products, however, are only provided under high-quality conditions, missing values usually exist in areas such as clouds, cloud shadows, and bright surfaces. In this study, spatially continuous AOD and subsequent PM10 to and PM2.5 concentrations were estimated over East Asia using satellite-and model-based data and auxiliary data in a Random Forest (RF) approach. Data collected from the Geostationary Ocean Color Imager (GOO; 8 times per day) in 2016 were used to develop AOD and PM models. Three schemes (i.e. G1, A1, and A2) were proposed for AOD modeling according to target AOD data (COG AOD and AERONET AOD) and the existence of satellite-derived AOD. The A2 scheme showed the best peifomiance (validation R-2 of 0.74 and prediction R-2 of 0.73 when GOCI AOD did not exist) and the resultant AOD was used to estimate spatially continuous PM concentrations. The PM models with location information produced successful estimation results with R-2 of 0.88 and 0.90, and iRMSE of 26.9 and 272% for PM10 and PM2.5, respectively. The spatial distribution maps of PM well captured the seasonal and spatial characteristics of PM reported in the literature, which implies the proposed approaches can be adopted for an operational estimation of spatially continuous AOD and PMs under all sky conditions.

TI  - A history of the rehabilitation of mangroves and an assessment of their diversity and structure using Landsat annual composites (1987-2019) and transect plot inventories
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Recently, there has been renewed interest in the ecosystem services of mangroves such as carbon sequestration or coastal protection, and consequently, the development of tools providing an effective and automatic monitoring of the dynamics of mangrove land coverage including rehabilitated or naturally regenerated forest stand is increasingly demanded. Satellite-based time series analysis in coastal areas can be limited by atmospheric contaminations, such as haze, and clouds and their shadows. Here, we present an "automatic regrowth monitoring algorithm" (ARMA) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE), based on Landsat interannual median composites from 1987 to 2019 with 30 m spatial resolution. The species and structural diversity were assessed using transect plot inventories. The Landsat-based normalized difference infrared index (NDII) and information obtained from plot inventories were used to assess the characteristics of the natural and rehabilitated mangrove forests. The ARMA identified the starting year of the rehabilitation project using the satellite data, the required stability period after the rehabilitation, and the stand age in the year 2019. The information obtained from the field survey data were linked to the results obtained using the ARMA. After 28 years, the rehabilitated mangroves at the study site consist of monocultures of Rhizophoraceae, while the undisturbed and naturally regenerated mangroves had greater species diversity. Nevertheless, the rehabilitated mangroves were found to reach the height of the adjacent natural mangroves. The period required to reach a stable NDII value (similar to natural stands) after rehabilitation ranged from 7 to 13 years. The careful assessment of the NDII upward trend was crucial for the performance of the ARMA. The application presented here shows, however, that the system can be used to evaluate both small- and large-scale rehabilitation projects. The results of this study provide valuable baseline information for the site assessed and for its comparison with other rehabilitated mangroves in Thailand. Due to the technical potential, we are convinced that the ARMA system is suited to investigate changes in mangrove coverage dynamics, in general, including gain (as presented here), but also mangrove losses, due to disturbances such as degradation or forest diebacks.

TI  - Use of remotely sensed data to estimate tree species diversity as an indicator of biodiversity in Blouberg Nature Reserve, South Africa
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - We use remotely sensed data to estimate species diversity in Blouberg Nature Reserve (BNR) in the Limpopo province, South Africa to understand the state of biodiversity since communities' involvement in conservation initiatives. To achieve this objective, Landsat series data collected before and after community involvement in biodiversity conservation were used in conjunction with selected diversity indices i.e., Shannon-Wiener Index (H') and Simpson Index (D). Thirty 15 m x 15 m field plots were selected and all trees within each plot were identified, with the help of Botanists. Further, we applied regression analysis to determine the relationship between satellite derived tree species diversity and field observations. The results of the study demonstrated a significant (p < 0.5) variation in tree species diversity between 1990 and 2019. The highest relationship was obtained between H' and the combined remotely sensed spectral data and as well as Indices (VIs) when compared to other derived satellite data. Further, the results showed positive significant relationship (p < 0.05) between the combined remotely sensed data and observed H' index with r(2) = 0.36 and r(2) = 0.34 for the period before and after involving local communities in biodiversity conservation, respectively. Thus, the findings of the study indicate that the ecological condition of the reserve was slightly affected by the involvement of local communities in biodiversity conservation, for instance, volunteering in bush-encroachment eradication and decision-making. Overall, findings of the study underscore the relevance of remotely sensed data in assessing the ecological condition of protected areas and this information can help in decision-making.

TI  - Delayed autumn leaf senescence date prolongs the growing season length of herbaceous plants on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant phenological shifts on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) have been a hot research topic during the recent decade. Most previous studies based on remote sensing data suggest that earlier spring green-up is the main contributor to the prolonged vegetation growing season on the QTP. Given the large uncertainties of satellite-derived phenology, this study collected a large number (1455+ records) of long-term and continuous ground phenological observation data across the QTP. Based on these data, we conducted comprehensive analyses of temporal changes in spring green-up date (GUD), autumn leaf senescence date (LSD), and growing season length (GSL) of herbaceous plants from 1981 to 2017 through ordinary least squares regression and meta-analysis, and evaluated the relative contribution of shifts in GUD and LSD to change in GSL using the C-index. Results showed that the overall trends of GUD, LSD, and GSL insignificantly advanced at a rate of -0.17 days/decade, significantly delayed at a rate of 5.29 days/decade, and significantly lengthened at a rate of 5.46 days/decade, respectively. On average, the relative contribution of LSD shift to GSL change was 69.3% which was more than twice that of GUD shift (30.7%). Therefore, it was mainly the delayed LSD, rather than an advanced GUD, that prolonged GSL of QTP herbaceous plants, which was contrary to the prevailing conclusion reported by studies based on remote sensing data. Besides, among three functional groups of herbaceous plants, we found that change trends and patterns of the growing seasons seemed to be more favorable to the growth of forbs, which might shift community structure and further influence ecosystem function. Our study suggests that the importance of autumn phenology has been underestimated on the QTP, and more attention should be paid to the shift in autumn phenology and its influences on ecosystem structure and function under global warming.

TI  - Paradigm shift in aerosol chemical composition over regions downwind of China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - A rapid decrease in PM2.5 concentrations in China has been observed in response to the enactment of strong emission control policies. From 2012 to 2017, total emissions of SO2 and NOx from China decreased by approximately 63% and 24%, respectively. Simultaneously, decreases in the PM2.5 concentration in Japan have been observed since 2014, and the proportion of stations that satisfy the PM2.5 environmental standard (daily, 35 mu g/m(3); annual average, 15 mu g/m(3)) increased from 37.8% in fiscal year (FY) 2014 (April 2014 to March 2015) to 89.9% in FY 2017. However, the quantitative relationship between the PM2.5 improvement in China and the PM2.5 concentration in downwind regions is not well understood. Here, we (1) quantitatively evaluate the impacts of Chinese environmental improvements on downwind areas using source/receptor analysis with a chemical transport model, and (2) show that these rapid emissions reductions improved PM2.5 concentrations both in China and its downwind regions, but the difference between SO2 and NOx reduction rates led to greater production of nitrates (e.g., NH4NO3) due to a chemical imbalance in the ammonia-nitric acid-sulfuric acid-water system. Observations from a clean remote island in western Japan and numerical modeling confirmed this paradigm shift.

TI  - Multi-algorithm comparison for predicting soil salinity
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the most predominant processes responsible for land degradation globally. However, monitoring large areas presents significant challenges due to strong spatial and temporal variability. Environmental covariates show promise in predicting salinity over large areas provided a reasonable relationship is developed with field measured salinity at few points. While simple regression-based approaches to complex data mining methods have been used in the prediction, a comprehensive comparison of their performances has not been explored, leading to uncertainty in which algorithms to select. This study compares thirteen popularly and non-popularly used algorithms and their performances following four criteria in predicting soil salinity from environmental covariates from Kuqa Oasis from Xinjiang, China. The environmental covariates used for the prediction include principal components of Landsat satellite images at multiple spectral bands, climate factors (referring to land surface temperature), vegetation indices, salinity and soil-related indices, soil moisture indices, DEM derived indices, land use, landform and soil type and categorized them under parameter categories of the SCORPAN (S, soils; C, climate; O, organisms, biotic factor; R, relief; P, parent material; A, age; and N, space) model. The predictive relationships were developed using the algorithms including some previously used ones such as Multiple Linear regression (MLR), Multi-Layer Perceptron-Artificial Neural Network (MLP-ANN), Stochastic Gradient Treeboost (SGT), M5 Model Tree (M5), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Regression (SVR) and some that have not previously been used in predicting salinity such as Alternating Model Tree (ATM), Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR), Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (GRBF), Least Median Squared Linear Regression (LMSLR), and Reduced Error Pruning Tree (REPTree). Here, 5-fold cross-validation and an independent dataset (30% overall samples) at three depths, 010 cm, 1030 cm, 3050 cm, were used for parameter optimization and evaluating the performance of algorithms. The performances of these algorithms were compared against multiple criteria, including the parameterization, error level/fitting accuracy (determination coefficient, R2; root mean squared error, RMSE), stability (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, R; mean absolute percent error, MAPE; root mean squared error, RMSE; Lins concordance correlation coefficient, LCCC) and computational efficiency of the algorithms. Finally, the result showed that CSRI is most important parameter for the prediction of soil salinity at the 010 cm and 1030 cm depths, whereas for the 3050 cm depth interval, VD was the most important predictor. For depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm across all models, the model R2 values ranged from 0.60 to 0.74, 0.15 to 0.31, and 0.30 to 0.47, and the RMSE values ranged from 18.87 to 23.49 dS m-1, 9.94 to 13.48 dS m-1 and 3.79 to 7.11 dS m-1. The optimal algorithms at three depths of 010 cm, 1030 cm and 3050 cm are RF, M5 and GRBF with considering accuracy and stability. After a comprehensive assessment of algorithm performance, we recommend RF for mapping salinity in an arid environment such as that of Xinjiang and elsewhere globally. However, there is no algorithm that can perform ideally for all datasets. Therefore, we suggest that the algorithm should be carefully chosen according to the purposes of the study.

TI  - Improving the estimating accuracy of extinction coefficient of surface aerosol with a new layer-resolved model in China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The aerosol extinction coefficient was an important factor for air quality. To estimate the aerosol extinction levels, widely used pure statistical models are generally not based on aerosol vertical structures. In this study, we estimated large-scale aerosol extinction coefficients by developing a new layer-resolved model with explicit inference for aerosol vertical distribution. The CALIOP aerosol profile, MODIS AOD and reanalysis boundary layer height data are used. The layer-resolved model was formulated by developing an explicit, steady and straightforward relationship between aerosol within boundary layer and corresponding AOD values. The estimated surface extinction coefficient from this model was compared against the values derived from station visibility observations in China in 2016. The results revealed that our model had outperformed the traditional one-layer model and the simplified two-layer model. Specifically, the numbers of ground stations with an NME value <0.4 are enhanced by a percentage > 100%, with the NME values significantly decreased from 46%, 48% to 36% and RMSE values from 027, 025 to 021 km(-1). Our model is easy for operational implementation thanks to its clear structure and input, and also informative to understand aerosol vertical distributions. Furthermore, this work will also be beneficial to air quality modeling studies to improve accuracy estimating ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Effects of waterborne exposure to cadmium on biochemical responses in the freshwater gastropod, <i>Bellamya aeruginosa</i>
T2  - ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The biochemical responses of Bellamya aeruginosa as a dominant and widespread freshwater gastropod throughout China to waterborne cadmium (Cd) were investigated to explore the impacts of exposure concentration and duration in this potential sentinel species. After the 7 days' test of dosage-mortality relationship, gastropods were exposed for either 7 days at the LC50 (1.7 mg/L), the LC10 (0.7 mg/L) and 0.02 mg/L Cd, or 28 days at 0.02 mg/L Cd. A suite of biochemical indicators including metallothionein-like protein (MTLP), reduced glutathione (GSH), catalase (CAT), contents of tissue metal (Cd, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn), and the compartments of these metals bound to MTLP were examined. The treatment of 0.02 mg/L Cd led to the increase of Cd bound to MTLP (Cd-MTLP) levels, the decrease of GSH content, and the upregulation of CAT activity, but no induction of MTLP, indicating that the intrinsic MTLP and GSH worked together for the detoxification of Cd at the low exposure. When the exposure concentration increased, GSH was depleted severely and synthesis of MTLP was triggered, leading to a strong and significant relationship between MTLP level and Cd accumulation. At the lethal concentrations (1.7 mg/L), both MTLP induction and CAT activity were inhibited while the proportion of Cd-MTLP to total Cd were increased, suggesting more intrinsic MTLP were utilized to sequester free Cd ions. Therefore, the content of Cd-MTLP in digestive glands of B. aeruginosa was recommended as a reliable biomarker for Cd contamination.

TI  - Efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy with S-1 in stage II oral squamous cell carcinoma patients: A comparative study using the propensity score matching method
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been reported that 20% of early-stage oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients treated with surgery alone (SA) may exhibit postoperative relapse within 2-3 years and have poor prognoses. We aimed to determine the safety of S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy and the potential differences in the disease-free survival (DFS) between patients with T2N0 (stage II) OSCC treated with S-1 adjuvant therapy (S-1) and those treated with SA. This single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted at Kumamoto University, between April 2004 and March 2012, and included 95 patients with stage II OSCC. The overall cohort (OC), and propensity score-matched cohort (PSMC) were analyzed. In the OC, 71 and 24 patients received SA and S-1, respectively. The time to relapse (TTR), DFS, and overall survival were better in the S-1 group, but the difference was not significant. In the PSMC, 20 patients each received SA and S-1. The TTR was significantly lower in the S-1 group than in the SA group, while the DFS was significantly improved in the former. S-1 adjuvant chemotherapy may be more effective than SA in early-stage OSCC.

TI  - Quantifying seasonal and diurnal contributions of urban landscapes to heat energy dynamics
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Cooling energy consumption in urban areas is affected significantly by the dynamics of urban heat flux. However, we still lack a clear understanding of the quantitative contribution rate and underlying mechanism of typical urban landscapes to urban heat dynamics, especially in seasonal and diurnal patterns. Here we used a thermal infrared camera and portable meteorological instruments to examine the sensible heat flux (SHF) changes of five typical urban landscapes in Beijing based on surface temperature and concurrent microclimate conditions. Diurnal and seasonal variations of SHF were quantified by comparing changes in forenoon and afternoon in different seasons. Results showed that (1) walls and roads act as heat-source, while forests and water act as heat-sink in all seasons; however, grassland served as heat-sink in summer and spring-autumn, but it becomes a heat-source in winter. (2) The seasonal variation of sensible heat flux of the wall is the greatest, followed by water, while that of trees is the smallest. Besides, the highest sensible heat flux and the maximum variation among typical urban landscapes occur between noon and 2:00 pm. (3) The numerical contribution rate of typical landscapes to sensible heat flux varies with daytime (forenoon and afternoon) and seasonal changes, and these ratios can be used as parameters to adjust the numerical models to obtain more reliable results in surface-energy-flux-related studies. The results of this study can provide a reference for explaining controversial findings based on remote-sensing data, and provide insights into revealing the sensible heat flux mechanism of typical urban landscapes and cooling energy conservation in cities.

AB  - Based on the dimension reduction of hyperspectral remote sensing image, a new neural network method is used to classify the hyperspectral remote sensing image of carbon dioxide in detail. Firstly, the Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Genetic Algorithms (GA) are used to reduce the dimension of hyperspectral remote sensing images; secondly, the traditional remote sensing image classification methods (ISODATA, SVM), traditional neural networks (BP), and new neural networks are used to classify the hyperspectral remote sensing images. Finally, noise assessment method based on local mean and local standard deviation (LMLSD) of spectral image is used to evaluate the classification accuracy. In addition, hyperspectral remote sensing images are dimensionality reduction. Secondly, the comparison between the traditional remote sensing image classification method and the new neural network method is analyzed. Finally, a new neural network method is applied to classify hyperspectral remote sensing images.

TI  - The Use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index to Analyze the Influence of Vegetation Cover Changes on the Streamflow in the Manhuacu River Basin, Brazil
T2  - WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The intensification of anthropogenic activities in river basins has significantly altered river streamflow. Thus, the aim of this work is to evaluate the influence of temporal and spatial changes in vegetation cover on the streamflow of the Manhuacu River, Brazil using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The NDVI values were obtained from Landsat images for 1986 to 2014 and processed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE). To characterize the hydrologic behavior of the basin, we used data from eight streamflow gauge stations and 18 rain gauge stations, and we conducted Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests to evaluate the stationarity hypothesis. To verify the relationship between the vegetation cover changes and the streamflow, we used multiple regression models. In the analyzed period, we observed a slight increase in the vegetation cover and a reduction in pasture areas. In most cases, the annual low flow exhibited a decreasing tendency because of an increase in vegetation area. We obtained satisfactory adjustments of the multiple regression models by examining the correlations among the change in vegetation cover, rainfall and evapotranspiration data, which resulted in adjusted Ra2 values ranging from 0.59 to 0.96. The NDVI values were a good indicator of vegetation cover dynamics in the Manhuacu River basin, which influenced the nonstationary streamflow behavior.

TI  - Model Combining Tumor Molecular and Clinicopathologic Risk Factors Predicts Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Primary Cutaneous Melanoma
T2  - JCO PRECISION ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - PURPOSEMore than 80% of patients who undergo sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy have no nodal metastasis. Here, we describe a model that combines clinicopathologic and molecular variables to identify patients with thin- and intermediate-thickness melanomas who may forgo the SLN biopsy procedure because of their low risk of nodal metastasis.PATIENTS AND METHODSGenes with functional roles in melanoma metastasis were discovered by analysis of next-generation sequencing data and case-control studies. We then used polymerase chain reaction to quantify gene expression in diagnostic biopsy tissue across a prospectively designed archival cohort of 754 consecutive thin- and intermediate-thickness primary cutaneous melanomas. Outcome of interest was SLN biopsy metastasis within 90 days of melanoma diagnosis. A penalized maximum likelihood estimation algorithm was used to train logistic regression models in a repeated cross-validation scheme to predict the presence of SLN metastasis from molecular, clinical, and histologic variables.RESULTSExpression of genes with roles in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (glia-derived nexin, growth differentiation factor 15, integrin-beta 3, interleukin 8, lysyl oxidase homolog 4, transforming growth factor-beta receptor type 1, and tissue-type plasminogen activator) and melanosome function (melanoma antigen recognized by T cells 1) were associated with SLN metastasis. The predictive ability of a model that only considered clinicopathologic or gene expression variables was outperformed by a model that included molecular variables in combination with the clinicopathologic predictors Breslow thickness and patient age (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.78 to 0.86; SLN biopsy reduction rate, 42%; negative predictive value, 96%).CONCLUSIONA combined model that included clinicopathologic and gene expression variables improved the identification of patients with melanoma who may forgo the SLN biopsy procedure because of their low risk of nodal metastasis.

TI  - Contralateral axillary sentinel lymph node in breast cancer recurrence
T2  - BREAST JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The rare but significant reports of aberrant lymph node drainage outside of the ipsilateral axilla in patients with breast cancer necessitate a review of the staging and treatment strategies for these patients. Current staging modalities continue to describe this phenomenon as a stage IV cancer, which could have profound implications for clinical management. We report a case of a patient with recurrent right breast invasive ductal carcinoma whose preoperative lymphoscintigraphy revealed sentinel lymph node drainage to the contralateral axilla. This discovery subsequently altered surgical planning and her ultimate stage.

TI  - Surgical treatment of cervical cancer
T2  - ONKOLOGE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Surgery represents the first choice for treatment of early cervical carcinoma (FIGO IA1 to FIGO IIa according to Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d'Obstetrique). The extent of surgical therapy for the patient should be determined based on the patient's age and tumor spread, particularly if fertility preservation is desired. More recently, less radical surgical procedures and concepts for sentinel lymph node biopsy are increasingly used in order to reduce mortality and morbidity. Controversy is currently emerging in the context of new studies regarding the choice of surgical approach. Objective In this article, surgical options for the treatment of cervical cancer are reviewed. Materials and methods An overview of the current study situation and literature is provided, taking into consideration the current German S3 guideline on cervical carcinoma. Results Localized cervical cancer (<= FIGO IIA) is primarily treated by surgery. Recent studies, e.g. SHAPE, are investigating whether less radical surgical procedures can provide adequate oncological safety. A fertility-preserving approach is possible up to stage IB1 depending on the presence of risk factors. After the study results of the LACC trial were published with increased recurrence and mortality rate in the group undergoing laparoscopic surgery compared to the laparotomy group, patients must be informed about these data prior to decision making regarding the route of hysterectomy. Conclusion The treatment of cervical cancer should be conducted according to the stage. Surgery is key in the treatment of early cervical carcinoma. Even less radical procedures seem to provide adequate oncological safety.

TI  - Enhancing the monitoring of fallen stock at different hierarchical administrative levels: an illustration on dairy cattle from regions with distinct husbandry, demographical and climate traits
T2  - BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The automated collection of non-specific data from livestock, combined with techniques for data mining and time series analyses, facilitates the development of animal health syndromic surveillance (AHSyS). An example of AHSyS approach relates to the monitoring of bovine fallen stock. In order to enhance part of the machinery of a complete syndromic surveillance system, the present work developed a novel approach for modelling in near real time multiple mortality patterns at different hierarchical administrative levels. To illustrate its functionality, this system was applied to mortality data in dairy cattle collected across two Spanish regions with distinct demographical, husbandry, and climate conditions. Results The process analyzed the patterns of weekly counts of fallen dairy cattle at different hierarchical administrative levels across two regions between Jan-2006 and Dec-2013 and predicted their respective expected counts between Jan-2014 and Jun- 2015. By comparing predicted to observed data, those counts of fallen dairy cattle that exceeded the upper limits of a conventional 95% predicted interval were identified as mortality peaks. This work proposes a dynamic system that combines hierarchical time series and autoregressive integrated moving average models (ARIMA). These ARIMA models also include trend and seasonality for describing profiles of weekly mortality and detecting aberrations at the region, province, and county levels (spatial aggregations). Software that fitted the model parameters was built using the R statistical packages. Conclusions The work builds a novel tool to monitor fallen stock data for different geographical aggregations and can serve as a means of generating early warning signals of a health problem. This approach can be adapted to other types of animal health data that share similar hierarchical structures.

TI  - Unsupervised change detection of remotely sensed images from rural areas based on using the hybrid of improved Thresholding techniques and particle swarm optimization
T2  - EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Change Detection from remote sensing images is one of the most challenging and controversial topics among researchers in this field. Given the variety of types of surveyed areas and the data used, it cannot be claimed that there is a comprehensive way to identify different types of remote sensing data.This research aims to represent three robust and novel cost functions based on improving conventional thresholding techniques (i.e., Otsu, Fisher, and Kittler & Illingworth) combined with Particle Swarm Optimization method. The aim of the research is to detect the local-global variation of bi-temporal remotely sensed images based on images statistics but without any a-prior assumptions. The proposed method consists of four fundamental steps. The first step is a preprocessing step, as an indispensable step, in order to equalize the spectral domains of inputs images and also the geometric correction of them. The second step is a process of difference image generation to highlight the changed regions in the study areas. Then, the generated difference image is split to smaller size non-overlapped blocks with the aim of local change analysis. The third step emphasizes the importance of the proposed method and also discusses in improving the cost functions of conventional thresholding techniques as local-global techniques in detail. Next, the final change map is created based on the maximum vote method and image bands combination results. At the final step, accuracy assessment and sensitivity analysis were applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Experimental result on Landsat data (i.e., Alaska region and Uremia Lake) demonstrated the accuracy improvement of three proposed change detection methods about (2% -11%) over different thresholding cost functions. Therefore, the results prove the efficiency and robustness of the proposed cost function compared to the initial cost function.

TI  - Multi-physics ensemble snow modelling in the western Himalaya
T2  - CRYOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Combining multiple data sources with multi-physics simulation frameworks offers new potential to extend snow model inter-comparison efforts to the Himalaya. As such, this study evaluates the sensitivity of simulated regional snow cover and runoff dynamics to different snowpack process representations. The evaluation is based on a spatially distributed version of the Factorial Snowpack Model (FSM) set up for the Astore catchment in the upper Indus basin. The FSM multi-physics model was driven by climate fields from the High Asia Refined Analysis (HAR) dynamical downscaling product. Ensemble performance was evaluated primarily using MODIS remote sensing of snow-covered area, albedo and land surface temperature. In line with previous snow model inter-comparisons, no single FSM configuration performs best in all of the years simulated. However, the results demonstrate that performance variation in this case is at least partly related to inaccuracies in the sequencing of inter-annual variation in HAR climate inputs, not just FSM model limitations. Ensemble spread is dominated by interactions between parameterisations of albedo, snowpack hydrology and atmospheric stability effects on turbulent heat fluxes. The resulting ensemble structure is similar in different years, which leads to systematic divergence in ablation and mass balance at high elevations. While ensemble spread and errors are notably lower when viewed as anomalies, FSM configurations show important differences in their absolute sensitivity to climate variation. Comparison with observations suggests that a subset of the ensemble should be retained for climate change projections, namely those members including prognostic albedo and liquid water retention, refreezing and drainage processes.

M3  - Article
AB  - Using the 2000-2018 MODIS Land Surface Temperature (LST) data and taking 11 cities (counties) in the northern slope of the central Tianshan Mountains in northwestern China as the study area, the spatial-temporal characteristics, landscape indices, centroid, and geo-information Tupu (carto-methodology in geo-information, CMGI) of surface thermal landscape (STL) were analyzed, and the paper draws the following results: (1) There are great differences in the diurnal and seasonal STL. The higher thermal levels are distributed more northerly in spring, summer, and autumn, and more southerly in winter. (2) In terms of class type level and landscape level, different landscape indices show different characteristics in diurnal and seasonal thermal landscapes. (3) Centroids at different thermal levels during the daytime are more dispersed than at nighttime in spring and summer, while the opposite is found in autumn. In winter, centroids of different thermal levels are concentrated in the southern and central-southern regions. During the period of 2000-2018, centroids of different thermal levels tend to move with the varying of STL. (4) The whole STL in same seasons changed little, transition usually happens between adjacent thermal levels. Overall, compared with the eastern monsoon area, there are similarities and differences in the characteristics of the STL.

TI  - Marking axillary nodes with 4% carbon microparticle suspension before neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves sentinel node identification rate and axillary staging
T2  - JOURNAL OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background and Objectives Marking positive lymph nodes (LNs) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) may improve the accuracy of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of marking LNs with 4% carbon microparticle suspension (CMS) before NAC and to evaluate if this technique would improve the SLNB identification rate.Methods A prospective study of patients with cT1-T4, cN1-N2 breast cancer who underwent US-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) of suspected LNs and concomitant marking with 4% CMS was performed. After NAC, LNs marked with 4% CMS and those marked with Patent Blue V dye (PBV) were identified and resected.Results Of the 123 patients included, 74 (60.1%) had positive LNs at FNAB. During axillary surgery, 4% CMS was identified in 121 of 123 patients (98.3%) and blue sentinel LNs in 91% (112 of 123 patients) (P = .0103). Comparing isolated results of PBV and 4%CMS + PBV, the association was better in identifying positive LNs (72.2% vs 97.7%) (P = .02).Conclusion The association of 4% CMS and PBV is feasible and significantly increased the identification rate of positive LNs. 4% CMS may play an important role as a complementary technique in patients submitted to NAC.

TI  - Connecting the dots: NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> emissions along a West Siberian natural gas pipeline
T2  - NPJ CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - New high quality satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over snow-covered regions of Siberia reveal previously undocumented but significant NO2 emissions associated with the natural gas industry in Western Siberia. Besides gas drilling and natural gas power plants, also gas compressor stations for the transport of natural gas are sources of high amounts of nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2), which are emitted in otherwise pristine regions. The emissions per station from these remote gas compressor stations are at least an order of magnitude larger than those reported for North American gas compressor stations, possibly related to less stringent environmental regulations in Siberia compared to the United States. This discovery was made possible thanks to a newly developed technique for discriminating snow covered surfaces from clouds, which allows for satellite measurements of tropospheric NO2 columns over large boreal snow-covered areas. While retrievals over snow-covered areas were traditionally filtered out, we used the retrieved column of air in these observations to distinguish clouds higher in the atmosphere from the snow at the surface. This results in 23% more TROPOMI observations on an annual basis. Furthermore, these observations have a precision four times better than nearly any TROPOMI observation over other areas and surfaces around the world. These new results highlight the potential of TROPOMI on Sentinel 5P as well as future satellite missions for monitoring small-scale emissions and emissions at high latitudes.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose of review Clinical trials have demonstrated the accuracy of SLN mapping in detecting nodal spread in patients with endometrial cancer. However, data regarding the oncological outcomes of this approach, particularly in the setting endometrial cancer with a high risk of nodal spread, are still lacking. In this review, we provide an overview of SLN mapping in endometrial cancer. We will specifically discuss its use in patients at high risk of nodal metastasis. Controversies and future directions for research will also be discussed. Summary of the findings High-quality data from prospective studies have shown that SLN mapping is as accurate as systematic lymphadenectomy. Retrospective analyses have suggested that SLN mapping does not appear to compromise oncological outcomes, compared to systematic lymphadenectomy in high-risk endometrial cancer. Conclusion In light of published retrospective data suggesting that SLN mapping in high-risk endometrial cancer does not jeopardize oncological outcomes and may even be better in identifying patients who need adjuvant treatment, SLN mapping may prove to be the optimal surgical management of these high-risk patients. Future studies on SLN mapping should focus on oncological outcomes and the management of micrometastases and ITCs that cannot be identified without ultrastaging.

TI  - Health in Need of Healing: Church History as a Road Map for Future Evangelization in Medicine
T2  - LINACRE QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Western medicine developed as an expression of Christian charity and played a large role in the growth of the early church. Despite its original foundation in Christian moral principles, modern medicine has deviated from its origins. The principles of human dignity, solidarity, and subsidiarity have been subjugated to a materialist and transactional construct that forms the basis of the contemporary medical delivery and financing systems. The dehumanization of both healthcare practitioners and patients by the partnership of governmental and corporate entities, and the use of health care as a political instrument, has debased the original mission of the medical profession and represents an affront to the principles of Catholic social teaching (CST). This essay explores the ways in which the US medical delivery and financing systems violate the principles of CST by means seldom recognized due to the inurement of the public and medical professionals. By examining the prevailing healthcare model through the lens of CST, the author illustrates the ways in which CST principles are systematically violated. This analysis serves as the foundation of a Catholic response to the question of how faithful Christians might live out their calls to holiness through the exercise of their professional vocations. A vision of an invigorated model of medicine as vocation, along with illustrative examples, is presented. By exemplifying the principles of human dignity, solidarity and subsidiarity in health care, Christians can seize a golden opportunity for evangelization by rearticulating the historical spiritual mission of Western medicine.

TI  - Atmospheric correction for satellite-derived bathymetry in the Caribbean waters: from a single image to multi-temporal approaches using Sentinel-2A/B
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Different atmospheric correction (AC) procedures for Sentinel-2 satellites are evaluated for their effectiveness in retrieving consistent satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) over two islands in the Caribbean (Buck and Culebra). The log-ratio method for SDB, which allows use of minimal calibration information from lidar surveys (25 points in this study), is applied to several Sentinel-2A/B scenes at 10 m spatial resolution. The overall performance during a one-year study period depends on the image quality and AC. Three AC processors were evaluated: ACOLITE Exponential model (EXP), ACOLITE Dark Spectrum Fitting model (DSF), and C2RCC model. ACOLITE EXP and ACOLITE DSF produce greater consistency and repeatability with accurate results in a scene-by-scene analysis (mean errors similar to 1.1 m) for depths up to 23 m (limit of lidar surveys). In contrast, C2RCC produces lower accuracy and noisier results with generally higher (> 50%) errors (mean errors similar to 2.2 m), but it is able to retrieve depth for scenes in Buck Island that have moderately severe sunglint. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a multi-temporal compositing model for SDB mapping, using ACOLITE for the input scenes, could achieve overall median errors < 1 m for depths ranging 0-23 m. The simple and effective compositing model can considerably enhance coastal SDB estimates with high reliability and no missing data, outperforming the traditional single image approaches and thus eliminating the need to evaluate individual scenes. The consistency in the output from the AC correction indicates the potential for automated application of the multi-scene compositing technique, which can apply the open and free Sentinel-2 data set for the benefit of operational and scientific investigations.

TI  - A review of the estimation of downward surface shortwave radiation based on satellite data: Methods, progress and problems
T2  - SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES
M3  - Review
AB  - The estimation of downward surface shortwave radiation (DSSR) is important for the Earth's energy budget and climate change studies. This review was organised from the perspectives of satellite sensors, algorithms and future trends, retrospects and summaries of the satellite-based retrieval methods of DSSR that have been developed over the past 10 years. The shortwave radiation reaching the Earth's surface is affected by both atmospheric and land surface parameters. In recent years, studies have given detailed considerations to the factors which affect DSSR. It is important to improve the retrieval accuracy of cloud microphysical parameters and aerosols and to reduce the uncertainties caused by complex topographies and high-albedo surfaces (such as snow-covered areas) on DSSR estimation. This review classified DSSR retrieval methods into four categories: empirical, parameterisation, look-up table and machine-learning methods, and evaluated their advantages, disadvantages and accuracy. Further efforts are needed to improve the calculation accuracy of atmospheric parameters such as cloud, haze, water vapor and other land surface parameters such as albedo of complex terrain and bright surface, organically combine machine learning and other methods, use the new-generation geostationary satellite and polar orbit satellite data to produce high-resolution DSSR products, and promote the application of radiation products in hydrological and climate models.

TI  - On-orbit radiometric calibration of the optical sensors on-board SuperView-1 satellite using three independent methods
T2  - OPTICS EXPRESS
M3  - Article
AB  - On-orbit radiometric calibration of the optical sensors on-board SuperView-1 satellites is the foundation for further quantitative applications. A field calibration campaign was orchestrated to radiometrically calibrate the SuperView-1 optical sensors at the Baotou calibration site in China during September 2018. Based on the collected datasets, three independent methods (reflectance-based, radiance-based, and cross-calibration) were used to determine the radiometric calibration coefficients of the SuperView-1 optical sensors with multiple permanent artificial calibration targets. Comparisons of the desert top-of-atmosphere radiance calculated based on the coefficients determined with independent methods were analyzed. Comparison results show that the minimum and maximum relative differences of the radiometrically-calibrated desert TOA radiance between the reflectance-based and radiance-based methods are 1.26% and 4.23% for SV0102 and SV0104, respectively. While, the minimum and maximum relative differences of the radiometrically-calibrated desert TOA radiance between the reflectance-based and radiance-based methods are 0.82% and 6.83% for SV0101 and SV0103, respectively. The reasonably good agreement of the radiometrically calibrated coefficients of the SuperView-1 on-board sensors between these independent methods is encouraging. An uncertainty analysis was also discussed, and the results suggest that the overall uncertainties of the predicted TOA radiance are less than 4.5%, 4.0%, and 5.15% for the reflectance-based, radiance-based, and cross-calibration methods, respectively.

TI  - Public attitudes toward urban foxes and coyotes: the roles of perceived risks and benefits, political ideology, ecological worldview, and attention to local news about urban wildlife
T2  - HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper examines public attitudes toward urban red foxes and coyotes in Madison, Wisconsin (US), and the roles that perceived risks and benefits, attention to local news about urban wildlife, political ideology, and ecological worldview play in an individual's attitude toward these species. Data were collected using an in-person survey at four public events around Madison from July to August 2017 (n = 163, response rate = 47%). Results showed that perceived benefits, perceived risks, and ecological worldview were significant predictors of attitudes toward both urban coyotes and foxes. Although political ideology and attention to local news about urban wildlife were not significant predictors of attitudes toward urban foxes or coyotes, these concepts interacted in predicting attitudes toward urban coyotes. This study demonstrated the importance for wildlife managers to consider attention to news about urban wildlife and political ideology, as well as developing separate communications for different species.

TI  - Satellite-based spectral mapping (ASTER and landsat data) of mineralogical signatures of beach sediments: a precursor insight
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed investigation on texture and mineralogy of beach sediments helps to understand their nature of deposition and potential targets of strategic mineral deposits. The beach sediments from the coast of Thiruvananthapuram, the southernmost district of Kerala, India, have been studied to understand the variation in grain size by using the spectral indices as derived from the visible-NIR-TIR bands of Landsat and ASTER remote sensing data. Further, an attempt has been made to map the distribution of strategic minerals present in beach sands using standardized hyperspectral analysis techniques. The grain size shows a remarkable variation from medium sand to fine sand. The THM (Total Heavy Minerals) content was estimated to about 80.04% and 52.33% along the coast of Kovalam and Varkala, respectively. The ilmenite mineral predominantly exists in these areas, followed by monazite, sillimanite, rutile, zircon, garnet, leucoxene, and Kyanite. The hyperspectral analysis extracts two endmembers of ilmenite and light minerals from the Landsat and ASTER imagery, which could be successfully, mapped using the SAM classification algorithm. The satellite-derived map showing texture and mineralogy has been validated with the results of laboratory analysis and shows strong correlation almost in all locations. This study illustrates the potential use of satellite remote sensing techniques for the mapping of natural resources, especially mineral resources.

TI  - Effects of Population Weighting on PM<sub>10</sub> Concentration Estimation
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 mu m or less (PM10) pollution poses a considerable threat to human health, and the first step in quantifying health impacts of human exposure to PM10 pollution is exposure assessment. Population-weighted exposure level (PWEL) estimation is one of the methods that provide a more refined exposure assessment as it includes the spatiotemporal distribution of the population into the pollution concentration estimation. This study assessed the population weighting effects on the estimated PM10 concentrations in Malaysia for years 2000, 2008, and 2013. Estimated PM10 annual mean concentrations with a spatial resolution of 5 kilometres retrieved from satellite data and population count obtained from the Gridded Population of the World version 4 (GPWv4) from the Centre for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) were overlaid to generate the PWEL of PM10 for each state. The calculated PWEL of PM10 concentrations were then classified based on the World Health Organization (WHO) and the national Air Quality Guidelines (AQG) and interim targets (IT) for comparison. Results revealed that the annual mean PM10 concentrations in Malaysia ranged from 31 to 73 mu g/m(3) but became generally lower, ranging from 20 to 72 mu g/m(3) after population weighting, suggesting that the PM10 population exposure in Malaysia might have been overestimated. PWEL of PM10 distribution showed that the majority of the population lived in areas that complied with the national AQG, but were vulnerable to exposure level 3 according to the WHO AQG and IT, indicating that the population was nevertheless potentially exposed to significant health effects from long-term exposure to PM10 pollution.

TI  - Seasonal dietary niche contraction in coexisting Neotropical frugivorous bats (Stenodermatinae)
T2  - BIOTROPICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical dry forests are characterized by punctuated seasonal precipitation patterns that drive primary production and the availability of fruits, seeds, flowers, and insects throughout the year. In environments in which the quantity and quality of food resources varies seasonally, consumers should adjust their foraging behavior to maximize energy intake while minimizing overlap with competitors during periods of low food availability. Here, we investigated how the diets of frugivorous bats in tropical dry forests of NW Mexico varied in response to seasonal availability and how this affected dietary overlap of morphologically similar species. We performed stable isotope analyses to understand temporal and interspecific patterns of overall isotopic niche breadth, trophic position, and niche overlap in the diet of six frugivorous species of closely related New World leaf-nosed bats (family Phyllostomidae, subfamily Stenodermatinae). We estimated seasonal changes in resource abundance in two complementary ways: (a) vegetative phenology based on long-term remote sensing data and (b) observational data on food availability from previously published insect and plant fruiting surveys. In all species, there was a consistent pattern of reduced isotopic niche breadth during periods of low food availability. However, patterns of niche overlap varied between morphologically similar species. Overall, results from our study and others suggest that seasonal food availability likely determines overall dietary niche breadth in Phyllostomidae and that despite morphological specialization, it is likely that other mechanisms, such as opportunistic foraging and spatiotemporal niche segregation, may play a role in maintaining coexistence rather than simply dietary displacement.in Spanish is available with online material.

TI  - Topoclimatic zones and characteristics of the upper Ganga basin, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The upper Ganga basin (UGB) constituting Bhagirathi and Alakananda basins has been considered as a single hydrological unit so far with comparable climate forcing. Here, we show three distinct "topoclimatic zones" of this basin having characteristically different temperature, precipitation, and orographic processes. The orographic discontinuity forced by a mountain ridge with an average elevation of 5,200 m a.s.l. is instrumental in the development of these topoclimatic zones. The northern region of the basin is identified as high elevation and high temperature zone (HE-HT) with monsoon moisture deficit. This monsoon deficit region is characterized by higher land surface temperature lapse rate (LSTLR) during July and August (JA) derived from MODIS-LST (11.00 degrees C/km) as compared to much lower LSTLR of monsoon topoclimatic zone (5.78 degrees C/km). The nival-glacier regimes of the monsoon dominant and monsoon deficit regions constituted the third topoclimatic zone characterized by high elevation-low temperature zone (HE-LT). This zone has comparatively lower temperature lapse rate (5.26 degrees C/km) than the immediately lower elevations. The coldest points identified in the basin are mostly placed in monsoon deficit regions with higher LSTLR. The 10-12 degrees C isotherm in the monsoon deficit zone runs at 5,300 m a.s.l. as compared to 3,200 m a.s.l. in monsoon dominant zone. It is proposed that 80% of glacier area in the UGB is in the monsoon deficit zone that is regulated by the northern region orographic processes rather than southern slopes. Glacier change in the southern and northern zones show significant difference during the period of 1994-2016/2017, with significantly higher glacier area loss in the HE-HT zone. The study highlights the importance of these topoclimatic considerations while evaluating the climate and hydrology of UGB.

TI  - Estimating near-surface air temperature across Israel using a machine learning based hybrid approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Rising global temperatures over the last decades have increased heat exposure among populations worldwide. An accurate estimate of the resulting impacts on human health demands temporally explicit and spatially resolved monitoring of near-surface air temperature (T-a). Neither ground-based nor satellite-borne observations can achieve this individually, but the combination of the two provides synergistic opportunities. In this study, we propose a two-stage machine learning-based hybrid model to estimate 1 x 1 km(2) gridded intra-daily T-a from surface skin temperature (T-s) across the complex terrain of Israel during 2004-2016. We first applied a random forest (RF) regression model to impute missing T-s from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra satellites, integrating T-s from the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) satellite and synoptic variables from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' (ECMWF) ERA5 reanalysis data sets. The imputed T-s are in turn fed into the Stage 2 RF-based model to estimate T-a at the satellite overpass hours of each day. We evaluated the model's performance applying out-of-sample fivefold cross validation. Both stages of the hybrid model perform very well with out-of-sample fivefold cross validated R-2 of 0.99 and 0.96, MAE of 0.42 degrees C and 1.12 degrees C, and RMSE of 0.65 degrees C and 1.58 degrees C (Stage 1: imputation of T-s, and Stage 2: estimation of T-a from T-s, respectively). The newly proposed model provides excellent computationally efficient estimation of near-surface air temperature at high resolution in both space and time, which helps further minimize exposure misclassification in epidemiological studies.

TI  - Detecting vegetation drought dynamics in European Russia
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainfall and temperature are the key factors responsible for vegetation condition, health and growth. This research work analysis spatiotemporal phenomena in between SPI, LST and VIs in summer session from 2000 to 2018 in European Russia. This study used MODIS, NDVI, LST and TRMM data. The negative SPI values represent increasing drought events with reducing rainfall and vice-versa. Numerical consequences specify that mean annual rainfall, VIs variate according to SPI values and they completely change in the year 2004, 2009 and 2015. VIs also indirectly related to LST as high LST values (high temperature) associated with low VIs values (low vegetation) and vice-versa, with correlation coefficients 0.90. Correlation analysis of VIs, SPI and LST indicate close relationship in between vegetation, rainfall and temperature and this relationship can be used for near real time vegetation drought dynamics monitoring through satellite data for short term to long term changes in vegetation growth.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies in the US Virgin Islands (USVI) have shown that land-based sources of pollution associated with watershed development coupled with climate is causing coral reef degradation. A good indicator that can be used to assess stress on these environments is the water quality. Conventional assessment methods based on in-situ measurements are timely and costly. Satellite remote sensing techniques offer better spatial coverage and temporal resolution to accurately characterize the dynamic nature of Water Quality Parameters (WQPs, chlorophyll-a), total suspended sediments (TSM), and coloured-dissolved organic matter). However, the interference of multiple optically active WQPs that characterize the water column as well as reflectance from the bottom substrates poses a challenge especially in shallow coastal environments such as the USVI. The optical properties of USVI waters are a function of multiple WQPs with chlorophyll-a values ranging from 0.10 to 2.35 mu g L(-1)and TSM values from 8.97 to 15.7 mg L-1. In this study, field data were combined with NASA's Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor data to specifically model chlorophyll-a variability in the USVI waters based on spectral indices approach. Landsat OLI spectral-based model produced promising results for characterizing the variability of chlorophyll-a in the USVI (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.70; root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.042 mu g L-1). Model developed in this study will significantly improve near-real time and long-term water quality monitoring in USVI and this will potentially help to provide insight to factors contributing to coral reef decline.

T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The study examines the effects of urbanization on land surface temperature (LST) in Guwahati, a city in India using satellite data. Landsat images were utilized for LST retrieval, land-use land-cover (LULC) classification and the normalized difference built-up index mapping. Surface Energy Balance Algorithms for Land and support vector machine methods were used in the study. Results showed that the city has gone through massive changes in its LULC pattern with a high degree of urbanization during the period 1992-2015. The built-up area (BUA) increased to 87.8 km(2) in 2015 from 11.6 km(2) in 1992 while vegetation decreased from 143.3 to 76.6 km(2). Open spaces and water bodies decreased from 14.5 to 5 km(2) and to 6.6 km(2) from 6.7 km(2), respectively. Conversely, an increasing trend of LST was observed. The mean LST which was 18.5 degrees C in 1992 rose to 29.03 degrees C in 2015. Linear regression used in quantifying the relationship between urbanization and LST showed a positive relationship between LST and BUAs in the city.

M3  - Article
AB  - The prediction of the future position of the shoreline is of great importance in planning studies in coastal areas, in making effective decisions in coastal management, and in determining changes occurring on the coast. In this study, coastal change analyses were performed in two different study areas (the Gulf of Izmit and the Goksu Delta) by using satellite images of different dates, and the accuracy of the Kalman filter-based future shoreline prediction method was determined by statistical methods. In this context, by using the 19-period Landsat satellite image belonging to different dates between 1975 and 2019 for the Gulf of Izmit and the 10-period Landsat satellite image belonging to different dates between 1984 and 2018 for the Goksu Delta, shorelines were extracted automatically, and coastal changes were analyzed at a 95% CI by the statistical methods of end point rate, linear regression rate, and weighted linear regression rate (WLR). Afterward, the shorelines extracted automatically on the determined dates were compared with 10-year and 20-year predicted shorelines by the Kalman filter-based prediction method, and their accuracy was statistically analyzed. As a result, the 10-year predicted shorelines by the WLR method were found to provide the highest accuracy.

M3  - Journal Article
AB  - Objective: To analyze data gathered from the laboratory records related to imported Dengue cases in Henan province in 2018. Methods: Suspected Dengue cases were found out through the Dengue fever surveillance network from the National infectious Disease reporting management information system. Serum samples of suspected Dengue cases were collected while case study and tested for Dengue NS1 antigen, IgM, IgG antibodies and Dengue RNA in Henan province in 2018. According to the standardized Dengue diagnosis criteria, confirmed cases were identified under the results of testing. Dengue RNA was checked by Real-time PCR genotyping and amplification of E gene in the samples being tested, before the PCR products were sequenced and analyses of homological and phylogenetic were performed. Results: In 2018, a total of 29 cases of Dengue fever was reported in Henan province, with all of which were imported cases, mainly from Southeast Asian countries and Africa. Majority of the cases were young and middle-aged farmers under 45 years old, and the number of males was significantly higher than that of females. The imported cases were dispersed in time and space. Among the 29 Dengue reported cases, 22 cases were with NS1 antigen and/or IgM positive through testing, while 6 cases were positive by detection of the Dengue virus RNA. These 6 samples with Dengue RNA were genotyped successfully, including 3 cases of Dengue virus type 1 and 3 cases of type 2. One of the Maldives import Dengue virus type 2 samples was sequenced. Result showed that the sequence belonged to the Asian Ⅰ genotype, which was most consistently similar to the Cambodia's Dengue virus type 2 JF730046, identified in 2008. Conclusions: The incidence of imported Dengue fever cases increased significantly in Henan province in 2018, compared to that in 2017, but fortunately did not cause any local epidemics.

TI  - Long-term follow-up on shoulder and arm morbidity in patients treated for early breast cancer
T2  - ACTA ONCOLOGICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: A prospective study on shoulder and arm morbidity was conducted in Denmark in 2003-2005. This study demonstrated that sentinel lymph node biopsy was associated with better outcomes than axillary lymph node dissection 18 months after surgery. We here aimed to describe subjective symptoms and objective findings in these patients 10+ years after they underwent breast cancer surgery and to assess how symptoms and findings developed during this period. Material and methods: Participants in the prospective study completed a questionnaire and underwent an objective, bilateral examination of their shoulder and arm morbidity, which included measurement of arm volume, range of motion, and sensibility. Results: Seventy participants completed follow-up. Thirty-four (49%) had one or more functional impairments, and 64% had one or more subjective loco regional symptoms like pain, swelling of the arm, and decreased shoulder mobility. Objective evaluation showed 34 ml's of increased arm volumes and 3-25% had severe reduced shoulder mobility on the operated side. Compared to the findings at 18 months postoperatively, small but significant differences in occurrence of subjective findings were observed. A significant progression regarding most objective findings was revealed. Conclusion: More than 11 years after breast cancer surgery, the majority of participants complained of one or more subjective symptoms of shoulder and arm morbidity. Objective findings were mild or modest in most cases. During the prolonged follow-up period of 10 years, a worsening in symptoms and objective findings was observed.

TI  - Machine learning on high performance computing for urban greenspace change detection: satellite image data fusion approach
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGE AND DATA FUSION
M3  - Article
AB  - Green spaces serve important environmental and quality-of-life functions in urban environments. Fast-changing urban regions require continuous and fast green space change detection. This study focuses on assessment of green space change detection using GPU- for time efficient green space identification and monitoring. Using spatio-temporal data from satellite images and a support vector machine (SVM) as a classification algorithm, this research proposes a platform for green space analysis and change detection. The main contributions of this research include the fusion of the thermal band in addition to Near infra-red, red, green band with the fusion of high spectral information of the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset and high spatial information of the LANDSAT 7 dataset. The novel method is employed to calculate the total green space area in the Mumbai metropolitan area and monitor the changes from 2005-2019. This research paper discusses the findings of our strategy and reveals that over the course of 15 years the overall green space was reduced to 50%.

TI  - Lensinglike tensions In the <i>Planck</i> legacy release
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW D
M3  - Article
AB  - We analyze the final release of the Planck satellite data to constrain the gravitational lensing potential in a model-independent manner. The amount of lensing determined from the smoothing of the acoustic peaks in the temperature and polarization power spectra is 2 sigma too high when compared with the measurements using the lensing reconstruction and 2.8 sigma too high when compared with ACDM expectation based on the "unlensed" portion of the temperature and polarization power spectra. The largest change from the previous data release is the ACDM expectation, driven by improved constraints to the optical depth to reionization. The anomaly still is inconsistent with actual gravitational lensing, given that the lensing reconstruction constraints are discrepant independent of the model. Within the context of ACDM, improvements in its parameter constraints from lensing reconstruction bring this tension to 2.1 sigma and from further adding baryon acoustic oscillation and Pantheon supernova data to a marginally higher 2.2 sigma. Once these other measurements are included, marginalizing this lensinglike anomaly cannot substantially resolve tensions with low-redshift measurements of H-0 and S-8 in ACDM, ACDM + N-eff, or ACDM +Sigma m(nu) furthermore, the artificial strengthening of constraints on Sigma m(nu) is less than 20%.

TI  - Integrating eddy fluxes and remote sensing products in a rotational grazing native tallgrass prairie pasture
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Eddy covariance (EC) systems provide integrated fluxes within their footprint areas. Spatial heterogeneity of up-scaled areas and spatio-temporal mismatches between EC footprint and remote sensing pixels jeopardize the performance of most satellite-based models. To examine the impact of spatial resolution of satellite products on up-scaling of fluxes, we compared the relationships between measured eddy fluxes and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) at 500 and 250 m spatial resolutions, Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) at 500 m spatial resolution, and Landsat at 30 m spatial resolution but integrated at the paddock-scale. The experiment was conducted over a grazed native tallgrass prairie pasture, which was divided into nine paddocks for rotational grazing. The EVI data from all satellites showed consistency in detecting vegetation phenology. Seasonality of EC-measured fluxes corresponded well with remotely-sensed vegetation phenology. Approximately 80% of contribution to eddy fluxes came from within 80 m upwind distance of the 2.7 m tall EC tower. As a result, the major contributing area for the measured fluxes was mostly limited to the paddock containing the EC tower. Different timings and duration of grazing caused some heterogeneity among paddocks within the pasture. The EVI of different spatial scales showed strong relationships with CO2 fluxes. However, Landsat-derived EVI integrated for the paddock containing the EC tower showed substantially stronger relationships with CO2 fluxes than did MODIS and VIIRS-derived EVI integrated for multiple paddocks, most likely due to similar spatial resolutions of remote sensing and EC observations. Results illustrate that satellite products of fine-scale spatial resolution that arc comparable to EC footprints can help improve the performance of satellite-based models for modeling or up-scaling of eddy fluxes, especially in heterogeneous ecosystems.

TI  - Interactive effects of salinity variation and exposure to ZnO nanoparticles on the innate immune system of a sentinel marine bivalve, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - ZnO nanoparticles (nZnO) are released into the coastal environment from multiple sources, yet their toxicity to marine organisms is not well understood. We investigated the interactive effects of salinity (normal 15, low 5, and fluctuating 5-15) and nZnO (100 mu g l(-1)) on innate immunity of the blue mussels Mytilus edulis from a brackish area of the Baltic Sea. Exposure to ionic Zn (100 mu g l(-1)) was used to test whether the toxic effects of nZnO can be attributed to the potential release of Zn2+. Functional parameters and the expression of key immune-related genes were investigated in the mussels exposed to nZnO or ionic Zn under different salinity regimes for 21 days. nZnO exposures elevated hemocyte mortality, suppressed adhesion, stimulated phagocytosis, and led to an apparent increase in lysosomal volume. At salinity 15, nZnO suppressed the mRNA expression of the Toll-like receptors TLRb and c, C-lectin, and the complement system component C3q indicating impaired ability for pathogen recognition. In contrast, the mRNA levels of an antimicrobial peptide defensin increased during nZnO exposure at salinity 15. At fluctuating salinity (5-15), nZnO exposure increased expression of multiple immune-related genes in hemocytes including the complement system components C1 and C3q, and the Toll-like receptors TLRa, b and c. Low salinity (5) had strong immunosuppressive effects on the functional and molecular immune traits of M. edulis that overshadowed the effects of nZnO. The salinity-dependent modulation of immune response to nZnO cannot be attributed to the differences in the aggregation or solubility of nZnO, and likely reflects the interaction of the toxic effects of nanoparticles and physiological effects of the osmotic stress. These findings have implications for the environmental risk assessment of nanomaterials and the development of the context-specific biomarker baselines for coastal pollution monitoring.

AB  - Several French regions where coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been reported currently show a renewed increase in ILI cases in the general practice-based Sentinelles network. We computed the number of excess cases by region from 24 February to 8 March 2020 and found a correlation with the number of reported COVID-19 cases so far. The data suggest larger circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the French population than apparent from confirmed cases.

TI  - Climatological and Hydrological Observations for the South American Andes: <i>In situ</i> Stations, Satellite, and Reanalysis Data Sets
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Modern hydrology relies on multiple sources of information combined with climatological, hydrological and glaciological data. These data can be collected through various sources such as private initiatives by companies, research programs, and both national and international organisms. They also vary by types, e.g., in situ measurements, satellite, reanalysis and simulated data. Recently the ANDEX research project, as a GEWEX regional program, was created to understand the processes related to the hydrological cycle and energy fluxes in the Andean region from Colombia to Patagonia. It is quite challenging to carry out this program given the complex orography and diversity of climates from tropical to sub-polar climates. This review article is a compilation of the various databases that are useful for hydrometeorological research in the South American Andes. The National Meteorological and Hydrological Services in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Venezuela and Argentina provide a large amount of data however the high-elevation areas are poorly instrumented and the number of stations varies greatly between the countries. National databases are only partially shared with the international bodies responsible for summarizing the existing data; this causes problems in term of data product assimilation. Across the entire continent, too few radiosondes are being used despite the fact that these data are crucial for validating and identifying problems in the atmospheric models. An increasing number of satellite data are available but it is difficult to assimilate them into the hydroclimatological models suited to the adjusted spatial and temporal resolutions. Specifically, for precipitation, we recommend merged products that account for the high spatial and temporal variability across the Andes. Finally, the international ANDEX program could be an excellent opportunity to increase the knowledge of the hydrological processes in the Andes.

TI  - Inactivated influenza vaccine does not reduce all cause respiratory illness in children with pre-existing medical conditions
T2  - VACCINE
M3  - Article
AB  - respiratory illness (RI) in children with pre-existing medical conditions has not been fully established and varies from season to season. This study aims to quantify the overall impact of IIV immunization on primary care attended RI episodes in children with pre-existing medical conditions, using robust observational data spanning twelve influenza seasons.Methods: Electronic records of IIV eligible children aged 6 months to 18 years were extracted from primary care databases over the years 2004-2015. IIV eligibility criteria according to Dutch guidelines included (chronic) respiratory and cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. For each year, information on IIV immunization status, primary care attended RI episodes (including influenza, acute respiratory tract infections and asthma exacerbations) and potential confounders were collected. Generalized estimating equations were used to model the association between IIV status and occurrence of at least one RI episode during the influenza epidemic period with "current year immunized" as reference group. Robustness of findings were assessed by performing various sensitivity analyzes in which (i) seasons with a mismatch between the dominant circulating influenza virus and vaccine strain were excluded, (ii) influenza periods were further restricted to weeks with at least 30% influenza virus positive specimens in sentinel surveillance (instead of 5%), (iii) propensity scores were used to adjust for confounding.Results: In total, 11,797 children (follow-up duration: 38,701 child-years) were eligible for IIV for >= one season with 29% immunized at least once. The adjusted odds for primary care attended RI episodes during the influenza epidemic period did not differ between current season immunized versus not immunized children (adjusted OR:1.01; 95%CI:0.90-1.13). The various sensitivity analysis showed comparable results.Conclusions: IIV immunization in children with pre-existing medical conditions does not reduce all cause RI episodes encountered in primary care during the influenza season.

TI  - An evapotranspiration model self-calibrated from remotely sensed surface soil moisture, land surface temperature and vegetation cover fraction: application to disaggregated SMOS and MODIS data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal-based two-source energy balance modeling is essential to estimate the land evapotranspiration (ET) in a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. However, the use of thermal-derived land surface temperature (LST) is not sufficient to simultaneously constrain both soil and vegetation flux components. Therefore, assumptions (about either soil or vegetation fluxes) are commonly required. To avoid such assumptions, an energy balance model, TSEB-SM, was recently developed by Ait Hssaine et al. (2018b) in order to consider the microwave-derived near-surface soil moisture (SM), in addition to the thermal-derived LST and vegetation cover fraction (f(c)) normally used. While TSEB-SM has been successfully tested using in situ measurements, this paper represents its first evaluation in real life using 1 km resolution satellite data, comprised of MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) for LST and f(c) data and 1 km resolution SM data disaggregated from SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) observations. The approach is applied during a 4-year period (2014-2018) over a rainfed wheat field in the Tensift basin, central Morocco. The field used was seeded for the 2014-2015 (S1), 2016-2017 (S2) and 2017-2018 (S3) agricultural seasons, while it remained unploughed (as bare soil) during the 2015-2016 (B1) agricultural season. The classical TSEB model, which is driven only by LST and f(c) data, significantly overestimates latent heat fluxes (LE) and underestimates sensible heat fluxes (H) for the four seasons. The overall mean bias values are 119, 94, 128 and 181 W m(-2) for LE and -104, -71, -128 and -181 W m(-2) for H, for S1, S2, S3 and B1, respectively. Meanwhile, when using TSEB-SM (SM and LST combined data), these errors are significantly reduced, resulting in mean bias values estimated as 39, 4, 7 and 62 W m(-2) for LE and -10, 24, 7, and -59 W m(-2) for H, for S1, S2, S3 and B1, respectively. Consequently, this finding confirms again the robustness of the TSEB-SM in estimating latent/sensible heat fluxes at a large scale by using readily available satellite data. In addition, the TSEB-SM approach has the original feature to allow for calibration of its main parameters (soil resistance and Priestley-Taylor coefficient) from satellite data uniquely, without relying either on in situ measurements or on a priori parameter values.

TI  - Agricultural Drought Monitoring via the Assimilation of SMAP Soil Moisture Retrievals Into a Global Soil Water Balance Model
T2  - FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA
M3  - Article
AB  - From an agricultural perspective, drought refers to an unusual deficiency of plant available water in the root-zone of the soil profile. This paper focuses on evaluating the benefit of assimilating soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission into the USDA-FAS Palmer model for agricultural drought monitoring. This will be done by examining the standardized soil moisture anomaly index. The skill of the SMAP-enhanced Palmer model is assessed over three agricultural regions that have experienced major drought since the launch of SMAP in early 2015: (1) the 2015 drought in California (CA), USA, (2) the 2017 drought in South Africa, and (3) the 2018 mid-winter drought in Australia. During these three events, the SMAP-enhanced Palmer soil moisture estimates (PM+SMAP) are compared against the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall dataset and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products. Results demonstrate the benefit of assimilating SMAP and confirm its potential for improving U.S. Department of Agriculture-Foreign Agricultural Service root-zone soil moisture information generated using the Palmer model. In particular, PM+SMAP soil moisture estimates are shown to enhance the spatial variability of Palmer model root-zone soil moisture estimates and adjust the Palmer model drought response to improve its consistency with ancillary CHIRPS precipitation and NDVI information.

T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces a new family of matrix variate distributions based on the mean-mixture of normal (MMN) models. The properties of the new matrix variate family, namely stochastic representation, moments and characteristic function, linear and quadratic forms as well as marginal and conditional distributions are investigated. Three special cases including the restricted skew-normal, exponentiated MMN and the mixed-Weibull MMN matrix variate distributions are presented and studied. Based on the specific presentation of the proposed model, an EM-type algorithm can be directly implemented for obtaining maximum likelihood estimate of the parameters. The usefulness and practical utility of the proposed methodology are illustrated through two conducted simulation studies and through the Landsat satellite dataset analysis.

TI  - The Bacterium <i>Akkermansia muciniphila</i>: A Sentinel for Gut Permeability and Its Relevance to HIV-Related Inflammation
T2  - FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Gut dysbiosis, namely dysregulation of the intestinal microbiota, and increased gut permeability lead to enhanced inflammation and are commonly seen in chronic conditions such as obesity and aging. In people living with HIV (PLWH), several lines of evidence suggest that a depletion of gut CD4 T-cells is associated with gut dysbiosis, microbial translocation and systemic inflammation. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) rapidly controls viral replication, which leads to CD4 T-cell recovery and control of the disease. However, gut dysbiosis, epithelial damage and microbial translocation persist despite ART, increasing risk of developing inflammatory non-AIDS comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, liver steatosis and cancer. In addition to ART, an emerging research priority is to discover strategies to improve the gut microbial composition and intestinal barrier function. Probiotic interventions have been extensively used with controversial benefits in humans. Encouragingly, within the last decade, the intestinal symbiotic bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila has emerged as the "sentinel of the gut." A lower abundance of A. muciniphila has been shown in diabetic and obese people as well as in PLWH. Interventions with high levels of polyphenols such as tea or diets rich in fruit, the antibiotic vancomycin and the antidiabetic drug metformin have been shown to increase A. muciniphila abundance, contributing to improved metabolic function in diabetic and obese individuals. We hypothesize that gut microbiota rich in A. muciniphila can reduce microbial translocation and inflammation, preventing occurrences of non-AIDS comorbidities in PLWH. To this aim, we will discuss the protective effect of A. muciniphila and its potential applications, paving the way toward novel therapeutic strategies to improve gut health in PLWH.

TI  - Increasing trends of lymphogranuloma venereum among HIV-negative and asymptomatic men who have sex with men, the Netherlands, 2011 to 2017
T2  - EUROSURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), an invasive form of Chlamydia trachomatis infection, has been reported among (mainly HIV-positive) men who have sex with men (MSM) since 2003. In the Netherlands, LGV testing recommendations changed from selective to universal testing in 2015. Changes in tested populations could have led to incomparable LGV positivity rates over time. Aim: We investigated LGV trends among MSM attending Centres for Sexual Health using surveillance data between 2011 and 2017. Methods: LGV positivity was calculated among MSM tested for rectal Chlamydia infection and MSM tested specifically for LGV. With multivariable logistic regression analysis, the association between years and LGV was adjusted for testing indicators and determinants. Results: We included 224,194 consultations. LGV increased from 86 in 2011 to 270 in 2017. Among LGV-positives, proportions of HIV-negative and asymptomatic MSM increased from 17.4% to 45.6% and from 31.4% to 49.3%, respectively, between 2011 and 2017. Among MSM tested for rectal chlamydia, LGV positivity increased from 0.12% to 0.33% among HIV-negatives and remained stable around 2.5% among HIV-positives. Among LGV-tested MSM, LGV positivity increased from 2.1% to 5.7% among HIV-negatives and from 15.1% to 22.1% among HIV-positives. Multivariable models showed increased odds ratios and significant positive associations between years and LGV. Conclusions: Although increased testing and changes in LGV incidence are difficult to disentangle, we found increasing LGV trends, especially when corrected for confounding. LGV was increasingly attributed to HIV-negative and asymptomatic MSM, among whom testing was previously limited. This stresses the importance of universal testing and continuous surveillance.

TI  - Fusing optical and synthetic aperture radar images based on shearlet transform to improve urban impervious surface extraction
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to extract urban impervious surfaces (ISs) accurately, optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images fusion was recognized as one promising method. However, most fusion methods currently focus on feature-level and decision-level fusions. There are only a few studies exploring the performance of the fused image at the pixel level for IS extraction. Therefore, we introduced the shearlet transform to fuse Landsat-8 and TerraSAR images and evaluated the fused image by comparing it to those obtained using conventional image fusion methods. The IS from the fused images using the support vector machine algorithm is extracted and compared. Experimental results indicate some interesting findings. First, the shearlet transform can fully retain the spectral information from the optical image and the spatial information from the SAR image. Second, the IS extraction from the fused image with the shearlet transform achieved the highest accuracy with an overall accuracy of 95.1% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.8792, which confirmed the proposed method is applicable to IS extraction. We can conclude that an effective pixel-level fusion algorithm for optical and SAR images can significantly improve the extraction accuracy of urban IS. Our research could provide an innovative fusion technique and also could serve as a meaningful reference for further applications of optical and SAR imagery. In addition, the potential of SAR data in IS extraction should be further investigated. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Risk factors for breast cancer-related lymphedema: correlation with docetaxel administration
T2  - BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Upper-limb lymphedema is a well-known complication of breast cancer and its treatment. This retrospective cohort study aims to determine what risk factors affect breast cancer-related lymphedema in patients with breast cancer. Methods This retrospective study comprised patients diagnosed with breast cancer and who underwent surgery at Wakayama Medical University Hospital between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2018. Assessed factors using univariate and multivariate analyses were patient-related factors (age, gender, and BMI), breast cancer-related factors (tumor size, nodal status, histology, tumor location, and intrinsic subtype), and treatment-related factors (type of surgery, application, timing and regimen of chemotherapy, and application of radiotherapy). Results This study included 1041 patients. BMI did not affect the onset of breast cancer-related lymphedema. There were only six sentinel lymph node biopsy cases in the breast cancer-related lymphedema group (6.6%). In cases of axillary lymph node dissection, adjuvant chemotherapy was marginally associated with increased risk of breast cancer-related lymphedema compared to no chemotherapy (HR 2.566; 95% CI 0.955-6.892;p = 0.0616). Among anti-cancer agents, docetaxel (HR 3.790; 95% CI 1.413-10.167;p = 0.0081) and anti-HER2 therapy (HR 2.507; 95% CI 1.083-5.803;p = 0.0318) were associated with increased risk of lymphedema according to multivariate analysis. Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy did not affect the onset of breast cancer-related lymphedema. Radiotherapy (HR 2.525; 95% CI 1.364-4.676;p = 0.0032) was an important risk factor for breast cancer-related lymphedema. Conclusions Axillary lymph node dissection, radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy, especially docetaxel, were risk factors for breast cancer-related lymphedema, but BMI and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy were not.

TI  - Temporal and spatial variability in snow cover over the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, from 2001 to 2015
T2  - PEERJ
M3  - Article
AB  - Xinjiang, China, is a typical arid and semi-arid region of Central Asia that significantly lacks freshwater resources, and the surface runoff in this region is mainly supplied by mountain glacier and snow cover meltwater. Based on the above background and issues of transnational water resources between Xinjiang and Central Asia along the Silk Road Economic Belt, which were highlighted in the major strategy of "The Belt and Road'', this study analysed the spatial and temporal variations in snow cover and snow cover days in the Xinjiang region from 2001 to 2015. The study area includes four subregions: Northern Xinjiang, Southern Xinjiang, Eastern Xinjiang and the Ili River Valley. Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 8-day snow cover data were used after removing clouds by combining MOD10A2 and MYD10A2. The results showed that seasonal snow cover occurred from October to April in most regions of Xinjiang and that this snow cover consisted of two processes: snow accumulation and snow ablation. The maximum snow cover occurred in January, whereas the minimum snow cover occurred from July to August. During the seasonal snow cover period, the snowfall rates in Northern Xinjiang and the Ili River Valley were higher, while the other regions had a low snowfall probability. To study the relationship between altitude and snow cover, the normalized snow elevation correlation index (NSACI) was calculated. The NSACI showed a significant correlation between snow cover and elevation in most regions of Xinjiang and was classified into five grades. Snow cover days did not fluctuate obviously from 2001 to 2015, and a decreasing trend was observed in the four subregions except for the Ili River Valley (nonsignificant decreasing trend). We also observed a correlation between snow cover and temperature and found that the correlations between monthly snow cover and monthly temperature in the four subregions were strongly related to the underlying land type and global warming background, which also suggests that the special topography of Xinjiang greatly influences both snow cover and climate change.

TI  - High level of TILs is an independent predictor of negative sentinel lymph node in women but not in men
T2  - ARCHIVES OF DERMATOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Factors that are most associated with positive lymph node status in melanoma are Breslow thickness and ulceration. However, there are other factors that have been little explored and could help in the identification of "at risk patients" harbouring occult metastasis. The objective of this study was to determine whether intensity of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in a cohort study (N = 4133) is an independent predictor of sentinel lymph node (SLN) status in patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. Of the patients with cutaneous melanoma who resulted negative for nodal metastasis, 50.7% had moderate/marked TILs versus 27.7% among those patients who resulted positive for nodal metastasis. In the multivariate analysis, controlling for sex, age, mitotic rate, ulceration and Breslow, high levels of TILs in primary invasive melanoma was associated with a lower risk of developing SLN metastasis (OR 0.46; 95% CI 0.23-0.95, p = 0.037). When the analysis was stratified by sex, the protective effect of moderate/marked TIL remained only for women (OR 0.30; 95% CI 0.10-0.93, p = 0.037) but not for men (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.19-1.34, p = 0.172). Other independent predictors of negative lymph node were low Breslow thickness (<= 2.0 mm) and low mitotic rate. Besides predicting a negative lymph node response, TILs were also associated with a decreased risk of 10-year mortality among females with positive lymph node. Our findings suggest that high level of TILs is an independent predictor of negative SLN status among women. Further research is warranted to confirm our findings.

TI  - Molecular models and scientific realism
T2  - FOUNDATIONS OF CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The practice of theoretical research in chemistry largely consists in the construction of models without which experimentation would be impossible. The best-known theoretical models in chemistry are those of the molecular structures of chemical compounds. What is the correspondence between these models and the unobservable entities that they are meant to explain? What is the ontological status of molecular models? The anti-realists question the basis of the realists' belief in these entities and the truth claims regarding them. Ultimately, the realist/anti-realist debate points to the question of the scope of scientific knowledge. In this paper, I shall show that the description of natural entities offered by the contemporary scientific worldview reveals that molecular modeling presupposes a realistic epistemology that recognizes the limits of scientific objectification.

TI  - Uncovering spatial and ecological variability in gap size frequency distributions in the Canadian boreal forest
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Analyses characterizing canopy gaps are required to improve our understanding of spatial and structural variations in forest canopies and provide insight into ecosystem-level successional processes. Gap size frequency distributions (GSFD) are indicative of ecological processes and disturbance patterns. To date, GSFD in boreal forest ecosystems have not been systematically quantified over large areas using a single consistent data source. Herein we characterized GSFDs across the entirety of the Canadian boreal forest using transects of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. ALS transects were representatively sampled within eight distinct Canadian boreal ecozones. Gaps were detected and delineated from the ALS-derived canopy height model as contiguous canopy openings >= 8 m(2) with canopy heights <= 3m. Gaps were then stratified by ecozone and forest type (i.e. coniferous, broadleaf, mixedwood, wetland-treed), and combinations thereof, and GSFDs were calculated for each stratum. GSFDs were characterized by the scaling parameter of the power-law probability distribution, lambda (lambda) and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests confirmed that GSFDs for each stratum followed a power-law distribution. Pairwise comparisons between ecozones, forest types, and combinations thereof indicated significant differences between estimates of lambda. Scaling parameters were found to be more variable by ecozone (1.96-2.31) than by forest type (2.15-2.21). These results contrast those of similar studies done in tropical forest environments, whereby lambda was found to be relatively consistent across a range of site types, geological substrates, and forest types. The geographic range considered herein is much larger than that of previous studies, and broad-scale patterns in climate, landforms, and soils that are reflected in the definition of unique ecozones, likely also influence gap characteristics.

TI  - Impact of land use land cover changes on ecosystem service value - A case study of Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao in South China
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The rapid increase in anthropogenic activities, socioeconomic development, and land use land cover (LULC) changes since the opening of economic reforms (1978), have changed the ecosystem service value (ESV) in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Macao (GKHM) region located in South China. This leads to the requirement of a significant tailored analysis of ecosystem services regarding incisive and relevant planning to ensure sustainability at regional level. This study focuses on the use of Landsat satellite imagery to quantify the precise impact of LULC changes on the ecosystem services in GHKM over the past three decades (1986-2017). The most renowned established unit value transfer method has been employed to calculate the ESV. The results show that the total ecosystem service value in GHKM has decreased from 680.23 billion CNY in 1986 to 668.45 billion CNY in 2017, mainly due to the decrease in farmland and fishponds. This overall decrease concealed the more dynamic and complex nature of the individual ESV. The most significant decrease took place in the values of water supply (-22.20 billion CNY, -14.72%), waste treatment (-20.77 billion CNY, - 14.63%), and food production (-7.96 billion CNY, - 33.18%). On the other hand, the value of fertile soil formation and retention (6.28 billion CNY, +7.26%) and recreation and culture (5.09 billion CNY, +12.91%) increased. Furthermore, total ESV and ESV per capita decreased significantly with the continuous increase in total gross domestic product (GDP) and GDP per capita. A substantial negative correlation exists between farmland ESV and GDP indicating human encroachment into a natural and semi natural ecosystems. The results suggest that in the rapidly urbanizing region, the protection of farmland and to control the intrusion of urban areas has marked an important societal demand and a challenge to the local government. This required a pressing need for smart LULC planning and to improve policies and regulation to guarantee ecosystem service sustainability for acceptable life quality in the study area and other fast expanding urban areas in China.

TI  - Antarctic Krill Lipid and Fatty acid Content Variability is Associated to Satellite Derived Chlorophyll <i>a</i> and Sea Surface Temperatures
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are a key component of the Antarctic food web with considerable lipid reserves that are vital for their health and higher predator survival. Krill lipids are primarily derived from their diet of plankton, in particular diatoms and flagellates. Few attempts have been made to link the spatial and temporal variations in krill lipids to those in their food supply. Remotely-sensed environmental parameters provide large-scale information on the potential availability of krill food, although relating this to physiological and biochemical differences has only been performed on small scales and with limited samples. Our study utilised remotely-sensed data (chlorophyll a and sea surface temperature) coupled with krill lipid data obtained from 3 years of fishery-derived samples. We examined within and between year variation of trends in both the environment and krill biochemistry data. Chlorophyll a levels were positively related to krill lipid levels, particularly triacylglycerol. Plankton fatty acid biomarkers analysed in krill (such as n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids) increased with decreasing sea surface temperature and increasing chlorophyll a levels. Our study demonstrates the utility of combining remote-sensing and biochemical data in examining biological and physiological relationships between Antarctic krill and the Southern Ocean environment.

TI  - A patient-level key performance indicator set to measure the effectiveness of fracture liaison services and guide quality improvement: a position paper of the IOF Capture the Fracture Working Group, National Osteoporosis Foundation and Fragility Fracture Network
T2  - OSTEOPOROSIS INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The International Osteoporosis Foundation (IOF) Capture the Fracture (R) Campaign with the Fragility Fracture Network (FFN) and National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) has developed eleven patient-level key performance indicators (KPIs) for fracture liaison services (FLSs) to guide quality improvement. Introduction Fracture Liaison Services (FLSs) are recommended worldwide to reduce fracture risk after a sentinel fracture. Given not every FLS is automatically effective, the IOF Capture the Fracture working group has developed and implemented the Best Practice Framework to assess the organisational components of an FLS. We have now developed a complimentary KPI set that extends this assessment of performance to the patient level. Methods The Capture the Fracture working group in collaboration with the Fragility Fracture Network Secondary Fragility Fracture Special Interest Group and National Osteoporosis Foundation adapted existing metrics from the UK-based Fracture Liaison Service Database Audit to develop a patient-level KPI set for FLSs. Results Eleven KPIs were selected. The proportion of patients: with non-spinal fractures; with spine fractures (detected clinically and radiologically); assessed for fracture risk within 12 weeks of sentinel fracture; having DXA assessment within 12 weeks of sentinel fracture; having falls risk assessment; recommended anti-osteoporosis medication; commenced of strength and balance exercise intervention within 16 weeks of sentinel fracture; monitored within 16 weeks of sentinel fracture; started anti-osteoporosis medication within 16 weeks of sentinel fracture; prescribed anti-osteoporosis medication 52 weeks after sentinel fracture. The final KPI measures data completeness for each of the other KPIs. For these indicators, levels of achievement were set at the < 50%, 50-80% and > 80% levels except for treatment recommendation where a level of 50% was used. Conclusion This KPI set compliments the existing Best Practice Framework to support FLSs to examine their own performance using patient-level data. By using this KPI set for local quality improvement cycles, FLSs will be able to efficiently realise the full potential of secondary fracture prevention and improved clinical outcomes for their local populations.

TI  - [PM2.5 Inversion Using Remote Sensing Data in Eastern China Based on Deep Learning].
T2  - Huan jing ke xue= Huanjing kexue
M3  - English Abstract
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - PM2.5, which is a major source of air pollution, has a considerable impact on human health. In this study, a multi-element joint PM2.5 inversion method based on a deep learning model is proposed. With PM2.5 concentration as the ground truth, 10 elements including the Himawari-AOD daily data products, temperature, relative humidity, and pressure, were introduced as inversion elements. To verify the effectiveness of the method, the experiment was carried out by season using remote sensing data in Eastern China during 2016-2018. The results demonstrate that PM2.5 concentrations were positively correlated with AOD, precipitation, wind speed, and high vegetation cover index and negatively correlated with dwarf vegetation cover index. The correlation with temperature, humidity, pressure, and DEM changed with seasons. Comparative experiments indicated that the accuracy of PM2.5 inversion based on the deep neural network is higher than that of traditional linear and nonlinear models. R2 was above 0.5, and the error was small in each season. The R2 value for autumn, which showed the best inversion, was 0.86, that for summer was 0.75, that for winter was 0.613, and that for spring was 0.566. The visualization of the model illustrates that the inversion result of the DNN model is closer to the PM2.5 concentration distribution interpolated by the ground monitoring station, and the resolution is higher and more accurate.

TI  - GIS application for urban domestic wastewater treatment site selection in the Northern Ethiopia, Tigray Regional State: a case study in Mekelle City
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Mekelle City is among the most rapidly growing cities in Ethiopia though the management of wastewater is very poor. The city lacks proper infrastructures for the collection and treatment of urban wastewater so that the wastewater released from different sectors directly joins the urban drainage of the city that finally flows to the Ellala River, which crosses the city. However, such practices have the potential to contaminate water reservoirs and surface water and groundwater bodies that endangers the health of the nearby society. Hence, to reduce and manage the wastewater impact sustainably, introducing natural treatment mechanisms like waste stabilization pond technology (WSP) is an ultimate means to implement with low cost and technology demand. Hence, the objective of this study was to select suitable sites for WSP sites to treat domestic wastewater of the city. During the process of WSP selection, nine most important parameters were considered namely groundwater, hydrogeology, slope, elevation, soil depth, land use land cover (LULC), distance from the settlement, from the road, and from the river. Those determinant factors affecting site selection were generated from satellite images, maps, and Digital Elevation Model. Supervised image classification for Landsat TM satellite image was done while the rest variables' geo-database files were generated in ArcGIS interface software. Since all input variables have not equal influence in WSP site selection, the weighted value of variable estimation was undertaken using the algorism weighted combination formula. And finally, the weighted overlay model was used to run the model so that suitable sites were selected. Result shows that the city has a large number of alternative sites for establishing a waste stabilization pond. Five classes of suitability were generated (from low to very high suitability level). The North West and Northern parts of the city are found in the potential candidates' areas as of the central and southern parts. Geographically, these areas are topographically gentle slope and have low altitude plus the newly designed sewer line network outlet lies in this direction. In contrast, unsuitable areas are found in the East, Central, and South direction of the study area. These selected areas are characterized by high population density, steep slope, and high topography. Groundwater, elevation, hydrogeology, and slope were found the most influential parameters determining WSP site selection. On the other hand, distance from road and river, land use cover, and soil depth were found the least influential parameters that determine WSP selection. Out of the total mml area, 21.3% were found highly suitable. So, this implies that the city has a large potential area that can be used for WSP establishment. From the present study, it can be concluded that GIS is a very essential tool in urban utility establishment like urban domestic wastewater treatment site selection. Although the city has adequate potential areas for establishing WSP, further assessment of flood vulnerability, biochemical determination, wastewater amount quantification, population growth, and urban expansion need to be seriously considered before implementing.

TI  - Downscaling of MODIS leaf area index using landsat vegetation index
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Several organizations provide satellite Leaf Area Index (LAI) data regularly, at various scales, at high frequency, but at low spatial resolution. This study attempted to enhance the spatial resolution of the MODIS LAI product to the Landsat resolution level. Four climatically diverse sites in Europe and Africa were selected as study areas. Regression analysis was applied between MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and LAI data. The regression equations were used as input in a downscaling model, along with Landsat EVI images and land-cover maps. The estimated LAI values showed high correlation with field-measured LAI during the dry period. The model validation gave statistically significant results, with correlation coefficient values ranging from relatively low (0.25-0.32), to moderate (0.48-0.64) and high (0.72-0.94). Limited samples per vegetation type, the diversity of species within the same vegetation type, land-use/land-cover changes and saturated EVI values affected the accuracy of the downscaling model.

TI  - CLASlite unmixing of Landsat images to estimate REDD plus activity data for deforestation in a Bangladesh forest
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) has emerged as a global climate change mitigation initiative under negotiation by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change aimed at providing financial support to the developing countries for conserving respective forests. To implement the REDD+ initiative, developing countries need to estimate, among other necessitates, the activity data (i.e., pattern and process) of respective deforestation and forest degradation. Bangladesh is steadily progressing through its REDD+ roadmap. However, an important research issue to address includes using remote sensing technology to detect activity data for deforestation in a spatially explicit manner following the recommended good practice guidelines by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This study mapped the activity data for deforestation of a mixed forest in Bangladesh during 1995 to 2015, applying Monte-Carlo spectral unmixing classification algorithm to Landsat images in CLASlite software. The classification was verified using independently drawn reference points from high-resolution Google Earth images. A postclassification comparison method was applied to generate landcover transition matrices. The outputs were highly accurate maps (overall accuracy >90%) and statics of activity data for deforestation of the study area. The approaches and findings may have significant implications in adopting any REDD+ project in Bangladesh. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Self-adapting extraction of cropland phenological transitions of rotation agroecosystems using dynamically fused NDVI images
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing can be used to monitor cropland phenological characteristics; however, tradeoffs between the spatial and temporal resolutions of cloudless satellite images limit the accuracy of their retrieval. In this study, an improved enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM) was applied to human-dominated Xiong'an New Area to develop a self-adapting algorithm automating the extraction of main phenological transition points (greenup, maturity, senescence, and dormancy). The analyses of cropland phenological characteristics were performed utilizing the Softmax classification method. By examining three different phases of fusion images, it was found that the improved ESTARFM was more accurate than the original ESTARFM (correlation coefficient > 0.76; relative root mean square error < 0.25; structural similarity index > 0.79). The reconstructed normalized difference vegetation indexes were consistent with that acquired by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (average discrepancy: 0.1136, median absolute deviation: 0.0110). The greenup, maturity, senescence, and dormancy points were monitored in 5-day resolution and 50-day length on a 30-m grid scale, and their average day of year (DOY) were 67, 119, 127, and 166 for wheat; 173, 224, 232, and 283 for single-season corn; and 189, 227, 232, and 285 for rotation corn, respectively. The corresponding median absolute deviations were 2, 3, 2, and 2 days for wheat; 2, 5, 3, and 4 days for single-season corn; and 2, 5, 2, and 2 days for rotation corn, respectively, while all coefficients of variation did not exceed 6%. The proposed self-adapting approach can be used for identifying the planting modes at grid level in rotation agroecosystems and cropland phenological dynamics on a global or regional scale.

TI  - Near Infrared (NIR) Fluorescence is Not a Substitute for Lymphoscintigraphy and Gamma Probe for Melanoma Sentinel Node Detection: Results from a Prospective Trial
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is the standard care for early detection and staging of lymph node metastasis in melanomas. Radiocolloids (RC) and blue dyes are used for SLN detection. Recently, near infrared (NIR) fluorescence tracing using indocyanine green has been developed as an alternative method for SLN detection. The relatively high tissue penetration depth of several millimeters and the ability to detect low concentrations of tracer both suggest that NIR may have significant advantages over RC and the blue dye methods. The objective of this study was to prospectively compare the performance of all three SLN detection techniques using them sequentially to evaluate the same group of patients. Methods One hundred twenty-one primary cutaneous melanoma patients with an indication for SLN biopsy were assigned to the procedure following NIR, blue dye, and RC detection techniques. Results No adverse event was reported. SLN was not detected in only 4.1% of cases. In 90.9%, an SLN was identified with NIR, but without any auxiliary technique in only 70.2% of cases. RC detected the SLN in 92.6% of cases. Patent blue was found in the sentinel node in 76.9%. The combination of all three techniques detected an SLN in 95.9% of cases. Metastases were present in 26.7%. The false-negative rate was 8.8%, with a negative predictive value of 91.2%. Conclusions RC was the only technique with high SLN detection. Both the blue dye and NIR methods added sensitivity to the detection rate but should not be a substitute for RC.

TI  - Pollen production for 13 urban North American tree species: allometric equations for tree trunk diameter and crown area
T2  - AEROBIOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimates of airborne pollen concentrations at the urban scale would be useful for epidemiologists, land managers, and allergy sufferers. Mechanistic models could be well suited for this task, but their development will require data on pollen production across cities, including estimates of pollen production by individual trees. In this study, we developed predictive models for pollen production as a function of trunk size, canopy area, and height, which are commonly recorded in tree surveys or readily extracted from remote sensing data. Pollen production was estimated by measuring the number of flowers per tree, the number of anthers per flower, and the number of pollen grains per anther. Variability at each morphological scale was assessed using bootstrapping. Pollen production was estimated for the following species: Acer negundo, Acer platanoides, Acer rubrum, Acer saccharinum, Betula papyrifera, Gleditsia triacanthos, Juglans nigra, Morus alba, Platanus x acerifolia, Populus deltoides, Quercus palustris, Quercus rubra, and Ulmus americana. Basal area predicted pollen production with a mean R-2 of 0.72 (range 0.41-0.99), whereas canopy area predicted pollen production with a mean R-2 of 0.76 (range 0.50-0.99). These equations are applied to two tree datasets to estimate total municipal pollen production and the spatial distribution of street tree pollen production for the focal species. We present some of the first individual-tree based estimates of pollen production at the municipal scale; the observed spatial heterogeneity in pollen production is substantial and can feasibly be included in mechanistic models of airborne pollen at fine spatial scales.

TI  - Dehydration and low ozone in the tropopause layer over the Asian monsoon caused by tropical cyclones: Lagrangian transport calculations using ERA-Interim and ERA5 reanalysis data
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Low ozone and high water vapour mixing ratios are common features in the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) anticyclone; however, low ozone and low water vapour values were observed near the tropopause over Kunming, China, within the ASM using balloon-borne measurements performed during the SWOP (sounding water vapour, ozone, and particle) campaign in August 2009 and 2015. Here, we investigate low ozone and water vapour signatures in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) using FengYun-2D, FengYun-2G, and Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) satellite measurements and backward trajectory calculations. Trajectories with kinematic and diabatic vertical velocities were calculated using the Chemical Lagrangian Model of the Stratosphere (CLaMS) trajectory module driven by both ERA-Interim and ERAS reanalysis data.All trajectory calculations show that air parcels with low ozone and low water vapour values in the UTLS over Kunming measured by balloon-borne instruments originate from the western Pacific boundary layer. Deep convection associated with tropical cyclones over the western Pacific transports ozone-poor air from the marine boundary layer to the cold tropopause region. Subsequently, these air parcels are mixed into the strong easterlies on the southern side of the Asian summer monsoon anticyclone. Air parcels are dehydrated when passing the lowest temperature region (< 190 K) at the convective outflow of tropical cyclones. However, trajectory calculations show different vertical transport via deep convection depending on the employed reanalysis data (ERA-Interim, ERAS) and vertical velocities (diabatic, kinematic). Both the kinematic and the diabatic trajectory calculations using ERAS data show much faster and stronger vertical transport than ERA-Interim primarily because of ERAS's better spatial and temporal resolution, which likely resolves convective events more accurately. Our findings show that the interplay between the ASM anticyclone and tropical cyclones has a significant impact on the chemical composition of the UTLS during summer.

TI  - Framework for network-level pavement condition assessment using remote sensing data mining
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Pavement condition monitoring is fundamental for the efficient allocation of resources in transportation asset management. However, data collection involves laborious and costly procedures. Our study intends to investigate the usage of remote sensing data for network-level pavement condition assessment that offers a more cost-effective alternative and a rapid infrastructure assessment tool that can be used in the aftermath of natural disasters. Based on an extensive literature review, a data mining framework was established to train models that predict the pavement condition of different road segments. The framework exploits the inherent information of multispectral images by generating spectral related attributes. To identify pavement sampling areas, an automated procedure using image segmentation replaces manual surface digitizing. Unlike previous research, different classification models were used to approximate the mapping function from spectral information to pavement conditions. A preliminary case study was conducted with data provided by the City of Dallas and multispectral images acquired from the Texas Natural Resources Information System. The mean-shift segmentation algorithm was used to locate noise introducing areas on the pavement surface. Four different classification models were trained using k-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes, support vector machines, and a multilayer perceptron. The developed models were employed to predict the road surface condition class of a test set not included in the training procedure. The multilayer perceptron presented the highest accuracy level of 71%, showing that the framework might have the potential for future implementation.

TI  - Urban foraging: Land management policy, perspectives, and potential
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Gathering of uncultivated food from green spaces, also known as foraging, is observed in urban areas across the world, but the literature focuses predominantly on the global north. Our study examines the existing urban land management structure and its approach to urban foraging in the eastern coastal region of South Africa. Through interviews with municipal officials in nine cities, we identified different stakeholders and their roles in urban green space management. We then used network analysis to represent interactions and influence of these stakeholders, and environmental worldviews to determine organisational and perceptual barriers to and enablers of foraging in urban green spaces. The policy on urban green space management, as well as land managers themselves are amenable to the concept of foraging in public spaces. Lack of knowledge on wild indigenous species and sustainable offtake, ambiguous, coarse, or lacking policy, and normative views of pristine nature may hinder foraging. We recommend pathways for policy and stakeholder partnerships to incorporate sustainable foraging in their biodiversity conservation and land stewardship strategies.

TI  - A thiopyrylium salt for PET/NIR-II tumor imaging and image-guided surgery
T2  - MOLECULAR ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - All tumor imaging modalities have resolution limits below which deeply situated small metastatic foci may not be identified. Moreover, incomplete lesion excision will affect the outcomes of the patients. Scintigraphy is adept in locating lesions, and second near-infrared window (NIR-II) imaging may allow precise real-time tumor delineation. To achieve complete excision of all lesions, multimodality imaging is a promising method for tumor identification and management. Here, a NIR-II thiopyrylium salt, XB1034, was first synthesized and bound to cetuximab and trans-cyclooctene (TCO) to produce XB1034-cetuximab-TCO. This probe provides excellent sensitivity and high temporal resolution NIR-II imaging in mice bearing tumors developed from human breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231. To enable PET imaging, Ga-68-NETA-tetrazine is subsequently injected into the mice to undergo a bio-orthogonal reaction with the preinjected XB1034-cetuximab-TCO. PET images achieved in the tumor models using the pretargeting strategy are of much higher quality than those obtained using the direct radiolabeling method. Moreover, real-time NIR-II imaging allows accurate tumor excision and sentinel lymph node mapping. In conclusion, XB1034 is a promising molecular imaging probe for tumor diagnosis and treatment.

TI  - Estimates of lightning NO<i><sub>x</sub></i> production based on high-resolution OMI NO<sub>2</sub> retrievals over the continental US
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Lightning serves as the dominant source of nitrogen oxides (NOx=NO + NO2) in the upper troposphere (UT), with a strong impact on ozone chemistry and the hydroxyl radical production. However, the production efficiency (PE) of lightning nitrogen oxides (LNOx) is still quite uncertain (32-1100 mol NO per flash). Satellite measurements are a powerful tool to estimate LNOx directly compared to conventional platforms. To apply satellite data in both clean and polluted regions, a new algorithm for calculating LNOx has been developed that uses the Berkeley High-Resolution (BEHR) v3.0B NO2 retrieval algorithm and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem). LNOx PE over the continental US is estimated using the NO2 product of the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) data and the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) data. Focusing on the summer season during 2014, we find that the lightning NO2 (LNO2) PE is 32 +/- 15 mol NO2 per flash and 6 +/- 3 mol NO2 per stroke while LNOx PE is 90 +/- 50 mol NOx per flash and 17 +/- 10 mol NOx per stroke. Results reveal that our method reduces the sensitivity to the background NO2 and includes much of the below-cloud LNO2. As the LNOx parameterization varies in studies, the sensitivity of our calculations to the setting of the amount of lightning NO (LNO) is evaluated. Careful consideration of the ratio of LNO2 to NO2 is also needed, given its large influence on the estimation of LNO2 PE.

TI  - Correlation Between Oncotype DX, PREDICT and the Nottingham Prognostic Index: Implications for the Management of Early Breast Cancer
T2  - CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - IntroductionBreast cancer remains the most common cancer diagnosis in the UK. The current clinical practice utilises two different types of modalities to estimate the prognosis, risk of recurrence and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy treatment in patients with early breast cancer. The first set of modalities includes risk calculators based on clinicopathological features, e.g. PREDICT or the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI); the second includes genetic profiling of tumour tissue using Oncotype DX (ODX; Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) testing. PREDICT, NPI and ODX stratify breast cancers into high-, intermediate- and low-risk categories to help guide adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions. This study compares PREDICT, NPI and ODX Recurrence Scores (RS), with the aim of assessing 1) the correlation between the RS for PREDICT, NPI and ODX and 2) whether early breast cancer patients are stratified into similar risk categories by all three modalities.MethodsThis retrospective study included early breast cancer patients treated at a National Health Service (NHS) hospital over a 12-month period (October 1, 2017 to September 30, 2018). Inclusion criteria: consecutive patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative and lymph node-negative breast cancer. All patients were discussed at the local multidisciplinary team (MDT) meeting and underwent ODX testing. Exclusion criteria: patients without ODX test scores; patients with an in-breast recurrence; patients who did not undergo a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB); and patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) only. NPI and PREDICT scores were calculated for each patient using online tools, and ODX data was obtained through Genomic Health and MDT records. Patients were risk-stratified into high, intermediate and low risk of recurrence groups based on their PREDICT, NPI and ODX scores. The thresholds for risk stratification were based on current practice, which is evidence-based. Correlations between PREDICT, NPI and ODX scores were analysed using Spearman's correlation coefficient.ResultsForty-six patients (mean age: 56 years), with a total of 57 early breast cancers, underwent ODX testing. Risk categories generated by PREDICT very strongly correlated with NPI for all patients (r=0.92; P<0.0001). However, the RS generated by ODX testing only strongly correlated for patients with low-risk PREDICT scores (r=0.51; P=0.0134), while no correlation between RS and PREDICT was observed for patients with intermediate- or high-risk PREDICT scores (r=-0.0064; P=0.9767). Similar results were seen between NPI and RS. Overall, only 19/46 (41.3%) patients had an RS which corresponded to PREDICT risk category, while 18/46 (39.1%) patients had an RS that indicated a higher risk of recurrence than PREDICT, and 9/46 (19.6%) patients had an RS indicating a lower risk of recurrence than PREDICT. Similar results were found when comparing RS and NPI.ConclusionThe risk of recurrence estimated by ODX in patients deemed low risk by PREDICT or NPI highly correlated, while no such correlation existed in patients with an estimated intermediate- or high-risk breast cancer. In PREDICT- or NPI-estimated intermediate- and high-risk patients, ODX provided valuable additional prognostic information to guide adjuvant treatment, while the potential avoidance of ODX testing in low-risk patients presents significant cost-savings.

T2  - JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper was to examine the institutional conditions and educational practices associated with the development of first-year students' capacities to script their own religious, spiritual, and worldview narratives through exposure to and thoughtful reflection on encounters with diverse others. We longitudinally administered a theoretically-derived and empirically-validated measure of interfaith learning and development to 7,194 first-year students enrolled in one of 122 institutions. In addition, we weighted data to reflect national demographic presentations for first-year students and used hierarchical linear modeling to account for students nested within institutions. Results indicated that development gains were related to institutional interfaith commitments, including the provision of opportunities for students to participate in at least two formal interfaith co-curricular experiences during the first year in college.

TI  - Untangling causality in midlatitude aerosol-cloud adjustments
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Aerosol-cloud interactions represent the leading uncertainty in our ability to infer climate sensitivity from the observational record. The forcing from changes in cloud albedo driven by increases in cloud droplet number (Nd) (the first indirect effect) is confidently negative and has narrowed its probable range in the last decade, but the sign and strength of forcing associated with changes in cloud macrophysics in response to aerosol (aerosol-cloud adjustments) remain uncertain. This uncertainty reflects our inability to accurately quantify variability not associated with a causal link flowing from the cloud microphysical state to the cloud macrophysical state. Once variability associated with meteorology has been removed, covariance between the liquid water path (LWP) averaged across cloudy and clear regions (here characterizing the macrophysical state) and Nd (characterizing the microphysical) is the sum of two causal pathways linking Nd to LWP: Nd altering LWP (adjustments) and precipitation scavenging aerosol and thus depleting Nd. Only the former term is relevant to constraining adjustments, but disentangling these terms in observations is challenging. We hypothesize that the diversity of constraints on aerosol-cloud adjustments in the literature may be partly due to not explicitly characterizing covariance flowing from cloud to aerosol and aerosol to cloud. Here, we restrict our analysis to the regime of extratropical clouds outside of low-pressure centers associated with cyclonic activity. Observations from MAC-LWP (Multisensor Advanced Climatology of Liquid Water Path) and MODIS are compared to simulations in the Met Office Unified Model (UM) GA7.1 (the atmosphere model of HadGEM3-GC3.1 and UKESM1). The meteorological predictors of LWP are found to be similar between the model and observations. There is also agreement with previous literature on cloud-controlling factors finding that increasing stability, moisture, and sensible heat flux enhance LWP, while increasing subsidence and sea surface temperature decrease it. A simulation where cloud microphysics are insensitive to changes in Nd is used to characterize covariance between Nd and LWP that is induced by factors other than aerosolcloud adjustments. By removing variability associated with meteorology and scavenging, we infer the sensitivity of LWP to changes in Nd. Application of this technique to UM GA7.1 simulations reproduces the true model adjustment strength. Observational constraints developed using simulated covariability not induced by adjustments and observed covariability between Nd and LWP predict a 25 %-30 % overestimate by the UM GA7.1 in LWP change and a 30 %-35 % overestimate in associated radiative forcing.

TI  - External validation of a prognostic model based on total tumor load of sentinel lymph node for early breast cancer patients
T2  - BREAST CANCER RESEARCH AND TREATMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Background A prognostic model based on the results of molecular analysis of sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) is needed to replace the information that staging the entire axilla provided. The aim of the study is to conduct an external validation of a previously developed model for the prediction of 5-year DFS in a group of breast cancer patients that had undergone SLN biopsy assessed by the One Step Nucleic Acid Amplification (OSNA) method. Methods We collected retrospective data of 889 patients with breast cancer, who had not received systemic treatment before surgery, and who underwent SLN biopsy and evaluation of all SLN by OSNA. The discrimination ability of the model was assessed by the area under the ROC curve (AUC ROC), and its calibration by comparing 5-years DFS Kaplan-Meier estimates in quartile groups of model predicted probabilities (MPP). Results The AUC ROC ranged from 0.78 (at 2 years) to 0.73 (at 5 years) in the training set, and from 0.78 to 0.71, respectively, in the validation set. The MPP allowed to distinguish four groups of patients with heterogeneous DFS (log-rank test p < 0.0001). In the highest risk group, the HR were 6.04 [95% CI 2.70, 13.48] in the training set and 4.79 [2.310, 9.93] in the validation set. Conclusions The model for the prediction of 5-year DFS was successfully validated using the most stringent form of validation, in centers different from those involved in the development of the model. The external validation of the model confirms its utility for the prediction of 5-year DFS and the usefulness of the TTL value as a prognostic variable.

TI  - Image texture indices and trend analysis for forest disturbance assessment under wood harvest regimes
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective disturbance indices for Hyrcanian forests in Kheyroud, Nowshahr, Iran were determined. The study area was divided into landscape mosaics based on ecosystem parameters including profile type, slope and elevation. Co-occurrence texture indices were derived as forest disturbance factors on the first five bands of Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI images for the prevailing wood harvest disturbance regimes. These indices were screened using ten types of trend analyses and used for modeling disturbance of the harvesting regime through artificial neural networks. The results show that the selected indices can be useful in distinguishing areas with different disturbance intensities and as such, used in the context of health assessment through the health distance method. The accuracy of the health maps derived from the indices [increasing disturbance] led to give rise higher disturbance classification accuracy.

TI  - The Clinicopathological and Survival Profiles Comparison Across Primary Sites in Acral Melanoma
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The clinicopathological and survival profiles across primary sites in acral melanoma (AM) are still controversial and unclear. Methods This is a multi-center retrospective study. Clinicopathological data of AM patients diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2017 from 6 large tertiary hospitals in China were extracted. Chi square tests were used to compare basic characteristics between primary sites of sole, palm and nail bed. Melanoma-specific survival (MSS) differences based on primary sites were compared by log-rank tests and multivariate Cox regressions were used to identify prognostic factors for MSS. Results In total, 1157 AM patients were included. The sole group had a more advanced initial stage, deeper Breslow thickness, higher recurrence rate and distant metastases risk (all P < 0.05). The proportion of age < 65 years and ulceration were statistically lower in nail bed and palm groups, respectively. A total of 294 patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy and rates of positive SLN status had no statistical difference across primary sites. Among 701 patients with genetic profiles, the mutational frequency of BRAF, C-KIT, and PDGFRA were similar except for NRAS (higher in sole group, P = 0.0102). The median MSS of sole, nail bed and palm patients were 65.0 months, 112.0 months, and not reached, respectively (log-rank P = 0.0053). In multivariate analyses, primary site, initial stage, ulceration and recurrence were the prognostic factors for MSS in overall population, but the statistical significance varied over primary sites. Conclusions Substantial clinicopathological and survival heterogeneities exist across different primary sites in the AM population. Sole melanoma has worse prognosis compared with palm and nail bed subtypes.

TI  - Quilting suture is better than conventional suture with drain in preventing seroma formation at pectoral area after mastectomy
T2  - BMC SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundThe aim of this study was to compare quilting suture with conventional suture on the formation of seroma at pectoral area after mastectomy (ME) with sentinel lymph nodes biopsy (SLN) or axillary lymph nodes dissection (ALND) for breast cancer.MethodsTwo hundred thirty-five consecutive breast cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed. The primary outcome was the incidence of Grade 2 or Grade 3 seroma at anterior pectoral area within 1 month postoperatively. We categorized seroma into early or late seroma according to the drainage removal time. Cox regression was used for analysis.ResultsThe incidence of Grade 2 and 3 seroma was significantly higher in the conventional suture group compared with that in the quilting suture group (19.3% vs. 9.5%, p=0.032), which was attributed to the late seroma in Grade 2 and 3. Quilting suture was associated with longer time for fixing flaps compared with that of conventional suture (504.7s vs. 109.1s, p<0.001), but with less volume of drainage. Old age, high body mass index and conventional suture were independently risk factors for Grade 2 and 3 seroma.ConclusionsQuilting suture decreased the incidence of Grade 2 and 3 seroma at pectoral area within 1 month after mastectomy, especially the late seroma in Grade 2 and 3.

TI  - Relational inquiry approach for developing deeper awareness of patient suffering
T2  - NURSING ETHICS
M3  - Article
AB  - To practice compassion, the recognition, understanding, and alleviation of patient suffering are of utmost importance. Nursing literature provides ample guidance about the nature and meaning and patients' views about compassion and physical and psychological suffering. However, missing is the discussion about how nurses can achieve a deeper awareness of patients' suffering to practice compassion. This paper aims to describe the relational inquiry nursing approach and illustrate how this approach can enable nurses to develop a deeper awareness of patient suffering. The relational inquiry approach encompasses two components: a relational consciousness and inquiry as a form of action. Relational consciousness requires the nurses to focus on the concrete situations and relationships as well as recognize the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and contextual factors affecting the situations. The interpersonal factors are among and between the individuals, intrapersonal factors are within the individuals, and contextual factors are the hidden factors influencing the individuals and situations. Inquiry as an action requires a critical analysis of the experiences of individuals, situational contexts, and knowledge to inform the nursing care modalities and actions. This approach encourages nurses to use the philosophies of hermeneutic phenomenology, critical theory, and pragmatism. The phenomenological worldview allows nurses to interpret their own and patients' experiences, the critical theory worldview allows nurses to examine the influence of social and cultural factors, and pragmatism allows nurses to question their prior knowledge and develop new knowledge in each situation. The relational inquiry approach allows nurses to develop a deeper understanding of patient suffering through building a therapeutic and trustworthy relationship, active listening, focusing on the details, and engaging in broad and situations specific inquiries to understand the patient narrative of suffering. Two case exemplars are shared to demonstrate how relational inquiry allowed nurses to move beyond recognizing physical suffering and understand patients' emotional and psychological suffering.

TI  - Verification of the regional atmospheric model CCLM v5.0 with conventional data and lidar measurements in Antarctica
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The nonhydrostatic regional climate model CCLM was used for a long-term hindcast run (2002-2016) for the Weddell Sea region with resolutions of 15 and 5 km and two different turbulence parametrizations. CCLM was nested in ERA-Interim data and used in forecast mode (suite of consecutive 30 h long simulations with 6 h spin-up). We prescribed the sea ice concentration from satellite data and used a thermodynamic sea ice model. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of temperature and wind using data from Antarctic stations, automatic weather stations (AWSs), an operational forecast model and reanalyses data, and lidar wind profiles. For the reference run we found a warm bias for the near-surface temperature over the Antarctic Plateau. This bias was removed in the second run by adjusting the turbulence parametrization, which results in a more realistic representation of the surface inversion over the plateau but resulted in a negative bias for some coastal regions. A comparison with measurements over the sea ice of the Weddell Sea by three AWS buoys for 1 year showed small biases for temperature around +/- 1K and for wind speed of 1ms(-1). Comparisons of radio soundings showed a model bias around 0 and a RMSE of 1-2K for temperature and 3-4 ms(-1) for wind speed. The comparison of CCLM simulations at resolutions down to 1 km with wind data from Doppler lidar measurements during December 2015 and January 2016 yielded almost no bias in wind speed and a RMSE of ca. 2ms(-1). Overall CCLM shows a good representation of temperature and wind for the Weddell Sea region. Based on these encouraging results, CCLM at high resolution will be used for the investigation of the regional climate in the Antarctic and atmosphere-ice-ocean interactions processes in a forthcoming study.

TI  - Near-real-time spatiotemporal analysis of convection and extreme rainfall leading to a flash flood using MSG-SEVIRI and TRMM data: A case study of a flash flood in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia on the November 25, 2009
T2  - JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper describes a convective system, which brought heavy rainfall leading towards a flash flood on November 25, 2009, over Jeddah city and its surrounding regions. Meteosat Second Generation Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) based near-real-time MSG-RGB (red, green, blue) composites and cloud top temperature images are used for the assessment of convection stages during the event. Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data is used to quantify the rainfall amount and found reliable as compared with ground observations. Air mass RGB serves as an effective tool for the visual enhancement of cumulonimbus (Cb) clouds as well as differentiating them from other local features. Cloud top temperatures obtained from MSG IR10.8 channel show that the threshold values of cloud top below 220 degrees K can lead to rainfall with the intensity of 10 mm/hr or above over Jeddah region. The results from MSG-SEVIRI and TRMM satellite data show that satellite data could serve as an effective tool for the near real-time monitoring of the rainfall event, when analysing convection stages. The study suggests that where ground measurements are minimal, satellite information can be used in as part of a flood warning system to minimise the aftermaths of a flood disaster.

TI  - Shoreline position change and the relationship to annual and interannual meteo-oceanographic conditions in Southeastern Brazil
T2  - ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Historical satellite imagery datasets are commonly used to map coastal behavior over time while correlating it with concurrent meteo-oceanographic conditions. Thus, this study evaluates the shoreline position changes over 60 km of Rio de Janeiro southern coast (SE Brazil) using the integrated analysis of Landsat imagery (Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI sensors) and a time series extracted from the WaveWatch III (WW3) model spanning the 1986-2018 period. This first study conducted in the area between the Marambaia barrier island and RecreioBarra da Tijuca beaches aims to correlate morphological changes with wind wave climatology over a 30-year span. The verified interannual variability was particularly correlated with more energetic storm events and coastal erosion during La Nina years. These results agree with and reinforce previous conclusions highlighting an important teleconnection pattern that affects Southern hemisphere beaches. Overall, 18% of the coastline is under erosion, 52% is stable and 30% is advancing, values close to the global average. Moreover, the applied methodology can be easily replicated in any sandy coast around the world, especially where in situ observations are scarce, becoming an important tool for studying complex coastal systems.

TI  - Household presentation of acute gastroenteritis in a primary care sentinel network: retrospective database studies
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundAcute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a highly transmissible condition spreading rapidly between individuals and within households. Rotavirus vaccination was introduced in the UK in 2013. The study objectives were to investigate how acute gastroenteritis incidence changed over 25years and household incidence of AGE since 2013.MethodsRepeated cross-sectional study of Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre network. We used a negative binomial model to report incidence rate ratio (IRR) using the last 5 years data. We also conducted a retrospective cohort analysis, using a shared gamma frailty model (2013-2017). We explored the impact of child under 5- years, household size, socioeconomic status quintile, and rurality.ResultsIn the cross-sectional analysis, the IRR of AGE in households with a child of under 5years was 12.20 (95%CI 11.08-13.45-, p <0.001) compared with households without; the IRR fell across IMD quintiles, for example there is a 37% decrease in incidence comparing IMD quintile 1 to quintile 5 (95%CI -0.52-0.76, p <0.001),The cohort study revealed that the presence of an under 5 in the household was associated with a higher risk of household presentation (HR=6.29, 95% CI 5.61-7.06, p <0.001). In addition, we observe a reduction in risk of presentation from the most to the least deprived socioeconomic quintile (second quintile: HR=0.74 (95%CI 0.59-0.92), to least deprived quintile, HR=0.55 (95%CI 0.41-0.74). We saw a lower association with male gender, white ethnicity and living outside London, but an increased association with increasing household size.ConclusionsThe incidence of AGE has changed over time: pre-school children, larger households, and living in London were associated with higher rates, and male gender and higher economic status associated with lower rates.

TI  - Evaluating the impact of the weather conditions on the influenza propagation
T2  - BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Predicting the details of how an epidemic evolves is highly valuable as health institutions need to better plan towards limiting the infection propagation effects and optimizing their prediction and response capabilities. Simulation is a cost- and time-effective way of predicting the evolution of the infection as the joint influence of many different factors: interaction patterns, personal characteristics, travel patterns, meteorological conditions, previous vaccination, etc. The work presented in this paper extends EpiGraph, our influenza epidemic simulator, by introducing a meteorological model as a modular component that interacts with the rest of EpiGraph's modules to refine our previous simulation results. Our goal is to estimate the effects of changes in temperature and relative humidity on the patterns of epidemic influenza based on data provided by the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS) and the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). Methods Our meteorological model is based on the regression model developed by AB and JS, and it is tuned with influenza surveillance data obtained from SISSS. After pre-processing this data to clean it and reconstruct missing samples, we obtain new values for the reproduction number of each urban region in Spain, every 10 minutes during 2011. We simulate the propagation of the influenza by setting the date of the epidemic onset and the initial influenza-illness rates for each urban region. Results We show that the simulation results have the same propagation shape as the weekly influenza rates as recorded by SISSS. We perform experiments for a realistic scenario based on actual meteorological data from 2010-2011, and for synthetic values assumed under simplified predicted climate change conditions. Results show that a diminishing relative humidity of 10% produces an increment of about 1.6% in the final infection rate. The effect of temperature changes on the infection spread is also noticeable, with a decrease of 1.1% per extra degree.Conclusions: Using a tool like ours could help predict the shape of developing epidemics and its peaks, and would permit to quickly run scenarios to determine the evolution of the epidemic under different conditions. We make EpiGraph source code and epidemic data publicly available.

TI  - External Electric Field-Phenyl interaction boosts hydrosilylation of substituted alkynes to α-vinylsilane
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - The hydrosilylation of terminal alkyne is the most straightforward and atom-economy method to generate alpha-vinylsilane. In the present paper, the acetylene and phenylacetylene hydrosilylation reactions were firstly studied by imposing external electric field (EEF) as a catalyst at the level of omega B97XD/TZVP. The results demonstrated that the oriented negative FY direction is the optimal direction, which mostly reduced the reaction barriers. Further computations indicated that the larger the EEF, the lower the barrier. When the EEF was increased to 180 (10(-4)) au, the barrier height of acetylene hydrosilylation (path Q) reduced almost 20 kcal/mol. To be surprised, as the phenyl substitute used, the hydrosilylation reaction (path FQ) was largely accelerated with the barrier height lowered to 13.2 kcal/mol, which decreased about 37 kcal/mol. Hopefully, this theoretical study would provide a guide for the experiment of the hydrosilylation of alkyne as much as possible.

TI  - Ecological types and bioindicator macrophyte species of pollution of riparian vegetation of Oued Larbaa in Taza City of Morocco
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The object of our study is devoted to the Spermatophyta of the wetlands of Oued Larbaa, the main river of the city of Taza, Morocco, and which is under strong anthropic pressure. Our work involved a floristic inventory, to define ecological types and groups of dominant plants in relation to seasonal factors and types of pollution, explaining the meaning of their presence. For this purpose, floristic sampling was carried out along the Oued during the dry periods (2017 and 2018) and the wet period (2018). A total of 66 plant species belonging to 54 genera and 30 families were identified, including 44 species during the wet period (2018) and 27 species during the dry periods (2017 and 2018). This difference is due to the favorable conditions for vegetation development during the period of precipitation and to the increase in pollution rates during the dry season. The inventoried flora shows the dominance of 10 ecological types characterized by the following plants: Cynodon dactylon, Arundo donax, Olea europaea, and Tamarix gallica (common between the two periods); Dittrichia viscosa, Visnaga daucoides, Typha angustifolia, and Ricinus communis (during the dry periods of 2017 and 2018); and Juncus maritimus and Populus nigra (during the wet period of 2018). The ecological types identified in this work decrease from the dry season to the rainy season, while specific richness increases. These dominant plants are all considered as bioindicators of the presence of heavy metals.

TI  - Fertility-Sparing Surgery Using Knitted TiNi Mesh Implants and Sentinel Lymph Nodes: A 10-Year Experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF INVESTIGATIVE SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: The aim of this cohort study is to improve the procedure of fertility-sparing surgery and to assess oncological and reproductive follow-up outcomes after radical trachelectomy (RT) for cervical cancer (T1a2-1bNxM0). Methods: We have suggested the method combining sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) and cervicoisthmic cerclage using a superelastic knitted TiNi mesh (KTNM) implant to facilitate the primary biomechanical/retention function of the uterus. Sixty-eight consented patients, who underwent fertility-sparing surgery using both transabdominal and laparoscopic route from 2009 through 2019, were recruited in the study and prospectively followed for a mean of 69 months. Results: There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications. No cervical stenoses or mesh failures were noted in all cases. The 5-year overall and recurrence-free survival rates were 100% and 97%, respectively. Two patients indicated recurrence, it occurred in 3 and 36 months. There were 19 (28%) spontaneous pregnancies, 6 resulted in full-term delivery, whereas 2 and 11 ended in miscarriage and early abortion, respectively. Conclusions: This sparing-surgery technique is turned out to be feasible and efficient as allows to achieve well oncologic and fertility outcomes, mimicking the effect of the cervix. It complements existing surgical approaches and may provide further insight into how to overcome challenges even in aggravated cases or previously failed procedures.

TI  - Assessing cyclone disturbances (1988-2016) in the Sundarbans mangrove forests using Landsat and Google Earth Engine
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclone disturbances can cause significant damage to forest vegetation. The Sundarbans spreading across Bangladesh and India, the world's largest mangrove forest, is frequently exposed to cyclones of various magnitudes. However, the extent and pattern of forest disturbances caused by cyclones in the Sundarbans (both parts) remain poorly understood, and a long-term dataset focused on cyclones and forest disturbances is required. In this study, Google Earth Engine and Landsat images were used to evaluate changes in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) before versus after 21 cyclones that occurred between 1988 and 2016. Supervised classification successfully classified the forest area with an overall accuracy of 86% and Kappa coefficient of 0.80. The percentage of affected forest area (i.e., the area that exhibited negative changes in NDVI values following a cyclone) ranged from 0.5 to 24.1% of the total forest area. Of the 21 focal cyclones, 18 affected less than 10% of the forest area, while two cyclones, Sidr in 2007 (category H5) and a cyclone in 1988 (category H3), affected 24.1% and 20.4%, respectively. Among the cyclone parameters (i.e., maximum wind speed, distance from the Sundarbans, and river water level), wind speed was significantly and positively correlated with affected forest area. Wind speed and affected forest area were nonlinearly related indicated by the piecewise linear regression and cubic regression. The piecewise model estimated a threshold point, suggesting that wind speed had little effects below a breakpoint of 101.9 km h(-1). Our analyses, based on a 29-year dataset, suggest that, although the region experienced cyclones almost every year, only the largest cyclones (i.e., in the H3 category or higher) affected 20% or more of the mangrove forest area, and these occurred around once per 7- to 12-year period. Trees with broken stems or uprooted canopies as a result of strong winds are likely to contribute to the reduction in NDVI in the aftermath of a cyclone. From a long-term perspective, such rare yet intense cyclones may have a significant effect on regeneration and species composition in the Sundarbans mangrove forest. Since previous studies only focused on a few cyclones, our results based on 21 cyclones will certainly help better understanding of the effects of cyclones on mangrove forest disturbance.

TI  - Evaluation of quality of life, body image and surgical outcomes of robotic total laparoscopic hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node mapping in low-risk endometrial cancer patients - A Robotic Gyne Club study
T2  - ACTA OBSTETRICIA ET GYNECOLOGICA SCANDINAVICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The aims of the study were to evaluate quality of life, cosmetic results and surgical outcomes of robotic single-site and robotic multiport total laparoscopic hysterectomy with sentinel lymph node mapping in women treated for low-risk endometrial cancer.Material and methods The study is a prospective, multicenter, case-control study conducted at Ospedale Santa Chiara in Trento and Novara and Pavia University Hospitals. Seventy-six consecutive patients with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of low-risk endometrial cancer or atypical endometrial hyperplasia who between January 2017 and January 2019 had undergone robotic total laparoscopic hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node mapping were included. Data on surgical outcomes, quality of life and cosmetic results were prospectively collected and analyzed based on the surgical approach with robotic single-site vs robotic multiport assistance. Patients' clinical characteristics, intra-operative parameters, sentinel lymph node mapping results and postoperative findings were prospectively recorded. Clinical follow up was performed 4 weeks and 6 and 12 months after surgery. Fifty-one patients underwent a robotic multiport procedure and 25 patients a robotic single-site surgery.Results There was one significant difference between the two groups in terms of patient characteristics: mean body mass index (BMI) in the multiport group was 29 kg/m(2) vs 24.8 kg/m(2) in the single-site group (P value <.001). After univariate and multivariate analysis on intraoperative and postoperative findings, a shorter surgical time was observed in the single-site cohort than in the multiport group (148.7 vs 158.2 minutes, P value .0182). BMI also had a significant effect on surgical time (P = .022). No differences were seen in terms of sentinel lymph node detection: the bilateral detection rate was 96.1% for multiport (66.7% bilateral, 29.4% monolateral) and 96% for single-site (76% bilateral, 20% monolateral) procedures. No differences between the two approaches were identified with regard to postoperative complications, pain, cosmetic results or quality of life comparisons.Conclusions For the treatment of low-risk endometrial cancer and atypical endometrial hyperplasia with total hysterectomy and sentinel lymph node mapping, the robotic single-port approach is comparable to the multiport procedure in terms of intraoperative and postoperative findings, and has an advantage in terms of shorter surgical times. Further studies are required to identify possible differences in quality of life and cosmetic results.

TI  - Decumbent development: Urban sprawl in the Guwahati Metropolitan Area, India
T2  - SINGAPORE JOURNAL OF TROPICAL GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban sprawl has become a global phenomenon as an outcome of growing population and rapid urbanization. Previous studies have addressed the rising incidence of uncontrollable urban development, particularly in peri-urban areas of cities, leading to chronic urban sprawl. The city of Guwahati, a million city in north east India, has expanded significantly in recent years. In this article, the links between population and growth of built-up areas were examined using geo-spatial techniques and remotely sensed datasets. The results indicate that the sprawl has accentuated in recent years. The intensity of land use remained uneven due to marked variations in the distribution of built-up areas, plausibly an outcome of unplanned urban growth. If current trends are anything to go by, future urban sprawl could pose serious threats to the vulnerable eco-sensitive and peri-urban areas of Guwahati. Secondary cities have unfortunately received scant attention in urban policy research, and Guwahati, epitomizes urban woes in a developing country.

TI  - Evaluating the capabilities of optical/TIR imaging sensing systems for quantifying soil water content
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Review
AB  - Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is a key parameter of global energy and water cycle, and knowing its spatiotemporal variability is of key importance in an array of research topics and practical applications alike. Recent developments in Earth Observation (EO) have indicated that SSM can be retrieved from different regions of electromagnetic spectrum, and numerous approaches have been proposed to facilitate this. Herein, are reviewed the SSM retrieval techniques exploiting optical and thermal EO data, including synergistic techniques with other types of EO datasets. The challenges and limitations of EO in this respect are discussed, aiming at providing a roadmap on which future research should be directed. It is also apparent that to satisfy the requirements for SSM information for practical applications, effort should be towards the investigation of the synergistic use of EO systems in deriving SSM for water resources applications.

TI  - Wavelet and non-parametric statistical based approach for long term land cover trend analysis using time series EVI data
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover change analysis was carried out using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series data for the period 2005-2014. MODIS EVI data coupled with Quality Assessment Science Data Sets (QASDS) was de-noised with Savitzky-Golay filter while enhancing quality and preserving the temporal profile of EVI. Wavelet transform (WT) based approach along with Sen slope's method was used for land cover change and trend analysis. The WT based approach is useful for studying multiscale and non-stationary processes. Mann-Kendall test was performed to confirm the significance of the identified trends. Proposed approach identified 358 locations as change points, where 285 (79.6%) and 73 (20.4%) locations were detected as 'Change' and 'False Change' with respect to high resolution images. The proposed approach is useful for monitoring land cover changes that provide vital inputs for sustainable management of land resources.

TI  - Evaluating changes in treeline position and land surface phenology in Sikkim Himalaya
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain ecosystems of the Himalaya have warmed more rapidly in recent decades than other areas of the globe. Landscape-level delineation of treeline position and its dynamics can give insight regarding climatic variability. Landsat-2 Multispectral Scanner (MSS), Resourcesat-2 Linear Imaging Self Scanning Sensor (LISS-III) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration- Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (NOAA-AVHRR) derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was used to study the long-term treeline dynamics. The treeline has shifted vertically 301 +/- 66 m upward in 37 years at a rate of c. 81 m decade(-1). The minimum air temperature has increased at a rate of 0.3 degrees C decade(-1) (p < 0.001) depicting the favourable scenario for treeline growth in this temperature limited ecosystem. The annual cumulative precipitation has decreased at a rate of 206.5 mm decade(-1). The length of growing season (LOS) has increased and the start (SOS) and end of growing season (EOS) has got earlier in the 1977 treeline. The elevation shifts and phenological changes of the treeline were observed in the warming scenario.

TI  - InSAR based deformation mapping of earthquake using Sentinel 1A imagery
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based satellites provide remedies to major geohazards under critical situations around the world. Sentinel 1A mission with the revisit period of 12 days helps to serve the objective in an effective manner. With the availability of interferometric wide (IW) Swath mode, Sentinel 1A mission is capable of monitoring the surface deformation using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) techniques. On 12 November 2017, an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.3 occurred in the Iran/Iraq border lead to the enormous disaster reaching over 500 victims. The study focuses on measuring the deformation caused due to earthquakes by using differential SAR interferometry (DInSAR). VV polarization of Sentinel Data and SRTM DEM are used as an input to GMTSAR for the development of interferogram. Based on the results obtained, it is found that a maximum of 85.1 cm deformation occurred and nearly 1500 km(2) of the area is severely affected.

TI  - Monitoring of landslide activity at the Sirobagarh landslide, Uttarakhand, India, using LiDAR, SAR interferometry and geodetic surveys
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A robust geodetic framework comprising Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Robotic Total Station (RTS) and Multi-temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) was employed first in India to investigate a landslide-prone Sirobagarh region, Uttarakhand, at different spatial extents, and to evaluate the relationship amongst the displacement estimates obtained from the applied surveying techniques. TLS derived digital elevation models indicated displacements >5 m on the landslide upper scarp. GNSS- and RTS-based observations showed horizontal movements towards the Alaknanda river in the landslide slope direction (maximum values: 0.1305 and 0.045 m, respectively), and downward vertical motion (largest subsidence magnitude: -2.1315 and -0.030 m, respectively). MT-InSAR processing of Sentinel-1a images identified 21071 measurement pixels, highlighting subsidence around the landslide (mean velocity range: -0.110 to 0.008 m/year). Analysis of displacement vectors using vector equality, cross-covariance, cross-correlation and principal component analysis reveals that GNSS vertical displacement estimates were partially correlated with MT-InSAR measurements (correlated for epoch difference 2-3), whereas there was good cross-correlation between MT-InSAR and LiDAR observations throughout. The displacement estimates and their analyses evident unstable movement of the landslide scarp occurring due to debris flow and rainfall, and a relatively moderate subsidence activity in the surrounding areas lying in the landslide zone.

TI  - Development of spatial decision-making for groundwater recharge suitability assessment by considering geoinformatics and field data
T2  - ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessment of groundwater conditions particularly its potential for sustainable groundwater management is a major concern for agriculture, domestic, and industrial water security. The rapid growth in population and urbanization impose to the high demand of water for drinking as well as for irrigation propose in quaternary aquifers in Ganga Plains and over-exploitation of groundwater resources for drinking and irrigation purpose causes a high rate of water level depletion in Ganga plains. The aim of the present work to develop the integrated groundwater recharges potential using geographical information system (GIS) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) techniques. The important biophysical and hydrogeological factors influencing the groundwater recharge considered are hydrogeomorphology, geology, LULC, depth to water level, rainfall, soil texture, NDVI, and slope. Thereafter, all the parameters were integrated into a GIS environment for developing the groundwater recharge suitability assessment. Multicriteria decision-making model used to develop the groundwater recharge suitability maps and classified into four zones with varying spatial coverage from very high (15%), high (63%), moderate (20%), and poor (2%). The groundwater recharge suitability zones were also validated with actual bore well yield data of the study area for each recharge suitability zones. Results of integrated geoinformatics and spatial decision-making techniques are a very useful scientific tool for groundwater recharge assessment of Indo-Gangetic Plains for assessment of suitable recharge techniques and locations for future groundwater sustainability and action plan.

TI  - Accelerated dryland expansion regulates future variability in dryland gross primary production
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Drylands cover 41% of Earth's surface and are the largest source of interannual variability in the global carbon sink. Drylands are projected to experience accelerated expansion over the next century, but the implications of this expansion on variability in gross primary production (GPP) remain elusive. Here we show that by 2100 total dryland GPP will increase by 12 +/- 3% relative to the 2000-2014 baseline. Because drylands will largely expand into formerly productive ecosystems, this increase in dryland GPP may not increase global GPP. Further, GPP per unit dryland area will decrease as degradation of historical drylands outpaces the higher GPP of expanded drylands. Dryland expansion and climate-induced conversions among sub-humid, semi-arid, arid, and hyper-arid subtypes will lead to substantial changes in regional and subtype contributions to global dryland GPP variability. Our results highlight the vulnerability of dryland subtypes to more frequent and severe climate extremes and suggest that regional variations will require different mitigation strategies.

T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Article
M3  - Data Paper
AB  - This paper describes how a validated semi-empirical, but physiologically based, remote sensing model - Ensemble_all - was up-scaled using MODIS land surface temperature data (MOD11C2), enhanced vegetation indices (MOD13C1) and land-cover data (MCD12C1) to produce a global terrestrial ecosystem respiration data set (Reco) for January 2001-December 2010. The temporal resolution of this data set is 1 month, the spatial resolution is 0.05 degrees, and the range is from 55 degrees S to 65 degrees N and 180 degrees W to 180 degrees E (crop and natural vegetation mosaic is not included). After cross-validating our data set using in-situ observations as well as Reco outputs from an empirical variable_Q10 model, a LPJ_S1 process model and a machine learning method model, we found that our data set performed well in detecting both temporal and spatial patterns in Reco's simulation in most ecosystems across the world. This data set can be found at .

TI  - A time series of land cover maps of South Asia from 2001 to 2015 generated using AVHRR GIMMS NDVI3g data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In South Asia, key differences in annual land use and land cover (LULC) take place due to climate change, global warming, human activity, biodiversity, and hydrology. So, it is very important to get accurate land cover information for this region. An annual LULC map that covers a comprehensive period is a major dataset for climatologically study. While yearly worldwide maps of LULC are produced from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) dataset, in 2001, the first LULC map of MODIS is generated which restrictions the perspective climatologically analysis. This research work generated a time series of yearly LULC maps of South Asia from 2001 to 2015 by using random forest classification from AVHRR GIMMS NDVI3g data. The MODIS land cover product such as (MCD12Q1) was used as a reference data for the trained classifier. The result was validated by using time series of annual LULC maps, and the spatiotemporal dynamic of LULC maps was illustrated in the last 15 years from 2001 to 2015. The simplified sixteen class versions of our 15-year overall accuracy of a land cover map are 86.70%, and 1.23% higher than that of MODIS maps. The change detection indicated that, for the last 15 years, the class of closed shrublands, savannas, croplands, urban and built-up land, barren, and cropland per natural vegetation mosaics increase notably during the 2001 to 2015, and in contrast, the class of woody savannas, evergreen needleleaf forests, open shrublands, grasslands, mixed forests, permanent wetlands, permanent snow and ice, evergreen broadleaf forests, and water bodies decrease notably during 2001 to 2015. These yearly land cover maps will be an essential dataset for the upcoming climate study, where time series of LULC maps accessibility is restricted.

TI  - Analysis of various optimizers on deep convolutional neural network model in the application of hyperspectral remote sensing image classification
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification is a most challenging task in hyperspectral remote sensing field due to unique characteristics of HSI data. It consists of huge number of bands with strong correlations in the spectral and spatial domains. Moreover, limited training samples make it more challenging. To address such problems, we have presented here a spatial feature extraction technique using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for HSI classification. As optimizer plays an important role in learning process of deep CNN model, we have presented the effect of seven different optimizers on our deep CNN model in the application of HSI classification. The seven different optimizers used in this study are SGD, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop, Adam, AdaMax, and Nadam. Extensive experimental results on four hyperspectral remote sensing data sets have been presented which demonstrate the superiority of the presented deep CNN model with Adam optimizer for HSI classification.

TI  - Neoliberal governmentality in global English textbooks
T2  - CLASSROOM DISCOURSE
M3  - Article
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the growing body of literature critically analysing the relation between neoliberalism and the global English Language Teaching (ELT) textbook with a new perspective. In this study, neoliberalism is regarded not only as an economic policy paradigm, but especially in a Foucauldian way, as a form of governmentality, with its emphasis on the responsibilisation of the self and the creation of a certain kind of subjectivity, related to the entrepreneurial-consumerist concept of society. The paper examines two best-selling global UK-produced English language textbooks. I develop a qualitative content analysis to explore in which way and to what extent these textbooks reflect, legitimate and reproduce neoliberal governmentality. The findings of the analysis suggest that the global ELT textbook not only presents a particular neoliberal worldview as common sense, but also encourages students to implement techniques of self-government to become entrepreneurial individuals and responsible consumers. In light of that, the paper concludes by arguing that the global ELT textbook may be regarded as a tool to extend and support the expansion of neoliberal governmentality in today's society.

TI  - Technetium-Radiolabeled Mannose-Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles as Nanoprobes for Sentinel Lymph Node Detection
T2  - MOLECULES
M3  - Article
AB  - Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) are considered valuable nanomaterials for the design of radiolabeled nanoprobes for single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Radiolabeled and functionalized AuNPs could improve lymphatic mapping by enhancing the radioactive signaling of individual particles in the sentinel node. In this study, an alternative method for functionalizing commercial AuNps with mannose is described. The chemical derivatization and biofunctionalization of AuNPs were performed with lipoic acid and mannose, respectively. Several levels of mannose were tested; the thiolate hydrazinonicotinamide-glycine-glycine-cysteine (HYNIC) molecule was also used for Tc-99m radiolabeling. Physicochemical characterization of this system includes U-V spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy. The most stable nanoprobe, in terms of the aggregation, radiolabeling efficiency, and purity, was tested in a sentinel lymph node model in a rat by microSPECT/computed tomography (CT) imaging. The SPECT images revealed that Tc-99m-radiolabeled AuNPs functionalized with mannose can track and accumulate in lymph nodes in a similar way to the commercial Tc-99m-Sulfur colloid, commonly used in clinical practice for sentinel lymph node detection. These promising results support the idea that Tc-99m-AuNPs-mannose could be used as a SPECT contrast agent for lymphatic mapping.

TI  - Habitat suitability modelling to predict the spatial distribution of cold-water coral communities affected by the <i>Deepwater Horizon</i> oil spill
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim The Deepwater Horizon disaster resulted in the largest accidental marine oil spill in history and caused extensive injury to deep-sea habitats, including cold-water coral communities dominated by Paramuricea species. One of the primary difficulties in assessing the full extent of the injury to cold-water coral ecosystems is the extreme paucity of observational data and the subsequent lack of knowledge of their distribution within the affected region. The aim of this study was to use habitat suitability modelling to estimate the number of potentially affected Paramuricea sp. corals across the northern Gulf of Mexico.Location Northern Gulf of Mexico.Taxon Cold-water corals in the genus Paramuricea.Methods High-resolution (12.5 m) models were built using the maximum entropy (Maxent) approach using remotely sensed data including seafloor topography, seismic reflectivity, temperature and the amount of productivity exported from the surface. Model outputs were used to estimate the number of potential coral sites in the northern Gulf of Mexico, delineated as areas with both high habitat suitability scores and the presence of hard substrate. The number of coral sites was further adjusted using a ground-truthing procedure using autonomous underwater vehicle-transect data.Results Across the entire study area in the northern Gulf of Mexico, there were 558 predicted coral sites, covering an area of 14.2 km(2). Within a 2,291 km(2) region shown to have been directly affected by the spill and subsequent oil plume, there were 66 predicted coral sites covering an area of 1.2 km(2) with an average of 63 corals per site.Main Conclusions Our results indicate that the magnitude of injury stemming from the spill was likely far higher than previously known, and will help quantify the full extent of the losses incurred as well as prioritize disturbed areas for future research and restoration efforts.

TI  - Monitoring subway construction using Sentinel-1 data: a case study in Bucharest, Romania
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In Bucharest, new subway tunnels are under construction since 2011. The whole project of extending Bucharest underground infrastructure is due to be finished by 2030. The M-5 artery has been under construction since 2011 and ongoing. In December 2015, dewatering procedures in one of the metro stations caused serious damage to the surface infrastructure above, which subsided and partially collapsed in some locations. This paper relies on multi-temporal interferometry techniques to characterize displacement patterns of the ground surface above M-5 beltway between 2014 and 2018, and presents the capacity of Sentinel-1 satellite imagery to detect potential hazards in urban environments. Two stacks of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired between October 2014 and October 2018 by the Sentinel-1 A and B satellites on ascending and descending orbits have been processed using the Delft Persistent Scatterer Interferometry algorithm (DePSI). The results indicate atypical acceleration in velocities starting in November 2015, prior to the described events, and manifesting until April 2016, when the ground was completely stabilized. The displacement trends and velocity values in the area of the Eroilor underground station were successfully validated using the ground-based Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) technique.

TI  - Quad-pol reconstruction from compact polarimetry using a fully convolutional network
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The compact polarimetry (CP) mode of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has attracted significant attention in recent years due to its lower energy budget, reduced data volume and larger swath width. In this paper, the possibility and practicability of a fully convolutional network (FCN) for quad-pol reconstruction from CP SAR data are explored. A 5-Dimension normalized input vector is designed to fully represent the CP covariance matrix. The proposed FCN consists of 11 feature extraction layers and one regression layer. Among them, 11 feature extraction layers have increased receptive fields for extracting spatial features and one regression layer for outputting reconstructed values. By introducing the residual connection and the batch normalization algorithm, the structure is deepened and the training speed is accelerated. The experiments are carried out on six Chinese Gaofen-3 quad-polarimetric SAR datasets, and the results show that the proposed method has higher accuracy than the existing reconstruction algorithms with good generalization ability.

TI  - HIV risk behavior and HIV testing among rural and urban men who have sex with men in Zhejiang Province, China: A respondent-driven sampling study
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Review
AB  - BackgroundCurrently, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) sentinel surveillance among men who have sex with men (MSM) in China conducted in large and medium-sized cities, and no HIV sentinel surveillance conducted in rural areas. HIV testing and intervention is predominantly conducted in urban areas, there have been a limited number of studies in rural areas MSM, it is necessary to conduct the investigation of HIV risk sexual behavior, HIV testing among rural and urban MSM.MethodBetween December 2013 and August 2015, a cross-sectional study was conducted in rural and urban areas in Zhejiang Province using respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Participants completed face-to-face interviewer-administered questionnaire surveys and were tested for HIV.ResultsA total of 710 MSM participants were recruited, of whom 36.1% were from rural areas. The overall HIV prevalence was 16.6%, and was considerably lower among MSM living in rural areas (3.9%) than those living in urban areas (24.2%). 61.1% participants had not condom use with male sexual behavior in the past 6 months (86.7% in rural areas and 46.7% in urban areas). The social demographic and behavioral characteristics had significance difference among rural and urban MSM. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that, compared to men living in urban areas, MSM living in rural areas MSM were more likely to use dating apps to find sexual partners, were more likely to engage in bisexual behavior, and had lower condom use. 43.0% participants had been tested for HIV in the past year (41.8% in rural areas and 43.6% in urban areas). Multivariate logistic regression also revealed that among participants living in rural areas, having rural health insurance and not accepting HIV intervention were associated with lower HIV testing rates, while a higher monthly income and through use of internet to find sexual partner were associated with higher rates of HIV testing.ConclusionHigh risk behavior was prevalent, and HIV testing rates were low among MSM living in rural areas compare to urban areas in Zhejiang Province, therefore, preventative intervention measures should be immediately among rural MSM urgently to reduce HIV transmission and to promote HIV testing.

TI  - Comparison of three remotely sensed drought indices for assessing the impact of drought on winter wheat yield
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Agricultural drought threatens food security. Numerous remote-sensing drought indices have been developed, but their different principles, assumptions and physical quantities make it necessary to compare their suitability for drought monitoring over large areas. Here, we analyzed the performance of three typical remote sensing-based drought indices for monitoring agricultural drought in two major agricultural production regions in Shaanxi and Henan provinces, northern China (predominantly rain-fed and irrigated agriculture, respectively): vegetation health index (VHI), temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and drought severity index (DSI). We compared the agreement between these indices and the standardized precipitation index (SPI), soil moisture, winter wheat yield and National Meteorological Drought Monitoring (NMDM) maps. On average, DSI outperformed the other indices, with stronger correlations with SPI and soil moisture. DSI also corresponded better with soil moisture and NMDM maps. The jointing and grain-filling stages of winter wheat are more sensitive to water stress, indicating that winter wheat required more water during these stages. Moreover, the correlations between the drought indices and SPI, soil moisture, and winter wheat yield were generally stronger in Shaanxi province than in Henan province, suggesting that remote-sensing drought indices provide more accurate predictions of the impacts of drought in predominantly rain-fed agricultural areas.

TI  - Remote Sensing approach to evaluate anthropogenic influences on Forest Cover of Palamau Tiger Reserve, Eastern India
T2  - ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Tropical forests have been experiencing remarkable rates of transformation over the past century as they are getting degraded or decimated to a great extent by anthropogenic activities. This study aims at investigating the long-term forest cover transformation in Palamau Tiger Reserve (PTR), Jharkhand, India, using Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI satellite images during 1975-2015. The forest cover was delineated utilizing various keys of visual interpretation techniques. Results The forest cover was primarily decreased in the north-eastern and north-western parts in PTR. In order to identify the anthropogenic disturbance in the forest reserve, human settlement density was mapped using high-resolution Google Earth imagery. The results showed a positive correlation between human population density and settlement density. Five major affected sites with an outer buffer of 2 km were demarcated in order to deduce the anthropogenic influences in major non-forested sites in PTR. It was observed that the forest change was maximum at site 3 (Ranidah, area 61.06 km(2), - 6.47% change) followed by site 2 (Saidup, area 124.38 km(2), - 7.65% change), where settlement units were also high (2638 and 2621 settlement units, respectively). At site 1 (Barkheta, area 81.59 km(2)), - 1.99% change was observed, and at site 4 (Samadh Tola, area 9.15 km(2)), 1.03% change was observed having moderate settlement units (2422 and 1892 settlement units, respectively). Areas with the low level of human settlements (1038 settlement units) observed the least change, i.e., at site 5 (Netarhat, area 48.52 km(2)), 0.58% change was observed mainly during the years. Conclusions The forest cover exhibited an overall decrease of 14.55 km(2) (- 1.34% change) with episodic variation during 1975-2015 in PTR, Eastern India. A significant forest disturbance occurred primarily in the north-eastern and north-western parts of PTR along the forest fringe due to the high population and settlement density. The study highlighted the potential use of freely available multi-temporal satellite observations in forest management.

TI  - Evaluating the potential of CubeSats for remote sensing reflectance retrieval over inland waters
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing plays an important role in the monitoring of inland waters. Recently, Cubesats have become an alternative data source for studies that require high spatiotemporal resolutions. However, the radiometric quality of those data was never evaluated for inland water studies. This letter presents the experimental results to assess the quality of the Remote Sensing Reflectance (R-rs) from commercial PlanetScope (PS) CubeSat constellation. The radiometric assessment was performed using in situ R-rs measured at 37 field stations on distinct lakes across Lower Amazon Floodplain. In turbid lakes, PS bands presented R-rs accuracy of 46% for all VNIR bands (coefficient of determination (R-2) = 0.56), while in clear water lakes the results were not satisfactory (R-2 = 0.08). Furthermore, results showed a spectral dependence in the quality of R-rs retrievals for the turbid lakes, with sounder metrics in visible bands (red band: R-2 = 0.83). Finally, there is a high correlation between water quality parameters (sediments concentration and Secchi Depth) and PS R-rs at the red band (R-2 > 0.74). Although PS images are mostly designed for land applications, the results suggest that the radiometric quality is sufficient for the monitoring of fine-scale mixing processes between river waters and floodplain lakes.

TI  - Data-driven anticipatory governance. Emerging scenarios in <i>data for policy</i> practices
T2  - POLICY DESIGN AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The contemporary technological advancements in information and communication technologies (ICT) enable the employment of non-traditional data sources (e.g. satellite data, sensors, cell phone networks data, social media, etc.) in different aspects of the public sphere. Datafication is changing the relationship between governments and citizens, and the way governments address policy problems. Nowadays, policy-makers are urged to harness data for policies and public service design, while answering at the same time the demand for citizen engagement; as a consequence, innovative government/governance models appeared to connect these two instances. Although it is not a new concept, the model of Anticipatory Governance is particularly worth considering in light of contemporary data availability. Predictive analytics based on data increasingly realizes predictions for public action, although it presents many controversial implications (e.g. the epistemology of data evidence, public trust and privacy). In this article, we address Anticipatory Governance models emerging from data used in futures thinking and policy-making. To understand this phenomenon, we will briefly retrace current paradigms of futures thinking and Anticipatory Governance concerning policy-making, specifying the contemporary perspective design has on these topics. Then, we identify the use of data in futures thinking practices through a systematic literature search. Finally, we will address the challenges and implications of designing data-driven Anticipatory Governance by portraying three scenarios supported by real cases of data for policy-making.

TI  - Dynamic modelling of rice leaf area index with quad-source optical imagery and machine learning regression models
T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical satellite imagery has been widely used to monitor leaf area index (LAI). However, most studies have focussed on single- or dual-source data, thus making little use of a growing repository of freely available optical imagery. Hence this study has evaluated the feasibility of quad-source optical satellite imagery involving Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A, China's environment satellite constellation (HJ-1 A and B) and Gaofen-1 (GF-1) in modelling rice green LAI over a test site located in southeast China at two growing seasons. With the application of machine learning regression models including Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN) and Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), results indicated that regression models based on an ensemble of decision trees (RF and GBDT) were more suitable for modelling rice green LAI. The current study has demonstrated the feasibility of quad-source optical imagery in modelling rice green LAI and this is relevant for cloudy areas.

T2  - HTS TEOLOGIESE STUDIES-THEOLOGICAL STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article aims to understand the concept of work in the teachings of Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Hacohen Kook (1865-1935). As the person who had the maximum impact on the religious Zionist sector, with its guiding principle of Torah va'avodah, meaning Torah and work, it is necessary to clarify his attitude towards work. Did he perceive work as a necessity, a part of one's duty to support the members of the household, or perhaps also as an ideological value, part of a worldview that combines religious values with extra-religious values, or then again maybe he perceived work as a religious value? This article shows that R. Kook's positive attitude towards work differs from traditional perspectives on work because of a pantheistic influence. Pantheism made him redefine the boundaries of Torah and include work and materiality.

TI  - An Afrocentric conceptualisation of life and immortality of values: A critical investigation on the paranormal and human dignity in southern Africa
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Many scholars across the disciplines in the humanities have overwhelmingly accepted Placide Tempels' theory of force as an authentic expression of African cosmology and cosmogony. On the other hand, the theory of force has been critiqued by other African scholars because it failed to recognise the primacy that is given to life as engendered in traditional African cosmological and cosmogonic theories. While Tempels' theory of force remains attractive as an authentic articulation of the traditional African cosmological and cosmogonic existential outlook, the argument that has been proffered by African scholars is that Tempels' concept of force should be replaced with the concept of life. In this article, I agree with critics of Tempels by arguing that life remains an all-encompassing element in the traditional African worldview and that life supervenes on the general African conceptualisation of para-existential experiences. In this regard, the phenomenon of African para-existential experiences serves as the cement that binds both the realms of the material and the spiritual. The dignity of the person is thus premised on the idea of the spiritual essence of the human soul which is ultimately enabled by the continuity of life after death.

TI  - Learning ship width and direction by convolutional neural networks without manual labelling
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Direction and width prediction have become hot topics in accurate ship location, while the resolution of remote sensing data has been increasing. In the current machine learning, demand for extensive manual labelling has become one of the biggest challenges to further improve tasks such as ship attribute prediction. To cope with this problem, in this paper, we propose a method to predict ship direction and width without manual labelling. To this end, pseudo-label generation approaches have been proposed for transfer learning with convolutional neural network (CNN). Experiments demonstrated that the pre-trained classification CNN features could preserve variational information for such attribute prediction. And the proposed pseudo-labels, which are even with limited qualities, could be efficient to train an accurate ship direction and width prediction model through fault-tolerant training by neural networks.

TI  - Vicarious calibration correction of large FOV sensor using BRDF model based on UAV angular spectrum measurements
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - When a satellite sensor with a large field of view and wide swath is calibrated, it is not easy to obtain the image when the calibration site is located precisely at the nadir position. If the location of a calibration site is at an off-nadir position in the image, calibration errors will be caused by the inconsistent observation angle between the sensor view and the ground measurement view. The bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model plays an important role in solving this problem. In this study, a BRDF measurement system based on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is developed. This system has the capability of measuring angular data with observation azimuth angle ranging from 0 deg to 360 deg with an angle interval of 30 deg, and observation zenith angle ranging from 0 deg to 50 deg with an angle interval of 10 deg. The directional data of the Dunhuang calibration site were measured using the UAV BRDF measuring system at different solar zenith and azimuth angles, and the spatiotemporal distribution characteristic of forward- and backward-scattering of Dunhuang calibration site was analyzed. A Ross-Li BRDF model, built using measurement data, is used to calculate the directional surface reflectance under any observation geometry of solar and satellite. These calculations are applied to correct the calibration data of the CBERS-04 WFI sensor. Results show that the BRDF model significantly improves the calibration accuracy, especially in the case of large observation angles. (C) The Authors.

TI  - Study of mixing ratios of SO<sub>2</sub> in a tropical rural environment in south India
T2  - JOURNAL OF EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Sulphur dioxide is a toxic pollutant in the atmosphere emitted from natural sources and human activities. Normally, SO2 has a life-time of about 2 days in the atmosphere and is not transported to long distances from its source region. However, under favourable circumstances such as low humidity or high wind speed, it can travel intercontinental distances from the point of emission. In this article, we have analysed the surface mixing-ratio of SO2 measured over the time period from January 2010 to April 2012 at a rural region in south India. It is found that SO2 mixing-ratio is very low over this region with an annual mean value in the range of 0.21-0.24 ppbv. OMI satellite estimates an annual mean value of 0.5 Dobson Units (DU) over the same location and period. However, during January to May relatively higher concentrations of SO2 are observed, mainly coming from power plants located in southern and eastern India as indicated by higher SO2/NO2 ratios of greater than 0.5. In one instance, on June 20th, 2011, it is found that the OMI SO2 value was a factor of 13 higher than 2011 annual mean at Gadanki. Using the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART) and satellite data, it is found that the observed higher SO2 value on 20th June was due to intercontinental transport of SO2 from Nabro volcanic eruption. Using the FLEXPART model with ECLIPSE-v5 emission inventory, the observed seasonal variation of SO2 could be well reproduced; however, the mixing ratios are found to be overestimated. CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) SO2 reanalysis values available through its implementation in the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System are a factor of 7.8 higher than observations, possibly due to incorrect vertical profile used in the model.

TI  - A comparison of Arctic sea ice freeboard products from Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A number of satellite altimeters have been used to measure Arctic sea ice freeboard and to study its changes over the past decades (1992-present). In order to produce long-term time series of sea ice freeboard data set, it is essential to investigate the difference and consistency between different satellite-based sea ice freeboard data sets. Hence in this study, the comparison between ice freeboard products from altimeters on board Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 is constructed from February 2017 to January 2018 excluding summer months. The comparisons of echo waveform shapes and along-track radar freeboard estimates suggest that the freeboard difference between these two sensors is caused by the signal range bin number and the chosen retrackers for different surface types (leads and sea ice floes). Monthly gridded freeboard results show that mean values of two different satellite altimeters agree each other reasonably over the whole study period. In general, Sentinel-3A data set shows lower freeboard estimates than CryoSat-2 data set, this phenomenon is found in both First-Year ice (FYI) and Multi-Year ice (MYI) regions. No ice-type-related difference indicates the good consistency between Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2 data sets. Over the whole period, mean freeboard estimates for the entire Arctic differs generally by not more than 0.07 m between Sentinel-3A and CryoSat-2. Compared to airborne Operation IceBridge (OIB) data, Sentinel-3A has closer sea ice freeboard estimates than CryoSat-2.

TI  - Deformation characteristics of the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub>5.9 Menyuan (China) earthquake by modelling Sentinel-1A and auxiliary data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 M(w)5.9 Menyuan earthquake occurred on the Qilian-Haiyuan fault system on the northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau. Since the seismogenic source is a blind fault, it is difficult to obtain reliable geometric parameters of the source only from the satellite data. In this paper, we used two aftershock relocation data sets to constrain the seismogenic fault, and obtained two southwest-dipping listric fault models with a strike of about 126 degrees and different dip angles. According to the geological structures, we assumed that the dip is uniformly reduced along the width direction, and modelled the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data of the Menyuan event using a simulated annealing algorithm to search for the optimal fault dips. The optimal top and bottom dips are about 59 degrees and 1 degrees, respectively. Using the optimal fault model, we obtained the slip distribution and three-dimensional displacement fields for the 2016 M(w)5.9 Menyuan earthquake. Sliding occurs mainly on the four sub-faults in the middle of the model, indicating that the rupture zone is relatively small. The displacement fields indicate that the seismogenic source is a thrust fault, and the epicentre experienced a strong northeastward compression deformation.

TI  - Supervised learning with convolutional neural networks for hyperspectral visualization
T2  - REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Visualization for hyperspectral images is demanded by the ground processing system for quick view and information survey. Previous methods using band selection or dimension reduction fail to produce stable details and good colours as reasonable as corresponding multispectral images. In this paper, a mixed strategy is proposed which utilizes multi-band selection and supervised learning to integrate natural spatial details within hyperspectral bands for visualization. In the training stage, multispectral images are introduced as the reference, which are targeted by convolutional neural networks modelling the conversion from hyperspectral bands to multispectral bands. In order to preserve the colour, the hyperspectral band numbers are recorded for those with high correlation to the reference images, which are put into the network for dimension reduction. The proposed method is tested for the EO-1 Hyperion hyperspectral images with LandSat-8 images as the benchmark. The results are compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms. The comparison results show that the present method has good performance in maintaining both structures and colours.

TI  - Fractional vegetation cover estimation in heterogeneous areas by combining a radiative transfer model and a dynamic vegetation model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - A fractional vegetation cover (FVC) estimation method incorporating a vegetation growth model and a radiative transfer model was previously developed, which was suitable for FVC estimation in homogeneous areas because the finer-resolution pixels corresponding to one coarse-resolution FVC pixel were all assumed to have the same vegetation growth model. However, this assumption does not hold over heterogeneous areas, meaning that the method cannot be applied to large regions. Therefore, this study proposes a finer spatial resolution FVC estimation method applicable to heterogeneous areas using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager reflectance data and Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) FVC product. The FVC product was first decomposed according to the normalized difference vegetation index from the Landsat 8 OLI data. Then, independent dynamic vegetation models were built for each finer-resolution pixel. Finally, the dynamic vegetation model and a radiative transfer model were combined to estimate FVC at the Landsat 8 scale. Validation results indicated that the proposed method (R-2 = 0.7757, RMSE = 0.0881) performed better than either the previous method (R-2 = 0.7038, RMSE = 0.1125) or a commonly used method involving look-up table inversions of the PROSAIL model (R-2 = 0.7457, RMSE = 0.1249).

TI  - Intercomparison of Himawari-8 AHI-FSA with MODIS and VIIRS active fire products
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DIGITAL EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The AHI-FSA (Advanced Himawari Imager - Fire Surveillance Algorithm) is a recently developed algorithm designed to support wildfire surveillance and mapping using the geostationary Himawari-8 satellite. At present, the AHI-FSA algorithm has only been tested on a number of case study fires in Western Australia. Initial results demonstrate potential as a wildfire surveillance algorithm providing high frequency (every 10 minutes), multi-resolution fire-line detections. This paper intercompares AHI-FSA across the Northern Territory of Australia (1.4 million km(2)) over a ten-day period with the well-established fire products from LEO (Low Earth Orbiting) satellites: MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite). This paper also discusses the difficulties and solutions when comparing high temporal frequency fire products with existing low temporal resolution LEO satellite products. The results indicate that the multi-resolution approach developed for AHI-FSA is successful in mapping fire activity at 500 m. When compared to the MODIS, daily AHI-FSA omission error was only 7%. High temporal frequency data also results in AHI-FSA observing fires, at times, three hours before the MODIS overpass with much-enhanced detail on fire movement.

TI  - Linking observation, modelling and satellite-based estimation of global land evapotranspiration
T2  - BIG EARTH DATA
M3  - Review
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is a pivotal process for ecosystem water budgets and accounts for a substantial portion of the global energy balance. In this paper, the exited actual ET main datasets in global scale, and the global ET modeling and estimates were focused on discussion. The Source energy balance (SEB) models, empirical models and other process-based models are summarized. Accuracy for ET estimates by SEB models highly depends on accurate surface temperature retrieval, and SEB models are hard to apply in large heterogeneous surface. The Penman-Monteith (PM) equations are thought to be with considerable sound mechanism. However, it involves large number of parameters, which are not all global available. A simplified PM equation by Priestley and Taylor (PT) is found to perform well on well-watered surface. For both PM and PT equations in estimating ET, the key is to consider the constraint from surface resistance primarily water stress. Empirical models are simple but the accuracy of which highly depends on training samples. Coupling satellite data into ET models can improve ET estimates with higher resolution spatiotemporal information inputs; However, finding the most proper way to estimate global ET remains problematic. Several reasons for this issue are also analyzed in this review.

TI  - Multitemporal 2016-2018 Sentinel-2 Data Enhancement for Landscape Archaeology: The Case Study of the Foggia Province, Southern Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper is focused on the use of satellite Sentinel-2 data for assessing their capability in the identification of archaeological buried remains. We selected the "Tavoliere delle Puglie" (Foggia, Italy) as a test area because it is characterized by a long human frequentation and is very rich in archaeological remains. The investigations were performed using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and spectral indices, commonly used in satellite-based archaeology, and herein analyzed in known archaeological areas to capture the spectral signatures of soil and crop marks and characterize their temporal behavior using Time Series Analysis and Spectral Un-mixing. Tasseled Cap Transformation and Principal Component Analysis have been also adopted to enhance archaeological features. Results from investigations were compared with independent data sources and enabled us to (i) characterize the spectral signatures of soil and crop marks, (ii) assess the performance of the diverse spectral channels and indices, and (iii) identify the best period of the year to capture the archaeological proxy indicators. Additional very important results of our investigations were (i) the discovery of unknown archaeological areas and (ii) the setup of a database of archaeological features devised ad hoc to characterize and categorize the diverse typologies of archaeological remains detected using Sentinel-2 Data.

TI  - The Potentiality of Operational Mapping of Oil Pollution in the Mediterranean Sea near the Entrance of the Suez Canal Using Sentinel-1 SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Suez Canal, being a main international maritime shipping route, experiences heavy ship traffic with probable illegal oil discharges. Oil pollution is harming the marine ecosystem and creates pressure on the coastal socio-economic activities particularly at Port Said city (the area of study). It is anticipated that the damage of oil spills is not only during the event but it extends for a long time and normally requires more effort to remediate and recover the environment. Hence, early detection and volume estimation of these spills is the first and most important step for a successful clean-up operation. This study is the first to use Sentinel-1 space-borne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images for oil spill detection and mapping over the north entrance of the Suez Canal aiming to enable operational monitoring. SAR sensors are able to capture images day and night and are not affected by weather conditions. In addition, they have a wide swath that covers large geographical areas for possible oil spills. The present study examines a large amount of data (800 scenes of sentinel 1) for the study area over a period of five years from 2014 till 2019 which resulted in the detection of more than 20 events of oil pollution. The detection model is based on the quantitative analysis of the dark spot of the radar backscatter of oil spills. The largest case covered nearly 26 km(2) of seawater. The spill drift direction in the area of spills indicated potential hazard on fishing activities, Port Said beaches and ports. This study can be the base for continuously monitoring and alarming pollution cases in the Canal area which is important for environmental agencies, decision-makers, and beneficiaries for coastal and marine socio-economic sustainability.

TI  - Effectiveness of strategies to screen for blood donors with <i>RH</i> variants in a mixed population
T2  - TRANSFUSION AND APHERESIS SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Patients with RH variants presenting antibodies directed to RH high frequency antigens or multiple RH antibodies might, in some occasions, be better served with RH genotype-matched units, requiring screening for RH variants among blood donors. To date, strategies to identify donors with RH variants were restricted to selecting individuals of African descent based on self-reported race, what can be inaccurate in racially mixed population. Our goal was to: 1) Screen for donors with RH variants in a mixed population using self-declared race and Rh phenotype as selection criteria; and 2) Verify if including the Duffy null genotype in the screening algorithm increases its effectiveness.Methods: Brazilian donors were included if self-declared as black and phenotyped as R0r or R1r. All individuals were genotyped for RHCE exons 1, 5, 6 and 7 and for the FY*B c.-67 T > C polymorphism in order to determine the Duffy null genotype. RHD variants were searched for in cases of altered RHCE.Results: Among 2500 blood donors, 217 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were enrolled. Fifty-three (24.4 %) had a predicted clinically relevant Rh phenotype (partial antigens or lack of high frequency antigens). Twelve donors (5.5 %) had a predicted RhCE phenotype lacking either hrB or hrS. Most cases with predicted lack of high frequency antigens (66.7 %) occurred in donors with the Duffy null genotype.Conclusion: Selecting donors based on self-declared race, Rh phenotype and Duffy null genotype is feasible and effective in identifying RH variants lacking Rh high frequency antigens among racially mixed donors.

TI  - A Fusion Approach for Water Area Classification Using Visible, Near Infrared and Synthetic Aperture Radar for South Asian Conditions
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistent estimation of water surface area from remote sensing remains challenging in regions such as South Asia with vegetation, mountainous topography, and persistent monsoonal cloud cover. High-resolution optical imagery, which is often used for global inundation mapping, is highly impacted by clouds, while synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery is not impacted by clouds and is affected by both topographic layover and vegetation. Here, we compare and contrast inundation extent measurements from visible (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2) and SAR (Sentinel-1) imagery. Each data type (wavelength) has complementary strengths and weaknesses which were gauged separately over selected water bodies in Bangladesh. High-resolution cloud-free PlanetScope imagery at 3-m resolution was used as a reference to check the accuracy of each technique and data type. Next, the optical and radar images were fused for a rule-based water area classification algorithm to derive the optimal decision for the water mask. Results indicate that the fusion approach can improve the overall accuracy by up to 3.8%, 18.2%, and 8.3% during the wet season over using the individual products of Landsat8, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2, respectively, at three sites, while providing increased observational frequency. The fusion-derived products resulted in overall accuracy ranging from 85.8% to 98.7% and Kappa coefficient varying from 0.61 to 0.83. The proposed SAR-visible fusion technique has potential for improving satellite-based surface water monitoring and storage changes, especially for smaller water bodies in humid tropical climate of South Asia.

TI  - Multi-Sensor Observation of a Saharan Dust Outbreak over Transylvania, Romania in April 2019
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Mineral aerosols are considered to be the second largest source of natural aerosol, the Saharan desert being the main source of dust at global scale. Under certain meteorological conditions, Saharan dust can be transported over large parts of Europe, including Romania. The aim of this paper is to provide a complex analysis of a Saharan dust outbreak over the Transylvania region of Romania, based on the synergy of multiple ground-based and satellite sensors in order to detect the dust intrusion with a higher degree of certainty. The measurements were performed during the peak of the outbreak on April the 24th 2019, with instruments such as a Cimel sun-photometer and a multi-wavelength Raman depolarization lidar, together with an in-situ particle counter measuring at ground level. Remote sensing data from MODIS sensors on Terra and Aqua were also analyzed. Results show the presence of dust aerosol layers identified by the multi-wavelength Raman and depolarization lidar at altitudes of 2500-4000 m, and 7000 m, respectively. The measured optical and microphysical properties, together with the HYSPLIT back-trajectories, NMMB/BSC dust model, and synoptic analysis, confirm the presence of lofted Saharan dust layers over Cluj-Napoca, Romania. The NMMB/BSC dust model predicted dust load values between 1 and 1.5 g/m(2) over Cluj-Napoca at 12:00 UTC for April the 24th 2019. Collocated in-situ PM monitoring showed that dry deposition was low, with PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations similar to the seasonal averages for Cluj-Napoca.

TI  - Modelling future land use land cover changes and their impacts on land surface temperatures in Rajshahi, Bangladesh
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization causes enormous land use and land cover (LULC) changes, which creates a significant impacts on land surface temperature (LST) in rapidly growing mega-cities. The substantial increment of the LST creates urban heat island (UHI) effects in cities. This study first identified the pattern of the LULC changes, and later, investigated their impacts on LST in Rajshahi City Corporation (RCC) areas for the years of 1999, 2009 and 2019 using Landsat TM/OLI satellite images. This study explored the impact of LULC change on LST through LST distribution in different land use categories, cross-section profile of LULC wise LST variability, and a correlation between LULC indexes (NDVI, NDBI, NDBaI & NDWI) and LST. The Multi-Layer Perceptron-Markov Chain (MLPMC) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods were utilized to simulate the LULC and LST maps, respectively, for the years of 2029 and 2039. The accuracy of LULC and LST simulation models are more than 85% and 90%, respectively, based on the validation results. Simulation results show if the current trend of urban growth continues, 70% and 88% of RCC area will experience temperature more than 38.C in 2029 and 2039, respectively. Such impacts need to be considered and evaluated immediately for ensuring sustainable urbanization and natural resource management in the RCC area. This study will be helpful for urban planners and environmental engineers to understand the impacts of LULC change (e.g. loss of vegetation cover, agricultural land and water bodies to accommodate extensive urban growth) on LST and to propose appropriate policy measures to control it.

TI  - Normalised difference spectral indices and urban land cover as indicators of land surface temperature (LST)
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover changes associated with urbanisation modify microclimate, leading to urban heat islands, whereby cities are warmer than the surrounding countryside. Understanding the factors causing this phenomenon could help urban areas adapt to climate change and improve living conditions of inhabitants. In this study, land surface temperatures (LST) of Aarhus, a city in the high latitudes, are estimated from the reflectance of a thermal band (TIRS1; Band 10; 10.60-11.19 mu m) of Landsat 8 on five dates in the summer months (one in 2015, and four in 2018). Spectral indices, modelled on the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), using all combinations of the first seven bands of Landsat 8 are calculated and their relationships with LST, analysed. Land cover characteristics, in terms of the percentages of tree cover, building cover and overall vegetation cover are estimated from airborne LiDAR data, building footprints and 4-band aerial imagery, respectively. The correlations between LST, the spectral indices and land cover are estimated.The difference in mean temperature between the rural and urban parts of Aarhus is up to 3.96 degrees C, while the difference between the warmer and colder zones (based on the mean and SD of LST) is up to 13.26 degrees C. The spectral index using the near infrared band (NIR; Band 5; 0.85-0.88 mu m) and a short-wave infrared band (SWIR2; Band 7; 2.11-2.29 mu m) has the strongest correlations (r: 0.62 to 0.89) with LST for the whole study area. This index is the inverse of normalised burn ratio (NBR), which has been used for mapping burnt areas. Spectral indices using different combinations of the infrared bands have stronger correlations with LST than the more widely used vegetation indices such as NDVI. The percentage of tree cover has a higher negative correlation (Pearson's r: -0.68 to -0.75) with IST than overall vegetation cover (r: -0.45 to -0.63). Tree cover and building cover (r: -0.53 to 0.71) together explain up to 68 % of the variation in LST. Modification of tree and building cover may therefore have the potential to regulate urban LST.

TI  - An Incoherent Decomposition Algorithm Based on Polarimetric Symmetry for Multilook Polarimetric SAR Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Polarimetric symmetry, including reflection symmetry, rotation symmetry, and azimuthal symmetry, are useful concepts for describing the scattering characteristics of polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. In this study, for the coherency matrices of multilook polarimetric SAR data, three new scattering models were first proposed based on the polarimetric symmetry. Then, a four-component incoherent decomposition algorithm was introduced, which was based on the three aforementioned new models, along with a classic volume scattering model. The proposed algorithm was considered to be a complete incoherent decomposition algorithm. No polarimetric information was lost during the decomposition. Also, there were no negative powers in its output. Then, by utilizing three polarimetric SAR images which had been derived by ESAR, RADARSAT-2, and GF-3, respectively, the experimental results had revealed that the proposed decomposition algorithm was effective in the analysis of the scattering mechanisms of terrain targets. It was observed that more than 90% of the coherency matrices of the real polarimetric SAR data had been completely decomposed by the proposed algorithm into four components. These components were found to be exactly consistent with the scattering models for surface scattering, double-bounce scattering, volume scattering, and helix scattering. The proposed decomposition algorithm had provided insight into the limitations of incoherent decomposition.

TI  - Drivers of Forest Loss in a Megadiverse Hotspot on the Pacific Coast of Colombia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests are disappearing at unprecedented rates, but the drivers behind this transformation are not always clear. This limits the decision-making processes and the effectiveness of forest management policies. In this paper, we address the extent and drivers of deforestation of the Choco biodiversity hotspot, which has not received much scientific attention despite its high levels of plant diversity and endemism. The climate is characterized by persistent cloud cover which is a challenge for land cover mapping from optical satellite imagery. By using Google Earth Engine to select pixels with minimal cloud content and applying a random forest classifier to Landsat and Sentinel data, we produced a wall-to-wall land cover map, enabling a diagnosis of the status and drivers of forest loss in the region. Analyses of these new maps together with information from illicit crops and alluvial mining uncovered the pressure over intact forests. According to Global Forest Change (GFC) data, 2324 km(2) were deforested in this area from 2001 to 2018, reaching a maximum in 2016 and 2017. We found that 68% of the area is covered by broadleaf forests (67,473 km(2)) and 15% by shrublands (14,483 km(2)), the latter with enormous potential to promote restoration projects. This paper provides a new insight into the conservation of this exceptional forest with a discussion of the drivers of forest loss, where illicit crops and alluvial mining were found to be responsible for 60% of forest loss.

TI  - Vegetation fragmentation of Marapanim River watershed, northeastern of Para state
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest fragmentation is one of the main consequences of anthropogenic activities in native vegetation areas. When considering the watershed approach, the fragmentation can increase the erosion processes and alter the water regime, notably as a result of deforestation actions. Thus, the present study sought to analyze the landscape structure of Marapanim river watershed, focusing on the fragmentation of tree vegetation. To do so, a Landsat 8, OLI sensor satellite scene acquired in 2017 and classified using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm was used to classify and estimate the different land uses and land cover in 2017 in the basin area. Subsequently, the forest fragments were analyzed using patch level, class and landscape metrics. The results indicate that the landscape of the watershed is mostly composed of tree vegetation (49%) and agricultural areas (29%, responsible for the main changes in the native vegetation cover of the studied basin. The study of the quantification and characterization of the landscape structure showed that the basin landscape is very fragmented, with a total of 16,697 fragments. The average fragment size is 12.79 ha, considered of medium value for biodiversity conservation. The class of tree vegetation is the most fragmented, representing 41.36% of the total fragments of the basin landscape. The shape index of these fragments is 1.56, indicating the predominance of more irregular shapes and therefore more susceptible to edge effects. The results of this study may support the formulation of actions and/or public policies aimed at promoting the recovery and maintenance of tree vegetation fragments of the Marapanim river watershed in the state of Para.

TI  - Botanical field-study and remote sensing to describe mangrove resilience in the Saloum Delta (Senegal) after 30 years of degradation narrative
T2  - FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove ecosystems are currently experiencing a drastic loss on a global scale. However, the Senegalese mangrove is presently achieving a significant increase that has been overlooked by non-governmental organizations, media, and policymakers. The purpose of this investigation is to develop a better understanding of the dynamics leading to the increase of the Senegalese mangrove in by using remote sensing and botanical field data. Our main results were obtained from a spatial analysis of mangrove gains (3600 ha between 2000 and 2015) from remote sensing data. Patches of mangrove appearance and reappearance between 2000 and 2015 were defined through the botanical survey at 47 sites. Spontaneous regeneration from the known natural mortality during the 1980s and 1990s represented 96% of the expansion. We conclude that the mangrove ecosystem has shown resilience to rainfall and salinity variation, which advance our understanding of potential future climate change impacts to mangroves and their ability to recover from drought-induced mortality. We estimate that the diverse process of replantation contribution is diminutive to the spontaneous regeneration of mangroves in the Saloum Delta, and that the merit of replantation programs should be reevaluated. Narratives regarding the degradation of the Senegalese mangrove, the contributing pressures of human activity, and environmental politics should also be revised to reflect the findings of scholarly research.

TI  - An Evaluation of Autonomous In Situ Temperature Loggers in a Coastal Region of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea for Use in the Validation of Near-Shore Satellite Sea Surface Temperature Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The coastal ocean is one of the most important environments on our planet, home to some of the most bio-diverse and productive ecosystems and providing key input to the livelihood of the majority of human society. It is also a highly dynamic and sensitive environment, particularly susceptible to damage from anthropogenic influences such as pollution and over-exploitation as well as the effects of climate change. These have the added potential to exacerbate other anthropogenic effects and the recent change in sea temperature can be considered as the most pervasive and severe cause of impact in coastal ecosystems worldwide. In addition to open ocean measurements, satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST) have the potential to provide accurate synoptic coverage of this essential climate variable for the near-shore coastal ocean. However, this potential has not been fully realized, mainly because of a lack of reliable in situ validation data, and the contamination of near-shore measurements by the land. The underwater biotechnological park of Crete (UBPC) has been taking near surface temperature readings autonomously since 2014. Therefore, this study investigated the potential for this infrastructure to be used to validate SST measurements of the near-shore coastal ocean. A comparison between in situ data and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua and Terra SST data is presented for a four year (2014-2018) in situ time series recorded from the UBPC. For matchups between in situ and satellite SST data, only nighttime in situ extrapolated to the sea surface (SSTskin) data within +/- 1 h from the satellite's overpass are selected and averaged. A close correlation between the in situ data and the MODIS SST was found (squared Pearson correlation coefficient-r(2) > 0.9689, mean absolute error-Delta < 0.51 both for Aqua and Terra products). Moreover, close correlation was found between the satellite data and their adjacent satellite pixel's data further from the shore (r(2) > 0.9945, Delta yyy < 0.23 for both Aqua and Terra products, daytime and nighttime satellite SST). However, there was also a consistent positive systematic difference in the satellite against satellite mean biases indicating a thermal adjacency effect from the land (e.g., mean bias between daytime Aqua satellite SST from the UBPC cell minus the respective adjacent cell's data is delta = 0.02). Nevertheless, if improvements are made in the in situ sensors and their calibration and uncertainty evaluation, these initial results indicate that near-shore autonomous coastal underwater temperature arrays, such as the one at UBPC, could in the future provide valuable in situ data for the validation of satellite coastal SST measurements.

TI  - Assessment of Urban Dynamics to Understand Spatiotemporal Differentiation at Various Scales Using Remote Sensing and Geospatial Tools
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Analysis of urban dynamics is a pivotal step towards understanding landscape changes and developing scientifically sound urban management strategies. Delineating the patterns and processes shaping the evolution of urban regions is an essential part of this step. Utilizing remote-sensing techniques and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools, we performed an integrated analysis on urban expansion in Srinagar city and surrounding areas from 1999 to 2017 at multiple scales in order to assist urban planning initiatives. To capture various spatial indicators of expansion, we analysed (i) land use/land cover (LULC) changes, (ii) rate and intensity of changes to built-up areas, (iii) spatial differentiation in landscape metrics (at 500, 1000 and 2000 m cell-size), and (iv) growth type of the urban expansion. Global Moran's I statistics and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) were also employed to identify hotspots of change in landscape structure. Our methodology utilizes a range of geovisualization tools which are capable of appropriately addressing various elements required for strategic planning in growing cities. The results highlight aggregation and homogenization of the urban core as well as irregularity and fragmentation in its periphery. A combination of spatial metrics and growth type analysis supports the supposition that there is a continuum in the diffusion-coalescence process. This allows us to extend our understanding of urban growth theory and to report deviations from accepted stages of growth. As our results show, each dominating growth phase of the city-both diffusion (1999) and coalescence (2009 and 2017)-is interspersed with features from the other type. An improved understanding of spatial differentiation and the identification of hotspots can serve to make urban planning more tailored to such local conditions. An important insight derived from the results is the applicability of remote-sensing data in urban planning measures and the usefulness of freely available medium resolution data in gaining a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of cities.

TI  - The InVEST Habitat Quality Model Associated with Land Use/Cover Changes: A Qualitative Case Study of the Winike Watershed in the Omo-Gibe Basin, Southwest Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The contribution of biodiversity to the global economy, human survival, and welfare has been increasing significantly, but the anthropogenic pressure as a threat to the pristine habitat has followed. This study aims to identify habitat suitability, analyze the change in habitat quality from 1988 to 2018, and to investigate the correlation between impact factors and habitat quality. The InVEST habitat quality model was used to analyze the spatiotemporal change in habitat quality in individual land-use types in the Winike watershed. Remote sensing data were used to analyze the land use/land cover changes. Nine threat sources, their maximum distance of impact, mode of decay, and sensitivity to threats were also estimated for each land-use cover type. The analysis illustrates that habitat degradation in the watershed was continuously increasing over the last three decades (1988 to 2018). Each threat impact factor and habitat sensitivity have increased for the last 30 years. The most contributing factor of habitat degradation was the 25.41% agricultural expansion in 2018. Population density, land-use intensity, elevation, and slope were significantly correlated with the distribution of habitat quality. Habitat quality degradation in the watershed during the past three decades suggested that the conservation strategies applied in the watershed ecosystem were not effective. Therefore, this study helps decision makers, particularly regarding the lack of data on biodiversity. It further looks into the conflict between economic development and conservation of biodiversity.

TI  - Vegetation Fraction Images Derived from PROBA-V Data for Rapid Assessment of Annual Croplands in Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper presents a new method for rapid assessment of the extent of annual croplands in Brazil. The proposed method applies a linear spectral mixing model (LSMM) to PROBA-V time series images to derive vegetation, soil, and shade fraction images for regional analysis. We used S10-TOC (10 days synthesis, 1 km spatial resolution, and top-of-canopy) products for Brazil and S5-TOC (five days synthesis, 100 m spatial resolution, and top-of-canopy) products for Mato Grosso State (Brazilian Legal Amazon). Using the time series of the vegetation fraction images of the whole year (2015 in this case), only one mosaic composed with maximum values of vegetation fraction was generated, allowing detecting and mapping semi-automatically the areas occupied by annual crops during the year. The results (100 m spatial resolution map) for the Mato Grosso State were compared with existing global datasets (Finer Resolution Observation and Monitoring-Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) and Global Food Security-Support Analyses Data (GFSAD30)). Visually those maps present a good agreement, but the area estimated are not comparable since the agricultural class definition are different for those maps. In addition, we found 11.8 million ha of agricultural areas in the entire Brazilian territory. The area estimation for the Mato Grosso State was 3.4 million ha for 1 km dataset and 5.3 million ha for 100 m dataset. This difference is due to the spatial resolution of the PROBA-V datasets used. A coefficient of determination of 0.82 was found between PROBA-V 100 m and Landsat-8 OLI area estimations for the Mato Grosso State. Therefore, the proposed method is suitable for detecting and mapping annual croplands distribution operationally using PROBA-V datasets for regional analysis.

TI  - Socio-demographic Factors Associated with HIV Prevalence among Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Clinics in Six Southern States of India: Evidences from the Latest Round of HIV Sentinel Surveillance
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: HIV/AIDS is a global public health issue and its transmission in a defined geographic region is influenced by the interplay of sociodemographic and behavioral factors. Better understanding of sociodemographic characteristics of HIV-positive individuals is required to prevent the spread of HIV among the general population. Objectives: The objective of the study was to find the association between HIV prevalence and sociodemographic characteristics of pregnant women aged 15-49 years attending the antenatal clinics (ANCs) in six Southern states of India. Methods: The data from the latest round of HIV sentinel surveillance, a cross-sectional study, conducted during January-March 2017 among ANC attendees were considered for this analysis. Blood samples along with other relevant information were collected from 98,634 pregnant women from 248 sites across the states. The association between HIV prevalence and sociodemographic variables was examined using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The highest HIV prevalence was reported in Karnataka (0.38%) and Andhra Pradesh (0.38%), followed by Telangana (0.33%), Odisha (0.28%), Tamil Nadu (0.27%), and Kerala (0.05%). In all states, the prevalence was highest among illiterate pregnant women exception being Kerala, wherein the prevalence was highest in pregnant women with schooling up to primary education. A significant association was found between HIV prevalence and spouse occupation in Karnataka and Odisha and spouse migration in Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Conclusions: Need for improvising the interventions for the young, illiterates, having a migrant spouse, and spouse occupation as truckers/hotel staff is recommended to the stakeholders involved in HIV management of the six southern states of India.

TI  - Comparative Study among Bivariate Statistical Models in Landslide Susceptibility Map
T2  - INDONESIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The main purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of bivariate statistical models i.e. Frequency Ratio, Weight of Evidence, and Information Value for landslide susceptibility assessment. These models were applied in Cianjur Regency, West Java Province (Indonesia), in order to map the landslide susceptibility and to rate the importance of landslide causal factors. In the first stage, a landslide inventory map and the input layers of the landslide conditioning factors were prepared in the Geographic Information System (GIS) supported by field investigations and remote sensing data. The 298 landslides were randomly divided into two groups of modeling/training data (70%) and validation/test data sets (30%). The landslide conditioning factors considered for the studied area were slope angle, elevation, slope aspect, lithological unit, and land use. Subsequently, the thematic data layers of conditioning factors were integrated by frequency ratio (FR), weight of evidence (WofeE), and information value (IV). Model performance was tested with receiver operator characteristic analysis. The validation findings revealed that the three models showed promising results since the models gave good accuracy values. The success rates of FR, WofE, and IV models were 0.920, 0.926, and 0.930, while the prediction rates of the three models were 0.913, 0.912, and 0.895, respectively. However, the FR model was proved to be relatively superior in estimating landslide susceptibility throughout the studied area.

TI  - Landslide Mapping and Monitoring Using Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) Technique in the French Alps
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Continuous geodetic measurements in landslide prone regions are necessary to avoid disasters and better understand the spatiotemporal and kinematic evolution of landslides. The detection and characterization of landslides in high alpine environments remains a challenge associated with difficult accessibility, extensive coverage, limitations of available techniques, and the complex nature of landslide process. Recent studies using space-based observations and especially Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) techniques with the integration of in-situ monitoring instrumentation are providing vital information for an actual landslide monitoring. In the present study, the Stanford Method for Persistent Scatterers InSAR package (StaMPS) is employed to process the series of Sentinel 1-A and 1-B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images acquired between 2015 and 2019 along ascending and descending orbits for the selected area in the French Alps. We applied the proposed approach, based on extraction of Active Deformation Areas (ADA), to automatically detect and assess the state of activity and the intensity of the suspected slow-moving landslides in the study area. We illustrated the potential of Sentinel-1 data with the aim of detecting regions of relatively low motion rates that be can attributed to activate landslide and updated pre-existing national landslide inventory maps on a regional scale in terms of slow moving landslides. Our results are compared to pre-existing landslide inventories. More than 100 unknown slow-moving landslides, their spatial pattern, deformation rate, state of activity, as well as orientation are successfully identified over an area of 4000 km(2) located in the French Alps. We also address the current limitations due the nature of PSI and geometric characteristic of InSAR data for measuring slope movements in mountainous environments like Alps.

TI  - Surface urban heat islands in the mega city of Karachi, their spatial distribution and health emergency response infrastructure
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE PAKISTAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
M3  - Review
AB  - The 2015 heat wave resulted in an estimated over 1200 deaths during the month of June. However, there were no records on the spatial distribution of the effects of this heat wave. An analysis of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) daily data was conducted to identify regions that experienced above normal temperatures in 2015. An analysis of the monthly averages showed that in general April and May were the warmer months in Karachi, unlike the case in 2015. In addition, the general warm trends were common in the highly industrialised Sindh Industrial Trading Estate (SITE) and Liaquatabad towns, while Gadap, with its mostly barren land, and New Karachi also experience higher temperatures. Coastal towns were naturally cooler and more habitable in the given scenario. A count of the spatial presence of health facilities for the city was also extracted where Gadap and Korangi were poorly served while the more affluent towns of Defence Housing Authority (DHA) and Gulshan-e-Iqbal appeared to be better served.

TI  - The Status of Earth Observation Techniques in Monitoring High Mountain Environments at the Example of Pasterze Glacier, Austria: Data, Methods, Accuracies, Processes, and Scales
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation offers a variety of techniques for monitoring and characterizing geomorphic processes in high mountain environments. Terrestrial laserscanning and unmanned aerial vehicles provide very high resolution data with high accuracy. Automatic cameras have become a valuable source of information-mostly in a qualitative manner-in recent years. The availability of satellite data with very high revisiting time has gained momentum through the European Space Agency's Sentinel missions, offering new application potential for Earth observation. This paper reviews the status of recent techniques such as terrestrial laserscanning, remote sensed imagery, and synthetic aperture radar in monitoring high mountain environments with a particular focus on the impact of new platforms such as Sentinel-1 and -2 as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. The study area comprises the high mountain glacial environment at the Pasterze Glacier, Austria. The area is characterized by a highly dynamic geomorphological evolution and by being subject to intensive scientific research as well as long-term monitoring. We primarily evaluate landform classification and process characterization for: (i) the proglacial lake; (ii) icebergs; (iii) the glacier river; (iv) valley-bottom processes; (v) slope processes; and (vi) rock wall processes. We focus on assessing the potential of every single method both in spatial and temporal resolution in characterizing different geomorphic processes. Examples of the individual techniques are evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively in the context of: (i) morphometric analysis; (ii) applicability in high alpine regions; and (iii) comparability of the methods among themselves. The final frame of this article includes considerations on scale dependent process detectability and characterization potentials of these Earth observation methods, along with strengths and limitations in applying these methods in high alpine regions.

TI  - Quantifying the Sensitivity of NDVI-Based C Factor Estimation and Potential Soil Erosion Prediction using Spaceborne Earth Observation Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), has been increasingly used to capture spatiotemporal variations in cover factor (C) determination for erosion prediction on a larger landscape scale. However, NDVI-based C factor (C-ndvi) estimation per se is sensitive to various biophysical variables, such as soil condition, topographic features, and vegetation phenology. As a result, C-ndvi often results in incorrect values that affect the quality of soil erosion prediction. The aim of this study is to multi-temporally estimate C-ndvi values and compare the values with those of literature values (C-lit) in order to quantify discrepancies between C values obtained via NDVI and empirical-based methods. A further aim is to quantify the effect of biophysical variables such as slope shape, erodibility, and crop growth stage variation on C-ndvi and soil erosion prediction on an agricultural landscape scale. Multi-temporal Landsat 7, Landsat 8, and Sentinel 2 data, from 2013 to 2016, were used in combination with high resolution agricultural land use data of the Integrated Administrative and Control System, from the Uckermark district of north-eastern Germany. Correlations between C-ndvi and C-lit improved in data from spring and summer seasons (up to r = 0.93); nonetheless, the C-ndvi values were generally higher compared with C-lit values. Consequently, modelling erosion using C-ndvi resulted in two times higher rates than modelling with C-lit. The C-ndvi values were found to be sensitive to soil erodibility condition and slope shape of the landscape. Higher erodibility condition was associated with higher C-ndvi values. Spring and summer taken images showed significant sensitivity to heterogeneous soil condition. The C-ndvi estimation also showed varying sensitivity to slope shape variation; values on convex-shaped slopes were higher compared with flat slopes. Quantifying the sensitivity of C-ndvi values to biophysical variables may help improve capturing spatiotemporal variability of C factor values in similar landscapes and conditions.

TI  - Bone in the Time of Corona: Suggestions for Managing Pediatric Orthopaedics Conditions in a Resource-limited Environment during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - ARCHIVES OF BONE AND JOINT SURGERY-ABJS
M3  - Review
AB  - The outbreak of a novel coronavirus, referred to as coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), with its sentinel case in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, has spread rapidly around the globe. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic, which led to most countries implementing social distancing protocols. Most non-essential medical practices have been halted to direct resources to the facilities caring for patients with COVID infection. The pediatric orthopaedic practice is in a unique position, with the treatment of many conditions being treated by pediatric orthopedists being non-emergent, but time-sensitive. We hereby review the current literature and guidelines surrounding the practice change around the world and give recommendations regarding the practice of pediatric orthopaedics during the COVID pandemic.

TI  - Fast-changing upwelling off the west coast of Hainan Island
T2  - OCEAN MODELLING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we investigated the short-term dynamics of upwelling off the west coast of Hainan Island (UWH) by combining Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) infrared sea surface temperature (SST) images and Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) simulations. MODIS observations showed that the UWH could exhibit rapid temporal variations, where the SST could increase or decrease by more than 1 degrees C within 3 h. Further investigations based on ROMS simulations suggested that flood tides could rapidly intensify the UWH, whereas ebb tides could rapidly weaken the UWH. Strong horizontal advection by intense tidal currents and high vertical velocity due to divergence/convergence triggered by progressive tidal waves were identified as the intrinsic physical mechanisms responsible for the rapid SST variations in the UWH. These findings were verified based on a MODIS-observed fast-cooling UWH event and a MODIS-observed fast-warming UWH event. Analyses of the timing of occurrence, tidal phase, and spatial patterns of the significant variations in the SST for these events all agreed with the hypothesis stated above. Model-data fusion analysis indicated that when a neap tide or transition period for tidal currents occurs, the influence of the tidal flow on the UWH is weak because of the associated weak horizontal advection and divergence/convergence.

TI  - Quantifying urban forest structure with open-access remote sensing data sets
T2  - URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING
M3  - Article
AB  - Future cities are set to face ever increasing population and climate pressures, ecosystem services offered by urban forests have been recognised as providing significant mitigation for these pressures. Therefore, the ability to accurately quantify the extent and structure of urban forests, across large and highly dynamic cities, is vital for determining the value of services provided and to assess the effectiveness of policy to promote these important assets. Current inventory methods used in urban forestry are mostly reliant on plot networks measuring a range of structural and demographic metrics; however, limited sampling (spatially and temporally) cannot fully capture the dynamics and spatial heterogeneity of the urban matrix. The rapid increase in the availability of open-access remote sensing data and processing tools offers an opportunity for monitoring and assessment of urban forest structure that is synoptic and at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here we present a framework to estimate urban forest structure that uses open-access data and software, is robust to differences in data sources, is reproducible and is transferable between cities. The workflow is demonstrated by estimating three metrics of 3D forest structure (canopy cover, canopy height and tree density) across the Greater London area (1577 km(2)). Random Forest was trained with open-access airborne LiDAR or iTree Eco inventory data, with predictor variables derived from Sentinel 2, climatic and topography data sets. Output were maps of forest structure at 100 m and 20 m resolution. Results indicate that forest structure can be accurately estimated across large urban areas; Greater London has a mean canopy cover of similar to 16.5% (RMSE 11-17%), mean canopy height of 8.1-15.0 m (RMSE 4.9-6.2 m) m and is home to similar to 4.6 M large trees (projected crown area >10 m(2)). Transferability to other cities is demonstrated using the UK city of Southampton, where estimates were generated from local and Greater London training data sets indicating application beyond geographic domains is feasible. The methods presented here can augment existing inventory practices and give city planners, urban forest managers and greenspace advocates across the globe tools to generate consistent and timely information to help assess and value urban forests.

TI  - Spatio-Temporal Analysis of Oil Spill Impact and Recovery Pattern of Coastal Vegetation and Wetland Using Multispectral Satellite Landsat 8-OLI Imagery and Machine Learning Models
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil spills are a global phenomenon with impacts that cut across socio-economic, health, and environmental dimensions of the coastal ecosystem. However, comprehensive assessment of oil spill impacts and selection of appropriate remediation approaches have been restricted due to reliance on laboratory experiments which offer limited area coverage and classification accuracy. Thus, this study utilizes multispectral Landsat 8-OLI remote sensing imagery and machine learning models to assess the impacts of oil spills on coastal vegetation and wetland and monitor the recovery pattern of polluted vegetation and wetland in a coastal city. The spatial extent of polluted areas was also precisely quantified for effective management of the coastal ecosystem. Using Johor, a coastal city in Malaysia as a case study, a total of 49 oil spill (ground truth) locations, 54 non-oil-spill locations and Landsat 8-OLI data were utilized for the study. The ground truth points were divided into 70% training and 30% validation parts for the classification of polluted vegetation and wetland. Sixteen different indices that have been used to monitor vegetation and wetland stress in literature were adopted for impact and recovery analysis. To eliminate similarities in spectral appearance of oil-spill-affected vegetation, wetland and other elements like burnt and dead vegetation, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning models were used for the classification of polluted and nonpolluted vegetation and wetlands. Model optimization was performed using a random search method to improve the models' performance, and accuracy assessments confirmed the effectiveness of the two machine learning models to identify, classify and quantify the area extent of oil pollution on coastal vegetation and wetland. Considering the harmonic mean (F-1)(,) overall accuracy (OA), User's accuracy (UA), and producers' accuracy (PA), both models have high accuracies. However, the RF outperformed the SVM with F-1, OA, PA and UA values of 95.32%, 96.80%, 98.82% and 95.11%, respectively, while the SVM recorded accuracy values of F-1 (80.83%)(,) OA (92.87%), PA (95.18%) and UA (93.81%), respectively, highlighting 1205.98 hectares of polluted vegetation and 1205.98 hectares of polluted wetland. Analysis of the vegetation indices revealed that spilled oil had a significant impact on the vegetation and wetland, although steady recovery was observed between 2015-2018. This study concludes that Chlorophyll Vegetation Index, Modified Difference Water Index, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and Green Chlorophyll Index vegetation indices are more sensitive for impact and recovery assessment of both vegetation and wetland, in addition to Modified Normalized Difference Vegetation Index for wetlands. Thus, remote sensing and Machine Learning models are essential tools capable of providing accurate information for coastal oil spill impact assessment and recovery analysis for appropriate remediation initiatives.

TI  - Surveillance of concussion-related injuries using electronic medical records from the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN): a proof-of-concept
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Previous studies on traumatic brain injury trends in Canada have been restricted to hospitalization and emergency department visit data. However, many concussion patients may present first, or only, to family physicians. Therefore, the true burden of concussion in Canada is likely underestimated. The Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) collects information electronically from family physicians across Canada and can potentially be used for concussion surveillance. The objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of using data collated from CPCSSN for concussion surveillance purposes and examine trends over time. Methods Electronic medical records housed by CPCSSN from 2010 to 2016 were analyzed. Case ascertainment was determined through a combination of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes. Binomial regression models were used to calculate the prevalence ratio (PR) of concussion by age, sex, deprivation indices, body mass index, and comorbid conditions. Results Concussion prevalence rates increased from 2010 to 2016 (p < 0.001). Based on 2016 data, males had a higher prevalence of concussion compared with females (PR = 1.09; 95% CI 1.02, 1.18), and those aged 10-14 (PR = 8.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 6.34, 11.44) and 15-19 (PR = 7.75; 95% CI 5.84, 10.28) had higher prevalence of concussion compared with those aged 0-4 years. Conclusion This pilot study demonstrates the feasibility of using the CPCSSN system for surveillance of concussion in the Canadian population. The initial findings on prevalence are in agreement with previous studies that have used hospitalization or emergency department data.

TI  - Fiducial Reference Measurements for Satellite Ocean Colour (FRM4SOC)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data can help us understand and address some of the grand challenges and threats facing us today as a species and as a planet, for example climate change and its impacts and sustainable use of the Earth's resources. However, in order to have confidence in earth observation data, measurements made at the surface of the Earth, with the intention of providing verification or validation of satellite-mounted sensor measurements, should be trustworthy and at least of the same high quality as those taken with the satellite sensors themselves. Metrology tells us that in order to be trustworthy, measurements should include an unbroken chain of SI-traceable calibrations and comparisons and full uncertainty budgets for each of the in situ sensors. Until now, this has not been the case for most satellite validation measurements. Therefore, within this context, the European Space Agency (ESA) funded a series of Fiducial Reference Measurements (FRM) projects targeting the validation of satellite data products of the atmosphere, land, and ocean, and setting the framework, standards, and protocols for future satellite validation efforts. The FRM4SOC project was structured to provide this support for evaluating and improving the state of the art in ocean colour radiometry (OCR) and satellite ocean colour validation through a series of comparisons under the auspices of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS). This followed the recommendations from the International Ocean Colour Coordinating Group's white paper and supports the CEOS ocean colour virtual constellation. The main objective was to establish and maintain SI traceable ground-based FRM for satellite ocean colour and thus make a fundamental contribution to the European system for monitoring the Earth (Copernicus).This paper outlines the FRM4SOC project structure, objectives and methodology and highlights the main results and achievements of the project: (1) An international SI-traceable comparison of irradiance and radiance sources used for OCR calibration that set measurement, calibration and uncertainty estimation protocols and indicated good agreement between the participating calibration laboratories from around the world; (2) An international SI-traceable laboratory and outdoor comparison of radiometers used for satellite ocean colour validation that set OCR calibration and comparison protocols; (3) A major review and update to the protocols for taking irradiance and radiance field measurements for satellite ocean colour validation, with particular focus on aspects of data acquisition and processing that must be considered in the estimation of measurement uncertainty and guidelines for good practice; (4) A technical comparison of the main radiometers used globally for satellite ocean colour validation bringing radiometer manufacturers together around the same table for the first time to discuss instrument characterisation and its documentation, as needed for measurement uncertainty estimation; (5) Two major international side-by-side field intercomparisons of multiple ocean colour radiometers, one on the Atlantic Meridional Transect (AMT) oceanographic cruise, and the other on the Acqua Alta oceanographic tower in the Gulf of Venice; (6) Impact and promotion of FRM within the ocean colour community, including a scientific road map for the FRM-based future of satellite ocean colour validation and vicarious calibration (based on the findings of the FRM4SOC project, the consensus from two major international FRM4SOC workshops and previous literature, including the IOCCG white paper on in situ ocean colour radiometry).

TI  - DFCNN-Based Semantic Recognition of Urban Functional Zones by Integrating Remote Sensing Data and POI Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban functional zone, as a special fundamental unit of the city, helps to understand the complex interaction between human space activities and environmental changes. Based on the recognition of physical and social semantics of buildings, combining remote sensing data and social sensing data is an effective way to quickly and accurately comprehend urban functional zone patterns. From the object level, this paper proposes a novel object-wise recognition strategy based on very high spatial resolution images (VHSRI) and social sensing data. First, buildings are extracted according to the physical semantics of objects; second, remote sensing and point of interest (POI) data are combined to comprehend the spatial distribution and functional semantics in the social function context; finally, urban functional zones are recognized and determined by building with physical and social functional semantics. When it comes to building geometrical information extraction, this paper, given the importance of building boundary information, introduces the deeper edge feature map (DEFM) into the segmentation and classification, and improves the result of building boundary recognition. Given the difficulty in understanding deeper semantics and spatial information and the limitation of traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) models in feature extraction, we propose the Deeper-Feature Convolutional Neural Network (DFCNN), which is able to extract more and deeper features for building semantic recognition. Experimental results conducted on a Google Earth image of Shenzhen City show that the proposed method and model are able to effectively, quickly, and accurately recognize urban functional zones by combining building physical semantics and social functional semantics, and are able to ensure the accuracy of urban functional zone recognition.

The medium resolution optical-satellite imagery of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 are employed covering the period 2016 to 2019 for forest fire patches identification on Google Earth Engine (GEE). The most indispensable season of Forest Fire (FF) is pre-monsoon in Uttarakhand, western Himalaya, India. Bi-temporal (pre and post fire) reflectance contrast of burn-sensitive spectral bands was used to compute differential spectral indices, namely, Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (dNDWI), and Short-Wave Infrared (dSWIR). The differential spectral-indices composite is further used as an input to unsupervised Weka clustering algorithms for capturing the shape and pattern of fire patches. Sample training-data of burn and unburn classes were collected with reference to thermal and optical spectral principle. Classification Regression Tree (CART), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms have been employed to identify FF. The key findings revealed that CART and RF algorithms displayed similar forest fire patches with an overall accuracy of 97-100%. The classification accuracy is slightly lower in SVM and its underestimating forest fire patches detections. Landsat-8 OLI derived burn area was fitted better with fire product of Climate Change Initiative (Fire-CCI of ESA) and MCD64A1 of MODIS burn area product with R-square of 0.71-0.93 and 0.62-0.91, respectively which attributed to better spectral bands of Landsat-8 than the Sentinel-2. However, Sentinel-2 bands have the potential to capture fire patches during postfire events. This study has demonstrated the potential utilities of combined effort of unsupervised and supervised algorithms on Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 on GEE to identify fire patches.

TI  - Comparison of Diurnal Variation of Land Surface Temperature From GOES-16 ABI and MODIS Instruments
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) and its diurnal variation are the critical factors in many aspects of climate study, surface energy balance, and environmental applications. Several satellite-based LST products are available for retrievals from regional to a global scale. However, due to the differences in sensor configurations and retrieval algorithms, these products may not necessarily be consistent. In this letter, the consistency of spatial and temporal skin temperature variations from two infrared satellite platforms has been evaluated over the contiguous United States (CONUS). Comparisons are made between the LST products from the newly launched Geostationary Operation Environmental Satellite R Series (GOES-R) advanced baseline imager (ABI) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on both Aqua and Terra satellites which are polar orbiting. Overall, both products show a general agreement in their diurnal variations with differences mostly under 2 K. However, a temperature-dependent inconsistency has been detected. The MODIS LST product seems to estimate higher temperatures in the summer months while the GOES product estimates higher temperatures during the winter months. Moreover, the maximum observed diurnal differences could reach up to 10 K in mountainous regions. The results suggest that the corresponding temperature differences should be accounted for when LST diurnal variations are compared or generated from satellite observations.

TI  - Complementing Optical Remote Sensing with Synthetic Aperture Radar Observations of Hail Damage Swaths to Agricultural Crops in the Central United States
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been frequently used to map hail damage to vegetation, especially in agricultural areas, but observations can be blocked by cloud cover during the growing season. Here, the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1A/1B C-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery in co- and cross polarization is used to identify changes in backscatter of corn and soybeans damaged by hail during intense thunderstorm events in the early and late growing season. Following a June event, hail-damaged areas produced a lower mean backscatter when compared with surrounding, unaffected pixels [vertical-vertical (VV): -1.1 dB; vertical-horizontal (VH): -1.5 dB]. Later, another event in August produced an increase in co- and cross-polarized backscatter (VV: 0.7 dB; VH: 1.7 dB) that is hypothesized to result from the combined effects of crop growth, change in structure of damaged crops, and soil moisture conditions. Hail damage regions inferred from changes in backscatter were further assessed through coherence change detections to support changes in the structure of crops damaged within the hail swath. While studies using NDVI have routinely concluded a decrease in NDVI is associated with damage, the cause of change with respect to the damaged areas in SAR backscatter values is more complex. Influences of environmental variables, such as vegetation structure, vegetation maturity, and soil moisture conditions, need to be considered when interpreting SAR backscatter and will vary throughout the growing season.

M3  - Article
AB  - Study Region: Part of the Lake Tana sub-basin of the Blue Nile, EthiopiaStudy focus: This study is aimed to identify and locate the groundwater potential zones of Megech watershed using geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing. Lithology, lineament density, slope, geomorphology, soil, land use and land cover, rainfall, drainage density and elevation were used as proxy data to map the groundwater potential zones of the watershed. Weights were assigned for each thematic layer and thematic layer classes using the PriEsT Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) tool. Suitably ArcGIS overlay analysis was conducted to obtain the groundwater potential map. Geology, lineament density, slope and geomorphology were found to be the dominant and sensitive factors for groundwater zoning as portrayed in the map removal analysis.New hydrological insights for the region: Three groundwater potential zones were identified in the study area namely low, moderate and high. These groundwater potential zones were compared with an independent set of groundwater inventory data to validate the results. The validation analysis showed 78.5 % agreement between the groundwater inventory data and the qualitative results. Use of proxy data can serve as a credible source of information for groundwater potential zoning and could greatly help in the groundwater development and management of a region.

TI  - "What Does Not Kill Me Makes Me Stronger": Paul and Epictetus on the Correlation of Virtues and Suffering
T2  - CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - Do Paul and Epictetus have a way to correlate suffering with the growth of virtues? This essay discusses passages in Epictetus's Discourses, which speak of the moral and Paul's catena in Rom 5:3-5. While suffering does not have a direct formative influence on "virtues" for either thinker, it can be meaningfully inferred from the heart of their religious and philosophical convictions and used to provide further evidence for what each author sees as "happiness" or "salvation." For Epictetus, this happens through the strengthening of rationality and virtues; for Paul, through the specific virtue of endurance in the service of hope. In Epictetus's worldview, suffering and its assault on human dignity are powerfully countered by human beings' inherent and God-given rationality. For Paul, suffering can be borne by those who anchor their existence in the love of God.

T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Communication is nowadays significantly shaped and determined by social networks. Their influence can be seen in various fields of human existence, from private sphere throughout professional life and building up contacts up to communities' creation. The influence may vary based on sphere where the social network is used and on its actual usage. Its character differs based on the individual concerned, the society that communicates or the status of the person. This type of communication penetrates the lives and the relations based on various society levels; religion is no an exception. Our paper deals with communication and its role in community building; communities have a common interest, world-view (especially considering their religion). We are interested in social networks usage related to religion and worshiping. Communication via social networks is nowadays done by parishes, religious communities, and the Pope Francis I, as the highest representative in religious hierarchy, is no exception, too. This paper deals with possibilities and means as well as the real essence of social networks usage by religious communities and groups, as well as possible uses of social networks for the purpose of faith or worldview spreading.

TI  - Response Versus Scan-Angle Assessment of MODIS Reflective Solar Bands in Collection 6.1 Calibration
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments onboard the Aqua and Terra satellites have been operated for nearly two decades, producing high-quality earth observation data sets suitable for a broad range of scientific studies regarding the earth & x2019;s land, ocean, and atmospheric processes. The high radiometric accuracy of MODIS reflective solar band (RSB) calibration has also served as benchmark measurements for on-orbit cross-calibration studies. As the two MODIS instruments have operated well beyond their design lifespan of six years, the measurements from the onboard calibrators alone become inadequate to characterize the sensor & x2019;s response at all scan angles, as evinced by long-term drifts observed at certain scan positions of the Aqua-MODIS 0.64- and 0.86- bands in Collection 6 (C6) data set. The latest MODIS Level 1B C6.1 data set incorporates earth-view response trending from invariant desert sites as supplemental inputs to characterize the scan-angle calibration dependencies for all RSB. This article presents a deep convective cloud (DCC)-based calibration approach for an independent evaluation of the MODIS RSB response versus scan-angle (RVS) performance in C6.1. The long-term calibration stability and RVS differences in C6.1 have been significantly improved for Aqua-MODIS RSB. The observed RVS differences of more than 2 & x0025; in Aqua-MODIS C6 bands 1 and 2 have been reduced to within 1 & x0025; in C6.1. Some RSBs of Terra-MODIS have suffered temporal drifts up to & x007E;2 & x0025; and calibration shifts up to 3 & x0025;, particularly around 2016 when the Terra satellite entered into safe mode. The DCC approach has been found very effective in tracking the on-orbit RVS changes over time.

TI  - The study of internal mammary lymph node dissection guided by modified radiotracer injection technique in breast cancer-a case report and review
T2  - GLAND SURGERY
M3  - Review
AB  - In addition to axillary lymph node (ALN), internal mammary lymph node (IMLN) could also provide important prognostic information. In this paper, we will introduce a case of breast cancer patient whose preoperative lymphoscintigraphy revealed that there were "hot-spots" in bilateral intercostal space. The bilateral IMLN found by preoperative lymphoscintigraphy is a rare phenomenon. She received ipsilateral internal mammary sentinel lymph node biopsy (IM-SLNB) and IMLN dissection and contralateral IM-SLNB. She was diagnosed as pT2N3bM1 breast cancer based on the positive IMLN and positive ALN. After performing surgery, the pathology indicated: (left breast) invasive ductal carcinoma (3.0x3.0 cm(2)), ALN (3/30), ipsilateral internal mammary sentinel lymph node (IMSLN) (1/2), IMLN (0/2); contralateral IMSLN (1/1). After performing IMLN surgery, the pathology staging increased from pT2N1aM0 to pT2N3bM1. And the irradiation therapy choice had been changed, she received irradiation therapy include chest wall, supraclavicular region, ipsilateral IMLN and contralateral IMLN. The treatment benefit had been increased. When the ipsilateral internal mammary lymphatic vessels were obstructed, deep lymphatic system might drain from ipsilateral IMLN to contralateral IMLN. The contralateral IMLN metastasis belongs to distant metastasis. The IMLN irradiation therapy should be tailored and balanced based on the statues of IMLN. With effective application of systemic therapy, the localized treatment advantage benefited from IMLN surgery might be transferred to survival benefit.

TI  - Global high-resolution mountain green cover index mapping based on Landsat images and Google Earth Engine
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountains provide essential ecosystem services to billions of people and are home to a majority of the global biodiversity hotspots. However, mountain ecosystems are particularly sensitive to climate and environmental changes. The protection and sustainable management of mountain ecosystems are thus of great importance and are listed as a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 15.4) of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for sustainable development. The mountain green cover index (MGCI, SDG 15.4.2), which is defined by measuring the changes of green vegetation in mountain areas, is one of the two SDG indicators for monitoring the conservation status of mountain environments. However, as a country indicator, it is challenging to use the current MGCI data to quantify the detailed changes in highly heterogeneous mountain areas within each country, and correspondingly, the measures is limited when supporting sustainable development and protection strategy decisionmaking for mountain environments. In this paper, a new global high resolution gridded-MGCI calculation method that depicts the varying details in the MGCI from both the spatial and temporal domains was proposed based on 30-m Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. In the method, first, a grid-based MGCI calculation model was proposed by that considers the true surface area instead of the planimetric area of each mountain pixel. The global green vegetation cover was then extracted using all available 30-m Landsat-8 satellite observations within the calendar year on the GEE platform via a new frequency- and phenology-based algorithm. The mountain true surface area was finally calculated and introduced into the MGCI calculation model for global MGCI mapping. The results showed that the green vegetation cover extracted from 30 m Landsat images can reach an overall accuracy of 95.56%. In general, 69.73% of the global mountain surface had 1.05 times more surface area than planimetric area. The average difference between the MGCIs considering the surface area and planimetric area can reach 11.89%. According to the statistics of the global grid MGCI, 68.79% of the global mountain area had an MGCI higher than 90%, 16.94% of the global mountain area had no vegetation cover and 3.81% of mountain area had an MGCI lower than 10%. The proposed MGCIs were further aggregated at the country level and compared with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) MGCI baseline data from 2017. The comparison indicated good consistency between the two datasets, with an R-2 of 0.9548 and a mean absolute difference of 4.26%. The new MGCI calculation method was based all available Landsat-8 observations from a year, which reduced the dependence of the MGCI on the updating frequency of the land cover product. Furthermore, the method has great potential for getting the spatio-temporal continuous MGCI with a high spatial resolution for characterizing explicit mountain vegetation dynamics and vegetation-climate change interactions to advance our understanding of global mountain changes. The new MGCI data will be available on the CASEarth data-sharing platform.

TI  - Surveillance of external ventricular drainage-associated meningitis and ventriculitis in German intensive care units
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: In light of the infection risk associated with external ventricular drainage (EVD), we decided to establish the surveillance of EVD-associated meningitis/ventriculitis in German intensive care units (ICUs) in the framework of the German national nosocomial infection surveillance system (KISS). Here, we present the current reference data and subsequent risk-factor analysis for EVD-associated meningitis/ventriculitis rates. Methods: The surveillance method corresponds with the surveillance methods for device-associated infections recommended by the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). All ICUs participating for at least 1 month from 2008 to 2016 in the module ICU-KISS were included in the reference dataset and the multivariate analysis. Results: Current reference data (2008-2016) are based on input from 157 ICUs. The mean EVD-associated meningitis/ventriculitis rate per 1,000 EVD days was 3.96, with little variation between neurosurgical, surgical, interdisciplinary (hospitals with >400 beds), and neurological ICUs. In total, 893 EVD-associated meningitis/ventriculitis cases and 225,351 EVD days were included in the risk-factor analysis. After multivariate analysis, 2 factors remained significant: (1) stay in an ICU labeled other than neurosurgical, surgical, interdisciplinary (>400 beds), and neurological as a protective factor and (2) EVD utilization rate above the 75th quantile as a risk factor for acquisition of EVD-associated meningitis/ventriculitis. Conclusions: EVD-associated meningitis and ventriculitis are frequent complications of care in intensive care patients at risk. A long hospital stay and/or the presence of the EVD puts the patient at high risk for pathogen acquisition with subsequent infection.

AB  - It is commonly held that Christian ethics generally and Christian bioethics particularly is the application of Christian moral systems to novel problems engaged by contemporary culture and created by contemporary technology. On this view, Christianity adds its moral vision to a technology, baptizing it for use. In this essay, I show that modern technology is a metaphysical moral worldview that enacts its own moral vision, shaping a moral imaginary, shaping our moral perception, creating moral subjects, and shaping what we imagine as moral intentions. In fact, modern technics has its own liturgics, which is foreign to Christian Divine Liturgy. Divine Liturgy is world forming, showing us a different world than the one that comes into relief in the ersatz liturgy of modern medical technics.

TI  - HIV Risk Profile and Its Socio-demographic Correlates among Long-Distance Truckers in West Bengal, India: Evidence from National HIV Sentinel Surveillance 2017
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Long-distance truckers (LDTs) belong to a special sentinel group with potentially high risk of acquisition of HIV owing to their high mobility, sociodemographic vulnerability, and high-risk behaviors. Objective: The objective is to estimate the prevalence of HIV and identifies its sociodemographic correlates among a representative population of LDTs in West Bengal, India. Methods: Between May and July 2017, HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) was conducted in West Bengal by the National AIDS Control Organization. A total of 749 LDTs were recruited for the study, were interviewed, and tested for HIV. Descriptive and logistic regression analysis of socio-demographics, sexual risk behavior, and HIV serostatus were performed using SAS 9.3.2. Results: The prevalence of HIV among LDT was 1.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.4-2.0). Mean age was 32.8 years (standard deviation 8.5), 77.1% were currently married, 89.9% were literate, 85.7% visited HSS site for collecting condoms or seeking medical care and treatment, 53.1% were rural residents, 86.7% had sex at least once with a female partner other than wife in the past 6 months, 2.7% had sex with a male partner and 1.7% injected drugs for recreational purpose. Higher age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.1 [95% CI = 1.0-1.1]), literate (OR = 0.3 [95% CI = 0.1-0.9]), visiting HSS sites for collecting condoms or seeking medical care and treatment (adjusted OR [AOR] = 0.2 [95% CI = 0.1-0.6]), rural residence (OR = 0.2 [95% CI = 0.1-0.3]) and duration of stay in home (AOR = 1.3 [95% CI = 1.1-1.5]) were found to be significant predictors of having sex with a female partner other than wife.Conclusion: High HIV burden calls for urgency in the implementation of targeted intervention to minimize HIV risk among LDTs in West Bengal to fight against HIV/AIDS.

The Secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) provided the country with a comprehensive set of indicators and information derived from an analysis of global satellite data reflecting key indicators of land degradation in the Kyrgyz Republic. This data set was analyzed at the national level via comparison with data from studies and a series of meetings and consultations with relevant state and nonstate institutions. As a result of the research, a team of national experts was able to compare international (UNCCD data) and national land-use indicators. In particular, a comparative analysis was carried out based on categories of land resources. Nevertheless, the work requires further detailed verification of international and national land use indicators with alternative satellite data, as well as special field studies.

TI  - Digital mapping of coastal boulders - high-resolution data acquisition to infer past and recent transport dynamics
T2  - SEDIMENTOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal boulder fields provide clues to long-term frequency-magnitude patterns of coastal flooding events and have the potential to play an important role in coastal hazard assessment. Mapping boulders in the field is time and labour-intensive, and work on intertidal reef platforms, as in the present study, is physically challenging. By addressing coastal scientists who are not specialists in remote sensing, this contribution reports on the possibilities and limitations of digital applications in boulder mapping in Eastern Samar, Philippines, where recent supertyphoons Haiyan and Hagupit induced high waves, coastal flooding and boulder transport. It is demonstrated how satellite imagery of sub-metre resolution (from Pleiades and WorldView-3 imagery) enables efficient analysis of transport vectors and distances of larger boulders, reflecting variation in latitudes of both typhoon tracks and approaching angles of typhoon-generated waves. During the investigated events, boulders with a-axes of up to 8 m were clearly identified to have been shifted for up to 32 m, mostly along the seaward margin of the boulder field. It is, however, hard to keep track of smaller boulders, and the length of a-axes and b-axes including their orientation is often impossible to map with sufficient accuracy. Orthophotographs and digital surface models created through the application of an unmanned aerial vehicle and the 'Structure from Motion' technique provide ultra-high-resolution data, and have the potential to not only improve the results of satellite image analysis, but also those from field mapping and may significantly reduce overall time in the field. Orthophotographs permit unequivocal mapping of a-axes and b-axes including their orientation, while precise values for c-axes can be derived from the respective digital surface models. Volume of boulders is best inferred from boulder-specific Structure from Motion-based three-dimensional models. Battery power, flight speed and altitude determine the limits of the area covered, while patches shielded by the boulders are difficult to resolve. For some tasks, field mapping remains mandatory and cannot be replaced by currently available remote sensing tools: for example, sampling for rock type, density and age dating, recording of lithological separation of boulders from the underlying geological unit and of geomorphic features on a millimetre to decimetre-scale, or documentation of fine-grained sediment transport in between the boulders in supratidal settings. In terms of future events, the digital products presented here will provide a valuable reference to track boulder transport on a centimetre to decimetre-scale and to better understand the hydrodynamics of extreme-wave events on a fringing reef coastline.

TI  - Harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Time Series Data to Detect Irrigated Areas: An Application in Southern Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Lack of accurate and up-to-date data associated with irrigated areas and related irrigation amounts is hampering the full implementation and compliance of the Water Framework Directive (WFD). In this paper, we describe the framework that we developed and implemented within the DIANA project to map the actual extent of irrigated areas in the Campania region (Southern Italy) during the 2018 irrigation season. For this purpose, we considered 202 images from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) products (57 images from Landsat 8 and 145 images from Sentinel-2). Such data were preprocessed in order to extract a multitemporal Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) map, which was then smoothed through a gap-filling algorithm. We further integrated data coming from high-resolution (4 km) global satellite precipitation Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN)-Cloud Classification System (CCS) products. We collected an extensive ground truth in the field represented by 2992 data points coming from three main thematic classes: bare soil and rainfed (class 0), herbaceous (class 1), and tree crop (class 2). This information was exploited to generate irrigated area maps by adopting a machine learning classification approach. We compared six different types of classifiers through a cross-validation approach and found that, in general, random forests, support vector machines, and boosted decision trees exhibited the best performances in terms of classification accuracy and robustness to different tested scenarios. We found an overall accuracy close to 90% in discriminating among the three thematic classes, which highlighted promising capabilities in the detection of irrigated areas from HLS products.

TI  - Continental-scale land surface phenology from harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dense time series of Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery are creating exciting new opportunities to monitor, map, and characterize temporal dynamics in land surface properties with unprecedented spatial detail and quality. By combining imagery from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the MultiSpectral Instrument on-board Sentinel-2A and -2B, the remote sensing community now has access to moderate (10-30 m) spatial resolution imagery with repeat periods of similar to 3 days in the mid-latitudes. At the same time, the large combined data volume from Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 introduce substantial new challenges for users. Land surface phenology (LSP) algorithms, which estimate the timing of phenophase transitions and quantify the nature and magnitude of seasonality in remotely sensed land surface conditions, provide an intuitive way to reduce data volumes and redundancy, while also furnishing data sets that are useful for a wide range of applications including monitoring ecosystem response to climate variability and extreme events, ecosystem modelling, crop-type discrimination, and land cover, land use, and land cover change mapping, among others. To support the need for operational LSP data sets, here we describe a continental-scale land surface phenology algorithm and data product based on harmonized Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 (HLS) imagery. The algorithm creates high quality times series of vegetation indices from HLS imagery, which are then used to estimate the timing of vegetation phenophase transitions at 30 m spatial resolution. We present results from assessment efforts evaluating LSP retrievals, and provide examples illustrating the character and quality of information related to land cover and terrestrial ecosystem properties provided by the continental LSP dataset that we have developed. The algorithm is highly successful in ecosystems with strong seasonal variation in leaf area (e.g., deciduous forests). Conversely, results in evergreen systems are less interpretable and conclusive.

TI  - 'Democratic Socialism' and the Concept of (Post)Capitalism
T2  - POLITICAL QUARTERLY
M3  - Article
AB  - This article explores the 'democratic socialism' being proposed by new left movements on either side of the Atlantic, and evaluates its claim to be a form of anti- or postcapitalism. It argues that in the democratic socialist worldview, the line between capitalism and socialism rests on the balance of power between workers and capitalists in the economic sphere. While traditional social democracy seeks to redistribute wealth but leaves relations between workers and capitalists within firms untouched, democratic socialism seeks to abolish private property in the economic sphere. Production is controlled democratically by the workers themselves, in league with a workers' state. The article critically appraises the claim that such a scenario constitutes a form of postcapitalism. Drawing on the work of critical Marxists such as Moishe Postone, it argues that capitalism is not primarily defined by private property relations in the economic sphere, but rather the peculiar social form of capitalist labour. Unlike in pre-capitalist societies, for labour in capitalism to secure a continued basis on which to reproduce the means of subsistence, it must be socially validated as 'value-producing'. The criteria for value validation is not set in the workplace, or within a single nation state, but rather on the world market. The article concludes that, for all its merits, the democratisation of workplaces does not overcome the need for this social validation, but rather constitutes an alternative form of managing the process of production in this context. As such, democratic socialism, like social democracy, remains susceptible to the same imperatives and crises as other forms of capitalist production, and so cannot be said to constitute a form of 'postcapitalism'.

TI  - Hydropower's hidden transformation of rivers in the Mekong
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Despite efforts to understand the hydrologic impact of hydropower dams, their influence on downstream river temperatures has gone unnoticed in data limited regions. Using 30 years of Landsat thermal infrared observations (1988-2018), we identified a relationship between dry season water temperature cooling trends and dam development in the 3S Basin, a major tributary of the Mekong River. Within a year of the beginning of operations of major dams in the 3S River Basin, rapid decreases in annual average dry season river temperature were observed ranging between 0.7 degrees C and 2 degrees C. Furthermore, in situ water temperature observations confirmed decreasing river temperature for two major dam development events. Evidence was found that the 3S outflow has been cooling the Mekong River downstream of the confluence, by as much as 0.8 degrees C in recent years. Our findings are critically important for understanding how fish and aquatic ecosystems will behave in the future as more hydropower dams are built in the Mekong River Basin.

TI  - Development of a Bowtie Inversion Technique for Real-Time Processing of the GOES-16/-17 SEISS MPS-HI Electron Channels
T2  - SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Space Environment In-Situ Suite on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-R series of satellites includes a new instrument for measuring radiation belt electrons and protons, the Magnetospheric Particle Sensor-High Energy (MPS-HI). The MPS-HI electron channels cover the energy range 50 keV to 4 MeV. The conversion of raw MPS-HI electron telescope counts to fluxes is based on the so-called bowtie technique. The goal of the bowtie analysis is to calculate for each energy channel an energy/geometric factor pair applicable to a wide range of energy spectra and for which the geometric factor error is minimized. Rather than using idealized analytical spectral functions, we use observed high-resolution spectra from the cross-calibrated Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) Medium Electron Sensor A and High Energy Electron Fluxmeter data set from the period 1990-1991, restricted to 6 L < 8. One thousand randomly selected CRRES spectra are used to perform the bowtie analysis and determine the MPS-HI channel energy/geometric factor characteristics. The results are used to convert the GOES-16/-17 MPS-HI electron counts to fluxes. The same bowtie technique is used to calculate effective energies and geometric factors for the GOES-13/-14 Magnetospheric Electron Detector ME1-ME5 (30-600 keV) electron channels. We compare the fluxes from the various spacecraft (GOES-16/-13, GOES-17/-14, and GOES-16/-17) over periods of several months to determine the applicability and utility of the bowtie analysis. Finally, we compare the GOES-16/-13 fluxes during 22 days of near conjunction. All comparisons show good agreement among the various satellite data sets.

TI  - Spatio-temporal quantification and distribution of diatoms and dinoflagellates associated with algal blooms and human activities in Algiers Bay (Algeria) using Landsat-8 satellite imagery
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying phytoplankton and its changes in coastal waters is an important aspect of marine ecosystems. Synoptic observations of phytoplankton communities became possible with remote sensing technologies and spatial analysis methods. Using these advancements would assist the scientific community to gain better understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics and consequently contribute in sustaining and maintaining these valuable ecosystems. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the water quality and aquatic ecosystem status of Algiers Bay, Algeria, through the quantification of diatoms and dinoflagellates species using in-situ measurements and Landsat images. We developed empirical models to assess phytoplankton abundance by comparing in-situ measurements of diatoms and dinoflagellates with various spectral bands and band ratioing products derived from Landsat-8 OLI images acquired in 4 April 2017 and 9 May 2018. The results showed a wide variation between coastal and offshore stations. The number of diatoms was less than that of dinoflagellates. These two algae communities illustrated a different spectral behavior. Diatoms showed a significant relationship with one of the ratioing products (i.e., log B7/log B2), whereas dinoflagellates exhibited an insignificant relationship with the remotely sensed dataset. Also, we learned that the southeastern area of the bay can be influenced by harmful algae blooms developed offshore because of hydrodynamic forces that push these blooms toward this area of the bay.

TI  - Classifying grass-dominated habitats from remotely sensed data: The influence of spectral resolution, acquisition time and the vegetation classification system on accuracy and thematic resolution
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed maps of vegetation facilitate spatial conservation planning. Such information can be difficult to map from remotely sensed data with the detail (thematic resolution) required for ecological applications.For grass-dominated habitats in the South-East of the UK, it was evaluated which of the following choices improved classification accuracies at various thematic resolutions: 1) Hyperspectral data versus data with a reduced spectral resolution of eight and 13 bands, which were simulated from the hyperspectral data. 2) A vegetation classification system using a detailed description of vegetation (sub)communities (the British National Vegetation Classification, NVC) versus clustering based on the dominant plant species (Dom-Species). 3) The month of imagery acquisition.Hyperspectral data produced the highest accuracies for vegetation away from edges using the NVC (84-87%). Simulated 13-band data performed also well (83-86% accuracy). Simulated 8-band data performed poorer at finer thematic resolutions (77-78% accuracy), but produced accuracies similar to those from simulated 13-band or hyperspectral data for coarser thematic resolutions (82-86%). Grouping vegetation by NVC (84-87% accuracy for hyperspectral data) usually achieved higher accuracies compared to Dom-Species (81-84% for hyperspectral data). Highest discrimination rates were achieved around the time vegetation was fully developed.The results suggest that using a detailed description of vegetation (sub)-communities instead of one based on the dominating species can result in more accurate mapping. The NVC may reflect differences in site conditions in addition to differences in the composition of dominant species, which may benefit vegetation classification. The results also suggest that using hyperspectral data or the 13-band multispectral data can help to achieve the fine thematic resolutions that are often required in ecological applications. Accurate vegetation maps with a high thematic resolution can benefit a range of applications, such as species and habitat conservation. (C) 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - RSV Reprograms the CDK9•BRD4 Chromatin Remodeling Complex to Couple Innate Inflammation to Airway Remodeling
T2  - VIRUSES-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - Respiratory syncytial virus infection is responsible for seasonal upper and lower respiratory tract infections worldwide, causing substantial morbidity. Self-inoculation of the virus into the nasopharynx results in epithelial replication and distal spread into the lower respiratory tract. Here, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activates sentinel cells important in the host inflammatory response, resulting in epithelial-derived cytokine and interferon (IFN) expression resulting in neutrophilia, whose intensity is associated with disease severity. I will synthesize key findings describing how RSV replication activates intracellular NF kappa B and IRF signaling cascades controlling the innate immune response (IIR). Recent studies have implicated a central role for Scg1a1(+) expressing progenitor cells in IIR, a cell type uniquely primed to induce neutrophilic-, T helper 2 (Th2)-polarizing-, and fibrogenic cytokines that play distinct roles in disease pathogenesis. Molecular studies have linked the positive transcriptional elongation factor-b (P-TEFb), a pleiotrophic chromatin remodeling complex in immediate-early IIR gene expression. Through intrinsic kinase activity of cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 9 and atypical histone acetyl transferase activity of bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), P-TEFb mediates transcriptional elongation of IIR genes. Unbiased proteomic studies show that the CDK9 center dot BRD4 complex is dynamically reconfigured by the innate response and targets TGF beta-dependent fibrogenic gene networks. Chronic activation of CDK9 center dot BRD4 mediates chromatin remodeling fibrogenic gene networks that cause epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mesenchymal transitioned epithelial cells elaborate TGF beta and IL6 that function in a paracrine manner to expand the population of subepithelial myofibroblasts. These findings may account for the long-term reduction in pulmonary function in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). Modifying chromatin remodeling properties of the CDK9 center dot BRD4 coactivators may provide a mechanism for reducing post-infectious airway remodeling that are a consequence of severe RSV LRTIs.

TI  - Analyzing Potential Tree-Planting Sites and Tree Coverage in Mexico City Using Satellite Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Locating potential tree-planting sites and analyzing tree canopy cover is important in the planning and management of urban forests. This paper reports the quantification of potential planting sites as well as tree canopy cover in the urban area of Mexico City, estimated by means of SPOT (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) 6 satellite images and a supervised pixel-based classification approach. Results showed an estimated area of 3100.7 ha of potentially useful sites, including places with bare soil and grass-covered areas such as median strips, roundabouts and parks. An average tree canopy cover of 10.6% and an average impervious surface of 79.2% for the 15 boroughs were also analyzed. The area of potential planting sites would represent a 5% gain for the current tree canopy cover if it were to be planted. With an overall accuracy of 92.4%, the use of both images from the SPOT 6 sensor and the classification approach proved to be appropriate for obtaining thematic covers in the urban environment of Mexico City.

TI  - A smart multiple spatial and temporal resolution system to support precision agriculture from satellite images: Proof of concept on Aglianico vineyard
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this century, one of the main objectives of agriculture is sustainability addressed to achieve food security, based on the improvement of use efficiency of farm resources, the increasing of crop yield and quality, under climate change conditions. The optimization of farm resources, as well as the control of soil degradation processes (e.g., soil erosion), can be realized through crop monitoring in the field, aiming to manage the local spatial variability (time and space) with a high resolution. In the case of high profitability crops, as the case of vineyards for high-quality wines, the capability to manage and follow spatial behavior of plants during the season represents an opportunity to improve farmer incomes and preserve the environmental health. However, any field monitoring represents an additional cost for the farmer, which slows down the objective of a diffuse sustainable agriculture.Satellite multispectral images have been widely used for production management in large areas. However, their observation is limited by the pre-defined and fixed scale with relatively coarse spatial resolution, resulting in limitations in their application.In this paper, encouraged by recent achievements in convolutional neural network (CNN), a multiscale full-connected CNN is constructed for the pan-sharpening of Sentinel-2A images by UAV images. The reconstructed data are validated by independent multispectral UAV images and in-situ spectral measurements. The reconstructed Sentinel-2A images provide a temporal evaluation of plant responses using selected vegetation indices. The proposed methodology has been tested on plant measurements taken either in-vivo and through the retrospective reconstruction of the eco-physiological vine behavior, by the evaluation of water conductivity and water use efficiency indexes from anatomical and isotopic traits recorded in vine trunk wood.In this study, the use of such a methodology able to combine the pro and cons of space-borne and UAVs data to evaluate plant responses, with high spatial and temporal resolution, has been applied in a vineyard of southern Italy by analyzing the period from 2015 to 2018. The obtained results have shown a good correspondence between the vegetation indexes obtained from reconstructed Sentinel-2A data and plant hydraulic traits obtained from tree-ring based retrospective reconstruction of vine eco-physiological behavior.

TI  - Determining forest parameters for avalanche simulation using remote sensing data
T2  - COLD REGIONS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mountain forests offer effective, natural and cost-efficient protection against avalanches. Trees reduce the probability of an avalanche formation and can significantly decelerate small to medium size avalanches. Remote sensing methods enable an efficient assessment of forest structural parameters on large scale and therefore determine the protective capacity of a specific forest. The aims of this study are: (i) to evaluate the quality of forest structural parameters obtained from remote sensing data using two different methods; and (ii) to determine how forest parameters and forest cover changes influence avalanche runout. We compared the control assessment of maximum tree height and crown coverage in 107 plots (50 in evergreen and 57 in deciduous forests). The same parameters were analysed using (i) a photogrammetry-based vegetation height model (VHMP) and (ii) a LiDAR-based vegetation height model (VHML). The control assessment of surface roughness was compared to the analysis of a digital terrain model (DTM). We then simulated two avalanche case studies near Davos (Switzerland) with forest parameters estimated by the remote sensing and control methods. Tree height and crown coverage assessed with both remote sensing methods (VHMP and VHML) did not differ significantly from the control measurements. However, surface roughness was underestimated. This had a significant influence on simulation results. For the first case study, a wet-snow avalanche, the simulated runout distances did not differ significantly, when using forest parameters from either of the two tested remote sensing methods. The simulated runout distance increased for an avalanche scenario with less forest cover in the release area and/or less forest cover after forest destruction by a preceding avalanche event. For the second case study, a dry-snow avalanche, the forest cover was underestimated by the VHMP, which led to longer simulated runout distances. Our study indicates that available remote sensing methods are increasingly suitable for the determination of forest parameters which are relevant for avalanche simulation models. However, more research is needed on the precise estimation of forest cover in release areas and understanding how forest cover changes affect avalanche runout.

TI  - Intertidal Bathymetry Extraction with Multispectral Images: A Logistic Regression Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, a methodology to estimate the intertidal bathymetry from multispectral remote sensing images is presented. The technique is based on the temporal variability of the water and the intertidal zone reflectance and their correlation with the tidal height. The water spectral behavior is characterized by high absorption at the infrared (IR) band or radiation with higher wavelengths. Due to tidal cycles, pixels on the intertidal zone have higher temporal variability on the near IR spectral reflectance. The variability of IR reflectivity in time is modeled through a sigmoid function of three parameters, where the inflection parameter corresponds to the pixel elevation. The methodology was tested at the Tagus river estuary in Lisbon, Portugal, and at the Bijagos archipelago, in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau. Multispectral images from Sentinel-2 satellites were used, after atmospheric corrections from ACOLITE processor and the derived bathymetric model validated with in situ data. The presented method does not require additional depth data for calibration, and the output can generate intertidal digital elevation models at 10 m spatial resolution, without any manual editing by the operator. The results show a standard deviation of 0.34 m at the Tagus tidal zone, with -0.50 m bias, performing better than the Stumpf ratio transform algorithm, also applied to the test areas to derive intertidal bathymetry. This methodology can be used to update intertidal elevation models with clear benefits to monitoring of intertidal dynamics, morphodynamic modeling, and cartographic update.

TI  - Estimating evapotranspiration in a semi-arid catchment: A comparison of hydrological modelling and remote-sensing approaches
T2  - WATER SA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable spatial data of evapotranspiration (ET) in support of water resources management re limited, ET is a major component of the water balance, in many regions, and therefore it is critical that it be accurately quantified. To identify a product that accurately estimates spatially distributed ET for application in data-scarce regions, an inter-model comparison was conducted between the MOD16 ET dataset and the ET calculated with the calibrated and validated JAMS/12000 hydrological model in the Sandspruit catchment (South Africa). Annual JAMS-ET and MOD16-ET data were generally consistent. Monthly JAMS-ET and MOD16-ET dynamics are influenced by the response of vegetation to precipitation as well as the atmospheric evaporative demand. The maximum correlation coefficient between JAMS-ET and MOD16-ET was 0.82 and it was evident at Lag 0, showing that both ET estimates are in phase when evaluated at the basin scale. The maximum correlation coefficients between the ET estimators and precipitation were 0.67 and 0.70 for JAMS-ET and MOD16-ET, respectively, and this was evident at Lag 2 (1 lag is 1 month) for both methods. This suggests that there is a 2-month delay in the maximum response of ET to precipitation. The models did not exhibit significant dependence on the seasonal distribution of precipitation. The complementary use of hydrological modelling and satellite-derived data may be greatly advantageous to water resources management, e.g., water allocation studies, ecological reserve determinations and vegetation water use studies. The results of the inter-model comparison also provide motivation for the use of the MOD16 ET dataset to estimate ET in data-scarce regions. Additionally, this study provides evidence for the potential use of validated satellite-based ET data as inputs in hydrological models. This may facilitate a more realistic representation of the catchment hydrological processes.

TI  - Adjacency radiance around a small island: implications for system vicarious calibrations
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The adjacency radiance field surrounding a small island (i.e., the Lampedusa Island in the Central Mediterranean Sea) was theoretically analyzed to address implications on a hypothetical nearby system vicarious calibration (SVC) infrastructure for satellite ocean color sensors. Simulations, performed in the visible and near-infrared regions for the Ocean Land Color Instrument (OLCI) operated onboard Sentinel-3 satellites, show different patterns of adjacency effects (AE) around the island. In the direction of the reflected sunbeam (i.e., in the north-western region), AE mainly originate by missing glint contributions from the sea surface masked by the island. These AE are mainly negative, decrease with wavelength, and strongly depend on sea surface anisotropy (i.e., sea state) and illumination conditions; this hinders the capability to provide a general unique description of their features. In the remaining marine regions, AE are positive and do not exceed the radiometric sensitivity of OLCI data beyond approximately 14 km from the coast. At shorter distances, uncertainties in satellite radiance due to AE would hence not allow fulfilling requirements for SVC. (C) 2020 Optical Society of America

TI  - Best practices in near-infrared fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green (NIRF/ICG)-guided robotic urologic surgery: a systematic review-based expert consensus
T2  - WORLD JOURNAL OF UROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Purpose The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of the near-infrared (NIRF) technology with indocyanine green (ICG) in robotic urologic surgery by performing a systematic literature review and to provide evidence-based expert recommendations on best practices in this field. Methods All English language publications on NIRF/ICG-guided robotic urologic procedures were evaluated. We followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) statement to evaluate PubMed(R), Scopus(R) and Web of Science (TM) databases (up to April 2019). Experts in the field provided detailed pictures and intraoperative video-clips of different NIRF/ICG-guided robotic surgeries with recommendations for each procedure. A unique QRcode was generated and linked to each underlying video-clip. This new exclusive feature makes the present the first "dynamic paper" that merges text and figure description with their own video providing readers an innovative, immersive, high-quality and user-friendly experience. Results Our electronic search identified a total of 576 papers. Of these, 36 studies included in the present systematic review reporting the use of NIRF/ICG in robotic partial nephrectomy (n = 13), robotic radical prostatectomy and lymphadenectomy (n = 7), robotic ureteral re-implantation and reconstruction (n = 5), robotic adrenalectomy (n = 4), robotic radical cystectomy (n = 3), penectomy and robotic inguinal lymphadenectomy (n = 2), robotic simple prostatectomy (n = 1), robotic kidney transplantation (n = 1) and robotic sacrocolpopexy (n = 1). Conclusion NIRF/ICG technology has now emerged as a safe, feasible and useful tool that may facilitate urologic robotic surgery. It has been shown to improve the identification of key anatomical landmarks and pathological structures for oncological and non-oncological procedures. Level of evidence is predominantly low. Larger series with longer follow-up are needed, especially in assessing the quality of the nodal dissection and the feasibility of the identification of sentinel nodes and the impact of these novel technologies on long-term oncological and functional outcomes.

TI  - GHS-POP Accuracy Assessment: Poland and Portugal Case Study
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Global Human Settlement Population Grid (GHS-POP) the latest released global gridded population dataset based on remotely sensed data and developed by the EU Joint Research Centre, depicts the distribution and density of the total population as the number of people per grid cell. This study aims to assess the GHS-POP data accuracy based on root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the correlation coefficient. The study was conducted for Poland and Portugal, countries characterized by different population distribution as well as two spatial resolutions of 250 m and 1 km on the GHS-POP. The main findings show that as the size of administrative zones decreases (from NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) to LAU (local administrative unit)) and the size of the GHS-POP increases, the difference between the population counts reported by the European Statistical Office and estimated by the GHS-POP algorithm becomes larger. At the national level, MAPE ranges from 1.8% to 4.5% for the 250 m and 1 km resolutions of GHS-POP data in Portugal and 1.5% to 1.6%, respectively in Poland. At the local level, however, the error rates range from 4.5% to 5.8% in Poland, for 250 m and 1 km, and 5.7% to 11.6% in Portugal, respectively. Moreover, the results show that for densely populated regions the GHS-POP underestimates the population number, while for thinly populated regions it overestimates. The conclusions of this study are expected to serve as a quality reference for potential users and producers of population density datasets.

TI  - Near-reef and nearshore tropical cyclone wave climate in the Great Barrier Reef with and without reef structure
T2  - COASTAL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Great Barrier Reef (GBR) coral coverage is in rapid decline from severe and sustained pressures from lagoon water quality, crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), coral bleaching, tropical cyclones, pollution and diseases. The two recent GBR coral bleaching events (2016-2017) lead to Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority (GBRMPA) shifting their focus from passive management to active intervention (Great Barrier Reef Blueprint for resilience by GBRMPA). These active interventions, potentially able to increase GBR resilience, as there are reefs that, due to their physical location relative to all other reefs, river and estuary entrances, ocean currents, have favourable coral growth conditions. To undertake such interventions, various information is required including tropical cyclone wave climates. This paper develops tropical cyclone wave climates for the entire GBR. These wave climates were developed by simulating several thousand synthetic cyclones derived from the "HadGEM" general circulation model with RCP8.5 climate change scenario. The synthetic cyclones adopted herein include the following climate changes assessed by comparing averages of key forcing parameters between 1950 to 1999 and 2050 to 2099. Their average arrival rate increases from 2.25 to 2.41 cyclones/year and their average maximum wind speed increases from 24 to 28 m/s. Their average radius to maximum winds remains constant at 51 km. Two key challenges were resolved, namely, long runtimes and large files (600 m grid increment covering 1800 km by 280 km). Runtimes were reduced by excluding cyclones where their wind speeds over the entire event never exceeded 10 m/s within GBR itself or within 100 km of the GBR over water. Maximum wave heights were compared with an extended fetch empirical expression, which was based on satellite data of tropical cyclones in open waters, when cyclones were outside the GBR lagoon. These comparisons indicate that predicted wave heights have a lower bias using default wave generation parameters when compared with the extended fetch empirical expression. Prediction uncertainty was estimated at no more than 10% from various cyclonic windfield models. The existing GBR reefs reduce nearshore wave or runup height by between 1.5 and 2 times compared to the no reef case. The reduction in wave or runup height was found to be minimal for 1 m sea level rise. These two findings indicate that there is more flooding potential from coral removal than SLR within the GBR lagoon.

TI  - Machine Learning Regression Model for Predicting Honey Harvests
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Honey yield from apiary sites varies significantly between years. This affects the beekeeper's ability to manage hive health, as well as honey production. This also has implications for ecosystem services, such as forage availability for nectarivores or seed sets. This study investigates whether machine learning methods can develop predictive harvest models of a key nectar source for honeybees, Corymbia calophylla (marri) trees from South West Australia, using data from weather stations and remotely sensed datasets. Honey harvest data, weather and vegetation-related datasets from satellite sensors were input features for machine learning algorithms. Regression trees were able to predict the marri honey harvested per hive to a Mean Average Error (MAE) of 10.3 kg. Reducing input features based on their relative model importance achieved a MAE of 11.7 kg using the November temperature as the sole input feature, two months before marri trees typically start to produce nectar. Combining weather and satellite data and machine learning has delivered a model that quantitatively predicts harvest potential per hive. This can be used by beekeepers to adaptively manage their apiary. This approach may be readily applied to other regions or forage species, or used for the assessment of some ecosystem services.

TI  - An Improved Res-UNet Model for Tree Species Classification Using Airborne High-Resolution Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tree species classification is important for the management and sustainable development of forest resources. Traditional object-oriented tree species classification methods, such as support vector machines, require manual feature selection and generally low accuracy, whereas deep learning technology can automatically extract image features to achieve end-to-end classification. Therefore, a tree classification method based on deep learning is proposed in this study. This method combines the semantic segmentation network U-Net and the feature extraction network ResNet into an improved Res-UNet network, where the convolutional layer of the U-Net network is represented by the residual unit of ResNet, and linear interpolation is used instead of deconvolution in each upsampling layer. At the output of the network, conditional random fields are used for post-processing. This network model is used to perform classification experiments on airborne orthophotos of Nanning Gaofeng Forest Farm in Guangxi, China. The results are then compared with those of U-Net and ResNet networks. The proposed method exhibits higher classification accuracy with an overall classification accuracy of 87%. Thus, the proposed model can effectively implement forest tree species classification and provide new opportunities for tree species classification in southern China.

TI  - Improving phenological monitoring of winter wheat by considering sensor spectral response in spatiotemporal image fusion
T2  - PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Multisensor image fusion results may deviate from accurately reflecting the phenological stages of winter wheat because different responses of satellite sensors to the spectrum lead to the radiometric inconsistency between different remote sensing images. To reduce the effect of the difference in the physical electromagnetic spectrum responses between sensors on monitoring the phenological stages of winter wheat by fusion results, Sensor Spectral Response (SSR) should be considered in spatiotemporal fusion methods. This paper proposes a novel image fusion model by introducing SSR into the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM). The contribution of SSR in minimizing the effect of the system difference between sensors on image fusion products is parameterized as a calibration factor by matrixing operation, which is able to offset the systematic inconsistency between different sensor images. Linear regression equation for different land cover type and spectral band is established to calculate the weights needed in STARFM for improving the selection of neighboring spectrally similar pixels. This proposed method is evaluated using one satellite datasets including four ZY-3 (5.8 m) and Landsat 8 OLI (30 m) scenes which are acquired during the growth stages of winter wheat from seedling to harvest. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation shows that the proposed method can better monitor the phenology of winter wheat with an improved spatial and temporal consistency with the observations than STARFM.

TI  - Landsat Images Classification Algorithm (LICA) to Automatically Extract Land Cover Information in Google Earth Engine Environment
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing has been recognized as the main technique to extract land cover/land use (LC/LU) data, required to address many environmental issues. Therefore, over the years, many approaches have been introduced and explored to optimize the resultant classification maps. Particularly, index-based methods have highlighted its efficiency and effectiveness in detecting LC/LU in a multitemporal and multisensors analysis perspective. Nevertheless, the developed indices are suitable to extract a specific class but not to completely classify the whole area. In this study, a new Landsat Images Classification Algorithm (LICA) is proposed to automatically detect land cover (LC) information using satellite open data provided by different Landsat missions in order to perform a multitemporal and multisensors analysis. All the steps of the proposed method were implemented within Google Earth Engine (GEE) to automatize the procedure, manage geospatial big data, and quickly extract land cover information. The algorithm was tested on the experimental site of Siponto, a historic municipality located in Apulia Region (Southern Italy) using 12 radiometrically and atmospherically corrected satellite images collected from Landsat archive (four images, one for each season, were selected from Landsat 5, 7, and 8, respectively). Those images were initially used to assess the performance of 82 traditional spectral indices. Since their classification accuracy and the number of identified LC categories were not satisfying, an analysis of the different spectral signatures existing in the study area was also performed, generating a new algorithm based on the sequential application of two new indices (SwirTirRed (STRed) index and SwiRed index). The former was based on the integration of shortwave infrared (SWIR), thermal infrared (TIR), and red bands, whereas the latter featured a combination of SWIR and red bands. The performance of LICA was preferable to those of conventional indices both in terms of accuracy and extracted classes number (water, dense and sparse vegetation, mining areas, built-up areas versus water, and dense and sparse vegetation). GEE platform allowed us to go beyond desktop system limitations, reducing acquisition and processing times for geospatial big data.

TI  - Effect of the digestible protein-energy relationship on the growth performance of Nile tilapia (<i>Oreochromis niloticus</i>) fed fishmeal-free diets
T2  - ANIMAL FEED SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aimed to determine the best digestible protein: digestible energy (DP:DE) ratio for adult Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) fed diets formulated with vegetable ingredients (soybean and corn), and without fishmeal. Four hundred and twenty male Nile tilapia (GIFT strain) (initial mean weight 193 +/- 12.6 g) were allocated to 60 plastic tanks (1000 L) connected to a water recirculation system, and there were 7 fish in each tank. The experimental design was a 5 x 4 factorial with three replicates for each diet treatment. The fish were fed one of 20 diets containing a combination of five digestible protein levels (140, 190, 240, 290 and 340 g/kg DP) and four digestible energy levels (10.89, 11.72, 12.56 and 13.40 MJ/kg DE) for 96 days. The fish were given three meals each day (8 AM, 1 PM and 6 PM) and feeding was to apparent satiation. At the end of the experimental period, diets presented an interactive effect (P < 0.05) in relation to the productive performance. Final weight (FW = 448.82 g), fillet yield (FY = 32.60 %) and specific growth ratio (SGR = 2.65 %) were increased and a decrease in feed conversion ratio (FCR = 1.20) was observed in diet containing 240 g/kg DP and 12.56 MJ/kg DE. Otherwise, the highest protein efficiency ratio (P < 0.05) was found in diet containing 140 g/kg DP and 12.56 MJ/kg DE. FW, WG, FY and SGR were increased significantly (P < 0.05) up to the 12.56 MJ/kg DE level, independent of digestible protein levels. A quadratic effect was observed for FW, WG and SGR, independent of energy levels. An increase in these variables was observed up to 250.78, 240.70 and 216.70 g/kg DP respectively, and the lowest FCR was 260.58 g/kg DP. A linear increase was observed for FY (P < 0.05) in diets containing higher DP levels. No interaction (P > 0.05) was observed in any treatment for fillet centesimal composition and whole body. However, an increase (P < 0.05) in crude protein of fillet and body moisture was observed in diets containing levels above 240 g/kg DP, independent of DE. The present findings indicate that the optimal DP:DE level was 240 g/kg DP and 12.56 MJ/kg DE in the fishmeal-free diets for males Nile tilapia, promoting adequate growth performance without affecting the proximal tissue composition.

TI  - Fluvial and oceanographic influences on suspended sediment dispersal in the Magdalena River Estuary
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Magdalena River is the main contributor of fresh water and sediment to the Caribbean Sea. Hydrological inputs from the Magdalena River are 10,287 and 4068 m(3) s(-1) at high and low flows, respectively. Sediment delivery from the Magdalena River is among the largest in the world, with 142 x 10(6) t yr(-1) of transported suspended matter. We used MODIS images to develop a regional model and assess the spatial and temporal variability of suspended sediment concentration at the mouth of the Magdalena River, map the extent of the turbidity plume using its morphometric properties, and identify the main fluvial and oceanographic factors associated with plume variability. We analyzed monthly average suspended sediment concentration data for the period 2003-2017. MODIS images were calibrated with in situ measurements of suspended sediment concentrations in surface waters of the study area. A finite mixing model was used to identify turbidity thresholds and define areas within the plume. Calculated suspended sediment concentrations indicate high turbidity in the Magdalena River mouth (178.6 +/- 78.7 mg L-1), values that are of the same order of magnitude as those measured in the Yangtze, Huang He and Amazon River mouths. Calculated plume areas (diffuse, solid and mixing) and their shapes suggest that the Magdalena River plume has a limited area, related to conditions such as wind speed and direction, streamflow, and sediment transport. Calculated areas and shapes demonstrate the ability to generate a near-field area, which indicates the presence of a clear convergence front. The data also emphasize the importance of sediment transport from the Magdalena River to the Caribbean Sea. Such fluvial transport is important in the biogeochemistry of estuarine systems, especially in turbid estuaries, where there is marked variability in the distribution of sediment in surface waters.

TI  - Atmospheric extinction levels of solar radiation using aerosol optical thickness satellite data. Validation methodology with measurement system
T2  - RENEWABLE ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to make the concentrating solar power (CSP) more competitive, an accurate prediction of the solar radiation incident on CSP tower plant receivers is necessary. The extinction in the heliostat-receiver pathway plays an important role in the optical loss of the solar field and therefore, in the performance of the plant. In order to correctly operate these kind of plants and to select new potential emplacements, it is necessary to know the on-site levels of extinction. A methodology was developed in another published work, called Extinction AOT method (EAM), with the purpose of finding out the levels of extinction present at a location using AERONET AOT as input data. However, there is no AERONETAOT data available at any potential site of interest for setting up a solar tower plant, so, alternative approaches were necessary. This paper proposes to determine levels of extinction at any location using AOT satellite data instead of AERONET data. These results have been compared with results obtained applying the EAM with AERONET data and using real extinction measurements obtained with the CIEMAT extinction measurement system. The extinction obtained at PSA has been 5% in all cases considering the error rates. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Sky Quality Meter and satellite correlation for night cloud-cover analysis at astronomical sites
T2  - MONTHLY NOTICES OF THE ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - The analysis of night cloud cover is very important for astronomical observations in real time, considering a typical observation time of about 15 minutes, and to provide statistics. In this article, we use the Sky Quality Meter (SQM) for high-resolution temporal analysis of the La Silla and Asiago (Ekar Observatory) sky: 3 and 5 minutes respectively. We investigate the annual temporal evolution of the natural contributions of the sky at a site not influenced by artificial light at night (ALAN) and at one highly influenced. We also make a correlation between GOES and Aqua satellite data and ground-based SQM data to confirm the relationship between the SQM data and cloud cover. We develop an algorithm that allows the use of the SQM for night cloud detection and reach correlations with the nighttime cloud cover detected by the GOES and Aqua satellites of 97.2 per cent at La Silla and 94.6 per cent at Asiago. Our algorithm also classifies photometric (PN) and spectroscopic nights ( SN). We measure 59.1 per cent PN and 21.7 per cent SN for a total percentage of clear nights of 80.8 per cent at La Silla in 2018. The respective Ekar Observatory values are 31.1 per cent PN, 24.0 per cent SN and 55.1 per cent of total clear night time. Application to the SQM network would involve the development of long-term statistics and large data forecasting models for site testing and real-time astronomical observation.

TI  - Toward Universal Stripe Removal via Wavelet-Based Deep Convolutional Neural Network
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Stripe noise from different remote sensing imaging systems varies considerably in terms of response, length, angle, and periodicity. Due to the complex distributions of different stripes, the destriping results of previous methods may be oversmoothed or contain residual stripe. To overcome this key problem, we provide a comprehensive analysis of existing destriping methods and propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for handling various kinds of stripes. Moreover, previous methods individually model the stripe or the image priors, which may lose the relationship between them. In this article, a two-stream CNN is designed to simultaneously model the stripe and image, which better facilitates distinguishing them from each other. Moreover, we incorporate the wavelet into our CNN model for better directional feature representation. Therefore, the CNN learns the discriminative representation from the external data set, while the wavelet models the internal directionality of the stripe, in which both the internal and external priors are beneficial to the destriping task. In addition, the wavelet extracts the multiscale information with a larger receptive field for global contextual information modeling; thus, we can better distinguish the stripe from the similar image line pattern structures. The proposed method has been extensively evaluated on a number of data sets and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by substantially a large margin in terms of quantitative and qualitative assessments, speed, and robustness.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Boreal Wetlands 2: Methods for Evaluating Boreal Wetland Ecosystem State and Drivers of Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - The following review is the second part of a two part series on the use of remotely sensed data for quantifying wetland extent and inferring or measuring condition for monitoring drivers of change on wetland environments. In the first part, we introduce policy makers and non-users of remotely sensed data with an effective feasibility guide on how data can be used. In the current review, we explore the more technical aspects of remotely sensed data processing and analysis using case studies within the literature. Here we describe: (a) current technologies used for wetland assessment and monitoring; (b) the latest algorithmic developments for wetland assessment; (c) new technologies; and (d) a framework for wetland sampling in support of remotely sensed data collection. Results illustrate that high or fine spatial resolution pixels (<= 10 m) are critical for identifying wetland boundaries and extent, and wetland class, form and type, but are not required for all wetland sizes. Average accuracies can be up to 11% better (on average) than medium resolution (11-30 m) data pixels when compared with field validation. Wetland size is also a critical factor such that large wetlands may be almost as accurately classified using medium-resolution data (average = 76% accuracy, stdev = 21%). Decision-tree and machine learning algorithms provide the most accurate wetland classification methods currently available, however, these also require sampling of all permutations of variability. Hydroperiod accuracy, which is dependent on instantaneous water extent for single time period datasets does not vary greatly with pixel resolution when compared with field data (average = 87%, 86%) for high and medium resolution pixels, respectively. The results of this review provide users with a guideline for optimal use of remotely sensed data and suggested field methods for boreal and global wetland studies.

TI  - Remote Sensing of Boreal Wetlands 1: Data Use for Policy and Management
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Wetlands have and continue to undergo rapid environmental and anthropogenic modification and change to their extent, condition, and therefore, ecosystem services. In this first part of a two-part review, we provide decision-makers with an overview on the use of remote sensing technologies for the 'wise use of wetlands', following Ramsar Convention protocols. The objectives of this review are to provide: (1) a synthesis of the history of remote sensing of wetlands, (2) a feasibility study to quantify the accuracy of remotely sensed data products when compared with field data based on 286 comparisons found in the literature from 209 articles, (3) recommendations for best approaches based on case studies, and (4) a decision tree to assist users and policymakers at numerous governmental levels and industrial agencies to identify optimal remote sensing approaches based on needs, feasibility, and cost. We argue that in order for remote sensing approaches to be adopted by wetland scientists, land-use managers, and policymakers, there is a need for greater understanding of the use of remote sensing for wetland inventory, condition, and underlying processes at scales relevant for management and policy decisions. The literature review focuses on boreal wetlands primarily from a Canadian perspective, but the results are broadly applicable to policymakers and wetland scientists globally, providing knowledge on how to best incorporate remotely sensed data into their monitoring and measurement procedures. This is the first review quantifying the accuracy and feasibility of remotely sensed data and data combinations needed for monitoring and assessment. These include, baseline classification for wetland inventory, monitoring through time, and prediction of ecosystem processes from individual wetlands to a national scale.

TI  - Establishing an Empirical Model for Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval at the US Climate Reference Network Using Sentinel-1 Backscatter and Ancillary Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Progress in sensor technologies has allowed real-time monitoring of soil water. It is a challenge to model soil water content based on remote sensing data. Here, we retrieved and modeled surface soil moisture (SSM) at the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) stations using Sentinel-1 backscatter data from 2016 to 2018 and ancillary data. Empirical machine learning models were established between soil water content measured at the USCRN stations with Sentinel-1 data from 2016 to 2017, the National Land Cover Dataset, terrain parameters, and Polaris soil data, and were evaluated in 2018 at the same USCRN stations. The Cubist model performed better than the multiple linear regression (MLR) and Random Forest (RF) model (R-2 = 0.68 and RMSE = 0.06 m(3) m(-3) for validation). The Cubist model performed best in Shrub/Scrub, followed by Herbaceous and Cultivated Crops but poorly in Hay/Pasture. The success of SSM retrieval was mostly attributed to soil properties, followed by Sentinel-1 backscatter data, terrain parameters, and land cover. The approach shows the potential for retrieving SSM using Sentinel-1 data in a combination of high-resolution ancillary data across the conterminous United States (CONUS). Future work is required to improve the model performance by including more SSM network measurements, assimilating Sentinel-1 data with other microwave, optical and thermal remote sensing products. There is also a need to improve the spatial resolution and accuracy of land surface parameter products (e.g., soil properties and terrain parameters) at the regional and global scales.

TI  - The impact of land-use/land cover changes on water balance of the heterogeneous Buzi sub-catchment, Zimbabwe
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The nature of interactions between ecological, physical and hydrological characteristics that determine the effects of land cover change on surface and sub-surface hydrology is not well understood in both natural and disturbed environments. The spatiotemporal dynamics of water fluxes and their relationship with land cover changes between 2009 and 2017 in the headwater Buzi sub-catchment in Zimbabwe is evaluated. To achieve this, land cover dynamics for the area under study were characterised from the 30 m Landsat data, using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm. After the land cover classification, the key water balance components namely; interception, transpiration and evapotranspiration (ET) contributions for each class in 2009 and 2017 were estimated. Image classification of Landsat data achieved good overall accuracies above 80% for the two periods. Results showed that the percentage of the plantation land cover types decreased slightly between 2009 (25.4%) and 2017 (22.5%). Partitioning the annual interception, transpiration and ET according to land cover classes showed that the highest amounts of ET in the basin were from plantation where land cover types with tea had the highest interception, transpiration and ET in the catchment. Higher ET, interception and transpiration were observed in the eastern parts of the catchment. At catchment level, results show that 2017 had a higher water balance than 2009, which was partly explained by the decrease in plantation cover type.

TI  - Remote sensing image quality evaluation based on deep support value learning networks
T2  - SIGNAL PROCESSING-IMAGE COMMUNICATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Aiming at the problem that the remote sensing image quality evaluation models with manually extracted features lack robustness and generality, this paper proposes a 3D CNN-based architecture and nuclear power plant for accurate remote sensing image quality assessment. The model incorporates two sub-networks. The DSVL-based sub-network is employed to extract multi-scale, multi-direction and high-level features by layer-wise training. Afterwards, the extracted feature maps are fused as flowed as input data of the second sub-network, which is designed with 3D CNN architecture and nuclear power plant for remote sensing image quality assessment. Experimental results on remote sensing image quality database from the GeoEye-1 and WorldView-2 satellites show that the proposed model can optimally discover the essential features of the image and effectively extract the high-frequency information of each level of image, and has better overall quality assessment performance than the other state-of-the-art methods.

T2  - FOOD BIOSCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Yams (Dioscorea spp.) are widely cultivated as a vegetable and as herbal medicines in China. Although the analysis of volatile components is important for edible vegetables, less is known about yam's volatiles. The aim of this work was to investigate the differences in the volatile compositions of Chinese yams and to explore the varietal and geographical influences on their volatile compositions. A total of 84 volatile compounds were identified from 11 varieties of Chinese yams using HS-SPME-GC-MS/MS. Alcohols and ethers such as 1-octen-3-ol and anthole were identified as the universal characteristic volatile components in Chinese yams. Principal components analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis showed two clear clusters: Ziyu yam and other yams, and variety was a more important factor than producing area. The results of orthogonal projections to latent structures discriminant analysis showed that ZY was different from the other varieties and 3,3,6,6-tetramethyl-1,2,4,5-tetroxane and 2,3-butanediol were its characteristic volatile compounds. As a special yam, ZY might be studied further.

TI  - Exploring Changes in Land Surface Temperature Possibly Associated with Earthquake: Case of the April 2015 Nepal Mw 7.9 Earthquake
T2  - ENTROPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite thermal infrared remote sensing has received worldwide attention in the exploration for earthquake precursors; however, this method faces great controversy. Obtaining repeatable phenomena related to earthquakes is helpful to reduce this controversy. In this paper, a total of 15 or 17 years of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)/Aqua and MODIS/Terra satellite remote sensing land surface temperature (LST) products is selected to analyze the temperature changes before and after the Mw 7.9 earthquake in Nepal on 25 April 2015 and to explore possible thermal information associated with this earthquake. Major findings are given as follows: (1) from the time course, the temperature slowly cooled before the earthquake, reached a minimum at the time of the earthquake, and returned to normal after the earthquake. Since these changes were initiated before the earthquake, they may even have been precursors to the Nepal earthquake. (2) From the space distribution, the cooling areas correspond to the seismogenic structure during the earthquake. These cooling areas are distributed along the Himalayas and are approximately 1300 km long. The widths of the East and West sides are slightly different, with an average temperature decrease of 5.6 degrees C. For these cooling areas, the Western section is approximately 90 km wide and 500 km long; the East side is approximately 190 km wide and 800 km long. The Western side of the cooling strips appeared before the earthquake. In short, these kinds of spatial and temporal changes are tectonically related to the earthquake and may have been caused by the tectonic activity associated with the Nepal earthquake. This process began before the earthquake and therefore might even be potentially premonitory information associated with the Nepal earthquake.

TI  - Optimization of the OCO-2 Cloud Screening Algorithm and Evaluation against MODIS and TCCON Measurements over Land Surfaces in Europe and Japan
T2  - ADVANCES IN ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A method to tighten the cloud screening thresholds based on local conditions is used to provide more stringent schemes for Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) cloud screening algorithms. Cloud screening strategies are essential to remove scenes with significant cloud and/or aerosol contamination from OCO-2 observations, which helps to save on the data processing cost and ensure high quality retrievals of the column-averaged CO2 dry air mole fraction (XCO2). Based on the radiance measurements in the 0.76 mu m O(2)A band, 1.61 mu m (weak), and 2.06 mu m (strong) CO2 bands, the current combination of the A-Band Preprocessor (ABP) algorithm and Iterative Maximum A Posteriori (IMAP) Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) Preprocessor (IDP) algorithm passes around 20%-25% of all soundings, which means that some contaminated scenes also pass the screening process. In this work, three independent pairs of threshold parameters used in the ABP and IDP algorithms are sufficiently tuned until the overall pass rate is close to the monthly clear-sky fraction from the MODIS cloud mask. The tightened thresholds are applied to observations over land surfaces in Europe and Japan in 2016. The results show improvement of agreement and positive predictive value compared to the collocated MODIS cloud mask, especially in summer and fall. In addition, analysis indicates that XCO2 retrievals with more stringent thresholds are in closer agreement with measurements from collocated Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) sites.

TI  - Evaluating the usage of tree-based ensemble methods in groundwater spring potential mapping
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The main goal of the study was to estimate the efficiency and predictive ability of a series of tree-based ensemble methods in groundwater spring potential mapping. The study introduces a novel hybrid integration approach based on J48 Decision Trees (J48), AdaBoost (AB), Bagging (Bag), RandomSubSpace (RS), Dagging (Dag) and Rotation Forest (RF) algorithms for constructing a groundwater spring potential map. The performance of the ensemble models were evaluated at the Wuqi County in Shaanxi Province, China. At first, a groundwater spring inventory map with 235 groundwater springs was constructed. The groundwater spring database was randomly divided into a training (70% of the total number of groundwater springs) and validating subset (remaining 30%). Secondly, sixteen groundwater spring related variables were selected and analyzed, such as elevation, slope, aspect, planform and profile curvature, curvature, topographic wetness index, stream transport and stream power indexes, distance from river network, lithology, soil and landuse cover, normalized difference vegetation index, mean annual rainfall and distance from road network. The contribution of each groundwater spring related variable so as to identify the most predictive was based on the correlation attribute evaluation method. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated by estimating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and several statistical indexes (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity). The outcomes revealed that all models had a good predictive performance, having AUC values greater than 0.74. Specifically, RF-J48 model appeared with the highest prediction capability (AUC = 0.797), followed by the AB-J48 model (0.793), the Bag-J48 (0.768), the RS-J48 (0.766) and the Dag-J48 (0.748), respectively. The study highlights that the proposed ensemble methodology is efficient and highly accurate appropriate for groundwater spring potential mapping.

TI  - Spectral Response Assessment of Moss-Dominated Biological Soil Crust Coverage Under Dry and Wet Conditions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Biological soil crusts (BSCs) are a major functional vegetation unit, covering extensive parts of drylands worldwide. Therefore, several multispectral indices have been proposed to map the spatial distribution and coverage of BSCs. BSCs are composed of poikilohydric organisms, the activity of which is sensitive to water availability. However, studies on dry and wet BSCs have seldom considered the mixed coverage gradient that is representative of actual field conditions. In this study, in situ spectral data and photographs of 136 pairs of dry and wet plots were collected to determine the influence of moisture conditions on BSC coverage detection. Then, BSC spectral reflectance and continuum removal (CR) reflectance responses to wetting were analyzed. Finally, the responses of four commonly used indices (i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI); crust index (CI); biological soil crust index (BSCI); and band depth of absorption feature after CR in the red band, (BD_red)), calculated from in situ hyperspectral data resampled to two multispectral data channels (Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2), were compared in dry and wet conditions. The results indicate that: (i) on average, the estimated BSC coverage using red-green-blue (RGB) images is 14.98% higher in wet than in dry conditions (P < 0.001); (ii) CR reflectance features of wet BSCs are more obvious than those of dry BSCs in both red and red-edge bands; and (iii) NDVI, CI, and BSCI for BSC coverage of 0%-60% under dry and wet conditions are close to those of dry and wet bare sand, respectively. NDVI and BD_red cannot separate dead wood and BSC with low coverage. This study demonstrates that low-coverage moss-dominated BSC is not easily detected by the four indices. In the future, remote-sensing data obtained during the rainy season with red and red-edge bands should be considered to detect BSCs.

TI  - Effect of Suction and Discharge Conditions on the Unsteady Flow Phenomena of Axial-Flow Reactor Coolant Pump
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In order to study the effects of the suction and discharge conditions on the hydraulic performance and unsteady flow phenomena of an axial-flow reactor coolant pump (RCP), three RCP models with different suction and discharge configurations are analyzed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method. The CFD results are validated by experimental data. The hydraulic performance of the three RCP models shows little difference. However, the unsteady flow phenomena of RCP are significantly affected by the variation of suction and discharge conditions. Compared with that of Model E-S (baseline, elbow-single nozzle), the pressure pulsation in rotating frame of Model S-S (straight pipe-single nozzle) and Model E-D (elbow-double nozzles) is weakened in different degrees and forms, due to the more uniform flow fields upstream and downstream of the impeller, respectively. It indicates that the generalized rotor-stator interaction (RSI) actually exists between the rotating impeller and all stationary components causing the circumferentially non-uniform flow. Furthermore, improving the circumferential uniformity of the flow upstream and downstream of impeller (suction and discharge flow) also contributes to reducing the radial dynamic fluid force acting on the impeller. Compared with those of Model E-S, the dynamic F-X and F-Y of Model S-S are severely weakened, and those of Model E-D also gain a minor amplitude decrease at f(BPF). In contrast, the general pressure pulsation in fixed frame is mainly related to the rotating impeller and barely affected by the suction and discharge conditions.

TI  - Case Study of a Retrieval Method of 3D Proxy Reflectivity from FY-4A Lightning Data and Its Impact on the Assimilation and Forecasting for Severe Rainfall Storms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As the first Geostationary Satellite with the LMI (Lightning Mapping Imager) instrument aboard running over the eastern hemisphere, FY-4A (Feng-Yun-4A) can better indicate severe convection and compensate for the limitations of radar observation in temporal and spatial resolution. In order to realize the application of FY-4A lightning data in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, a logarithmic relationship between FY-4A lightning density and maximum radar reflectivity is presented to convert FY-4A lightning data into maximum FY-4A proxy reflectivity. Then, according to the profiles of radar reflectivity, the maximum FY-4A proxy reflectivity is extended to 3D FY-4A proxy reflectivity. Finally, the 3D FY-4A proxy reflectivity is assimilated in RMAPS-ST (Rapid-refresh Multi-scale Analysis and Prediction System-Short Term) to compare with radar assimilation. Four groups of continuous cycling data assimilation and forecasting experiments are carried out for a severe rainfall case. The results demonstrate that cycling assimilation of 3D FY-4A proxy reflectivity can adjust the moisture condition effectively, and indirectly affects the temperature and wind fields, then makes the thermal and dynamic analysis more reasonable. The Fractions Skill Scores (FSSs) show that the rainfall forecasts are improved significantly within 6 h by assimilating 3D FY-4A proxy reflectivity, which is similar to the parallel experiments in assimilating radar reflectivity. In addition, other cycling data assimilation experiments are carried out in mountainous areas without radar data. The improvement of precipitation forecasts in mountainous areas further proves that the application of assimilating 3D FY-4A proxy reflectivity can be considered a useful substitute where observed radar data are missing. Through the two severe rainfall cases, this method could be framed as an example of how to use lightning for data assimilation.

TI  - Floodplain response to varied flows in a large coastal plain river
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The natural flood pulse maintains river-floodplain ecosystems through the exchange of freshwater resources between the main-stem and floodplain habitats. Few prior studies have quantified the relationship between flows and floodplain response including estimating inundation area, floodwater volumes, and slough connectivity. Floodplain modeling typically uses the flow-stage height relationship at river gauge stations. In this study, we compared a relative elevation model (REM) and the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS 1D) model using events from 2015 and 2016 covering a range of flows fromthe 1st to the 99th percentile for the Apalachicola River, Florida. Because digital elevation models (DEM) from LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data lack details of riverbed topography, we compared a LiDAR-alone and LiDAR-sonar combined DEM to assess their differences. Estimates from the REM and HEC-RAS models were compared to maps based on Landsat imagery-derived water and vegetation indices. In this river, we found a non-linear relationship between the inundated area and flow, increasing markedly through the 90th flow percentile after which increases are minimal. Inundated areas from both REM and HEC-RAS models were similar for all selected flow levels except at the 74th percentile (708 m(3)/s) flow at which the REM produced 11% higher inundated area than HEC-RAS. Near themedian flows, major sloughs were fully connected with backswamps and low-lying patches being inundated. At the higher flows, only a few anthropogenic features were exposed. Floodplain inundation estimates from Landsat performed poorly, detecting 9% with the modified normalized difference water index (mNDWI) and 41% with the open water likelihood index (OWL). These estimates were much lower than the HEC-RAS model (96% flooded), largely because the satellite is unable to penetrate dense forests and examine the floodplain surface, and the Landsat pixel size is twice the width of floodplain sloughs. The LiDAR-sonar combined DEM produced a higher floodwater volume estimate with the HEC-RAS model than using LiDAR-alone. The difference of 1,368,000 m(3) at the 1st percentile (142m(3)/s) and 2,825,000m(3) at the 89th percentile (1133m(3)/s) demonstrate the limitation of using a LiDAR-alone DEM, which cannot penetrate thewater surface, and the importance of surveying floodplains using sonar. Modeling results under predict historical wetting of the floodplain because Corps dredging made themain channel approximately 13% wider from its historical width in 1941. Further, in the past few decades, droughts and low flows have become more common because of varied upstream water uses, resulting in less inundation than in the past. Frequent high flows are required to maintain river-floodplain connectivity, floodplain forests, and other hydroecological functions in the Apalachicola River floodplain. Our findings present a basis to assess the legacy of past and ongoing disturbances, inform potential policy decisions for water and floodplain management, and provide a baseline for further research.

TI  - The value of sonographically guided fine-needle aspiration in the diagnosis of small lymph
T2  - CHINESE CLINICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: To analyze the diagnostic value of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy for lymph nodes with short-axis diameters <= 1 cm and to investigate whether the short-axis diameter influences the results of FNA biopsy.Methods: The cytological results of ultrasound-guided FNA lymph node biopsies in 1,242 cases treated at our hospital between December 2015 and June 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The results were compared with the final diagnostic results of the cases (988 cases had core-needle biopsies, and 254 cases were followed-up for more than six months) to explore the diagnostic value of ultrasound-guided FNA for small lymph nodes.Results: The sensitivities, specificities and accuracies of ultrasound-guided FNA were 99.6%, 99.5% and 99.5% for small lymph nodes with short-axis diameters <= 1 cm and 97.2%, 94.4% and 96.4% for lymph nodes with short-axis diameters >1 cm, respectively. No significant differences were detected between the two groups (P>0.05). Lymph nodes with short-axis diameters <= 1 cm were divided into three groups according to the following diameters: 0.7 cm <= short-axis diameter <= 1 cm, 0.5 cm <= short-axis diameter <0.7 cm, and short-axis diameter <0.5 cm. The sensitivities of ultrasound-guided FNA for these three groups were 99.6%, 99.5% and 98.0% respectively; the specificities were 99.5%, 99.0% and 98.0%, respectively; and the accuracies were 99.8%, 99.3% and 99.0%, respectively. The differences in accuracy between the three groups were significant (P<0.05), while the differences in sensitivity and specificity were not significant (P>0.05).Conclusions: The diagnostic results of ultrasound-guided FNA for small lymph nodes are not affected by the short-axis diameter. For lymph nodes with short-axis diameters <= 1 cm, the accuracy decreases as the short-axis diameter decreases, but FNA still has a high diagnostic accuracy for these small lymph nodes.

TI  - Modeling the Relationship of Precipitation and Water Level Using Grid Precipitation Products with a Neural Network Model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Modeling the relationship between precipitation and water level is of great significance in the prevention of flood disaster. In recent years, the use of machine learning algorithms for precipitation-water level prediction has attracted wide attention in flood forecasting and other fields; however, a clear method to model the relationship of precipitation and water level using grid precipitation products with a neural network model is lacking. The issues of the method include how to select a neural network model, as well as how to influence the modeling results with different types and resolutions of remote sensing data. The purpose of this paper is to provide some findings for the issues. We used the back-propagation (BP) neural network and a nonlinear autoregressive exogenous model (NARX) time series network to model the relationship between precipitation and water level, respectively. The water level of Pingshan hydrographic station at a catchment area in the Jinsha River Basin was simulated by the two network models using three different grid precipitation products. The results showed that when the ground station data are missing, the grid precipitation product is a good alternative to construct the precipitation-water level relationship. In addition, using the NARX network as a model fitting network using extra inputs was better than using the BP neural network; the Nash efficiency coefficients of the former were all higher than 97%, while the latter were all lower than 94%. Furthermore, the input of grid products with different spatial resolutions has little significant effect on the modeling results of the model.

TI  - Long-term Estimates of the Number of Cloud Layers from Radiosonde Data for 1964-2017 in Different Latitudinal Zones
T2  - RUSSIAN METEOROLOGY AND HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The statistical characteristics are computed for the number of cloud layers based on radiosonde data from 965 aerological stations located at different latitudes of the globe for the period of 1964-2017 and on the CE method for the determination of cloud boundaries and cloud amount from the temperature and humidity profiles retrieved from radiosonde data. The calculations are performed for the atmospheric layer from the surface to the height of 10 km. The geographic distribution of seasonal and annual mean values as well as of standard deviations is obtained for the number of cloud layers. The amplitude of their regional variations is determined, that allowed specifying the spatiotemporal features of atmospheric layering into cloud and intercloud layers. The results agree with data of aircraft-based sounding, radar data, radiosonde data, and the results obtained from free balloon experiments.

TI  - Spatio-temporal landscape changes and the impacts of climate change in mountainous Bhutan: A case of Punatsang Chhu Basin
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Agro-ecological landscape changes along the Punatsang Chhu (River) Basin of Bhutan was assessed using Geographic Information System (GIS) and Remote Sensing techniques. The study used satellite data (Landsat imageries) of three periods (1996, 2010 and 2017). The results showed a 51% reduction in the snow and glacial area over the last 20 years. Further, the area under rock outcrops and bare land almost doubled from 8 % in 1996 to 15 % in 2017 during the same period. These changes could be directly related to the impacts of climate change since the study site showed increases in both maximum and minimum temperatures by about 1 degrees C and 0.5 degrees C, respectively based on 1997 to 2017 data. The seasonal average rainfall during the same period also showed a decreasing trend from a high of about 800 mm to 400 mm, which might have affected snow and glacier cover in the higher mountains. Thus, this research further confirms the existing knowledge that climate change impacts are more severely felt in the high altitudes and mountainous locations, such as the Himalayas. The study highlights land cover changes due to climate change and anthropogenic factors which could be used for suitable policy interventions and management of natural resources.

TI  - Comparative Assessment of Various Machine Learning-Based Bias Correction Methods for Numerical Weather Prediction Model Forecasts of Extreme Air Temperatures in Urban Areas
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Forecasts of maximum and minimum air temperatures are essential to mitigate the damage of extreme weather events such as heat waves and tropical nights. The Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model has been widely used for forecasting air temperature, but generally it has a systematic bias due to its coarse grid resolution and lack of parametrizations. This study used random forest (RF), support vector regression (SVR), artificial neural network (ANN) and a multi-model ensemble (MME) to correct the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS; a local NWP model over Korea) model outputs of next-day maximum and minimum air temperatures ( Tmaxt+1 and Tmint+1) in Seoul, South Korea. A total of 14 LDAPS model forecast data, the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures of in-situ observations, and five auxiliary data were used as input variables. The results showed that the LDAPS model had an R-2 of 0.69, a bias of -0.85 degrees C and an RMSE of 2.08 degrees C for Tmaxt+1 forecast, whereas the proposed models resulted in the improvement with R-2 from 0.75 to 0.78, bias from -0.16 to -0.07 degrees C and RMSE from 1.55 to 1.66 degrees C by hindcast validation. For forecasting Tmint+1, the LDAPS model had an R-2 of 0.77, a bias of 0.51 degrees C and an RMSE of 1.43 degrees C by hindcast, while the bias correction models showed R-2 values ranging from 0.86 to 0.87, biases from -0.03 to 0.03 degrees C, and RMSEs from 0.98 to 1.02 degrees C. The MME model had better generalization performance than the three single machine learning models by hindcast validation and leave-one-station-out cross-validation.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of Assimilating Aerosol Optical Depth Observations on Dust Forecasts Over North Africa and the East Atlantic Using Different Data Assimilation Methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study evaluates the impact of assimilating moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) data using different data assimilation (DA) methods on dust analyses and forecasts over North Africa and tropical North Atlantic. To do so, seven experiments are conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting dust model and the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation analysis system. Six of these experiments differ in whether or not AOD observations are assimilated and the DA method used, the latter of which includes the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var), ensemble square root filter (EnSRF), and hybrid methods. The seventh experiment, which allows us to assess the impact of assimilating deep blue AOD data, assimilates only dark target AOD data using the hybrid method. The assimilation of MODIS AOD data clearly improves AOD analyses and forecasts up to 48 hr in length. Results also show that assimilating deep blue data has a primarily positive effect on AOD analyses and forecasts over and downstream of the major North African source regions. Without assimilating deep blue data (assimilating dark target only), AOD assimilation only improves AOD forecasts for up to 30 hr. Of the three DA methods examined, the hybrid and EnSRF methods produce better AOD analyses and forecasts than the 3D-Var method does. Despite the clear benefit of AOD assimilation for AOD analyses and forecasts, the lack of information regarding the vertical distribution of aerosols in AOD data means that AOD assimilation has very little positive effect on analyzed or forecasted vertical profiles of backscatter.

TI  - Modernizing federal technology transfer metrics
T2  - JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER
M3  - Article
AB  - Nearly 40 years ago Congress laid the foundation for federal agencies to engage in technology transfer activities with a primary goal to make federal laboratory research outcomes widely available. Since then, agencies generally rely on universal metrics such as licensing income and number of patents to measure the benefit of their technology transfer program. However, such metrics do not address the requirements set by the current and previous administrations, which require agencies to better gauge the effectiveness and return on investment of their technology programs. Here we evaluate two metrics, filing ratio and transfer rate, and empirically evaluate these metrics using data from Department of the Navy's most transactionally active laboratory, as well as recently released agency-reported data available from the FY 2015 annual technology transfer report (15 U.S.C. Section 3710). We additionally propose other federally-relevant metrics for which agency data are not currently available. Results presented here indicate that these modernized metrics may potentially fulfill the requirements set by executive guidance. The study findings also point out to other metrics that are relevant to practitioners, program managers, and policymakers in the evaluation of technology transfer programs for better measurement of effectiveness, efficiency, and return on investment.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND DIAGNOSTIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Breast cancer is the commonest cancer among women in India and the leading cause of cancer related deaths. In patients with invasive breast cancer, axillary nodal metastasis remains as the most important predictive factor for recurrence and survival, despite progression made in molecular and genetic characterisation of these cancers.Aim: To know the nodal positivity rate and pathologic predictive factors of nodal positivity in early breast cancer in Indian patients, which may help in predicting the axillary status preoperatively.Materials and Methods: This study was retrospective review of patients treated in Cancer Institute, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India between January 2011 to October 2014 for invasive breast cancer which were clinical T1 and T2 and either N0 or N1. Pathologic characteristics of the primary tumour such as size, centricity, histological type, nuclear grade, and Lympho Vascular Invasion (LVSI), Estrogen receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) Status, Human Epidermal growth factor Rector 2 (HER-2)/neu and Ki-67 were analysed and correlated to nodal positivity using univariate and multivariate analysis.Results: In the univariate analysis using chi- square test, Pathological T stage, number of tumours, LVSI, ER and PR status emerged as significant variables. Variables like pT2 (p-0.032), multiple tumours (p-0.007), LVI (p<0.0001), ER positive (p-0.002) and PR positive (p-0.001) and Her2 -2+ (p-0.040) was found to have positive predictive value with statistical significance. On multivariate analysis, LVSI proved to be a highly significant predictor of positive nodes.Conclusion: Although variables such as pT2, multiple tumours, LVSI, ER positive, PR positive and Her2+ was found to have positive predictive value with statistical significance, only LVSI emerged as significant independent predictive factors of positive lymph node.

TI  - Land use/land cover change assessment of Halda watershed using remote sensing and GIS
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Being the only tidal river where major Indian carps spawn naturally, Halda is a unique heritage of Bangladesh and the surroundings of this river undergo chronological changes because of rapid urbanization, anthropogenic and socioeconomic activities. In this study, an attempt has been made to analyze Land use/land cover change (LULCC) of Halda Watershed over the last 40 years using multispectral satellite data obtained from Landsat 2 MSS for April 15, 1978; Landsat 5 TM for February 26, 1999 and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS for May 2, 2017. The watershed has been classified into five major land cover/use classes viz. Agriculture, Bare soil, Settlements, Vegetation and Water Body. Resultant LULC and overlay maps indicate a significant shift from Vegetation (35.1%) and Water class (85.47%) to Agriculture, Bare soil and Settlements. This study envisages to facilitate policy makers, planners and other associated development workers to adopt the best suitable land-use management option for Halda Watershed.

TI  - Vegetation and climate zones based carbon use efficiency variation and the main determinants analysis in China
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - NPP/GPP ratio is related to the allocation of photosynthesized products by plants. The examination of this ratio and its exterior controlling factors are very critical for understanding the carbon cycle. China covers a large area and contains diverse ecosystems and climate conditions, while, extensive studies of the NPP/GPP ratio and its exterior controls have not yet been conducted. This study examines the 16-year (2000-2015) mean NPP/GPP ratio distribution in space, its spatiotemporal changes, its response to exterior controls in each ecosystem, and how ongoing climate changes affect the NPP/GPP ratio over time. This study found, cold and dry environments usually contain vegetation with high NPP/GPP ratios, while the opposite is true for warm and wet environments. However, the highest NPP/GPP values do not always occur in the coldest and driest environments, and the lowest values do not always occur in the warmest and wettest environments. The NPP/GPP ratio weakly increased over the past 16 years. Generally, both moderate precipitation and temperature can increase NPP/GPP ratio. Temporally, more grids are positively correlated with changes in precipitation and negatively correlated with changes in temperature.

TI  - Lateral geomorphic connectivity in a fluvial landscape system: Unraveling the role of confinement, biogeomorphic interactions, and glacial legacies
T2  - GEOMORPHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The rates at which sediment from the landscape is recruited to channel networks reflect lateral geomorphic connectivity and have significant implications for biophysical river systems. By strongly influencing sediment supply regime, such inputs control the dynamics and characteristics of the channel as well as the associated habitat and biota. The main objective of this research was to disentangle the relative importance of geomorphic and biological factors which define spatial patterns in lateral connectivity by promoting or restricting bank erosion, avulsions, and slope failures. Focusing on a forested, formerly glaciated mountain basin in the interior Pacific Northwest, wecombined extensive field surveys with remote sensing data (LiDAR, aerial imagery) to obtainmetrics representing this complex suite of landscape characteristics. The interpretation of evidence yielded by correlations between these variables, a regime model, and qualitative observations, suggest that, at a multi-decadal timescale between major landscape disturbances, lateral connectivity patterns in Sullivan Creek may be, to a large extent, governed by a combination of biotic factors and glacial legacies. In particular, forest canopy metrics were key predictors of hillslope stability as well as bank and valley floor resistance, suggesting a pivotal influence of root reinforcement. On the other hand, instream large wood abundance was closely related to channel splitting, which reflects its role in promoting channel avulsions. More extensive bank erosion in reaches dominated by drift deposits appeared to indicate glacial legacies. Furthermore, a strong association between bank erosion and colluvial inputs suggested a close coupling within the channel-hillslope system. Lateral confinement - defined as the proportion of the channel length abutting against bedrock, terraces, fans and roads - was negatively associated with channel braiding; the relationships linking confinement with bank erosion and the magnitude of colluvial inputs (negative and positive association, respectively) were relatively weak. Taken together, findings emerging from this research suggest that better understanding of lateral geomorphic connectivity patterns in mountain river basins similar to our study site requires that both channel processes and broader, biophysical landscape system be considered.

TI  - Quantifying national and regional cyanobacterial occurrence in US lakes using satellite remote sensing
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms are the most common form of harmful algal blooms in freshwater systems throughout the world. However, in situ sampling of cyanobacteria in inland lakes is limited both spatially and temporally. Satellite data has proven to be an effective tool to monitor cyanobacteria in freshwater lakes across the United States. This study uses data from the European Space Agency Envisat MEdium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer and the Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Color Instrument to provide a national overview of the percentage of lakes experiencing a cyanobacterial bloom on a weekly basis for 2008-2011, 2017, and 2018. A total of 2321 lakes across the contiguous United States were included in the analysis. We examined four different thresholds to define when a waterbody is classified as experiencing a bloom. Across these four thresholds, we explored variability in bloom percentage with changes in seasonality and lake size. As a validation of algorithm performance, we analyzed the agreement between satellite observations and previously established ecological patterns, although data availability in the wintertime limited these comparisons on a year-round basis. Changes in cyanobacterial bloom percentage at the national scale followed the well-known temporal pattern of freshwater blooms. The percentage of lakes experiencing a bloom increased throughout the year, reached a maximum in fall, and decreased through the winter. Wintertime data, particularly in northern regions, were consistently limited due to snow and ice cover. With the exception of the Southeast and South, regional patterns mimicked patterns found at the national scale. The Southeast and South exhibited an unexpected pattern as cyanobacterial bloom percentage reached a maximum in the winter rather than the summer. Lake Jesup in Florida was used as a case study to validate this observed pattern against field observations of chlorophyll a. Results from this research establish a baseline of annual occurrence of cyanobacterial blooms in inland lakes across the United States. In addition, methods presented in this study can be tailored to fit the specific requirements of an individual system or region.

TI  - WHAT IT TAKES TO LIVE PHILOSOPHICALLY: OR, HOW TO PROGRESS IN THE ART OF LIVING
T2  - METAPHILOSOPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - This essay presents an account of what it takes to live a philosophical way of life: practitioners must be committed to a worldview, structure their lives around it, and engage in truth-directed practices. Contra John Cooper, it does not require that one's life be solely guided by reason. Religious or tradition-based ways of life count as truth directed as long as their practices are reasons responsive and would be truth directed if the claims made by their way of life are correct. The essay argues that these three conditions can be met by progressors as well as sages. Making progress in how one acts in the world, and improving one's understanding and direction through being part of a community is living a philosophical way of life. The offered view acknowledges more ways to develop the art of living and enables a broader range of people to count as living philosophically.

TI  - Radioguided Occult Lesion Localization Versus Wire-guided Localization of Nonpalpable Breast Lesions: A Comparative Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC RESEARCH IN MEDICINE-JAREM
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Wire-guided localization (WGL) is the preoperative localization method most commonly used before the surgical excision of non-palpable breast lesions (NPBLs). Recently, radioguided occult lesion localization (ROLL) has emerged as an alternative to WGL. We sought to compare the efficacy of ROLL with that of WGL for the preoperative localization of NPBLs and to assess our experience encountered as ROLL is implemented at our institution.Methods: We retrospectively identified reports of patients with NPBLs who underwent mammography-or ultrasonography-guided ROLL or WGL between January 2014 and March 2017. Medical records were reviewed to compare radiologic and pathologic findings, rates of accurate localization, specimen volumes, lengths of operation, creation of positive surgical margins, number of simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNB) performed, complication rates, and lengths of hospital stay.Results: Our search identified 67 women (mean age, 52.7 years; range, 32-69 years) diagnosed with NPBLs during the study period. ROLL was used in 25 patients; WGL was used in 42 patients. Both methods had a high accurate localization rate (ROLL, 96%; WGL, 98%). The length of operation was longer in the ROLL group than in the WGL group (p=0.001), and more SLNBs were performed in the ROLL group than in the WGL group. No significant differences were seen between the groups in terms of radiologic and pathologic findings, specimen volumes, positive surgical margins, complication rates, or lengths of hospital stay.Conclusion: ROLL is a promising alternative to WGL for preoperative localization of NPBLs. The operation time for ROLL procedures at our institution will likely decrease as clinicians become more familiar with the procedure.

TI  - Near Real-Time Monitoring of the Christmas 2018 Etna Eruption Using SEVIRI and Products Validation
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - On the morning of 24 December 2018, an eruptive event occurred at Etna, which was followed the next day by a strong sequence of shallow earthquakes. The eruptive episode lasted until 30 December, ranging from moderate strombolian to lava fountain activity coupled with vigorous ash/gas emissions and a lava flow effusion toward the eastern volcano flank of Valle del Bove. In this work, the data collected from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI) instruments on board the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) geostationary satellite are used to characterize the Etna activity by estimating the proximal and distal eruption parameters in near real time. The inversion of data indicates the onset of eruption on 24 December at 11:15 UTC, a maximum Time Average Discharge Rate (TADR) of 8.3 m(3)/s, a cumulative lava volume emitted of 0.5 Mm(3), and a Volcanic Plume Top Height (VPTH) that reached a maximum altitude of 8 km above sea level (asl). The volcanic cloud ash and SO2 result totally collocated, with an ash amount generally lower than SO2 except on 24 December during the climax phase. A total amount of about 100 and 35 kt of SO2 and ash respectively was emitted during the entire eruptive period, while the SO2 fluxes reached peaks of more than 600 kg/s, with a mean value of about 185 kg/s. The SEVIRI VPTH, ash/SO2 masses, and flux time series have been compared with the results obtained from the ground-based visible (VIS) cameras and FLux Automatic MEasurements (FLAME) networks, and the satellite images collected by the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on board the Terra and Aqua- polar satellites. The analysis indicates good agreement between SEVIRI, VIS camera, and MODIS retrievals with VPTH, ash, and SO2 estimations all within measurement errors. The SEVIRI and FLAME SO2 flux retrievals show significant discrepancies due to the presence of volcanic ash and a gap of data on the FLAME network. The results obtained in this study show the ability of geostationary satellite systems to characterize eruptive events from the source to the atmosphere in near real time during the day and night, thus offering a powerful tool to mitigate volcanic risk on both local population and airspace and to give insight on volcanic processes.

TI  - Long-Term Wood Micro-Density Variation in Alpine Forests at Central Mexico and Their Spatial Links with Remotely Sensed Information
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ongoing climate variability strongly affects high-elevation forests, influencing the wood formation process (e.g., xylogenesis). Furthermore, spatio-temporal studies to establish links of wood properties and tree performance are needed. Using linear mixed-effects models, empirical cumulative distribution functions, and spatial analysis, we explore time trends and space connections of wood density of Pinus hartwegii Lindl. to remotely sensed variables (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer MODIS-derived) in two high-elevation forests in Mexico, Tlaloc (TLA) and Jocotitlan (JOC) Mountains. Results indicated that elevation and cambial age effects are important factors explaining wood density variation. Minimum earlywood-MID, average-AVE, and maximum latewood density-MXD were statistically similar between mountains (p > 0.05), but TLA showed a significant increase in MID over time with higher values after 1950. Wood density values and spatial correlations were site-dependent with TLA exhibiting the highest correlations between MXD and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) of the spring season (r = 0.59, p < 0.05). Overall, correlations to remotely sensed information were positive with MXD, negative for MID and divergent for AVE. Historical temperature defines MID along the elevation gradient, while MXD was related to soil moisture only at low-elevation sites where soils are deeper. We found that two high-elevation forests, 115 km away from each other, with similar climate, soil, and vegetation, behaved differently regarding their xylogenesis, indicating the potential of using the link between wood micro-density and remotely sensed information to understand forest response to climate change effects.

TI  - Spatial variability quantification of maize water consumption based on Google EEflux tool
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The evapotranspiration (ET) and crop coefficient (K-c) spatial variabilities are disregarded in traditional methods of evapotranspiration estimation based on lysimeters. With the development of remote sensing techniques, the estimative of ET on agricultural areas, in a specialized way, has become possible through the use of algorithms based on the surface energy balance such as the METRIC and its automated version, featured on the Google Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux) platform. This study was carried out at a center pivot irrigated area located in the city of Primavera do Leste, MT, Brazil. One growing season (2016) of the specie Zea mays (maize) was analyzed. Using processed images from the Landsat 8 satellite, within the EEFlux platform, the spatial variability of the actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and the K-c curve of this crop was determined. The water use efficiency (WUE) was also determined. A comparative analysis was performed using different statistical indices: root mean square error (RMSE), the mean bios error (MBE) and the index of agreement (d). The ETa for maize ranged from 1.3-4.1 mm d(-1) and the K-c obtained ranged from 0.3 to 1.2. The average WUE of maize was 1.13 kg m(-3). The method of estimation of ETa and K-c spatialized using the Google EEFlux platform made possible the understanding the spatial variability of these two variables and, therefore, this application has high potential to estimate the ETa and K-c on different stages of maize crop growth cycle.

TI  - DIFFERENTIAL ACCLIMATION OF JUVENILE SEA URCHINS TRANSPLANTED ACROSS A METALLIC TRACE ELEMENT GRADIENT WITHIN TILE BAY OF TOULON (FRANCE)
T2  - JOURNAL OF SHELLFISH RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanized harbors and embayments scattered along marine shorelines act as important sources of a wide range of chemical contaminants, which include metallic trace elements (MTE). Within the semi-enclosed Mediterranean Sea, the high number of such areas might locally challenge the persistence of coastal marine species. In recent decades, biomonitoring studies, using sentinel species such as mussels, have increased knowledge of coastal contamination and provided a number of contentious potential environmental surveillance biomarkers, which contributed to a better comprehension toward the acclimation abilities of marine organisms, to actual anthropogenically derived environments. The aim of this study was to characterize the influence of the chemically, multi-contaminated, Bay of Toulon (France) on the young fauna, using juvenile sea urchins Paracentrotus lividus as a proxy. Hatchery-produced individuals were immersed, for 1 mo, within the bay, at four contrasted sites for MTE concentrations. At the end of the experiment, growth and transcript abundances of key genes, involved in the acclimation process, were assessed. Contrasted phenotypic and molecular responses were observed evidencing a significant environmental influence. Specifically, under the high metallic stress, a dwarfing response was observed, associated with a high level of metallothionein and a low level of hsp response. In addition, the level of DNA methyltransferase transcript abundance was inversely correlated with the level of MTE concentrations, highlighting that the chronic exposure to metallic contaminants would probably increase the risk of genetic mutations, such as those consecutive to transpositions. Overall, this study indicates that further in-depth research into the mechanisms driving plasticity and adaptive changes at the population level is required.

TI  - A Central Sierra Miwok Origins Story The Theft of the Sun
T2  - ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOTES
M3  - Article
AB  - This article examines an Indigenous origins narrative from central California. The text is an oral narrative about the theft of the sun by Coyote, recorded in the Central Sierra Miwok language. The article presents a formal analysis of the structure, language, and poetics of the text from the perspective of ethnopoetics, focusing on structural and lexical metaphors developed for describing the pathway of the sun. It then offers reflections on the ethnogeography and worldview presented in the text, linking it to Penutian migrations from the western Great Basin into central California's Sierra Nevada several thousand years ago. The article also provides a general contextualization of the themes of the text in relation to California and western North American coyote stories and origins stories more generally.

TI  - JUSTIFYING BLASPHEMY LAWS: FREEDOM OF EXPRESSION, PUBLIC MORALS, AND INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS LAW
T2  - JOURNAL OF LAW AND RELIGION
M3  - Article
AB  - In its General Comment No. 34 dealing with freedom of expression, the United Nations Human Rights Committee (UNHRC) rejected the idea that a blasphemy law could ever be human-rights compliant, unless its function was to prevent incitement to religious or racial hatred. This is a widely shared view that is consistently endorsed when any international blasphemy controversy (such as that involving the Danish Cartoons in 2005) arises. This article assesses the legitimacy of this view. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) permits freedom of expression to be limited inter alia in the name of public morality, provided that the law in question is also necessary to achieve this end. This article argues that because a blasphemy law can be a response to a public moral vision; therefore a blasphemy law can serve a legitimate purpose insofar as human rights law is concerned. It is further submitted that whereas some blasphemy laws are unacceptably draconian, it is not inherently impossible for such a law to represent a proportionate response to a public morals concern. Thus, the conclusion from the UNHRC is not warranted by the text of the ICCPR. Moreover, there is a risk that, in reaching this conclusion the committee is evincing an exclusively secularist worldview in its interpretation of the ICCPR that undermines its claim to universality.

TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia surveillance using two methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia surveillance is used as a quality indicator due to concerns that some cases may be preventable and may contribute to mortality. Various surveillance criteria exist for the purposes of national reporting, but a large-scale direct comparison has not been conducted.Methods: A prospective cohort study applied two routinely used surveillance criteria for ventilator-associated pneumonia from the European Centre for Disease Control and the American Centers for Disease Control to all patients admitted to two large general intensive care units. Diagnostic rates and concordance amongst diagnostic events were compared.Findings: A total of 713 at-risk patients were identified during the study period. The European surveillance algorithm returned a rate of 4.6 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1000 ventilation days (95% confidence interval 3.1-6.6) and the American surveillance system a rate of 5.4 (3.8-7.5). The concordance between diagnostic events was poor (Cohen's Kappa 0.127 (-0.003 to 0.256)).Conclusions: The algorithms yield similar rates, but the lack of event concordance reveals the absence of inter-algorithm agreement for diagnosing ventilator-associated pneumonia, potentially undermining surveillance as an indicator of care quality.

TI  - Multitemporal Analysis of Soil Sealing and Land Use Changes Linked to Urban Expansion of Salamanca (Spain) Using Landsat Images and Soil Carbon Management as a Mitigating Tool for Climate Change
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The lack of urban sustainability is a widespread deficiency in urban agglomerations. To achieve adequate land use, we present a methodology that allows for: 1) the identification of the impacts caused by urban expansion since 1956 to the present in Salamanca (Spain); and 2) the promotion of a more sustainable future in urban development. A multi-temporal assessment of land use was made by remote sensing, while sustainability criteria were analyzed using the multicriteria analysis (MCA) with Geographical Information Systems (GIS). In addition, we established recommendations for soil carbon management in semi-arid ecosystem soils that contribute to climate change mitigation. The results show an increase of the urbanized area from 3.8% to 22.3% in the studied period, identifying up to 15% of buildings in zones with some type of restriction. In 71% of the cases, urbanization caused the sealing of productive agricultural soils (2519 Ha), almost 20% of which were of the highest quality. In last few decades, an excessive increase of built-up areas in comparison to population dynamics was identified, which causes unnecessary soil sealing that affects the food production and the capacity to mitigate climate change by managing the carbon cycle in the soil.

TI  - Unraveling Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneities of Very Slow Rock-Slope Deformations with Targeted DInSAR Analyses
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spaceborne radar interferometry is a powerful tool to characterize landslides at local and regional scales. However, its application to very slow rock slope deformations in alpine environments (displacement rates < 5 cm/year) remains challenging, mainly due to low signal to noise ratio, atmospheric disturbances, snow cover effects, and complexities resulting from heterogeneous displacement in space and time. Here we combine SqueeSAR(TM) data, targeted multi-temporal baseline DInSAR, GPS data, and detailed field morpho-structural mapping, to unravel the kinematics, internal segmentation, and style of activity of the Mt. Mater deep-seated gravitational slope deformation (DSGSD) in Valle Spluga (Italy). We retrieve slope kinematics by performing 2D decomposition (2D InSAR) of SqueeSAR(TM) products derived from Sentinel-1 data acquired in ascending and descending orbits. To achieve a spatially-distributed characterization of DSGSD displacement patterns and activity, we process Sentinel-1 A/B images (2016-2019) with increasing temporal baselines (ranging from 24-days to 1-year) and generate several multi-temporal interferograms. Unwrapped displacement maps are validated using ground-based GPS data. Interferograms derived with different temporal baselines reveal a strong kinematic and morpho-structural heterogeneity and outline nested rockslides and active sectors, that arise from the background displacement signal of the main DSGSD. Seasonal interferograms, supported by GPS displacement measurements, reveal non-linear displacement trends suggesting a complex response of different slope sectors to rainfall and snowmelt. Our analyses clearly outline a composite slope instability with different nested sectors possibly undergoing different evolutionary trends towards failure. The results herein outline the potential of a targeted use of DInSAR for the detailed investigation of very slow rock slope deformations in different geological and geomorphological settings.

TI  - Challenges in Estimating Tropical Forest Canopy Height from Planet Dove Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring tropical forests using spaceborne and airborne remote sensing capabilities is important for informing environmental policies and conservation actions. Developing large-scale machine learning estimation models of forest structure is instrumental in bridging the gap between retrospective analysis and near-real-time monitoring. However, most approaches use moderate spatial resolution satellite data with limited capabilities of frequent updating. Here, we take advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolutions of Planet Dove images and aim to automatically estimate top-of-canopy height (TCH) for the biologically diverse country of Peru from satellite imagery at 1 ha spatial resolution by building a model that associates Planet Dove textural features with airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) measurements of TCH. We use and modify features derived from Fourier textural ordination (FOTO) of Planet Dove images using spectral projection and train a gradient boosted regression for TCH estimation. We discuss the technical and scientific challenges involved in the generation of reliable mechanisms for estimating TCH from Planet Dove satellite image spectral and textural features. Our developed software toolchain is a robust and generalizable regression model that provides a root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.36 m for Peru. This represents a helpful advancement towards better monitoring of tropical forests and improves efforts in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), an important climate change mitigation approach.

TI  - Landslide Image Captioning Method Based on Semantic Gate and Bi-Temporal LSTM
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - When a landslide happens, it is important to recognize the hazard-affected bodies surrounding the landslide for the risk assessment and emergency rescue. In order to realize the recognition, the spatial relationship between landslides and other geographic objects such as residence, roads and schools needs to be defined. Comparing with semantic segmentation and instance segmentation that can only recognize the geographic objects separately, image captioning can provide richer semantic information including the spatial relationship among these objects. However, the traditional image captioning methods based on RNNs have two main shortcomings: the errors in the prediction process are often accumulated and the location of attention is not always accurate which would lead to misjudgment of risk. To handle these problems, a landslide image interpretation network based on a semantic gate and a bi-temporal long-short term memory network (SG-BiTLSTM) is proposed in this paper. In the SG-BiTLSTM architecture, a U-Net is employed as an encoder to extract features of the images and generate the mask maps of the landslides and other geographic objects. The decoder of this structure consists of two interactive long-short term memory networks (LSTMs) to describe the spatial relationship among these geographic objects so that to further determine the role of the classified geographic objects for identifying the hazard-affected bodies. The purpose of this research is to judge the hazard-affected bodies of the landslide (i.e., buildings and roads) through the SG-BiTLSTM network to provide geographic information support for emergency service. The remote sensing data was taken by Worldview satellite after the Wenchuan earthquake happened in 2008. The experimental results demonstrate that SG-BiTLSTM network shows remarkable improvements on the recognition of landslide and hazard-affected bodies, compared with the traditional LSTM (the Baseline Model), the BLEU1 of the SG-BiTLSTM is improved by 5.89%, the matching rate between the mask maps and the focus matrix of the attention is improved by 42.81%. In conclusion, the SG-BiTLSTM network can recognize landslides and the hazard-affected bodies simultaneously to provide basic geographic information service for emergency decision-making.

TI  - Developing a Gap-Filling Algorithm Using DNN for the Ts-VI Triangle Model to Obtain Temporally Continuous Daily Actual Evapotranspiration in an Arid Area of China
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Temporally continuous daily actual evapotranspiration (ET) data play a critical role in water resource management in arid areas. As a typical remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST)-based ET model, the surface temperature-vegetation index (Ts-VI) triangle model provides direct monitoring of ET, but these estimates are temporally discontinuous due to cloud contamination. In this work, we present a gap-filling algorithm (TSVI_DNN) using a deep neural network (DNN) with the Ts-VI triangle model to obtain temporally continuous daily actual ET at regional scale. The TSVI_DNN model is evaluated against in situ measurements in an arid area of China during 2009-2011 and shows good agreement with eddy covariance (EC) observations. The temporal coverage was improved from 16.1% with the original Ts-VI tringle model to 67.1% with the TSVI_DNN model. The correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and mean absolute difference (MAD) are 0.9, 0.86 mm d(-1), -0.16 mm d(-1), and 0.65 mm d(-1), respectively. When compared with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) official MOD16 version 6 ET product, estimates of ET using TSVI_DNN are improved by approximately 49.2%. The method presented here can potentially contribute to enhanced water resource management in arid areas, especially under climate change.

TI  - Ductal Carcinoma in Situ: A French National Survey. Analysis of 2125 Patients
T2  - CLINICAL BREAST CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - This was an analysis of 2125 ductal carcinoma in situ features/treatments from 71 French centers. Mastectomy and breast-conserving surgery was performed in 25% and 75% of cases, respectively; the median tumor size was 15 mm, and the low, intermediate, and high nuclear grade distribution was 12%, 36%, and 47%, respectively. After breast-conserving surgery, 97% underwent whole breast irradiation. This survey reflects the daily ductal carcinoma in situ treatment in France, and the results are in accordance with national guidelines.Background: Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) represents 15% of all breast cancers in France. The first national survey was conducted in 2003. The present multi-center real-life practice survey aimed at assessing possible changes in demographic, clinical, pathologic, and treatment features. Material and Methods: From March 2014 to September 2015, patients diagnosed with DCIS from 71 centers with complete information about age, diagnostic features, and treatment modalities were prospectively included. Results: A total of 2125 patients with a median age of 58.6 years from 71 centers were studied. DCIS was diagnosed by mammography in 87.5% of cases. Preoperative biopsy was performed in 96% of cases. The median tumor size was 15 mm. Nuclear grade was low, intermediate, and high in 12%, 36%, and 47% of cases, respectively. Margins were considered to be negative in 83% of cases. Overall mastectomy and lumpectomy rates were 25% and 75%, respectively. The immediate breast reconstruction rate was 50%. Sentinel node biopsy and axillary dissection rates were 41% and 2.6%, respectively. After lumpectomy, 97% of patients underwent radiotherapy, and 32% received a boost dose. Only 1% of patients received endocrine therapy. Compared with our previous survey, he median tumor size remained the same, and the proportion of high-grade lesions increased by 9%. The mastectomy rate decreased by 4%. Conclusions: The clinical practice identified in this survey complies with French DCIS guidelines. About 10% of patients with low-grade DCIS may be eligible to participate in treatment de-escalation trials. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Mathematical modelling of the intra-annual behaviour of NDVI in the Caatinga Biome, Brazil
T2  - CIENCIA FLORESTAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation indexes from remote sensing images are often used for land-cover monitoring and identification of biomass changes. They are also very useful to describe the relationships between the phenological cycle and the carbon sequestration, which are climate change indicators. The Caatinga land-cover is very heterogeneous, making hard the understanding of the land cover processes in different scales (spatial and temporal), due to seasonalities and human actions. The Landsat series products usually can describe spatial land-cover variations, with a low temporal scale, so far. This study aims to improve the temporal representation of the land cover by Landsat images for a Caatinga area. This article presents an evaluation, using a mathematical approach of three-parameter functions to describe the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Each function performance was evaluated by the reduced chi-square (chi(2)) and determination coefficient (R-2) parameters. The analysis is performed for an annual period and considers land-cover changes by anthropic action. The Cauchy function seems the best option and presented an adjust up to 83% of the total (years and places), with an R-2 (average) of 0.82. The parameters of this function can be a valuable source for environmental studies in the Caatinga biome, supporting temporal analysis of the vegetation.

TI  - Eating and Being Eaten: Interspecies Vulnerability as Eucharist
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Living in a time of urgent ecological crisis, Christians need outdoor ritual experience of their faith: of what is wild, of the living Earth, stranger faces of the divine: taking eco-alienated people out of the building and into the streets, the river, the forest. Moving liturgy outdoors makes possible an opening to both human and more-than-human strangeness on their own terms, in actual, present, sensory experience. It also opens worshipers' experience of the Christian sacraments into the disconcerting realm of our bodies' physical edibility to other creatures: the possibility of our own flesh becoming food. Using the work of Val Plumwood, David Abram, and Eric Meyer, this paper examines Eucharistic ritual language and theologies of resurrection as these contribute to a worldview that maintains a human versus food dualism incommensurate with biological processes. Ultimately, the paper calls for Eucharistic practices that allow participants to pray being prey.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Shoreline changes are processes that occur due to the influence of coastal conditions in seeking the balance of the impacts that occur from natural factors and human activities. The coastal area of Tanah Laut Regency South Kalimantan covers along the west coast and south coast region. Physically this region is influenced by oceanographic dynamics of the Java Sea and the Barito River runoff that changes seasonally. This study aims to determine the shoreline changes of the West Coast area of Tanah Laut Regency, South Kalimantan. The data used are Landsat 8 imagery acquisition in 2016 to describe the current condition and Landsat imagery 7 the acquisition year 2003 as an initial condition. Data were analyzed to determine the shoreline changes that had accretion or abrasion of the coastline. The results showed that the coastline of the West Coast area of Tanah Laut regency experienced changes in abrasion and accretion conditions. Overall the coastal areas of Tanah Laut Regency dominated accretion than abrasion. In particular, cell numbers 3 and 4 have been recorded as abrasion areas; even the cells are near the estuary of Barito River.

T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - The vulnerabilities of coastal communities have increased in recent years, as more people have to live in hazard-prone areas due to population growth. The east coast of India is one such vulnerable area that faces the combined challenge of climate risks and poverty. This study identifies the environmental and socioeconomic factors contributing to the resilience building that helped the communities in the study area to cope with cyclone Phailin in 2013 and cyclone Hudhud in 2014. We used questionnaire surveys, GIS and satellite data, and econometric analysis to identify these features. The damage suffered by the households, and the time needed by them to return to the pre-cyclone situation were used as indicators of resilience. We found that factors such as high education, decision-making power of women, and presence of coastline vegetation of local species such as cashew and palmyra helped the communities to build resilience toward cyclones.

TI  - The Relationship between Educational Attainment and HIV Prevalence among Pregnant Women Attending Antenatal Clinics in Six States of India: Sentinel Surveillance from 2010 to 2017
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The National AIDS Control Programme provides support for HIV prevention services to pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) clinics through testing, kit delivery, counseling, and treatment services. The impact of HIV prevention programs in the general population is assessed by monitoring trends and progress made against the HIV epidemic among pregnant women attending ANC clinics during HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS). Objectives: This study explores the association of HIV risk with educational attainment for Indian women across different age groups from four repeated cross-sectional surveillance of antenatal clinics in six states from the southern part of India. Methods: Data collected from the repeated cross-sectional HSS conducted during the year 2010-2011 (baseline) and 2016-2017 (end line) across six states were used for this analysis. The total sample size was 94,266 at baseline and 99,434 at end line. In the logistic regression analysis, we focused on identifying the association between educational attainment, and HIV prevalence adjusting for period effects across two age groups for women attending ANC clinics. Results: The analysis showed an inverse association between education and HIV risk across different age groups. The age-segregated and survey period adjusted analysist showed that for older women (>= 25 years), the HIV risk in 2010 ranged from 41% lower among 5th Grade to 80% lower among postgraduates than illiterates. For the <25 year age group, this risk of HIV for pregnant women was 35% to 49% lower. Conclusions: To ensure an effective national response to control and prevent HIV infection, policymakers in India need to focus on >= 25 years' age group of women attending ANC for designing educational interventions to reduce HIV risk as well as the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV.

TI  - Environmental drivers and indicators of change in habitat and fish assemblages within a climate change hotspot
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate-driven environmental change is predicted to accelerate over the coming decades. Anticipating the ecological consequences requires a fundamental understanding of how environmental variables influence key habitats and species. Southeastern Australia is a marine climate change hotspot, characterised by rapidly increasing sea surface temperatures, strengthening currents and increasing storm frequency. To understand ecosystem responses to environmental drivers in this region, and to anticipate future climate-driven change, we examined the spatial distribution and environmental relationships of key marine habitats, fish assemblages, and the ecologically important urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii along similar to 1000 km of reef off southeastern Australia using towed video transects. We also identified potential biological indicators of climate-driven changes to rocky reef ecosystems, based on ecological importance, ease of measurement, and sensitivity to one or more climate-affected environmental drivers. Significant latitudinal gradients were identified for biota, with habitats, fish assemblages and urchin densities all varying latitudinally with sea surface temperature and current strength. Wave energy and distance offshore were identified as drivers of biota at local-scales (1001000 m). These results indicate that climate-driven changes to various environmental factors will alter the composition and distribution of marine biota, at a variety of scales. The average thermal niche for fish assemblages varied significantly with changing mean sea surface temperature and may be a sentinel indicator of climate-driven changes. Coverage of the kelp Ecklonia radiata, densities of the urchin C. rodgersii, and coral cover were also confirmed as potential valuable biological indicators of climate-driven changes. These indicators, and the widespread baseline data assembled in this study, will facilitate detection of future changes to rocky reef ecosystems in southeastern Australia. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Mapping and monitoring of the land use/cover changes in the wider area of Itanos, Crete, using very high resolution EO imagery with specific interest in archaeological sites
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Archaeological site mapping is important for both understanding the history and protecting the sites from excavation during developmental activities. As archaeological sites are generally spread over a large area, use of high spatial resolution remote sensing imagery is becoming increasingly applicable in the world. The main objective of this study is to map the land cover of the Itanos area of Crete and of its changes, with specific focus on the detection of the landscape's archaeological features. Six satellite images were acquired from the Pleiades and WorldView-2 satellites over a period of 3 years. In addition, digital imagery of two known archaeological sites was used for validation. An object-based image analysis classification was subsequently developed using the five acquired satellite images. Two rule sets were created, one using the standard four bands which both satellites have and another for the two WorldView-2 images with their four extra bands included. Validation of the thematic maps produced from the classification scenarios confirmed a difference in accuracy amongst the five images. Comparing the results of a 4-band rule set versus the 8-band rule set showed a slight increase in classification accuracy using extra bands. The resultant classifications showed a good level of accuracy exceeding 70%. Yet, separating the archaeological sites from the open spaces with little or no vegetation proved to be challenging. This was mainly due to the high spectral similarity between rocks and the archaeological ruins. The high resolution of the satellite data allowed for the accuracy in defining larger archaeological sites, but still there was difficulty in distinguishing smaller areas of interest. The digital image data provided a very good 3D representation for the archaeological sites, assisting as well as in validating the satellite-derived classification maps. To conclude, our study provides further evidence that use of high resolution imagery may allow for archaeological sites to be located, but only where the archaelogical features are of an adequate size.

TI  - A Survey of Blockchain-Based Strategies for Healthcare
T2  - ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
M3  - Article
AB  - Blockchain technology has been gaining visibility owing to its ability to enhance the security, reliability, and robustness of distributed systems. Several areas have benefited from research based on this technology, such as finance, remote sensing, data analysis, and healthcare. Data immutability, privacy, transparency, decentralization, and distributed ledgers are the main features that make blockchain an attractive technology. However, healthcare records that contain confidential patient data make this system very complicated because there is a risk of a privacy breach. This study aims to address research into the applications of the blockchain healthcare area. It sets out by discussing the management of medical information, as well as the sharing of medical records, image sharing, and log management. We also discuss papers that intersect with other areas, such as the Internet of Things, the management of information, tracking of drugs along their supply chain, and aspects of security and privacy. As we are aware that there are other surveys of blockchain in healthcare, we analyze and compare both the positive and negative aspects of their papers. Finally, we seek to examine the concepts of blockchain in the medical area, by assessing their benefits and drawbacks and thus giving guidance to other researchers in the area. Additionally, we summarize the methods used in healthcare per application area and show their pros and cons.

TI  - Reliability and discrepancies of rainfall and temperatures from remote sensing and Brazilian ground weather stations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Insufficient ground meteorological stations limit agricultural research in wide geographic areas, but high-quality data from remote sensing may decrease information gaps, when surface stations are scarce. This study compared meteorological datasets, estimated from satellite and ground meteorological stations in latitudes from 0 to 33 degrees S, to support agricultural research in Brazil. The dataset comprised 3600 records of monthly temperatures and rainfall from 01 Jan 2004 to 31 Dec 2014 in 30 Brazilian municipalities distributed in six regions, labeled according to their precipitation homogeneity. Climatic records from NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource (POWER) online database were compared with data from Brazilian surface stations managed by National Institute of Meteorology (INMET). Monthly rainfall data showed satisfactory correlation coefficients for almost all locations, between 0.75 and 0.95 (p < 0.01), and simple linear models were fit for estimated (satellite) and observed (ground) rainfall relationship (p < 0.001). Complimentary accuracy and precision tests endorsed rainfall satellite-estimated data according to the root mean square error (RMSE) and the modified index of agreement. Maximum and minimum temperatures estimated by remote sensing in the Brazilian South Region were also statistically supported, but unsuitable results were found especially in lower latitudes, based on higher RMSE. The Pearson's correlation coefficient for temperatures increased proportionally with latitude, while rainfall did not show this correlation. These results showed satellite-data quality varies regionally and is affected by seasonal variation. Remote sensors may not detect extreme climatic events such as heavy rainfall or draught and, therefore, need to be appraised carefully.

TI  - Assessment of the offshore wind technical potential for the Brazilian Southeast and South regions
T2  - ENERGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper presents an assessment of the technical potential of the offshore wind resources of the Southeast and South regions along the Brazilian coastline using atmospheric reanalysis databases. At first, three atmospheric reanalysis databases, CFSv2, ERAS and MERRA2, are validated using measured data provided by the PNBOIA program. Afterwards, to estimate the technical potential, two approaches are considered for calculating the usable area on the sea surface. The first approach considers the entire area from the shoreline to the limit of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) along the coastline. In the second approach, some areas are excluded due to technical and environmental restrictions. The NREL 6MW wind turbine with a capacity density of 3 MW/km(2) is used for the energy production calculation. The results include the spatial distribution of the wind speed, wind power density, annual energy production and capacity factor, and other important parameters, presented for different water depth intervals.

TI  - Optimal Interpolation for Infrared Products from Hyperspectral Satellite Imagers and Sounders
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Thermal infrared remote sensing measurements have greatly improved in terms of spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution. These improvements are producing a clearer picture of the land surface and Earth atmospheric composition than ever before. Nevertheless, the analysis of this big quantity of data presents important challenges due to incomplete temporal and spatial recorded information. The aim of the present paper is to discuss a methodology to retrieve missing values of some interesting geophysical variables on a spatial field retrieved from spatially scattered infrared satellite observations in order to yield level 3, regularly gridded, data. The technique is based on a 2-Dimensional (2D) Optimal Interpolation (OI) scheme and is derived from the broad class of Kalman filter or Bayesian estimation theory. The goodness of the approach has been tested on 15-min temporal resolution Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) emissivity and surface temperature (ST) products over South Italy (land and sea), on Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) atmospheric ammonia (NH3) concentration over North Italy and carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and NH3 concentrations over China. All these gases affect air quality. Moreover, sea surface temperature (SST) retrievals have been compared with gridded data from MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) observations. For gases concentration we have considered data from 3 different emission inventories, that is, Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research v3.4.2 (EDGARv3.4.2), the Regional Emission inventory in ASiav3.1 (REASv3.1) and MarcoPolov0.1, plus an independent study. The results show the efficacy of the proposed strategy to better capture the daily cycle for surface parameters and to detect hotspots of severe emissions from gas sources affecting air quality such as CO and NH3 and, therefore, to yield valuable information on the variability of gas concentration to complete ground stations measurements.

TI  - Emergence of a Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): Protocol for Extending Surveillance Used by the Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre and Public Health England
T2  - JMIR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SURVEILLANCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: The Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) and Public Health England (PHE) have successfully worked together on the surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases for over 50 years, including three previous pandemics. With the emergence of the international outbreak of the coronavirus infection (COVID-19), a UK national approach to containment has been established to test people suspected of exposure to COVID-19. At the same time and separately, the RCGP RSC's surveillance has been extended to monitor the temporal and geographical distribution of COVID-19 infection in the community as well as assess the effectiveness of the containment strategy.Objectives: The aims of this study are to surveil COVID-19 in both asymptomatic populations and ambulatory cases with respiratory infections, ascertain both the rate and pattern of COVID-19 spread, and assess the effectiveness of the containment policy.Methods: The RCGP RSC, a network of over 500 general practices in England, extract pseudonymized data weekly. This extended surveillance comprises of five components: (1) Recording in medical records of anyone suspected to have or who has been exposed to COVID-19. Computerized medical records suppliers have within a week of request created new codes to support this. (2) Extension of current virological surveillance and testing people with influenza-like illness or lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)-with the caveat that people suspected to have or who have been exposed to COVID-19 should be referred to the national containment pathway and not seen in primary care. (3) Serology sample collection across all age groups. This will be an extra blood sample taken from people who are attending their general practice for a scheduled blood test. The 100 general practices currently undertaking annual influenza virology surveillance will be involved in the extended virological and serological surveillance. (4) Collecting convalescent serum samples. (5) Data curation. We have the opportunity to escalate the data extraction to twice weekly if needed. Swabs and sera will be analyzed in PHE reference laboratories.Results: General practice clinical system providers have introduced an emergency new set of clinical codes to support COVID-19 surveillance. Additionally, practices participating in current virology surveillance are now taking samples for COVID-19 surveillance from low-risk patients presenting with LRTIs. Within the first 2 weeks of setup of this surveillance, we have identified 3 cases: 1 through the new coding system, the other 2 through the extended virology sampling.Conclusions: We have rapidly converted the established national RCGP RSC influenza surveillance system into one that can test the effectiveness of the COVID-19 containment policy. The extended surveillance has already seen the use of new codes with 3 cases reported. Rapid sharing of this protocol should enable scientific critique and shared learning.

TI  - Benefits of Combining Satellite-Derived Snow Cover Data and Discharge Data to Calibrate a Glaciated Catchment in Sub-Arctic Iceland
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The benefits of fractional snow cover area, as an additional dataset for calibration, were evaluated for an Icelandic catchment with a low degree of glaciation and limited data. For this purpose, a Hydrological Projections for the Environment (HYPE) model was calibrated for the Geithellnaa catchment in south-east Iceland using daily discharge (Q) data and satellite-retrieved MODIS snow cover (SC) images, in a multi-dataset calibration (MDC) approach. By comparing model results using only daily discharge data with results obtained using both datasets, the value of SC data for model calibration was identified. Including SC data improved the performance of daily discharge simulations by 7% and fractional snow cover area simulations by 11%, compared with using only the daily discharge dataset (SDC). These results indicate that MDC improves the overall performance of the HYPE model, confirming previous findings. Therefore, MDC could improve discharge simulations in areas with extra sources of uncertainty, such as glaciers and snow cover. Since the change in fractional snow cover area was more accurate when MDC was applied, it can be concluded that MDC would also provide more realistic projections when calibrated parameter sets are extrapolated to different situations.

TI  - Multispectral radiometric characterization of coffee rust epidemic in different irrigation management systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Coffee rust (Hemileia vastatrix Berk. & Br.) is one of the most prominent diseases in coffee (Coffea arabica L.) and causes serious damage to the crop. The pathogen incubation period may be long for about 30 days and 10% incidence of rust may result in 3 times more disease few days after the signals of rust appear in the leaves, even in the absence of new infections. The objective of this study was to evaluate the applicability of coffee crop monitoring under different irrigation systems by orbital radiometry, exploring the spectral signature and spectral, spatial and temporal pattern of rust incidence in the coffee field. The study was carried out in four areas of coffee plantations in Carmo do Rio Claro, Minas Geris, Brazil, between August 2012 and December 2014, under self-propelled, drip, center pivot irrigation systems and rainfed system. Fifteen Landsat-7/ETM + and Landsat-8/OLI-TIRS images were used, trying to establish a better sequence of images between in situ data of rust incidence in the coffee leaves and coffee leaf growth evaluated by sample meshes in the field along the time. Space-time disease incidence distribution maps, Pearson correlation and reflectance spectral signatures were used to evaluate coffee rust progress in the different irrigation fields. The highest coffee rust incidence occurred in August and corresponded to the values of lower NIR reflectance for all evaluated areas, independently of the irrigation management system. In the visible, SWIR-1 and SWIR-2 spectral regions, there were higher reflectance values in the rainfed area when compared to irrigated areas in rainy periods. There was a greater spectral and temporal variation of rust in the center pivot irrigation system when compared to the other irrigation management systems, presenting high values of average incidence of rust above 30% in the periods close to the harvest period, from June to August 2013 and 2014. The high incidence of rust associated with coffee fruit harvest probably led to a reduction in plant leaf growth in center pivot and rainfed fields. There was a negative correlation between near infrared and rust in the self-propelled and center pivot management systems. High coffee rust incidence values mainly in center pivot and rainfed coffee fields determined reduction in the average reflectance of NIR and green and increase reflectance in red, SWIR-1 and SWIR-2 when compared to periods with lower rust in the coffee fields.

TI  - Cluster Low-Streams Regression Method for Hyperspectral Radiative Transfer Computations: Cases of O<sub>2</sub> A- and CO<sub>2</sub> Bands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Current atmospheric composition sensors provide a large amount of high spectral resolution data. The accurate processing of this data employs time-consuming line-by-line (LBL) radiative transfer models (RTMs). In this paper, we describe a method to accelerate hyperspectral radiative transfer models based on the clustering of the spectral radiances computed with a low-stream RTM and the regression analysis performed for the low-stream and multi-stream RTMs within each cluster. This approach, which we refer to as the Cluster Low-Streams Regression (CLSR) method, is applied for computing the radiance spectra in the O-2 A-band at 760 nm and the CO2 band at 1610 nm for five atmospheric scenarios. The CLSR method is also compared with the principal component analysis (PCA)-based RTM, showing an improvement in terms of accuracy and computational performance over PCA-based RTMs. As low-stream models, the two-stream and the single-scattering RTMs are considered. We show that the error of this approach is modulated by the optical thickness of the atmosphere. Nevertheless, the CLSR method provides a performance enhancement of almost two orders of magnitude compared to the LBL model, while the error of the technique is below 0.1% for both bands.

TI  - Effects on the Double Bounce Detection in Urban Areas Based on SAR Polarimetric Characteristics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 9th International Workshop on Science and Applications of SAR Polarimetry and Polarimetric Interferometry (POLinSAR)
CL  - Frascati, ITALY
AB  - Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) polarimetric datasets are widely used in the detection and classification of urban areas. Most methods used today are based on the decomposition of fully polarimetric SAR data, which allows for the extraction of physical information about the nature of the medium and the application of proper classification methods. According to the theory, the main and predominant backscattering mechanism for buildings is double bounce. However, when analyzing urban environments, the observed predominant backscatter may differ from theory depending on many aspects. In this paper, we analyze fully polarimetric ALOS PALSAR data for various cities located on different continents, proving that the theory does not hold for most cases. There are many factors that have an impact on the detected backscatter mechanism, and the theoretical principle of predominant double bounce in urban areas can be met only under specific conditions. These factors are, among others, the orientation of the buildings, the dimensions of the streets, the type of construction (i.e., numerous planes on the roof), etc. This paper also mentions the canonical example of San Francisco, widely analyzed in the literature, as a case showing the impact of building deorientation on double bounce scattering. This area of interest is also discussed in terms of the impact of SAR data resolution on the detection of specific backscatter mechanisms. The findings of this work are very useful for increasing the awareness of the utilization of classification approaches where only pixels with double bounce backscatter mechanisms are classified as urban areas. Moreover, the article lists factors that should be taken into consideration when performing urban area detection based only on polarimetric data and standard algorithms, such as street and building orientation, building heights, and structures.

TI  - Antarctic petrels 'on the ice rocks': wintering strategy of an Antarctic seabird
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - There is a paucity of information on the foraging ecology, especially individual use of sea-ice features and icebergs, over the non-breeding season in many seabird species. Using geolocators and stable isotopes, we defined the movements, distribution and diet of adult Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica from the largest known breeding colony, the inland Svarthamaren, Antarctica. More specifically, we examined how sea-ice concentration and free-drifting icebergs affect the distribution of Antarctic petrels. After breeding, birds moved north to the marginal ice zone (MIZ) in the Weddell sector of the Southern Ocean, following its northward extension during freeze-up in April, and they wintered there in April-August. There, the birds stayed predominantly out of the water (60-80% of the time) suggesting they use icebergs as platforms to stand on and/or to rest. Feather delta N-15 values encompassed one full trophic level, indicating that birds fed on various proportions of crustaceans and fish/squid, most likely Antarctic krill Euphausia superba and the myctophid fish Electrona antarctica and/or the squid Psychroteuthis glacialis. Birds showed strong affinity for the open waters of the northern boundary of the MIZ, an important iceberg transit area, which offers roosting opportunities and rich prey fields. The strong association of Antarctic petrels with sea-ice cycle and icebergs suggests the species can serve, year-round, as a sentinel of environmental changes for this remote region.

TI  - Estimating tree canopy cover using harmonic regression coefficients derived from multitemporal Landsat data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study was to evaluate whether harmonic regression coefficients derived using all available cloud free observations in a given Landsat pixel for a three-year period can be used to estimate tree canopy cover (TCC), and whether models developed using harmonic regression coefficients as predictor variables are better than models developed using median composite predictor variables, the previous operational standard for the National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The two study areas in the conterminous USA were as follows: West (Oregon), bounded by Landsat Worldwide Reference System 2 (WRS-2) paths/rows 43/30, 44/30, and 45/30; and South (Georgia/South Carolina), bounded by WRS-2 paths/rows 16/37, 17/37, and 18/37. Plot-specific tree canopy cover (the response variable) was collected by experienced interpreters using a dot grid overlaid on 1 m spatial resolution National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP) images at two different times per region, circa 2010 and circa 2014. Random forest model comparisons (using 500 independent model runs for each comparison) revealed the following (1) harmonic regression coefficients (one harmonic) are better predictors for every time/region of TCC than median composite focal means and standard deviations (across times/regions, mean increase in pseudo R-2 of 6.7% and mean decrease in RMSE of 1.7% TCC) and (2) harmonic regression coefficients (one harmonic, from NDVI, SWIR1, and SWIR2), when added to the full suite of median composite and terrain variables used for the NLCD 2011 product, improve the quality of TCC models for every time/region (mean increase in pseudo R-2 of 3.6% and mean decrease in RMSE of 1.0% TCC). The harmonic regression NDVI constant was always one of the top four most important predictors across times/regions, and is more correlated with TCC than the NDVI median composite focal mean. Eigen analysis revealed that there is little to no additional information in the full suite of predictor variables (47 bands) when compared to the harmonic regression coefficients alone (using NDVI, SWIR1, and SWIR2; 9 bands), a finding echoed by both model fit statistics and the resulting maps. We conclude that harmonic regression coefficients derived from Landsat (or, by extension, other comparable earth resource satellite data) can be used to map TCC, either alone or in combination with other TCC-related variables.

TI  - Hydraulic Model Calibration Using Water Levels Derived from Time Series High-Resolution SAR Images
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Hydraulic models require water extents (WE) and water levels (WL) for their calibration and validation. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been readily used in the past to delineate water bodies and extract WL from the digital terrain model (DTM). However, studies using SAR data to calibrate hydraulic models have been carried out with a limited number of images. This study aims to use WL derived from a time series of high-resolution (5 m) Radarsat-2 SAR images to calibrate a one-dimensional model (HEC-RAS) using an automated algorithm on a 40-km reach of the Athabasca River in Alberta, Canada. Eighteen images, spanning 2012-2016, were processed to extract WL using a high-resolution (2 m) DTM that combined light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data and bathymetry acquired by boat surveying. The impact of the number of images used for the calibration has been assessed. The best root mean square error in validation between the SAR-derived and simulated WL was 0.28 m using seven images. Finally, a critical success index (CSI) was performed to compare the SAR-derived and simulated WE. No significant change in CSI was observed because of riverbank steepness.

TI  - Rapid and robust monitoring of flood events using Sentinel-1 and Landsat data on the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) sensors represent an indispensable data source for flood disaster planners and responders, given their ability to image the Earth's surface nearly independently of weather conditions and time of day. The decision by the European Space Agency (ESA) Copernicus program to open data from its Sentinel-1 SAR satellites to the public marks the first time global, operational SAR data have been made freely available. Combined with the emergence of cloud computing platforms like the Google Earth Engine (GEE), this development presents a tremendous opportunity to the disaster response community, for whom rapid access to analysis-ready data is needed to inform effective flood disaster response interventions and management plans. Here, we present an algorithm that exploits all available Sentinel-1 SAR images in combination with historical Landsat and other auxiliary data sources hosted on the GEE to rapidly map surface inundation during flood events. Our algorithm relies on multi-temporal SAR statistics to identify unexpected floods in near real-time. Additionally, historical Landsat-based surface water class probabilities are used to distinguish unexpected floods from permanent or seasonally occurring surface water. We assessed our algorithm over three recent flood events using coincident very high- spatial resolution imagery and operational flood maps. Using very high resolution optical imagery, we estimated an area-normalized accuracy of 89.8 +/- 2.8% (95% c.i.) over Houston, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in late August 2017, representing an improvement of between 1.6% and 9.8% over flood maps derived from a simple backscatter threshold. Additionally, comparison of our results with SAR-derived Copernicus Emergency Management Service (EMS) maps following devastating floods in Thessaly, Greece and Eastern Madagascar in January and March 2018, respectively, yielded overall agreement rates of 98.5% in both cases. Importantly, our algorithm was able to ingest hundreds of SAR and optical images served on the GEE to produce flood maps over affected areas within minutes, circumventing the need for time-consuming data download and pre-processing steps. The flexibility of our algorithm will allow for the rapid processing of future open-access SAR data, including data from future Sentinel-1 missions.

TI  - Comparison of MODIS and Model-Derived Snow-Covered Areas: Impact of Land Use and Solar Illumination Conditions
T2  - GEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometry (MODIS) snow cover accuracy has been assessed in the past at different scales, with various approaches and in relation to the many factors influencing the remote observation of snow-covered areas (SCA). However, the challenge of fully characterizing MODIS accuracy over forest sites is still open. In this study, we exploit 5 years of data from the upper river Adige basin at Ponte Adige (Eastern Italian Alps) to condition an enhanced temperature index snowpack model accounting for model parameter uncertainty by using the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology. The simulated SCA is then compared with MODIS retrievals through a range of different statistical metrics to investigate how land use and solar illumination conditions affect such comparison. In particular, the Overall Accuracy index (OA) is used to quantify the agreement between satellite-derived and simulated SCA on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Analyzing the spatial variability either of the median OA and its range shows that illumination conditions over forested canopies represent a major source of uncertainty in MODIS SCA. Exploiting this finding, we identify the minimum level of incoming short-wave radiation for accurate use of MODIS SCA in forest areas.

TI  - ResUNet-a: A deep learning framework for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Scene understanding of high resolution aerial images is of great importance for the task of automated monitoring in various remote sensing applications. Due to the large within-class and small between-class variance in pixel values of objects of interest, this remains a challenging task. In recent years, deep convolutional neural networks have started being used in remote sensing applications and demonstrate state of the art performance for pixel level classification of objects. Here we propose a reliable framework for performant results for the task of semantic segmentation of monotemporal very high resolution aerial images. Our framework consists of a novel deep learning architecture, ResUNet-a, and a novel loss function based on the Dice loss. ResUNet-a uses a UNet encoder/decoder backbone, in combination with residual connections, atrous convolutions, pyramid scene parsing pooling and multi-tasking inference. ResUNet-a infers sequentially the boundary of the objects, the distance transform of the segmentation mask, the segmentation mask and a colored reconstruction of the input. Each of the tasks is conditioned on the inference of the previous ones, thus establishing a conditioned relationship between the various tasks, as this is described through the architecture's computation graph. We analyse the performance of several flavours of the Generalized Dice loss for semantic segmentation, and we introduce a novel variant loss function for semantic segmentation of objects that has excellent convergence properties and behaves well even under the presence of highly imbalanced classes. The performance of our modeling framework is evaluated on the ISPRS 2D Potsdam dataset. Results show state-of-the-art performance with an average F1 score of 92.9% over all classes for our best model.

TI  - Drivers and Implications of Land Use/Land Cover Dynamics in Finchaa Catchment, Northwestern Ethiopia
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding the trajectories and extents of land use/land cover change (LULCC) is important to generate and provide helpful information to policymakers and development practitioners about the magnitude and trends of LULCC. This study presents the contributing factors of LULCC, the extent and implications of these changes for sustainable land use in the Finchaa catchment. Data from Landsat images 1987, 2002, and 2017 were used to develop the land use maps and quantify the changes. A supervised classification with the maximum likelihood classifier was used to classify the images. Key informant interviews and focused group discussions with transect walks were used for the socio-economic survey. Over the past three decades, agricultural land, commercial farm, built-up, and water bodies have increased while forestland, rangeland, grazing land, and swampy areas have decreased. Intensive agriculture without proper management practice has been a common problem of the catchment. Increased cultivation of steep slopes has increased the risk of erosion and sedimentation of nearby water bodies. Multiple factors, such as biophysical, socio-economic, institutional, technological, and demographic, contributed to the observed LULCC in the study area. A decline in agricultural yield, loss of biodiversity, extended aridity and drought, land and soil degradation, and decline of water resources are the major consequences of LULCC in the Finchaa catchment. The socio-economic developments and population growth have amplified the prolonged discrepancy between supply and demand for land and water in the catchment. More comprehensive and integrated watershed management policies will be indispensable to manage the risks.

TI  - Automated Mapping of Antarctic Supraglacial Lakes Using a Machine Learning Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Supraglacial lakes can have considerable impact on ice sheet mass balance and global sea-level-rise through ice shelf fracturing and subsequent glacier speedup. In Antarctica, the distribution and temporal development of supraglacial lakes as well as their potential contribution to increased ice mass loss remains largely unknown, requiring a detailed mapping of the Antarctic surface hydrological network. In this study, we employ a Machine Learning algorithm trained on Sentinel-2 and auxiliary TanDEM-X topographic data for automated mapping of Antarctic supraglacial lakes. To ensure the spatio-temporal transferability of our method, a Random Forest was trained on 14 training regions and applied over eight spatially independent test regions distributed across the whole Antarctic continent. In addition, we employed our workflow for large-scale application over Amery Ice Shelf where we calculated interannual supraglacial lake dynamics between 2017 and 2020 at full ice shelf coverage. To validate our supraglacial lake detection algorithm, we randomly created point samples over our classification results and compared them to Sentinel-2 imagery. The point comparisons were evaluated using a confusion matrix for calculation of selected accuracy metrics. Our analysis revealed wide-spread supraglacial lake occurrence in all three Antarctic regions. For the first time, we identified supraglacial meltwater features on Abbott, Hull and Cosgrove Ice Shelves in West Antarctica as well as for the entire Amery Ice Shelf for years 2017-2020. Over Amery Ice Shelf, maximum lake extent varied strongly between the years with the 2019 melt season characterized by the largest areal coverage of supraglacial lakes (similar to 763 km(2)). The accuracy assessment over the test regions revealed an average Kappa coefficient of 0.86 where the largest value of Kappa reached 0.98 over George VI Ice Shelf. Future developments will involve the generation of circum-Antarctic supraglacial lake mapping products as well as their use for further methodological developments using Sentinel-1 SAR data in order to characterize intraannual supraglacial meltwater dynamics also during polar night and independent of meteorological conditions. In summary, the implementation of the Random Forest classifier enabled the development of the first automated mapping method applied to Sentinel-2 data distributed across all three Antarctic regions.

TI  - Mapping Winter Wheat in North China Using Sentinel 2A/B Data: A Method Based on Phenology-Time Weighted Dynamic Time Warping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate mapping of winter wheat over a large area is of great significance for guiding policy formulation related to food security, farmland management, and the international food trade. Due to the complex phenological features of winter wheat, the cloud contamination in time-series imagery, and the influence of the soil/snow background on vegetation indices, there remains no effective method for mapping winter wheat at a medium spatial resolution (10-30 m). In this study, we proposed a novel method called phenology-time weighted dynamic time warping (PT-DTW) for identifying winter wheat based on Sentinel 2A/B time-series data. The main advantages of PT-DTW include (1) the use of phenological features in two periods, i.e., the greenness increase before winter and greenness decrease after heading, which are common to all winter wheat and are distinct from the features of other land cover types, and (2) the use of the normalized differential phenology index (NDPI) instead of traditional vegetation indices to provide more robust vegetation information and to suppress the adverse impacts of soil and snow cover, especially during the before-winter growth period. The proposed PT-DTW method was employed for winter wheat mapping based on Sentinel 2A/B data on the Huang-Huai Plain, China. Validation with visually interpreted samples showed that the produced winter wheat map achieved an overall classification accuracy of 89.98% and a kappa coefficient of 0.7978, outperforming previous winter wheat classification methods. Moreover, the planting area derived from PT-DTW agreed well with census data at the municipal level, with a coefficient of determination of 0.8638, indicating that the winter wheat map produced at 20 m resolution was reliable overall. Therefore, the PT-DTW method is recommended for winter wheat mapping over large areas.

TI  - An analysis of antibiotic prescribing practices for enteric bacterial infections within FoodNet Canada sentinel sites
T2  - JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Understanding the current state of antibiotic treatment guidelines and prescribing practices for bacterial enteric infections is critical to inform antibiotic stewardship initiatives. This study aims to add to the current understanding through three objectives: (i) to identify and summarize published treatment guidelines for bacterial enteric infections; (ii) to describe observed antibiotic prescribing practices for bacterial enteric infections across three sentinel sites in Canada; and (iii) to assess concordance between observed antibiotic prescribing and treatment guidelines.Methods: An environmental scan of treatment guidelines for bacterial enteric infections was conducted and recommendations were collated. A descriptive analysis of cases of bacterial enteric illnesses captured in FoodNet Canada's sentinel site surveillance system between 2010 and 2018 was performed. Antibiotic-use data were self-reported by cases via an enhanced questionnaire.Results: Ten treatment guidelines were identified in the environmental scan. There was substantial variation between guidelines for both when to prescribe antibiotics and which antibiotics were recommended. Of the 5877 cases of Laboratory-confirmed bacterial enteric illness in the three sites, 49% of cases reported having received an antibiotic prescription. Of particular significance was the finding that 21% of verotoxigenic Escherichia coli cases received a prescription. Of the 17 antibiotics recommended in the guidelines, 14 were used in practice. In addition to these, 18 other antibiotics not included in any of the guidelines reviewed were also prescribed.Conclusions: Our study suggests that a substantial proportion of enteric bacterial infections in Canada are prescribed antibiotics. These findings highlight the need to standardize treatment guidelines for enteric illnesses and could be used to inform future stewardship programme development.

TI  - State of natural vegetation conservation across the landscape temporal changes in Paraguai/Jauquara Hydrographic Basin. in Mato Grosso - Brazil
T2  - ATELIE GEOGRAFICO
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of this study is to analyze the changes in the landscape structure and its effects on the conservation of natural vegetation in the Paraguay/Jauquara-MT Hydrographic Basin. The study is justified by the importance of the hydrographic region and its sub-basins in the contribution of the flood pulse of the Pantanal in Mato Grosso state. In the study, images from the Landsat-5 and 8 satellites were used, classified by land use and land cover in the years 1997, 2007 and 2017. Seven landscape metrics were applied to analyze the changes that occurred over the 20-year period, through measures of area, fragmentation, size, connectivity and isolation from natural vegetation. The results indicated that 19% of the natural vegetation was converted by pasture, 14% between 1997 and 2007 and 4% between 2007 and 2017. Agriculture was responsible for 1% of the vegetation between 1997 and 2007, which also contributed to fragmentation and an increase in the degree of isolation from the remaining vegetation in the basin. Therefore, it is suggested that efficient measures be adopted in environmental management, as the alteration of the natural vegetation in the study area may affect the geosystems and the flood pulse of the Pantanal plain.

TI  - Precipitation-Sensitive Dynamic Threshold: A New and Simple Method to Detect and Monitor Forest and Woody Vegetation Cover in Sub-Humid to Arid Areas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote-sensing tools and satellite data are often used to map and monitor changes in vegetation cover in forests and other perennial woody vegetation. Large-scale vegetation mapping from remote sensing is usually based on the classification of its spectral properties by means of spectral Vegetation Indices (VIs) and a set of rules that define the connection between them and vegetation cover. However, observations show that, across a gradient of precipitation, similar values of VI can be found for different levels of vegetation cover as a result of concurrent changes in the leaf density (Leaf Area Index-LAI) of plant canopies. Here we examine the three-way link between precipitation, vegetation cover, and LAI, with a focus on the dry range of precipitation in semi-arid to dry sub-humid zones, and propose a new and simple approach to delineate woody vegetation in these regions. By showing that the range of values of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) that represent woody vegetation changes along a gradient of precipitation, we propose a data-based dynamic lower threshold of NDVI that can be used to delineate woody vegetation from non-vegetated areas. This lower threshold changes with mean annual precipitation, ranging from less than 0.1 in semi-arid areas, to over 0.25 in mesic Mediterranean area. Validation results show that this precipitation-sensitive dynamic threshold provides a more accurate delineation of forests and other woody vegetation across the precipitation gradient, compared to the traditional constant threshold approach.

TI  - Tracking Lake and Reservoir Changes in the Nenjiang Watershed, Northeast China: Patterns, Trends, and Drivers
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - In terms of evident climate change and human activities, investigating changes in lakes and reservoirs is critical for sustainable protection of water resources and ecosystem management over the Nenjiang watershed (NJW), an eco-sensitive semi-arid region and the third-largest inland waterbody cluster in China. In this study, we established a multi-temporal dataset documenting lake and reservoir (area >= 1 km(2)) changes in this region using an object-oriented image classification method and Landsat series images from 1980 to 2015. Using the structural equation model (SEM), we analyzed the diverse impacts of climatic and anthropogenic variables on lake changes. Results indicated that lakes experienced significant changes with fluctuations over the past 35 years including obvious declines in the total area (by 42%) and number (by 51%) from 1980 to 2010 and a slight increase in the total lake area and number from 2010 to 2015. More than 235 lakes in the size class of 1-10 km2 decreased to small lakes (area < 1 km(2)), while 59 lakes covering 243.75 km(2) disappeared. Total reservoir area and number had continuous increases during the investigated 35 years, with an areal expansion of 54.9% from 919 km(2) to 1422 km(2), and a number increase by 65.3% from 78 to 129. The SEM revealed that the lake area in the NJW had a significant correlation with the mean annual precipitation (MAP), suggesting that the MAP decline clarified most of the lake shrinkage in the NJW. Furthermore, agricultural consumption of water had potential impacts on lake changes, suggested by the significant relationship between cropland area and lake area.

TI  - Deformation Time Series and Driving-Force Analysis of Glaciers in the Eastern Tienshan Mountains Using the SBAS InSAR Method
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Glacier melting is one of the important causes of glacier morphology change and can provide basic parameters for calculating glacier volume change and glacier mass balance, which, in turn, is important for evaluating water resources. However, it is difficult to obtain large-scale time series of glacier changes due to the cloudy and foggy conditions which are typical of mountain areas. Gravity-measuring satellites and laser altimetry satellites can monitor changes in glacier volume over a wide area, while synthetic-aperture radar satellites can monitoring glacier morphology with a high spatial and temporal resolution. In this article, an interferometric method using a short temporal baseline and a short spatial baseline, called the Small Baseline Subsets (SBAS) Interferometric Synthetic-Aperture Radar (InSAR) method, was used to study the average rate of glacier deformation on Karlik Mountain, in the Eastern Tienshan Mountains, China, by using 19 Sentinel-1A images from November 2017 to December 2018. Thus, a time series analysis of glacier deformation was conducted. It was found that the average glacier deformation in the study region was -11.77 +/- 9.73 mm/year, with the observation sites generally moving away from the satellite along the Line of Sight (LOS). Taking the ridge line as the dividing line, it was found that the melting rate of southern slopes was higher than that of northern slopes. According to the perpendicular of the mountain direction, the mountain was divided into an area in the northwest with large glaciers (Area I) and an area in the southeast with small glaciers (Area II). It was found that the melting rate in the southeast area was larger than that in the northwest area. Additionally, through the analysis of temperature and precipitation data, it was found that precipitation played a leading role in glacier deformation in the study region. Through the statistical analysis of the deformation, it was concluded that the absolute value of deformation is large at elevations below 4200 m while the absolute value of the deformation is very small at elevations above 4500 m; the direction of deformation is always away from the satellite along the LOS and the absolute value of glacier deformation decreases with increasing elevation.

TI  - Multiresolution Multimodal Sensor Fusion for Remote Sensing Data With Label Uncertainty
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In remote sensing, each sensor can provide complementary or reinforcing information. It is valuable to fuse outputs from multiple sensors to boost overall performance. Previous supervised fusion methods often require accurate labels for each pixel in the training data. However, in many remote-sensing applications, pixel-level labels are difficult or infeasible to obtain. In addition, outputs from multiple sensors often have different resolutions or modalities. For example, rasterized hyperspectral imagery (HSI) presents data in a pixel grid while airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) generates dense 3-D point clouds. It is often difficult to directly fuse such multimodal, multiresolution data. To address these challenges, we present a novel multiple instance multiresolution fusion (MIMRF) framework that can fuse multiresolution and multimodal sensor outputs while learning from automatically generated, imprecisely labeled data. Experiments were conducted on the MUUFL Gulfport HSI and LiDAR data set and a remotely sensed soybean and weed data set. Results show improved, consistent performance on scene understanding and agricultural applications when compared to traditional fusion methods.

TI  - Multiscale Refinement Network for Water-Body Segmentation in High-Resolution Satellite Imagery
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Water-body segmentation in high-resolution satellite imagery is challenging because of the significant variations in the appearance, size, and shape of water bodies. In this letter, a novel multiscale refinement network (MSR-Net) is proposed for water-body segmentation. Similar to most learning-based methods, the MSR-Net resorts to the multiscale information for segmentation, but it improves existing networks in two ways: First, it uses the multiscale information in a new perspective. Instead of the traditional one-off manner that concatenates features and conducts segmentation on one uniform scale, the MSR-Net adopts a new multiscale refinement scheme that makes full use of the multiscale features for more accurate water-body segmentation. In addition, a novel erasing-attention module is designed for an effective feature embedding during the refinement scheme. Experiments on the Gaofen Image Data Set and the DeepGlobe Data Set demonstrate the superiority of MSR-Net when compared with the other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods, including U-Net, SegNet, DeepLabv3+, and ExFuse.

TI  - Glacial Lake Outburst Flood Hazard, Downstream Impact, and Risk Over the Indian Himalayas
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Indian Himalayas are home to numerous glacial lakes, which can pose serious threat to downstream communities and lead to catastrophic socioeconomic disasters in case of a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF). This study first identified 329 glacial lakes of size greater than 0.05 km(2) in the Indian Himalayas, and then a remote sensing-based hazard and risk assessment was performed on these lakes. Different factors such as avalanche, rockfall, upstream GLOF, lake expansion, identification of the presence of ice cores, and assessment of the stability of moraine were considered for the hazard modeling. Further, a stochastic inundation model was applied to quantify the potential number of buildings, bridges, and hydropower systems that could be inundated by GLOF in each lake. Finally, the hazard parameters and downstream impact were collectively considered to determine the risk linked with each lake. A total of 23 lakes were identified as very high risk lakes and 50 as high-risk lakes. The potential flood volumes associated with various triggering mechanisms were also measured and were used to identify the lakes with the most considerable risk, such as Shakho Cho and Khangchung Tso. This study is anticipated to support stakeholders and decision-makers in identifying critical glacial lakes and make well-informed decisions related to future modeling efforts, field studies, and risk mitigation measures.Key PointsAvalanche trajectories suggest that 36 out of 329 glacial lakes are susceptible to dynamic failure via an avalanche entering the lake Application of stochastic flood model reveals that 67 glacial lakes contain at least one hydropower system along their flow path Indian Himalayas contain 23 critical glacial lakes, 17 of which are located in the state of Sikkim

TI  - An Update on Regional Nodal Irradiation: Indication, Target Volume Delineation, and Radiotherapy Techniques
T2  - BREAST CARE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Tremendous changes have occurred in the treatment of breast cancer. This paper reviews and unifies the available data on modern axillary management of breast cancer patients with focus on the target volume delineation for regional nodal irradiation according to the most important contouring guidelines, the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) and the Radiation Therapy and Oncology Group (RTOG). Summary: The use of extensive radiotherapy target volumes (level I, II, III, IV) is probably not necessary for all patients to reproduce the clinical benefit shown in the available randomized trials (EORTC, MA.20, AMAROS, Z0011). Nevertheless, given the results in the MA.20 trial, where the patients received more modern systemic therapies and high irradiation doses in the medial paraclavicular region (level IV) and level II, it can be justified to include these regions completely in selected high-risk patients. Key Messages: High-tangent irradiation results in a similar dose distribution in axillary levels I and II compared to the AMAROS treatment field design in some patients. This supports earlier assumptions that irradiation may have accounted for the good results after sentinel lymph node dissection alone in the Z0011 trial. The ESTRO and RTOG clinical target volume (CTV) definitions cover sufficiently the metastatic lymph node hotspots, with a better coverage for the ESTRO CTV. Further, contouring according to the ESTRO would spare a significantly larger part of the healthy lymphatic system, making it our preferred contouring atlas. Modern radiotherapy techniques, such as deep inspiration breath hold, should be cautiously employed in patients treated according to the inclusion criteria of the Z0011 as it will result in a lower dose to the axillary levels.

TI  - How Can Remote Sensing Help Monitor Tropical Moist Forest Degradation?-A Systematic Review
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In the context of the climate and biodiversity crisis facing our planet, tropical forests playing a key role in global carbon flux and containing over half of Earth's species are important to preserve. They are today threatened by deforestation but also by forest degradation, which is more difficult to study. Here, we performed a systematic review of studies on moist tropical forest degradation using remote sensing and fitting indicators of forest resilience to perturbations. Geographical repartition, spatial extent and temporal evolution were analyzed. Indicators of compositional, structural and regeneration criteria were noted as well as remote sensing indices and metrics used. Tropical moist forest degradation is not extensively studied especially in the Congo basin and in southeast Asia. Forest structure (i.e., canopy gaps, fragmentation and biomass) is the most widely and easily measured criteria with remote sensing, while composition and regeneration are more difficult to characterize. Mixing LiDAR/Radar and optical data shows good potential as well as very high-resolution satellite data. The awaited GEDI and BIOMASS satellites data will fill the actual gap to a large extent and provide accurate structural information. LiDAR and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) form a good bridge between field and satellite data. While the performance of the LiDAR is no longer to be demonstrated, particular attention should be brought to the UAV that shows great potential and could be more easily used by local communities and stakeholders.

TI  - A study on trade-offs between spatial resolution and temporal sampling density for wheat yield estimation using both thermal and calendar time
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Within-season forecasting of crop yields is of great economic, geo-strategic and humanitarian interest. Satellite Earth Observation now constitutes a valuable and innovative way to provide spatio-temporal information to assist such yield forecasts. This study explores different configurations of remote sensing time series to estimate of winter wheat yield using either spatially finer but temporally sparser time series (5daily at 100 m spatial resolution) or spatially coarser but denser (300 m and 1 km at daily frequency) time series. Furthermore, we hypothesised that better yield estimations could be made using thermal time, which is closer to the crop physiological development. Time series of NDVI from the PROBA-V instrument, which has delivered images at a spatial resolution of 100 m, 300 m and 1 km since 2013, were extracted for 39 fields for field and 56 fields for regional level analysis across Northern France during the growing season 2014-2015. An asymmetric double sigmoid model was fitted on the NDVI series of the central pixel of the field. The fitted model was subsequently integrated either over thermal time or over calendar time, using different baseline NDVI thresholds to mark the start and end of the cropping season. These integrated values were used as a predictor for yield using a simple linear regression and yield observations at field level. The dependency of this relationship on the spatial pixel purity was analysed for the 100 m, 300 m and 1 km spatial resolution. At field level, depending on the spatial resolution and the NDVI threshold, the adjusted R-2 ranged from 0.20 to 0.74; jackknifed - leave-one-field-out cross validation - RMSE ranged from 0.6 to 1.07 t/ha and MAE ranged between 0.46 and 0.90 t/ha for thermal time analysis. The best results for yield estimation (adjusted R-2 = 0.74, RMSE = 0.6 t/ha and MAE = 0.46 t/ha) were obtained from the integration over thermal time of 100 m pixel resolution using a baseline NDVI threshold of 0.2 and without any selection based on pixel purity. The field scale yield estimation was aggregated to the regional scale using 56 fields. At the regional level, there was a difference of 0.0012 t/ha between thermal and calendar time for average yield estimations. The standard error of mean results showed that the error was larger for a higher spatial resolution with no pixel purity and smaller when purity increased. These results suggest that, for winter wheat, a finer spatial resolution rather than a higher revisit frequency and an increasing pixel purity enable more accurate yield estimations when integrated over thermal time at the field scale and at the regional scale only if higher pixel purity levels are considered. This method can be extended to larger regions, other crops, and other regions in the world, although site and crop-specific adjustments will have to include other threshold temperatures to reflect the boundaries of phenological activity. In general, however, this methodological approach should be applicable to yield estimation at the parcel and regional scales across the world.

TI  - Large variability exists in the management of posterolateral corner injuries in the global surgical community
T2  - KNEE SURGERY SPORTS TRAUMATOLOGY ARTHROSCOPY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The management of posterolateral corner (PLC) injuries has significantly evolved over the past 2 decades. The purpose of this study was to determine the current worldview of key concepts on the diagnosis, treatment strategy, and rehabilitation for patients presenting with PLC injuries. Methods A 12-question multiple-choice online survey was designed to address key questions in the diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation of PLC injuries. The survey was distributed to the most important international sports medicine societies worldwide. Clinical agreement was defined as > 80% of agreement in responses and general agreement was defined as > 60% of agreement in responses. Results 975 surgeons completed the survey with 49% from Europe, 21% from North America, 12% from Latin America, 12% from Asia, and smaller percentages from Africa and Oceania. Less than 14% of respondents manage more than ten PCL injuries yearly. Clinical agreement of > 80% was only evident in the use of MRI in the diagnosis of PLC injury. Responses for surgical treatment were split between isometric fibular-based reconstruction techniques and anatomically based fibular and tibial-based reconstructions. A general agreement of > 60% was present for the use of a post-operative brace in the early rehabilitation. Conclusion In the global surgical community, there remains a significant variability in the diagnosis, treatment, and postoperative management of PLC injuries. The number of PLC injuries treated yearly by most surgeons remains low. As global clinical consensus for PLC remains elusive, societies will need to play an important role in the dissemination of evidence-based practices for PLC injuries.

TI  - Fire severity and soil erosion susceptibility mapping using multi-temporal Earth Observation data: The case of Mati fatal wildfire in Eastern Attica, Greece
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent years, forest fires have increased in terms of frequency, extent and intensity, especially in Mediterranean countries. Climate characteristics and anthropogenic disturbances lead forest environments to display high vulnerability to wildfires, with their sustainability being threatened by the loss of vegetation, changes on soil properties, and increased soil loss rates. Moreover, wildfires are a great threat to property and human life, especially in Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI) areas. In light of the impacts and trends mentioned above, this study aims to assess the impact of the Mati, Attika wildfire on soil erosion. The event caused 102 fatalities, inducing severe consequences to the local infrastructure network; economy; and natural resources. As such, the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was implemented (pre-; post-fire) at the Rafina, Attika watershed encompassing the Mali WUI. Fire severity was evaluated based on the Normalized Bum Ratio (NBR). This index was developed utilizing innovative remotely sensed Earth Observation data (Sentinel-2). The high post-fire values indicate the fire's devastating effects on vegetation loss and soil erosion. A critical "update" was also made to the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) v. 2018, by introducing a new land use class namely "Urban Forest", in order to distinguish the WUI configuration. Post-fire erosion rates are notably higher throughout the study area (4.53-5.98 t ha(-1) y(-1)), and especially within the WUI zone (3.75-18.58 t ha(-1) y(-1)), while newly developed and highly vulnerable cites now occupy the greater Mad area. Furthermore, archive satellite data (Landsat-5) revealed how the repeated (historical) wildfires have ultimately impacted vegetation recovery and erosional processes. To our knowledge this is the first time that RUSLE is used to simulate soil erosion at a WUI after a fire event, at least at a Mediterranean basin. The realistic results attest that the model can perform well at such diverse conditions, providing a solid basis for soil loss estimation and identification of high-risk erosion areas.

TI  - Quantification of Erosion in Selected Catchment Areas of the Ruzizi River (DRC) Using the (R)USLE Model
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Inappropriate land management leads to soil loss with destruction of the land's resource and sediment input into the receiving river. Part of the sediment budget of a catchment is the estimation of soil loss. In the Ruzizi catchment in the Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), only limited research has been conducted on soil loss mainly dealing with local observations on geomorphological forms or river load measurements; a regional quantification of soil loss is missing so far. Such quantifications can be calculated using the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE). It is composed of four factors: precipitation (R), soil (K), topography (LS), and vegetation cover (C). The factors can be calculated in different ways according to the characteristics of the study area. In this paper, different approaches for calculating the single factors are reviewed and validated with field work in two sub-catchments of Ruzizi River supplying the water for the reservoirs of Ruzizi I and II hydroelectric dams. It became obvious that the (R)USLE model provides the best results with revised R and LS factors. C factor calculations required to conduct a supervised classification using the Maximum Likelihood Procedure. Different C factor values were assigned to the land cover classes. The calculations resulted in a soil loss rate for the predominantly occurring Ferralsols and Leptosols of around 576 kt/yr in both catchments, when 2016 landcover and precipitation are used. This represents an area-normalized value of 40.4 t/ha/yr for Ruzizi I and 50.5 t/ha/yr for Ruzizi II due to different landcover in the two sub-catchments. The mean value for the whole study area is 47.8 t/ha/yr or even 27.1 t/ha/yr when considering land management techniques like terracing on the slopes (P factor). This work has shown that the (R)USLE model can serve as an easy to handle tool for soil loss quantification when comprehensive field work results are sparse. The model can be implemented in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with free data; hence, a validation is crucial. It becomes apparent that the use of high resolution Sentinel 2a MSI data as the basis for C factor calculations is an appropriate method for considering heterogeneous Land Use Land Cover (LULC) patterns. To transfer the approach to other regions, the calculation of factor R needs to be modified.

TI  - Multi-Scale Evaluation of the TSEB Model over a Complex Agricultural Landscape in Morocco
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - An accurate assessment of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucially needed at the basin scale for studying the hydrological processes and water balance especially from upstream to downstream. In the mountains, this term is poorly understood because of various challenges, including the vegetation complexity, plant diversity, lack of available data and because the in situ direct measurement of ET is difficult in complex terrain. The main objective of this work was to investigate the potential of a Two-Source-Energy-Balance model (TSEB) driven by the Landsat and MODIS data for estimating ET over a complex mountain region. The complexity is associated with the type of the vegetation canopy as well as the changes in topography. For validating purposes, a large-aperture scintillometer (LAS) was set up over a heterogeneous transect of about 1.4 km to measure sensible (H) and latent heat (LE) fluxes. Additionally, two towers of eddy covariance (EC) systems were installed along the LAS transect. First, the model was tested at the local scale against the EC measurements using multi-scale remote sensing (MODIS and Landsat) inputs at the satellite overpasses. The obtained averaged values of the root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R) were about 72.4 Wm(-2) and 0.79 and 82.0 Wm(-2) and 0.52 for Landsat and MODIS data, respectively. Secondly, the potential of the TSEB model for evaluating the latent heat fluxes at large scale was investigated by aggregating the derived parameters from both satellites based on the LAS footprint. As for the local scale, the comparison of the latent heat fluxes simulated by TSEB driven by Landsat data performed well against those measured by the LAS (R = 0.69, RMSE = 68.0 Wm(-2)), while slightly more scattering was observed when MODIS products were used (R = 0.38, RMSE = 99.8 Wm(-2)). Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that (1) the TSEB model can be fairly used to estimate the evapotranspiration over the mountain regions; and (2) medium- to high-resolution inputs are a better option than coarse-resolution products for describing this kind of complex terrain.

TI  - An Approach Based on Landsat Images for Shoreline Monitoring to Support Integrated Coastal Management-A Case Study, Ezbet Elborg, Nile Delta, Egypt
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the dynamic behavior of shorelines is an essential factor for integrated coastal management (ICM). In this study, satellite-derived shorelines and corresponding eroded and accreted areas of coastal zones have been calculated and assessed for 15 km along the coasts of Ezbet Elborg, Nile Delta, Egypt. A developed approach is designed based on Landsat satellite images combined with GIS to estimate an accurate shoreline changes and study the effect of seawalls on it. Landsat images for the period from 1985 to 2018 are rectified and classified using Supported Vector Machines (SVMs) and then processed using ArcGIS to estimate the effectiveness of the seawall that was constructed in year 2000. Accuracy assessment results show that the SVMs improve images accuracy up to 92.62% and the detected shoreline by the proposed method is highly correlated (0.87) with RTK-GPS measurements. In addition, the shoreline change analysis presents that a dramatic erosion of 2.1 km(2) east of Ezbet Elborg seawall has occurred. Also, the total accretion areas are equal to 4.40 km(2) and 10.50 km(2) in between 1985 -and -2000 and 2000 -and -2018, respectively, along the southeast side of the study area.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN EARTH SCIENCE SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Drought is an environmental disaster typically defined as an unusual deficiency of water supply over an extended period. Satellite remote sensing provides an alternative approach to monitoring drought over large areas. In this study, we monitored drought patterns over about 30 years (1985-2015), using satellite imagery of Lake Soyang, Gangwondo, South Korea. Landsat images were classified using ISODATA, maximum likelihood analysis, and an artificial neural network to derive the lake area. In addition, the relationship between areas of Lake Soyang and the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) was analyzed. The results showed that the artificial neural network was a better method for determining the area of the lake. Based on the relationship between the SPI value and changes in area, the R-2 value was 0.52. This means that the area of the lake varied depending on SPI value. This study was able to detect and monitor drought conditions in the Lake Soyang area. The results of this study are used in the development of a regional drought monitoring program.

TI  - APPLICATION OF SENTINEL-2A DATA AND PIXEL-BASED ALGORITHMS FOR LAND COVER MAPPING IN ILAM-IRAN
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The western forests and rangelands of Iran in Zagros Mountain are valuable ecosystems for protecting the water and soil resources and providing the habitat for endemic fauna and flora. These ecosystems have widely destroyed by human interferences in the recent years. The land cover mapping using an accurate method is the first step to prevent the further destruction of these ecosystems. The aim of this study was to generate a land cover map of Ilam (Western Iran) using Sentinel-2A data at 10 m spatial resolution using the best suited classification algorithm. For this purpose, the supervised classification of Sentinel-2A image was performed by seven pixel-based algorithms (Maximum Likelihood, Minimum Distance, Spectral Angle Mapper, Spectral Correlation Mapper, Mahalanobis Distance, Neural Network and Support Vector Machine). For accuracy assessment of the land cover maps, the stratified random points were created and controlled in the field. After checking out the current land cover of each point in a plot area at the field, the real land cover of each one was compared with the defined land cover of the same point based on classification maps. Finally, the accuracy of the algorithms was evaluated by accuracy indices. The results showed that Support Vector Machine algorithm had the highest accuracy in classification of Sentinel-2A image with overall accuracy 79% and Kappa Index 0.70. This algorithm usually shows a good efficiency for land cover mapping in the heterogeneous regions like the study area. The analysis of the land cover map obtained from this algorithm showed that the dense, semi-dense and sparse forests have covered 319.64 ha, 361.44 ha and 1832.36 ha of the study area, respectively. The human-made land covers such as agriculture and understory agriculture have widely extended in the study area and have covered 658.42 and 4504.64 ha, respectively. The results of this study could be used as a baseline for managers to monitor land cover changes in the region. For the optimum management of the study area, land cover mapping using SVM algorithm in the certain temporal intervals is recommended to discover the forests change and to control the agriculture development.

TI  - MAPPING THE LAND USES AND ANALYSING THE LANDSCAPE ELEMENTS IN SOUTH-WESTERN IRAN: APPLICATION OF LANDSAT-7 FIELD DATA AND LANDSCAPE METRICS
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - In the recent years, the human-made land uses have been increased in the natural areas around the world which are the serious threats for nature, environment, and biodiversity. This research was performed to investigate the human-made and natural land uses in Dashte Raz region as a biodiversity hotspot located in southwest Iran. For this purpose, ETM+ satellite image of Landsat-7 for the study area was provided from USGS. First, the study area boundary was digitized in Google Earth. Then, the training areas were selected in each land use in Google Earth and were checked in field surveys using GPS. Then, training areas were found on the satellite image and land use map was provided using maximum likelihood algorithm in Erdas Imagine 2014 software. The accuracy of the land use map was assessed by field control points which were randomly selected in each land use. In the next step, the landscape elements of the study area were analyzed by CA, PERIM, and NP metrics in FRAGSTATS software. Results showed that Landsat-7 has successfully classified the land uses/covers in the study area with an overall accuracy of 87%. Results of landscape metrics showed that forest has been the bed of study area (the biggest land use). The human-made land uses such as villages and agricultural lands have improperly developed in the forests and have destructed this ecosystem in recent years. Thus, a protective management of the study area is very essential to conserve the remained forests. The main focus should be to remove some human-made land uses and to replace them by some other natural land covers. Agriculture development has exposed the study area in a critical situation which may completely destroy the forests in the near future. Therefore, it should be controlled; while other land uses such as gardens can create a proper habitat for some endemic fauna and flora and may lead to conserve the biodiversity of the study area.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variability of erosion and accretion in Ganges River using GIS and RS: a comparative study overlapping Rennell's map of 1760s
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Bangladesh has predominantly four major river systems. Ganges (Padma) River is one of the prominent rivers which support the life and livelihoods of millions of people in Bangladesh. The riverine area of Bangladesh has always faced some changing stages for radical accretion and erosion of lands. Areas of erosion and deposition were determined from successive changes in the bankline positions. Erosion is more active in course line and deposition in sandbar of river. In this research, the area which is eroded and deposited during 1760-2015 (more than 250 years) was analyzed. Erosion and accretion are measured by using Rennell's map and Landsat MSS, TM and ETM+ satellite imagery with an average duration of 20 years. Processing of image analysis such as layer stack, image enhancement, mosaic and re-projection is done by different tools of image processing software. The Raster and spatial data have been analyzed by image analysis approaches and geo-processing techniques, while quantitative data have been analyzed by using some other statistical computer software program. It was analyzed through the spatial and temporal variation in the study reaches. These are identified by geo-processing techniques of riverbanks. The highest amount of erosional area occurred during 1760-1975 is 38,633 ha, depositional area is 55,140, and therefore, difference is 16,507, with the lowest amount of erosion occurring during 1995-2015. On the other hand, highest amount of deposition occurred during 1760-2015 is 57,605 ha, erosional land is 33,320 ha and there difference is 24,285 ha, with the lowest amount of deposition occurring during 1975-2015. The erosion and deposition has been comparatively low during 1975-1995 and 1995-2015. Finally it is identified that deposition is more active than erosion in Ganges-Padma River in a long period of time (during 1760-2015).

TI  - Advanced land observing satellite data to identify ground vegetation in a juniper forest, northeast Iran
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Juniperus excelsa subsp. polycarpos, (Persian juniper), is found in northeast Iran. In this study, the relationship between ground cover and vegetation indices have been investigated using remote sensing data for a Persian juniper forest. Multispectral data were analyzed based on the Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer type 2 and panchromatic data obtained by the Panchromatic Remote-sensing Instrument for Stereo Mapping sensors, both on board the advanced land observing satellite (ALOS). The ground cover was calculated using field survey data from 25 sub-sample plots and the vegetation indices were derived with 5 x 5 maximum filtering algorithm from ALOS data. R-2 values were calculated for the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and various soil-adjusted vegetation indices (SAVI) with soil-brightness-dependent correction factors equal to 1 and 0.5, a modified SAVI (MSAVI) and an optimized SAVI (OSAVI). R-2 values for the NDVI, MSAVI, OSAVI, SAVI (1), and SAVI (0.5) were 0.566, 0.545, 0.619, 0.603, and 0.607, respectively. Total ratio vegetation index for arid and semi-arid regions based on spectral wavelengths of ALOS data with an R-2 value 0.633 was considered. Results of the current study will be useful for forest inventories in arid and semi-arid regions in addition to assisting decision-making for natural resource managers.

TI  - Towards low carbon cities: Spatio-temporal dynamics of urban form and carbon dioxide emissions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban form as its compactness, complexity and centrality is increasingly being recognized by researchers for its potential role in the decreasing of CO2 emissions and sustainable urban development. The objective of this study is to quantify the relationship between CO2 emission and urban form, using panel data analysis for Iran's 15 cities from 2001 to 2015. Therefore, a series of urban form indicators were selected which were measured by applying spatial landscape metrics to remotely sensed data. The results of the study expressed a positive correlation between CO2 emission levels and the growth of urban areas. In addition, increased urban complexity represented a positive relationship with CO2 emissions and conversely, increased urban compactness led to reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The findings of this research indicate that measures to make existing cities in northern Iran more compact may in fact help to decrease the CO2 emissions level, just as increasing fragmentation or increased complexity with respect to urban form may contribute to increase carbon dioxide emissions. Urban planners and decision makers should consider urban form to obtain significant reduction in CO2 emissions which subsequently leads to low carbon cities development in Iran.

TI  - Introducing Spatially Distributed Fire Danger from Earth Observations (FDEO) Using Satellite-Based Data in the Contiguous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wildfire danger assessment is essential for operational allocation of fire management resources; with longer lead prediction, the more efficiently can resources be allocated regionally. Traditional studies focus on meteorological forecasts and fire danger index models (e.g., National Fire Danger Rating System-NFDRS) for predicting fire danger. Meteorological forecasts, however, lose accuracy beyond 10 days; as such, there is no quantifiable method for predicting fire danger beyond 10 days. While some recent studies have statistically related hydrologic parameters and past wildfire area burned or occurrence to fire, no study has used these parameters to develop a monthly spatially distributed predictive model in the contiguous United States. Thus, the objective of this study is to introduce Fire Danger from Earth Observations (FDEO), which uses satellite data over the contiguous United States (CONUS) to enable two-month lead time prediction of wildfire danger, a sufficient lead time for planning purposes and relocating resources. In this study, we use satellite observations of land cover type, vapor pressure deficit, surface soil moisture, and the enhanced vegetation index, together with the United States Forest Service (USFS) verified and validated fire database (FPA) to develop spatially gridded probabilistic predictions of fire danger, defined as expected area burned as a deviation from "normal". The results show that the model predicts spatial patterns of fire danger with 52% overall accuracy over the 2004-2013 record, and up to 75% overall accuracy during the fire season. Overall accuracy is defined as number of pixels with correctly predicted fire probability classes divided by the total number of the studied pixels. This overall accuracy is the first quantified result of two-month lead prediction of fire danger and demonstrates the potential utility of using diverse observational data sets for use in operational fire management resource allocation in the CONUS.

TI  - Estimating Soil Salinity in the Dried Lake Bed of Urmia Lake Using Optical Sentinel-2 Images and Nonlinear Regression Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil salinization is one of the serious environmental problems in arid and semiarid regions. As an effective technique for monitoring soil salinity, remote sensing (RS) technology has been widely used to estimate soil salinity in recent years. Previous studies on soil salinity mapping based on RS images adopted linear regression (LR) between the field measured of electrical conductivity (EC) and the RS data. It is expected that nonlinear regression (NLR) models improve the accuracy of soil salinity mapping over LR. The main objectives of this study are: (1) evaluation the capability of various NLR models for estimating soil salinity based on optical Sentinel-2 RS images, (2) feature selection for soil salinity estimation, and (3) updated and accurate soil salinity map production in the dried lake bed of Urmia Lake. The investigated NLR models include: polynomials, rational functions, powers, exponential, gaussian, logarithmic, and sum of sinusoidal functions with different degrees. All these regression models were calibrated and evaluated separately based on 8 visible and infrared bands of the Sentinel-2 image and 17 salinity indices to estimate soil salinity in the dried lake bed of Urmia Lake (Iran). The evaluation results confirmed the superiority of the NLR models over the LR model for soil salinity estimation. The polynomial degree 3 (Poly-3) based on S3 index (S3=GxRBcould predict EC value with better accuracy than the best LR model (based on narrow NIR band). The R-2 and RMSE of the Poly-3 model were 0.98 and 8.16 dS/m while corresponding values of the best LR model were 0.88 and 20.85 dS/m in test samples, respectively. In general, the results show that the NLR models, along with RS data, have enough accuracy to estimate soil salinity. To compare these methods visually and estimate salt's distribution and concentration in this area, soil salinity maps were predicted by the best NLR model (EC=1.63x10-10xS33-9.95x10-6xS32+0.11xS3-151.7$${\text{EC}} = 1.63 \times 10<^>{ - 10} \times {\text{S}}3<^>{3} - 9.95 \times 10<^>{ - 6} \times {\text{S}}3<^>{2} + 0.11 \times {\text{S}}3 - 151.7$$\end{document}) and the other linear and NLR models in the dried lake bed of Urmia Lake.

TI  - Effects of Particulate Matter on the Incidence of Respiratory Diseases in the Pisan Longitudinal Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - The current study aimed at assessing the effects of exposure to Particulate Matter (PM) on the incidence of respiratory diseases in a sub-sample of participants in the longitudinal analytical epidemiological study in Pisa, Italy. Three hundred and five subjects living at the same address from 1991 to 2011 were included. Individual risk factors recorded during the 1991 survey were considered, and new cases of respiratory diseases were ascertained until 2011. Average PM10 and PM2.5 exposures (mu g/m(3), year 2011) were estimated at the residential address (1-km(2) resolution) through a random forest machine learning approach, using a combination of satellite data and land use variables. Multivariable logistic regression with Firth's correction was applied. The median (25th-75th percentile) exposure levels were 30.1 mu g/m(3) (29.9-30.7 mu g/m(3)) for PM10 and 19.3 mu g/m(3) (18.9-19.4 mu g/m(3)) for PM2.5. Incidences of rhinitis and chronic phlegm were associated with increasing PM2.5: OR = 2.25 (95% CI: 1.07, 4.98) per unit increase (p.u.i.) and OR = 4.17 (1.12, 18.71) p.u.i., respectively. Incidence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with PM10: OR = 2.96 (1.50, 7.15) p.u.i. These results provide new insights into the long-term respiratory health effects of PM air pollution.

TI  - The role of liquid water percolation representation in estimating snow water equivalent in a Mediterranean mountain region (Mount Lebanon)
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In many Mediterranean mountain regions, the seasonal snowpack is an essential yet poorly known water resource. Here, we examine, for the first time, the spatial distribution and evolution of the snow water equivalent (SWE) during three snow seasons (2013-2016) in the coastal mountains of Lebanon. We run SnowModel (Liston and Elder, 2006a), a spatially distributed, process-based snow model, at 100m resolution forced by new automatic weather station (AWS) data in three snow-dominated basins of Mount Lebanon. We evaluate a recent upgrade of the liquid water percolation scheme in SnowModel, which was introduced to improve the simulation of the SWE and runoff in warm maritime regions. The model is evaluated against continuous snow depth and snow albedo observations at the AWS, manual SWE measurements, and MODIS snow cover area between 1200 and 3000ma.s.l. The results show that the new percolation scheme yields better performance, especially in terms of SWE but also in snow depth and snow cover area. Over the simulation period between 2013 and 2016, the maximum snow mass was reached between December and March. Peak mean SWE (above 1200ma.s.l.) changed significantly from year to year in the three study catchments, with values ranging between 73 and 286mmw.e. (RMSE between 160 and 260mmw.e.). We suggest that the major sources of uncertainty in simulating the SWE, in this warm Mediterranean climate, can be attributed to forcing error but also to our limited understanding of the separation between rain and snow at lower-elevations, the transient snowmelt events during the accumulation season, and the high variability of snow depth patterns at the subpixel scale due to the wind-driven blown-snow redistribution into karstic features and sinkholes. Yet, the use of a process-based snow model with minimal requirements for parameter estimation provides a basis to simulate snow mass SWE in nonmonitored catchments and characterize the contribution of snowmelt to the karstic groundwater recharge in Lebanon. While this research focused on three basins in the Mount Lebanon, it serves as a case study to highlight the importance of wet snow processes to estimate SWE in Mediterranean mountain regions.

T2  - TALANTA
M3  - Article
AB  - Thiophenols, a class of significant industrial materials, are extremely toxic in environmental as well live cells. However, the process of live cells responding to thiophenols is not well understood. Herein, an innovative "OFF-ON" probe FY for thiophenols selectively in 100% aqueous solution was reported. It featured rapid response (similar to 150 s), prominent sensitivity (detection limit: 5 nM), and large Stokes shift (similar to 104 nm), which assured specific detection of thiophenols in A375 cells, HeLa cells and environment. Especially, it proved that thiophenols in live cells can be eliminated by endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS), indicating that thiophenols may result in cellular oxidative stress. As well, it was resoundingly put into recognizing of thiophenols quantitatively in actual water samples and in serum.

TI  - Carbon Stock Estimations in a Mediterranean Riparian Forest: A Case Study Combining Field Data and UAV Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to estimate the total biomass aboveground and soil carbon stocks in a Mediterranean riparian forest and identify the contribution of the different species and ecosystem compartments to the overall riparian carbon reservoir. We used a combined field and object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach, based on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery, to assess C stock of three dominant riparian species. A linear discriminator was designed, based on a set of spectral variables previously selected in an optimal way, permitting the classification of the species corresponding to every object in the study area. This made it possible to estimate the area occupied by each species and its contribution to the tree aboveground biomass (AGB). Three uncertainty levels were considered, related to the trade-off between the number of unclassified and misclassified objects, leading to an error control associated with the estimated tree AGB. We found that riparian woodlands dominated by Acacia dealbata Link showed the highest average carbon stock per unit area (251 +/- 90 tC ha(-1)) followed by Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner (162 +/- 12 tC ha(-1)) and by Salix salviifolia Brot. (73 +/- 17 tC ha(-1)), which are mainly related to the stem density, vegetation development and successional stage of the different stands. The woody tree compartment showed the highest inputs (79%), followed by the understory vegetation (12%) and lastly by the soil mineral layer (9%). Spectral vegetation indices developed to suppress saturation effects were consistently selected as important variables for species classification. The total tree AGB in the study area varies from 734 to 1053 tC according to the distinct levels of uncertainty. This study provided the foundations for the assessment of the riparian carbon sequestration and the economic value of the carbon stocks provided by similar Mediterranean riparian forests, a highly relevant ecosystem service for the regulation of climate change effects.

TI  - MULTITEMPORAL ANALYSIS BY REMOTE SENSING OF THE EVOLUTION OF COASTAL LINE OF GUANABARA BAY, RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL
T2  - SISTEMAS & GESTAO
M3  - Article
AB  - Changes in coastlines are considered one of the most dynamic processes in coastal environments. Therefore, the mapping of such variations has become important in the survey of coastal impacts. In the past years, remote sensing has been used in mapping the coastline. In this research, the coastline of Guanabara Bay, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, was mapped in the years of 1938, 1974, 1984, 1997, and 2015, by using geo-referencing software and existing cartographic documents. To map the changes, the bay was divided into four sections, in which maps were produced in graphical format, using ArcGIS, in scales 1:175.000 and 1:250.000. The research used satellite images from Landsat 1 Multispectral Scanner System (MSS), Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM), and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), integrated under geographic information system database, for a visual analysis (qualitative), and statistical observation (quantitative) of orbital images. The data indicate more intense transformations between the years 1938 and 1974, with a total landing area of 15.220.000m(2). This area corresponds to 69.23% of the amount suppressed during the interval 1938-2015.

TI  - PCB levels in adipose tissue of dogs from illegal dumping sites in Campania region (Italy)
T2  - CHEMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The aim of the study is to investigate the potential relationship between exposure to PCBs and cancer. In doing so we relied on a sample of dogs coming from a peculiar area of the Campania region (Italy), that has been suffering for illegal waste dumping and open air burning of plastic waste for many years. The latter determined the release of organic and inorganic pollutants, such as the PCBs. By comparing dogs with cancer and healthy dogs, we found much higher PCB concentrations in the former, with a significant difference (p < 0.05) for the non-indicator Sigma 10NDL-PCB and the DL-PCBs. A regression analysis, controlling for three potentially confounding factors, that are sex, age and weight, confirmed the higher Sigma 10NDL-PCB concentration in dogs with cancer. Hence, our evidence suggests a potential health hazard for animals and likewise people living in a risky area due to the presence of environmental organic pollutants. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Variability of the PAR/GHI Ratio and PAR Modeling Based on Two Satellite Estimates
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The main objectives of this work are to address the analysis of the spatial and temporal variability of the ratio between photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and global horizontal irradiance (GHI), as well as to develop PAR models. The analysis was carried out using data from three stations located in mainland Spain covering three climates: oceanic, standard Mediterranean, and continental Mediterranean. The results of this analysis showed a clear dependence between the PAR/GHI ratio and the location; the oceanic climate showed higher values of PAR/GHI compared with Mediterranean climates. Further, the temporal variability of PAR/GHI was conditioned by the variability of clearness index, so it was also higher in oceanic than in Mediterranean climates. On the other hand, Climate Monitoring Satellite Facility (CM-SAF) and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to estimate PAR as a function of GHI over the whole territory. The validation with ground measurements showed better performance of the MODIS-estimates-derived model for the oceanic climate (root-mean-square error (RMSE) around 5%), while the model obtained from CM-SAF fitted better for Mediterranean climates (RMSEs around 2%).

TI  - Fusion of MODIS and Landsat-Like Images for Daily High Spatial Resolution NDVI
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the obstacles in monitoring agricultural crops is the difficulty in understanding and mapping rapid changes of these crops. With the purpose of addressing this issue, this study aimed to model and fuse the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) using Landsat-like images to achieve daily high spatial resolution NDVI. The study was performed for the period of 2017 on a commercial farm of irrigated maize-soybean rotation in the western region of the state of Bahia, Brazil. To achieve the objective, the following procedures were performed: (i) Landsat-like images were upscaled to match the Landsat-8 spatial resolution (30 m); (ii) the reflectance of Landsat-like images was intercalibrated using the Landsat-8 as a reference; (iii) Landsat-like reflectance images were upscaled to match the MODIS sensor spatial resolution (250 m); (iv) regression models were trained daily to model MODIS NDVI using the upscaled Landsat-like reflectance images (250 m) of the closest day as the input; and (v) the intercalibrated version of the Landsat-like images (30 m) used in the previous step was used as the input for the trained model, resulting in a downscaled MODIS NDVI (30 m). To determine the best fitting model, we used the following statistical metrics: coefficient of determination (r(2)), root mean square error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency index (NSE), mean bias error (MBE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Among the assessed regression models, the Cubist algorithm was sensitive to changes in agriculture and performed best in modeling of the Landsat-like MODIS NDVI. The results obtained in the present research are promising and can enable the monitoring of dynamic phenomena with images available free of charge, changing the way in which decisions are made using satellite images.

TI  - Modeling the Impact of Urbanization on Land-Use Change in Bahir Dar City, Ethiopia: An Integrated Cellular Automata-Markov Chain Approach
T2  - LAND
M3  - Article
AB  - The fast-paced urbanization of recent decades entails that many regions are facing seemingly uncontrolled land-use changes (LUCs) that go hand in hand with a range of environmental and socio-economic challenges. In this paper, we use an integrated cellular automata-Markov chain (CA-MC) model to analyze and predict the urban expansion of and its impact on LUC in the city of Bahir Dar, Ethiopia. To this end, the research marshals high-resolution Landsat images of 1991, 2002, 2011, and 2018. An analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method is then used to identify the biophysical and socioeconomic factors underlying the expansion in the research area. It is shown that, during the period of study, built-up areas are rapidly expanding in the face of an overall decline of the farmland and vegetation cover. Drawing on a model calibration for 2018, the research predicts the possible geographies of LUC in the Bahir Dar area for 2025, 2034, and 2045. It is predicted that the conversions of other land-use types into built-up areas will persist in the southern, southwestern, and northeastern areas of the sprawling city, which can mainly be traced back to the uneven geographies of road accessibility, proximity to the city center, and slope variables. We reflect on how our findings can be used to facilitate sustainable urban development and land-use policies in the Bahir Dar area.

TI  - "The Interior Is More Important Than the Exterior": Images of Contemporaries in Nikolay Karamzin's Letters
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The article considers evaluations, portrait characteristics, and qualities of contemporaries from Nikolay Karamzin's closest circle fixed in his epistolary heritage. The systematic reconstruction of the real picture of the historiographer's literature, daily and social relations allows a deeper comprehension and a scientific description of his legacy, which makes the study relevant. As a result of the study, the author revealed the basic principles of creating contemporaries' images specific to Karamzin's epistolary behavior and patterns in the characterization and evaluation of individuals; she also determined the interrelation of these principles and patterns with the historiographer's worldview. The main elements of the contemporaries' description in Karamzin's letters are external manifestations of the inner world, character traits, actions, less often portrait traits. Portrait details are mainly found in the description of the royal family members. Angelic motives are invariably included in the characteristics of the reigning persons Karamzin most often met with in his life. Karamzin's historical and philosophical ideas, his monarchism, conservatism based on a synthesis of humanistic ideas, Orthodoxy, and political principles of autocracy had an influence on how he described the appearance, spiritual qualities, gave evaluations of the royal family representatives' actions. The dominant characteristics of the emperor in Karamzin's letters represent the historiographer's ideas about the ideal monarch and his historical mission. Karamzin pays attention to the state of mind, intelligence, way of thinking when giving characteristics to his friends and acquaintances. All these become the main object of his evaluation. At the same time, his focus is on the positive spiritual qualities of the people mentioned in the letters. Karamzin's letters, like his entire creative activities, can be viewed from the standpoint of a certain positive program, which found its expression, among other things, in the concept of the hero of the time, inextricably linked with his historiosophical worldview. The characteristics from Karamzin's letters show how judgments about people, regardless of generally accepted opinions, become a reflection of Karamzin's worldview, a practical manifestation of his philosophy of life, and a kind of a behavioral text. Besides, the letters make it possible to imagine Karamzin's closest circle through the prism of the author's worldview, which is extremely important for the full coverage of the entire range of literature, friendly, official, monarchist ties of the poet, writer, publisher, historiographer, and man.

TI  - Similarities and Differences in the Temporal Variability of PM<sub>2.5</sub> and AOD Between Urban and Rural Stations in Beijing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of <2.5 <mu>m (PM2.5) and column-integrated aerosol optical depth (AOD) exhibits substantial diurnal, daily, and yearly variabilities that are regionally dependent. The diversity of these temporal variabilities in urban and rural areas may imply the inherent mechanisms. A novel time-series analysis tool developed by Facebook, Prophet, is used to investigate the holiday, seasonal, and inter-annual patterns of PM2.5 and AOD at a rural station (RU) and an urban station (UR) in Beijing. PM2.5 shows a coherent decreasing tendency at both stations during 2014-2018, consistent with the implementation of the air pollution action plan at the end of 2013. RU is characterized by similar seasonal variations of AOD and PM2.5, with the lowest values in winter and the highest in summer, which is opposite that at UR with maximum AOD, but minimum PM2.5 in summer and minimum AOD, but maximum PM2.5 in winter. During the National Day holiday (1-7 October), both AOD and PM2.5 holiday components regularly shift from negative to positive departures, and the turning point generally occurs on October 4. AODs at both stations steadily increase throughout the daytime, which is most striking in winter. A morning rush hour peak of PM2.5 (7:00-9:00 local standard time (LST)) and a second peak at night (23:00 LST) are observed at UR. PM2.5 at RU often reaches minima (maxima) at around 12:00 LST (19:00 LST), about four hours later (earlier) than UR. The ratio of PM2.5 to AOD (eta) shows a decreasing tendency at both stations in the last four years, indicating a profound impact of the air quality control program. eta at RU always begins to increase about 1-2 h earlier than that at UR during the daytime. Large spatial and temporal variations of eta suggest that caution should be observed in the estimation of PM2.5 from AOD.

TI  - The Ability of Sun-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence From OCO-2 and MODIS-EVI to Monitor Spatial Variations of Soybean and Maize Yields in the Midwestern USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) has emerged as a promising tool for monitoring growing conditions and productivity of vegetation. However, it still remains unclear the ability of satellite SIF data to predict crop yields at the regional scale, comparing to widely used satellite vegetation index (VI), such as the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Additionally, few attempts have been made to verify if SIF products from the new Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite could be applied for regional corn and soybean yield estimates. With the deep neural networks (DNN) approach, this study investigated the ability of OCO-2 SIF, MODIS EVI, and climate data to estimate county-level corn and soybean yields in the U.S. Corn Belt. Monthly mean and maximum SIF and MODIS EVI during the peak growing season showed similar correlations with corn and soybean yields. The DNNs with SIF as predictors were able to estimate corn and soybean yields well but performed poorer than MODIS EVI and climate variables-based DNNs. The performance of SIF and MODIS EVI-based DNNs varied with the areal dominance of crops while that of climate-based DNNs exhibited less spatial variability. SIF data could provide useful supplementary information to MODIS EVI and climatic variables for improving estimates of crop yields. MODIS EVI and climate predictors (e.g., VPD and temperature) during the peak growing season (from June to August) played important roles in predicting yields of corn and soybean in the Midwestern 12 states in the U.S. The results highlighted the benefit of combining data from both satellite and climate sources in crop yield estimation. Additionally, this study showed the potential of adding SIF in crop yield prediction despite the small improvement of model performances, which might result from the limitation of current available SIF products. The framework of this study could be applied to different regions and other types of crops to employ deep learning for crop yield forecasting by combining different types of remote sensing data (such as OCO-2 SIF and MODIS EVI) and climate data.

T2  - ARID ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and anthropogenic activity in the Republic of Buryatia aggravate the processes of desertification and land degradation. The territory of Buryatia was zoned according to the aridity index based on ENVIREM climate data with a high spatial resolution. Long-term changes in the vegetation cover in arid and humid zones are quantitatively assessed based on a combined study of the time series of the normalized-difference vegetation index (NDVI) with the Advanced Very High Radiation Radiometer (AVHRR), meteorological series of the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis data set, and field studies. Maps of the spatial distribution of NDVI linear trends and precipitation for 1982-2015 (with the differentiation of the wet (1982-1999) and dry periods (2000-2015)) have been constructed. During the wet period, positive NDVI trends are observed for almost the entire republic, while the dry period is characterized by a significant increase in negative trends of the vegetation index. A positive correlation between the Selyaninov hydrothermal coefficient and NDVI is observed for intermountain steppe basins, while it is negative for forest landscapes. The dynamics of the NDVI for steppe vegetation is more dependent on precipitation, while the dynamics of the NDVI for forests is more significantly correlated with temperature. Reforestation, postpyrogenic succession, the bushing of fallow lands, and other factors determine the growth in the NDVI. Negative NDVI trends are characteristic of steppe ecosystems with low precipitation and forest ecosystems exposed to felling and fires.

T2  - DISASTER MEDICINE AND PUBLIC HEALTH PREPAREDNESS
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: In January 2017, Washington, DC, hosted the 58th United States presidential inauguration. The DC Department of Health leveraged multiple health surveillance approaches, including syndromic surveillance (human and animal) and medical aid station-based patient tracking, to detect disease and injury associated with this mass gathering. Methods: Patient data were collected from a regional syndromic surveillance system, medical aid stations, and an internet-based emergency department reporting system. Animal health data were collected from DC veterinary facilities. Results: Of 174 703 chief complaints from human syndromic data, there were 6 inauguration-related alerts. Inauguration attendees who visited aid stations (n = 162) and emergency departments (n = 180) most commonly reported feeling faint/dizzy (n = 29; 17.9%) and pain/cramps (n = 34;18.9%). In animals, of 533 clinical signs reported, most were gastrointestinal (n = 237; 44.5%) and occurred in canines (n = 374; 70.2%). Ten animals that presented dead on arrival were investigated; no significant threats were identified. Conclusion: Use of multiple surveillance systems allowed for near-real-time detection and monitoring of disease and injury syndromes in humans and domestic animals potentially associated with inaugural events and in local health care systems.

TI  - Comparisons of Diverse Machine Learning Approaches for Wildfire Susceptibility Mapping
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change has increased the probability of the occurrence of catastrophes like wildfires, floods, and storms across the globe in recent years. Weather conditions continue to grow more extreme, and wildfires are occurring quite frequently and are spreading with greater intensity. Wildfires ravage forest areas, as recently seen in the Amazon, the United States, and more recently in Australia. The availability of remotely sensed data has vastly improved, and enables us to precisely locate wildfires for monitoring purposes. Wildfire inventory data was created by integrating the polygons collected through field surveys using global positioning systems (GPS) and the data collected from the moderate resolution imaging spectrometer (MODIS) thermal anomalies product between 2012 and 2017 for the study area. The inventory data, along with sixteen conditioning factors selected for the study area, was used to appraise the potential of various machine learning (ML) methods for wildfire susceptibility mapping in Amol County. The ML methods chosen for this study are artificial neural network (ANN), dmine regression (DR), DM neural, least angle regression (LARS), multi-layer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), radial basis function (RBF), self-organizing maps (SOM), support vector machine (SVM), and decision tree (DT), along with the statistical approach of logistic regression (LR), which is very apt for wildfire susceptibility studies. The wildfire inventory data was categorized as three-fold, with 66% being used for training the models and 33% being used for accuracy assessment within three-fold cross-validation (CV). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) was used to assess the accuracy of the ML approaches. RF had the highest accuracy of 88%, followed by SVM with an accuracy of almost 79%, and LR had the lowest accuracy of 65%. This shows that RF is better suited for wildfire susceptibility assessments in our case study area.

TI  - Classification of Compressed Remote Sensing Multispectral Images via Convolutional Neural Networks
T2  - JOURNAL OF IMAGING
M3  - Article
AB  - Multispectral sensors constitute a core Earth observation image technology generating massive high-dimensional observations. To address the communication and storage constraints of remote sensing platforms, lossy data compression becomes necessary, but it unavoidably introduces unwanted artifacts. In this work, we consider the encoding of multispectral observations into high-order tensor structures which can naturally capture multi-dimensional dependencies and correlations, and we propose a resource-efficient compression scheme based on quantized low-rank tensor completion. The proposed method is also applicable to the case of missing observations due to environmental conditions, such as cloud cover. To quantify the performance of compression, we consider both typical image quality metrics as well as the impact on state-of-the-art deep learning-based land-cover classification schemes. Experimental analysis on observations from the ESA Sentinel-2 satellite reveals that even minimal compression can have negative effects on classification performance which can be efficiently addressed by our proposed recovery scheme.

TI  - A remote sensing approach to mapping fire severity in south-eastern Australia using sentinel 2 and random forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate and consistent broad-scale mapping of fire severity is an important resource for fire management as well as fire-related ecological and climate change research. Remote sensing and machine learning approaches present an opportunity to enhance accuracy and efficiency of current practices. Quantitative biophysical models of photosynthetic, non-photosynthetic and bare cover fractions have not been widely applied to fire severity studies but may provide greater consistency in comparisons of different fires across the landscape compared to reflectance-based indices. We systematically tested and compared reflectance and fractional cover candidate severity indices derived from Sentinel 2 satellite imagery using a random forest (RF) machine learning framework. Assessment of predictive power (cross-validation) was undertaken to quantify the accuracy of mapping severity of new fires. The effect of environmental variables on the accuracy of the RF predicted severity classification was examined to assess the stability of the mapping across the landscape. The results indicate that fire severity can be mapped with very high accuracy using Sentinel 2 imagery and RF supervised classification. The mean accuracy was >95% for the unburnt and extreme severity class (complete crown consumption), >85% for high severity class (full crown scorch), >80% for low severity (burnt understory, unburnt canopy) and >70% for the moderate severity class (partial canopy scorch). Higher canopy cover and higher topographic complexity was associated with a higher rate of under-prediction, due to the limitations of optical sensors in viewing the burnt understorey of low severity classes under these conditions. Further research is aimed at improving classification accuracy of low and moderate severity classes and applying the RF algorithm to hazard reduction fires.

M3  - Article
AB  - In the late 1960s, the Islamic Republic of Pakistan's capital shifted from Karachi to Islamabad, officially named Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). In this aspect, the ICT is a young city, but undergoing rapid expansion and urbanization, especially in the last two decades. This study reports the measurement and characterization of ICT land cover change dynamics using Landsat satellite imagery for the years 1976, 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2016. Annual rate of change, landscape metrics, and urban forest fragmentation spatiotemporal analyses have been carried out, along with the calculation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) indicator 11.3.1 Land Consumption Rate to the Population Growth Rate (LCRPGR). The results show consistent increase in the settlement class, with highest annual rate of 8.79% during 2000-2010. Tree cover >40% and <40% canopy decreased at an annual rate of 0.81% and 0.77% between 1976 to 2016, respectively. Forest fragmentation analysis reveals that 'core forests of >500 acres' class decreased from 392 km(2) (65.41%) to 241 km(2) (55%), and 'patch forest' class increased from 15 km(2) (2.46%) to 20 km(2) (4.54%), from 1976 to 2016. The LCRPGR ratio was 0.62 from 1976 to 2000, increasing to 1.36 from 2000 to 2016.

TI  - Hyperspectral polarimetric imaging of the water surface and retrieval of water optical parameters from multi-angular polarimetric data
T2  - APPLIED OPTICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Total and polarized radiances from above the ocean surface are measured by a state-of-the-art snapshot hyperspectral imager. A computer-controlled filter wheel is installed in front of the imager allowing for recording of division-of-time Stokes vector images from the ocean surface. This system, to the best of our knowledge, for the first time provided a capability of hyperspectral polarimetric multi-angular measurements of radiances from above the water surface. Several sets of measurements used in the analysis were acquired from ocean platforms and from shipborne observations. Measurements made by the imager are compared with simulations using a vector radiative transfer (VRT) code showing reasonable agreement. Analysis of pixel-to-pixel variability of the total and polarized above-water radiance for the viewing angles of 20 degrees-60 degrees in different wind conditions enable the estimation of uncertainties in measurements of these radiances in the polarized mode for the spectral range of 450-750 nm, thus setting requirements for the quality of polarized measurements. It is shown that there is a noticeable increase of above-water degree of linear polarization (DoLP) as a function of the viewing angle, which is due both to the larger DoLP of the light from the water body and the light reflected from the ocean surface. Results of measurements and VRT simulations are applied for the multi-angular retrieval of the ratio of beam attenuation coefficient (c(tot)) to absorption coefficient (a(tot)) in addition to the other parameters such as absorption and backscattering coefficients retrieved from traditional unpolarized methods.

T2  - TEKST KNIGA KNIGOIZDANIE-TEXT BOOK PUBLISHING
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the material of archival research, the author examines the reading circle and the role of books in shaping the worldview and the positions of the democratic enlightenment of Yakov Abramov. Abramov was a theorist and practitioner of a culturalist trend in the reformist populism of the 1880s-1890s, a prose writer and publicist. The author aims to determine the genesis of Abramov's educational intentions and his philosophy of social evolutionism for his name and activities are connected with the second stage of the populist "going to the people", "going to the great cultural work". The origins of Abramov's social programs and educational ideas are found in social, scientific and artistic literature, which he independently studied as a high school student and a student of the Caucasian Theological Seminary (1873-1877). Books played a decisive role in the ideological and creative development of the future populist ideologist. The main criterion for evaluating books was their usefulness for the mental, spiritual, moral development of the people, the availability of presentation, and the significance for the sociocultural progress of society as a whole. A certain tendency is observed in how Abramov selected books: natural scientific research dominated among scientific literature, while among fiction and sociological publications it was books in which their authors' progressive social and democratic orientation were clearly expressed. Fixing the essence of what a text contains in terms of its social and aesthetic functions, Abramov analyzed the methodological guidelines of the authors, pointed out the real possibilities of using the cognitive qualities of a particular publication in a particular reading environment or in order to fulfill the educational needs of an emerging personality. From the point of view of epistemological resources and reception qualities in his youth, Abramov gave priority to scientific texts over fiction, which is explained by his belief in the power of scientific knowledge. Abramov relied on forms and methods aimed at accomplishing the tasks of socio-moral and general cultural progressive development, actualizing the genres of journalism, literary criticism, popular science and documentary literature. Wide readership in the field of research summarizing the nature of many spheres of modern society and the first experiments of Abramov's statistical reviews yielded fruitful results: the populist educator would later inspire many publishing projects, including the Life of Remarkable People series, promote public education in every possible way, open libraries, publish popular science essays, brochures, books for national reading, statistical works, etc. Abramov's reading circle of the time when his democratic worldview had been shaping largely determined the connection between the theoretical substantiation and the practical implementation of the sociocultural program of "work among the people".

TI  - Hyperspectral Reflectance as a Basis to Discriminate Olive Varieties-A Tool for Sustainable Crop Management
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Worldwide sustainable development is threatened by current agricultural land change trends, particularly by the increasing rural farmland abandonment and agricultural intensification phenomena. In Mediterranean countries, these processes are affecting especially traditional olive groves with enormous socio-economic costs to rural areas, endangering environmental sustainability and biodiversity. Traditional olive groves abandonment and intensification are clearly related to the reduction of olive oil production income, leading to reduced economic viability. Most promising strategies to boost traditional groves competitiveness-such as olive oil differentiation through adoption of protected denomination of origin labels and development of value-added olive products-rely on knowledge of the olive varieties and its specific properties that confer their uniqueness and authenticity. Given the lack of information about olive varieties on traditional groves, a feasible and inexpensive method of variety identification is required. We analyzed leaf spectral information of ten Portuguese olive varieties with a powerful data-mining approach in order to verify the ability of satellite's hyperspectral sensors to provide an accurate olive variety identification. Our results show that these olive varieties are distinguishable by leaf reflectance information and suggest that even satellite open-source data could be used to map them. Additional advantages of olive varieties mapping were further discussed.

TI  - An Overview of Platforms for Big Earth Observation Data Management and Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - In recent years, Earth observation (EO) satellites have generated big amounts of geospatial data that are freely available for society and researchers. This scenario brings challenges for traditional spatial data infrastructures (SDI) to properly store, process, disseminate and analyze these big data sets. To meet these demands, novel technologies have been proposed and developed, based on cloud computing and distributed systems, such as array database systems, MapReduce systems and web services to access and process big Earth observation data. Currently, these technologies have been integrated into cutting edge platforms in order to support a new generation of SDI for big Earth observation data. This paper presents an overview of seven platforms for big Earth observation data management and analysis-Google Earth Engine (GEE), Sentinel Hub, Open Data Cube (ODC), System for Earth Observation Data Access, Processing and Analysis for Land Monitoring (SEPAL), openEO, JEODPP, and pipsCloud. We also provide a comparison of these platforms according to criteria that represent capabilities of the EO community interest.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF ASIAN ART
M3  - Article
AB  - Questions arising from the so-called Brooklyn kalamkari, a seven-panel, hand-painted cotton textile, have confronted art historians for decades: what do we see, who produced it for whom, what does it mean? With royal court scenes from all over the Indian Ocean world, the Brooklyn kalamkari represents a uniquely cosmopolitan worldview from early-seventeenth-century South India. In this essay I discuss the makings of this particular worldview in the context of early modern processes of globalization and state-formation. By engaging with the work of Indologists Johan Huizinga, Jan Heesterman, and David Shulman on Indian kingship and theater, I then attempt to decode the local and the global, as well as the seen and unseen, meaning of this textile.

TI  - Lymph node metastasis probability in young patients eligible for conservative management of endometrial cancer
T2  - GYNECOLOGIC ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective. Endometrial cancer (EC) is a rare condition in young women. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of pelvic lymph node (LN) metastasis in young women with EC who are candidates for conservative management.Methods. Using the SEER database, a population-based analysis was conducted to identify women <45 years with grade 1, 2, or 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma stage IA (FIGO 2009) who underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy with at least ten LNs removed. The LN macrometastases rate based on conventional histological diagnosis was analyzed according to tumor grade and myometrial invasion (MI) on final histology.Results. A cohort of 1284 women was analyzed. The LN metastasis rates were: 2/414 (0.5%) grade 1 EC without MI, 5/239 (2.1%) grade 2 or 3 EC without MI, 5/308 (1.6%) grade 1 EC with MI, and 14/323 (4.3%) grade 2 or 3 EC with MI. Tumor size was not correlated with LN metastasis probability.Conclusions. Young patients eligible for conservative management have a low rate of LN macrometastasis, especially in stage IA without MI grade 1 EC. A systematic lymphadenectomy should not be performed in these patients. Prospective study evaluating the sentinel LN mapping in conservative management of EC could be performed to assess the LN micrometastasis rate. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Utility of image point cloud data towards generating enhanced multitemporal multisensor land cover maps
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Multitemporal land cover classification over urban areas is challenging, especially when using heterogeneous data sources with variable quality attributes. A prominent challenge is that classes with similar spectral signatures (such as trees and grass) tend to be confused with one another. In this paper, we evaluate the efficacy of image point cloud (IPC) data combined with suitable Bayesian analysis based time-series rectification techniques to improve the classification accuracy in a multitemporal context. The proposed method uses hidden Markov models (HMMs) to rectify land covers that are initially classified by a random forest (RF) algorithm. This land cover classification method is tested using time series of remote sensing data from a heterogeneous and rapidly changing urban landscape (Kuopio city, Finland) observed from 2006 to 2014. The data consisted of aerial images (5 years), Landsat data (all 9 years) and airborne laser scanning data (1 year). The results of the study demonstrate that the addition of three-dimensional image point cloud data derived from aerial stereo images as predictor variables improved overall classification accuracy, around three percentage points. Additionally, HMM-based post processing reduces significantly the number of spurious year-to-year changes. Using a set of 240 validation points, we estimated that this step improved overall classification accuracy by around 3.0 percentage points, and up to 6 to 10 percentage points for some classes. The overall accuracy of the final product was 91% (kappa = 0.88). Our analysis shows that around 1.9% of the area around Kuopio city, representing a total area of approximately 0.61 km(2), experienced changes in land cover over the nine years considered.

TI  - Mapping of ferric <SUP>(Fe3+)</SUP> and ferrous <SUP>(Fe2+)</SUP> iron oxides distribution using band ratio techniques with ASTER data and geochemistry of Kanjamalai and Godumalai, Tamil Nadu, south India
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The iron ores found in Tamil Nadu State, South India, are major varieties that have been confined with banded magnetite quartzite. The occurrence, distribution, and grade of these deposits significantly vary according to their geological structure and geomorphologic control. In this article, presents a novel approach, based on spectral remote sensing and digital processing of ASTER data, to identify and characterize the iron ores of Kanjamalai and Godumalai areas located in Tamil Nadu, India. By analyzing the ASTER images, the abundance of iron oxides including ferric (Fe3+) and ferrous (Fe2+) components was determined. The band ratioing technique, a multiband analysis was used to generate the abundance of iron oxide content in various parts of the study area using different band combinations such as band 2/band 1 (for Fe3+) and band 5/band 3 + band 1/ band 2 (for Fe2+). The geochemical analysis is an important part of this work to arrive with the outcome of band ratio techniques to decipher the relationship of the band ratio to the chemical composition of the ore samples. Accordingly, the correlation between the results of the geochemical analysis of the samples collected from the random locations was determined by Pearson's coefficient of correlation (rho) and compared with the corresponding locations in the abundance image. In addition to rho, various factors such as mean (mu), variance (sigma(2)) and corresponding standard deviations (sigma) were also analyzed for a comparative analysis. This comparative analysis indicated that most of the samples have considerably high iron oxide content in the locations. Thus, this study shows the possibility of detecting iron oxide content and its spatial distribution by using ASTER satellite images analysis. Hence, from the mapping results, it is evident that the band ratio technique of ASTER images can be used to map and characterize with limited fieldwork and geochemistry.

TI  - Can shallow groundwater sustain small-scale irrigated agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa? Evidence from N-W Ethiopia
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We present an evidence-based approach to identify how best to support development of groundwater for small-scale irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). We argue that it is important to focus this effort on shallow groundwater resources. We demonstrate and test this proposal at a case study site: Dangila woreda in the northwestern highlands of Ethiopia. This site was selected to allow exploration of a shallow weathered volcanic regolith type aquifer formation which is found to the South of Lake Tana and also exists more extensively across Ethiopia. We believe lessons from this case study are transferable and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small-scale irrigated agriculture in SSA.In comparison with other global regions, the groundwater resources of SSA are among the least understood; borehole records and hydrogeological studies are lacking. Assessments of groundwater resources do exist, but they rely on remotely sensed data combined with modelling at national or regional scale, and they focus on deeper aquifers. There is a need for these broad evaluations to be supplemented by localised and detailed assessments. The case study here presents such an assessment in order to support analysis of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with developing small-scale irrigation utilising shallow groundwater.A multimethod groundwater recharge assessment was conducted utilising formal and community-based monitoring, field investigation and existing published data. Water table recovery tests at existing hand dug wells confirm that well yields of 1 l/s are achievable at the end of the wet season when water would be available to support an additional irrigated crop. Hydraulic conductivity estimates ranged from 0.2 to 6.4 m/d in the dry season and from 2.8 to 22.3 m/day in the wet season. Specific yield estimations have a wider range though the mean value of 0.09 is as would be expected.Records of groundwater levels and rainfall monitored by the local community for the period April 2014 to April 2018 show that all the wells maintained useable water levels beyond the end of the rainy season. An assessment of the hydrology of the Kilti catchment provided insights into groundwater availability within the wider area. The catchment receives about 1600 mm/year of rainfall, of which about 350 mm/year enters the groundwater as recharge, discharging to the river as baseflow with a similar amount of rapid runoff contributing to a total river flow of about 400 mm/year. The lowest value of baseflow is 82% of the mean baseflow, which suggests a degree of buffering and indicates that groundwater is available even in a very dry year.We conclude that arguments previously put forward against the promotion of shallow groundwater use for agriculture in SSA appear exaggerated. Our analysis challenges the view that shallow aquifers are unproductive and that irrigation will have unacceptable impacts on wetlands and other groundwater-dependent ecosystems. We believe lessons from this case study are transferable, and there is a case for arguing that shallow groundwater represents a neglected opportunity for promoting sustainable small-scale irrigated agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa. It appears that factors other than the physical availability of groundwater control the 'triggering' of development. Interventions to promote development of groundwater resources should recognise the importance of shallow aquifers.

TI  - Toll-like receptors: exploring their potential connection with post-operative infectious complications and cancer recurrence
T2  - CLINICAL & EXPERIMENTAL METASTASIS
M3  - Review
AB  - Cancer is the leading cause of death in North America. Despite modern advances in cancer therapy, many patients will ultimately develop cancer metastasis resulting in mortality. Surgery to resect early stage solid malignancies remains the cornerstone of cancer treatment. However, surgery places patients at risk of developing post-operative infectious complications that are linked to earlier cancer metastatic recurrence and cancer mortality. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are evolutionarily-conserved sentinel receptors of the innate immune system that are activated by microbial products present during infection, leading to activation of innate immunity. Numerous types of solid cancer cells also express TLRs, with their activation augmenting their ability to metastasize. Similarly, healthy host-tissue TLRs activated during infection induce a prometastatic environment in the host. Cancer cells additionally secrete TLR activating ligands that activate both cancer TLRs and host TLRs to promote metastasis. Consequently, TLRs are an attractive therapeutic candidate to target infection-induced cancer metastasis and progression.

TI  - Continuous Detection of Small-Scale Changes in Scots Pine Dominated Stands Using Dense Sentinel-2 Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change and severe extreme events, i.e., changes in precipitation and higher drought frequency, have a large impact on forests. In Poland, particularly Norway spruce and Scots pine forest stands are exposed to disturbances and have, thus experienced changes in recent years. Considering that Scots pine stands cover approximately 58% of forests in Poland, mapping these areas with an early and timely detection of forest cover changes is important, e.g., for forest management decisions. A cost-efficient way of monitoring forest changes is the use of remote sensing data from the Sentinel-2 satellites. They monitor the Earth's surface with a high temporal (2-3 days), spatial (10-20 m), and spectral resolution, and thus, enable effective monitoring of vegetation. In this study, we used the dense time series of Sentinel-2 data from the years 2015-2019, (49 images in total), to detect changes in coniferous forest stands dominated by Scots pine. The simple approach was developed to analyze the spectral trajectories of all pixels, which were previously assigned to the probable forest change mask between 2015 and 2019. The spectral trajectories were calculated using the selected Sentinel-2 bands (visible red, red-edge 1-3, near-infrared 1, and short-wave infrared 1-2) and selected vegetation indices (Normalized Difference Moisture Index, Tasseled Cap Wetness, Moisture Stress Index, and Normalized Burn Ratio). Based on these, we calculated the breakpoints to determine when the forest change occurred. Then, a map of forest changes was created, based on the breakpoint dates. An accuracy assessment was performed for each detected date class using 861 points for 46 classes (45 dates and one class representing no changes detected). The results of our study showed that the short-wave infrared 1 band was the most useful for discriminating Scots pine forest stand changes, with the best overall accuracy of 75%. The evaluated vegetation indices underperformed single bands in detecting forest change dates. The presented approach is straightforward and might be useful in operational forest monitoring.

TI  - Vegetation cover dependence on accumulated antecedent precipitation in Australia: Relationships with photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic vegetation fractions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT

AB  - The development of fractional vegetation cover products for Australia that resolve cover into photosynthetic vegetation (F-PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (F-NPV) and bare soil/rock (F-BS) provides a new basis for examination of responses of vegetation cover to long term precipitation cycles, and to explore the interaction between these responses and land cover type, land use and other land surface properties. In this study, the relationship between accumulated antecedent precipitation (AAP) from 1 to 60 months and average monthly F-PV and F-NPV from the MODIS Fractional Cover Product is examined over a 17 year period from 2001 to 2018. The maximum R-2 value, regression coefficients for the maximum R-2, and number of accumulated months to the maximum R-2 were mapped for each month of the year for F-PV and F-NPV. Behaviour of responses in relation to land use, land cover, and soil water holding capacity was analysed based on pixel frequencies of classes at sub-region scale in the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia. The analysis showed that F-PV is largely dependent upon AAP in the preceding 12 months, however responses to longer periods of AAP also occur in specific land use-vegetation type combinations. The study also showed that positive responses in F-NPV could be driven by AAP from as much as 60 months, but that F-NPV is reduced in many areas in response to increased AAP. The presence or absence of domesticated livestock grazing as defined by Australian land use mapping was a major influence on response to AAP of both F-PV and F-NPV with statistical analysis indicating interactions between major natural vegetation type and grazing. In highly responsive areas (R-2 > 0.6) monitoring of land condition could be enhanced by testing of regional cover levels for major deviations from the long terms responses that might suggest land management concerns.

TI  - Time-Series Satellite Imagery Demonstrates the Progressive Failure of a City Master Plan to Control Urbanization in Abuja, Nigeria
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization is a global phenomenon, but its negative effects are most pronounced in developing countries. While much urbanization in the global South is unplanned, there have been occasional attempts at strategic, large-scale urban planning. One example is Abuja, Nigeria, a new city with origins in a 1970s Master Plan. Here, we use multi-temporal remote sensing to investigate four decades of urbanization in Abuja, showing the extent to which urban development has matched original intentions. Seven Landsat images from 1975 to 2014 were selected to correspond with Master Plan milestones and turning points in Nigeria's socio-political development. Land cover classification and change detection results show built-up land increasing rapidly, from 1,167 ha in 1975 to 18,623 ha in 2014, mostly converted from grassland, often via a pioneer bare soil class. Comparing image analysis against the Master Plan shows that, in the early years, Abuja's development matched broad planning intentions fairly closely. Later, though, unplanned development proliferated, and the city's resemblance to the Master Plan diminished progressively. Level of adherence to the Master Plan varied widely according to the system of government. Notably, after long-term military rule was replaced by a democratic government around the turn of the millennium, unplanned development increased sharply.

TI  - Fusion Despeckling Based on Surface Variation Anisotropic Diffusion Filter and Ratio Image Filter
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article proposes a novel fusing filter algorithm based on a surface variation anisotropic diffusion (SVAD) filter and a ratio image filter to achieve good speckle reduction and edge preservation. The proposed algorithm can be divided into three steps. First, the proposed SVAD filter effectively calculates the diffusion coefficient of each pixel to obtain filtering results on different scales. Second, the proposed ratio image filter obtains a new denoising result that can effectively recover some details lost with the SVAD filter. Then, the two filtering results are fused to obtain the final despeckling result. Furthermore, the effects of the weighting coefficients of the fusion processing and the number of iterations of the ratio image filter on the final filtering results are analyzed. The proposed algorithm is effectively evaluated by conducting some experiments on the added noise image and real synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. The experimental results confirm that the proposed method can not only significantly reduce speckle but also effectively preserve the edge information of images.

CP  - International Conference on Geo-Information Technology and its Applications (ICGITA)
CL  - Nanchang, PEOPLES R CHINA
AB  - Automatic water body extraction method is important for monitoring floods, droughts, and water resources. In this study, a new semantic segmentation convolutional neural network named the multi-scale water extraction convolutional neural network (MWEN) is proposed to automatically extract water bodies from GaoFen-1 (GF-1) remote sensing images. Three convolutional neural networks for semantic segmentation (fully convolutional network (FCN), Unet, and Deeplab V3+) are employed to compare with the water bodies extraction performance of MWEN. Visual comparison and five evaluation metrics are used to evaluate the performance of these convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The results show the following. (1) The results of water body extraction in multiple scenes using the MWEN are better than those of the other comparison methods based on the indicators. (2) The MWEN method has the capability to accurately extract various types of water bodies, such as urban water bodies, open ponds, and plateau lakes. (3) By fusing features extracted at different scales, the MWEN has the capability to extract water bodies with different sizes and suppress noise, such as building shadows and highways. Therefore, MWEN is a robust water extraction algorithm for GaoFen-1 satellite images and has the potential to conduct water body mapping with multisource high-resolution satellite remote sensing data.

TI  - Advances for the new remote sensing technology in ecosystem ecology research
T2  - Chinese Journal of Plant Ecology
M3  - Article
AB  - As the increasing pressure caused by climatic changes and human activities, the structure and function of terrestrial ecosystems are undergoing dramatic changes. Understanding how ecosystem processes change at large spatial-temporal scales is crucial for dealing with the threats and challenges posed by global climate change. Traditional field survey method can obtain accurate plot-level ecosystem observations, but it is difficult to be used to address large-scale ecosystem patterns and processes because of spatial and temporal discontinuities. Compared to traditional field survey methods, remote sensing has the advantages of real-time acquisition, repeated monitoring and multi spatial-temporal scales, which can compensate for the shortcomings of traditional field observation methods. Remote sensing can be used to identify the type and characteristic of ground objects, and extract key ecosystem parameters, energy flow and material circulation through retrieving the information contained by electromagnetic signals. Remote sensing data have become an indispensable data source in ecological studies, especially at the ecosystem, landscape, regional or global scales. With the emergence of new remote sensing sensors (e.g., light detection and ranging, and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence) and near-surface remote sensing platforms (e.g., unmanned aerial vehicle and backpack), remote sensing is entering the three-dimensional era and the observation platform become more diverse. These three-dimensional, multi-source and time-series remote sensing data bring new opportunities to fully understand ecosystem processes across different spatial scales. This paper reviews the advances of the application of remote sensing in terrestrial ecosystem studies. Specifically, this study focuses on the derivation of biological factors from remote sensing data, including vegetation types, structures, functions and biodiversity of terrestrial ecosystems. We also summarize the current status of the remote sensing technology in ecosystem studies and suggest the future opportunities of ecosystem monitoring in China.

TI  - Validating GEV Model for Reflection Symmetry-Based Ocean Ship Detection with Gaofen-3 Dual-Polarimetric Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is quite powerful in worldwide ocean observation, especially for ship monitoring, as a hot topic in ocean surveillance. The launched Gaofen-3 (GF3) satellite of China can provide C-band and multi-polarization SAR data, and one of its scientific applications is ocean ship detection. Compared with the single polarization system, polarimetric systems can be used for more effective ship detection. In this paper, a generalized extreme value (GEV)-based constant false alarm rate (CFAR) detector is proposed for ship detection in the ocean by using the reflection symmetry metric of dual-polarization. The reflection symmetry property shows big differences between the metallic targets at sea and the sea surface. In addition, the GEV statistical model is employed for reflection symmetry statistical distribution, which fits the reflection symmetry probability density function (pdf) well. Five dual-polarimetric GF3 stripmap ocean data sets are introduced in the paper, to show the contrast in enhancement by using reflection symmetry and to investigate the GEV model fit to the reflection symmetry metric. Additionally, with the detection experiments on the real GF3 datasets, the effectiveness and efficiency of the GEV model for reflection symmetry and the model-based ocean ship detector are verified.

TI  - Understanding the Role of Optimized Land Use/Land Cover Components in Mitigating Summertime Intra-Surface Urban Heat Island Effect: A Study on Downtown Shanghai, China
T2  - ENERGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, 167 land parcels of downtown Shanghai, China, were used to investigate the relationship between parcel-level land use/land cover (LULC) components and associated summertime intra-surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, and further analyze the potential of mitigating summertime intra-SUHI effect through the optimized LULC components, by integrating a thermal sharpening method combining the Landsat-8 thermal band 10 data and high-resolution Quickbird image, statistical analysis, and nonlinear programming with constraints. The results show the remarkable variations in intra-surface urban heat island (SUHI) effect, which was measured with the mean parcel-level blackbody sensible heat flux in kW per ha (Mean pc BBF). Through measuring the relative importance of each specific predictor in terms of their contributions to changing Mean pc BBF, the influence of parcel-level LULC components on excess surface flux of heat energy to the atmosphere was estimated using the partial least square regression (PLSR) model. Analysis of the present and optimized parcel-level LULC components and their contribution to the associated Mean pc BBF were comparable between land parcels with varying sizes. Furthermore, focusing on the gap between the present and ideally optimized area proportions of parcel -level LULC components towards minimizing the Mean pc BBF, the uncertainties arising from the datasets and methods, as well as the implications for sustainable land development and mitigating the UHI effect were discussed.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Natural forest ecosystems are vital environmental resources that provide multiple benefits to society, making it imperative for them to be monitored and mapped for practical management purposes. Satellite remote sensing technology is a new source of data and information for forest management and conservation. This study, therefore, applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms to Landsat 8 image for mapping a natural forest in South Africa. The objectives were to classify the forest into specific thematic cover classes that indicate its condition, compare the classification performance of the two algorithms based on their default parameters, and determine the most important variables that contributed to the mapping accuracy. The closed canopy forest was determined as the dominant thematic class, followed in descending order by the open canopy forest, grassland, and bare sites. Both algorithms obtained high classification accuracies of above 95%, though the SVM was slightly superior to the RF. The McNemer test indicated that the difference in performance between the two algorithms was statistically insignificant. The most important variables that contributed to the accuracy were the red, blue, green, Near Infrared and Short-Wave Infrared bands, which is attributed to their sensitivity to vegetation. The information provided through the study can be utilized for the planning, management and prioritization initiatives aimed at the protection and conservation of the forest reserve and similar forest ecosystems. The mapping approach could be used for other natural forest ecosystems to ascertain the spatial coverage of the specific thematic cover for conservation purposes. The SVM is recommended for forest ecosystem mapping as it optimally utilized the capabilities of the spectral bands that reflect their actual importance in the mapping of each cover class. The bands identified as important variables can be incorporated as part of input variables when using Landsat 8 satellite imagery for natural forest mapping.

TI  - Mapping Maize Cropping Patterns in Dak Lak, Vietnam Through MODIS EVI Time Series
T2  - AGRONOMY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Land use maps specifying up-to-date acreage information on maize (Zea mays L.) cropping patterns are required by many stakeholders in Vietnam. Government statistics, however, lag behind by one year, and the official land use maps are only updated at 5-year intervals. The aim of this study was to apply the Savitzky-Golay algorithm to reconstruct noisy Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) time series (2003-2018) from Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Vegetation Indices (MOD13Q1) to allow timely detection of changes in maize crop phenology, and then to employ a linear kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier on the reconstructed EVI time series to prepare the present-day maize cropping pattern map of Dak Lak province of Vietnam. The method was able to specify the spatial extent of areas cropped to maize with an overall map accuracy of 79% and could also differentiate the areas cropped to maize just once versus twice annually. The by-district mapped maize acreage shows a good agreement with the official governmental data, with a 0.93 correlation coefficient (r) and a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 1624 ha.

TI  - Monitoring and mapping rural urbanization and land use changes using Landsat data in the northeast subtropical region of Vietnam
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid land use change has taken place in many neighboring provinces of the capital of Vietnam such as Thai Nguyen province over the past 2 decades due to urbanization and industrialization. Deriving accurate and updated land cover and land-use change information is essential for the environmental monitoring, evaluation and management. In this study, a robust classification algorithm, Random Forest (RF) was employed in R programming to map and monitor temporal and spatial characteristics of urban expansion and land-use change in Thai Nguyen province, Vietnam. The results showed that there has been a substantial and uneven urban growth and a significant loss of forest and cropland between 2000 and 2016. Most of the conversion of agriculture and forest into built-up and mining uses were largely detected in rural regions and suburbs of Thai Nguyen. Further GIS analysis revealed that rapid urban and industrial expansion was spatially occurred in the southern rural portions and central area of the province. This study also demonstrates the potential of Landsat data and combination of R programming language and GIS to provide a timely, accurate and economical means to map and analyze temporal land cover and land use changes for future national and local land development planning.

TI  - Precision of exogenous post-stratification in small-area estimation based on a continuous national forest inventory
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - National forest inventories (NFIs) are designed to provide accurate information on forest resources at the national and regional levels, but there is also a demand for such information at smaller spatial scales. Auxiliary data such as satellite imagery have been used to facilitate small-area estimation. The commonly used method, k-nearest neighbour (k-NN), provides a model-based estimator for small areas, but a design-unbiased estimator for the mean square error is not available. Post-stratification (PS) is an alternative approach to using auxiliary information that allows for design-based variance estimation. In a case study using real inventory data of the Finnish NFI, we applied this method to the municipality level to explore the lower limit to the area for which the key forest parameters, forest area and growing stock volumes, can be estimated with sufficient precision. For PS, we employed exogenous forest resources maps based on the previous NFI round. In the municipalities of the two study provinces, the relative standard errors of total volume estimates ranged from 2.3% to 26.9%. They were smaller than 10% for municipalities with an area of 390 km(2) or larger, corresponding to approximately 100 or more sample plots on forestland. We also demonstrated the usefulness of design-unbiased variance estimation in showing discrepancies between design-based PS and modelbased k-NN estimates.

TI  - Classification Methods for Mapping Mangrove Extents and Drivers of Change in Thanh Hoa Province, Vietnam during 2005-2018
T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests have been globally recognised as their vital functions in preventing coastal erosion, mitigating effects of wave actions and protecting coastal habitats and adjacent shoreline land-uses from extreme coastal events. However, these functions are under severe threats due to the rapid growth of population, intensive shrimp farming and the increased intensity of severe storms in Hau Loc and Nga Son districts, Thanh Hoa province. This research was conducted to monitor spatial-temporal changes in mangrove extents using Landsat and Sentinel imageries from 2005 to 2018. Unsupervised and supervised classification methods and vegetation indices were tested to select the most suitable classification method for study sites, then to quantify mangrove extents and their changes in selected years. The findings show that supervised classification was the most suitable in study sites compared to vegetation indices and unsupervised classification. Mangrove forest extents increased by 7.5 %, 38.6 %, and 47.8 % during periods of 2005 - 2010, 2010 - 2015 and 2015 - 2018, respectively. An increase of mangrove extents resulted from national programs of mangrove rehabilitation and restoration during 2005- 2018, increased by 278.0 ha (123.0 %).

T2  - FOREST AND SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove forests are important and known as one of the most productive ecosystems in the tropics. They reduce the impacts of extreme events, provide important breeding grounds for aquatic species and build the resilience of ecosystem-dependent coastal communities. On the contrary, they are also known as one of the most threatened and vulnerable ecosystems worldwide, which have experienced a dramatic decline due to extensive coastal development during the last half-century. Remote sensing techniques have demonstrated a high potential to detect, identify, map, and monitor mangrove conditions and its changes, which is reflected by a large number of scientific papers published on this topic. The aim of this study was to investigate the multi-decadal changes of mangrove forests selected communes in Hai Phong city, North Vietnam, based on using Landsat and Sentinel 2 data from 2000 to 2018. The study used these continuous steps: 1) data pre-processing; 2) image classification using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index; 3) accuracy assessments; and 4) multi-temporal change detection and spatial analysis of mangrove forests. The classification maps in comparison with the ground reference data showed the satisfactory agreement with the overall accuracy was higher than 80.0%. From 2000 to 2018, the areas of mangrove forests in the study regions increased by 584.2 ha in Dai Hop and Bang La communes (Region 1) and by 124.2 ha in Tan Thanh, Ngoc Xuyen and Ngoc Hai communes (Region 2), mainly due to the boom of mangrove planting projects and good mangrove management at the local community level.

TI  - Complex, Critical and Caring: Young People's Diverse Religious, Spiritual and Non-Religious Worldviews in Australia and Canada
T2  - RELIGIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Recent scholarly and media perspectives on religion and youth have often depicted young people as being apathetic when it comes to religion. The methods used in research on religion are also typically informed by outdated, fixed idea of religious identity that are no longer applicable, especially to young people. This paper confronts these issues by applying contemporary theories of religious diversity, including lived religion and religious complexity, to the findings of the Canadian Religion, Gender and Sexuality among Youth in Canada (RGSY) study, the Australian Interaction multifaith youth movement project, and the Worldviews of Australian Generation Z (AGZ) study. These three studies revealed that young people negotiate their worldview identities in complex, critical and caring ways that are far from ambivalent, and that are characterised by hybridity and questioning. We thereby recommend that policies and curricula pertaining to young people's and societies' wellbeing better reflect young people's actual lived experiences of diversity.

TI  - Antarctic Supraglacial Lake Identification Using Landsat-8 Image Classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface meltwater generated on ice shelves fringing the Antarctic Ice Sheet can drive ice-shelf collapse, leading to ice sheet mass loss and contributing to global sea level rise. A quantitative assessment of supraglacial lake evolution is required to understand the influence of Antarctic surface meltwater on ice-sheet and ice-shelf stability. Cloud computing platforms have made the required remote sensing analysis computationally trivial, yet a careful evaluation of image processing techniques for pan-Antarctic lake mapping has yet to be performed. This work paves the way for automating lake identification at a continental scale throughout the satellite observational record via a thorough methodological analysis. We deploy a suite of different trained supervised classifiers to map and quantify supraglacial lake areas from multispectral Landsat-8 scenes, using training data generated via manual interpretation of the results from k-means clustering. Best results are obtained using training datasets that comprise spectrally diverse unsupervised clusters from multiple regions and that include rock and cloud shadow classes. We successfully apply our trained supervised classifiers across two ice shelves with different supraglacial lake characteristics above a threshold sun elevation of 20 degrees, achieving classification accuracies of over 90% when compared to manually generated validation datasets. The application of our trained classifiers produces a seasonal pattern of lake evolution. Cloud shadowed areas hinder large-scale application of our classifiers, as in previous work. Our results show that caution is required before deploying 'off the shelf' algorithms for lake mapping in Antarctica, and suggest that careful scrutiny of training data and desired output classes is essential for accurate results. Our supervised classification technique provides an alternative and independent method of lake identification to inform the development of a continent-wide supraglacial lake mapping product.

TI  - Is Inclusion of Informed Consent Associated with HIV Seropositivity Rate? Findings from 2017 HIV Sentinel Surveillance among Men Having Sex with Men in Select States of India
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During round 2017 of HIV Sentinel Surveillance (HSS) for men who have sex with men (MSM) in India, sampling strategy was changed from consecutive sampling to random sampling, and recruitment was conditioned on informed written consent. Objective: The study aimed to explore whether inclusion of informed consent is associated with HIV seropositivity rates among MSM population in select four states of Central India. Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted in four states of Delhi, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand that were supervised by All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. We did analysis of data collected during 2017 HSS, supplemented with additional program data from targeted intervention (TI) sites. All nine MSM sites in four states were included. Participants were defined as all those MSM who participated in HSS 2017 irrespective of whether they were mentioned in the random list or were selected by the TI partner. The MSM in the random list who either refused to participate or could not be contacted even after three attempts were classified as "nonparticipants." Seropositivity of both groups was compared. Descriptive statistics were derived. Results: Overall nonparticipation rate was 14.7%, the highest being in Jharkhand (26%) and lowest in Uttarakhand (6.8%). Overall HIV positivity rate was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in nonparticipants (4.2%) when compared to participants (1.42%). Conclusion: The change in sampling strategy and introduction of written informed consent for recruitment of high-risk groups in HSS 2017 round could have led to an underestimation of HIV seropositivity rate among MSM in the states in Central Zone.

TI  - Assessing the Ecological Quality of Nanjing during Its Urbanization Process by Using Satellite, Meteorological, and Socioeconomic Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing the ecological status of different districts within a city undergoing urbanization is challenging given their complex surface types and fast pace of development. In this study, we utilized satellite data obtained from Landsat 5/TM (Thematic Mapper) and Landsat 8/OLI (Operational Land Imager) images in conjunction with meteorological and socioeconomic data to construct a remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) for monitoring the ecological quality of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. A higher RSEI value corresponded to better ecological quality. Five ratings were associated with RSEI values of city districts: very poor, poor, average, good, and excellent. In Nanjing, the percentage of areas evidencing good RSEI ratings decreased from 55.9% in 2000 to 48.0% in 2018, whereas there was a slight increase in areas with very poor RSEI ratings during this period. Of the 11 city districts, 16.8%, 21.8%, and 61.4% respectively evidenced the increasing, decreasing, and stable ecological quality relative to their quality in 2000. Of the 11 administrative districts in Nanjing, the main urban districts evidenced increased RSEI values in 2018 compared with those in 2000, with the improved areas exceeding the ones that had deteriorated in these districts. However, the ecological quality of new urban and ed because of the urban expansion, with areas that had deteriorated exceeding the improved ones. Of the three protected ecological zones, the quality of Zijin Mountain National Forest Park was considerably better than that of Laoshan and Jiangxinzhou. Overall, the urbanization rate and RSEI evidenced a high negative correlation coefficient value (-0.76). The urbanization process of Nanjing induced a declining trend for the ecological quality, indicating the need of strong protection measures for the maintenance or improvement of its ecological environment.

TI  - Outlier-insensitive Bayesian inference for linear inverse problems (OutIBI) with applications to space geodetic data
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Inverse problems play a central role in data analysis across the fields of science. Many techniques and algorithms provide parameter estimation including the best-fitting model and the parameters statistics. Here, we concern ourselves with the robustness of parameter estimation under constraints, with the focus on assimilation of noisy data with potential outliers, a situation all too familiar in Earth science, particularly in analysis of remote-sensing data. We assume a linear, or linearized, forward model relating the model parameters to multiple data sets with a priori unknown uncertainties that are left to be characterized. This is relevant for global navigation satellite system and synthetic aperture radar data that involve intricate processing for which uncertainty estimation is not available. The model is constrained by additional equalities and inequalities resulting from the physics of the problem, but the weights of equalities are unknown. We formulate the problem from a Bayesian perspective with non-informative priors. The posterior distribution of the model parameters, weights and outliers conditioned on the observations are then inferred via Gibbs sampling. We demonstrate the practical utility of the method based on a set of challenging inverse problems with both synthetic and real space-geodetic data associated with earthquakes and nuclear explosions. We provide the associated computer codes and expect the approach to be of practical interest for a wide range of applications.

TI  - An Improved Topography-Coupled Kernel-Driven Model for Land Surface Anisotropic Reflectance
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The semiempirical kernel-driven model is commonly used for global surface reflectance characterization because of its simplicity and underlying physical meaning. However, the current kernel-driven reflectance models assume that the terrain is flat and homogeneous, and can induce significant errors in the surface reflectance estimation and subsequent parameter retrievals over rugged terrain. In this study, an improved topography-coupled kernel-driven (TCKD) reflectance model with the correction of diffuse skylight effects was proposed based on the diffused-equivalent slope model (dESM) and RossThick-LiTransit (RTLT) kernel-driven model. The TCKD model's accuracy and effectiveness were evaluated using surface reflectance simulated by the radiosity approach and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. Against simulated data, the results show that the TCKD model can accurately capture the distortion of the reflectance shape and hemispherical distribution caused by the topographic effects. Compared to MODIS data, the TCKD model has an overall better performance than the RTLT model across different spatial scales and land cover types. When the mean slope is larger than 35 degrees at the 500-m resolution, the TCKD model's near-infrared (NIR) root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the regression slope of the fitting line are 0.037 and 0.752, respectively, whereas those of the RTLT model are 0.049 and 0.645. Neglecting the diffuse skylight in the TCKD model can also lead to great bias in the reflectance retrievals. When the mean slope is 31 degrees, as the ratio of diffuse skylight varies from 0 to 1, the NIR RMSE of the TCKD model decreases from 0.012 to 0.005, whereas that increases from 0.012 to around 0.02 if the diffuse skylight effects are neglected. These preliminary results demonstrate that the TCKD model is capable of improving the fitting ability of the kernel-driven model over rugged terrain and provides potentials for better retrieving and interpreting land surface parameters such as land surface albedo in mountainous areas.

TI  - Identification of groundwater resource zone in the active tectonic region of Himalaya through earth observatory techniques
T2  - GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The delineation of the groundwater resource (GWR) zone is one of the challenging tasks for the research domain of hydrogeologists and decision makers. In this study, thematic inventory of existing ancillary data and remotely sensed data sets were used for targeting the GWR zones at microscale. Different geology, geomorphological and hydrological parameters thematic layers have been prepared to determine the groundwater resources zones. Further, GWR zones were validated with the results carried out by the resistivity imaging tomography data. Wenner, Dipole-Dipole and Pole-Dipole array methods, portraying six electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) characterised by 40 electrodes channels was used for geophysical analysis. The study result discovers two aquifer pockets in perched condition, in good association with hydrogeomorphological variables. To enhance the groundwater supply in study area a few recharged pits and trenches are being suggested for immediate construction in the upper reaches of the JNV campus. Thus the search for a suitable location of groundwater source in the small basin located at active tectonic area of the Lesser Himalaya i.e., Simar watershed (covering 4.62 Km(2)) was carried out as stated by the result of geospatial analysis, showing two strong accumulations cum recharging pockets located in the NNW portion of JNV campus, which are big source of groundwater, further validated by the 2-D resistivity as high potential groundwater zone.

TI  - Tropical Wetland (TropWet) Mapping Tool: The Automatic Detection of Open and Vegetated Waterbodies in Google Earth Engine for Tropical Wetlands
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the location and extent of surface water and inundated vegetation is vital for a range of applications including flood risk management, biodiversity monitoring, quantifying greenhouse gas emissions, and mapping water-borne disease risk. Here, we present a new tool, TropWet, which enables users of all abilities to map wetlands in herbaceous dominated regions based on simple unmixing of optical Landsat satellite imagery in the Google Earth Engine. The results demonstrate transferability throughout the African continent with a high degree of accuracy (mean 91% accuracy, st. dev 2.6%, n = 10,800). TropWet demonstrated considerable improvements over existing globally available surface water datasets for mapping the extent of important wetlands like the Okavango, Botswana. TropWet was able to provide frequency inundation maps as an indicator of malarial mosquito aquatic habitat extent and persistence in Barotseland, Zambia. TropWet was able to map flood extent comparable to operational flood risk mapping products in the Zambezi Region, Namibia. Finally, TropWet was able to quantify the effects of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on the extent of photosynthetic vegetation and wetland extent across Southern Africa. These examples demonstrate the potential for TropWet to provide policy makers with crucial information to help make national, regional, or continental scale decisions regarding wetland conservation, flood/disease hazard mapping, or mitigation against the impacts of ENSO.

TI  - Characterization of Snowfall Rates, Totals, and Snow-to-Liquid Ratios in Electrified Snowfall Events Identified by the Geostationary Lightning Mapper
T2  - WEATHER AND FORECASTING
M3  - Article
AB  - It has been theorized that thundersnow (TSSN) occurs in conjunction with heavy snowfall rates and in geographical regions where heavy-banded snow occurs more frequently. This study aims to objectively and quantitatively identify characteristics associated with TSSN to improve the situational awareness of heavy snowfall and associated hazards. The Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM), National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Services (NESDIS) merged Snowfall Rate (mSFR) product, and surface observations were utilized to characterize snowfall accumulation, snow-to-liquid ratio (SLR) values, and radar characteristics of heavy snowfall events from a GLM perspective. When at least 2 in. of snowfall accumulation occurred, areas with TSSN flashes identified by the thundersnow detection algorithm (TDA) were likely to receive, on average, a total of 24.5 cm (9.6 in.) of snowfall. TSSN was more likely to occur in snowfall rates less than 2.54 cm h(-1) (1 in. h(-1)) and be associated with snow-to-liquid ratio (SLR) values between 8:1 and 10:1. It was determined that TSSN flashes observed by GLM occurred in isothermal reflectivity values less than 30 dBZ and average spatial offsets of 131 km between the lightning flash location and the heaviest snowfall rates were observed. GLM flashes in proximity of National Lightning Detection Network cloud-to-ground flashes and tall structures were found to be statistically different (p < 0.05) regarding snowfall rates, SLR values, and various Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor variables compared to other TSSN flashes. It was inferred that tower TSSN flashes, on median, were more likely to initiate within light-to-moderately rimed snowfall. Last, a heavy snowfall event was analyzed to demonstrate the capability of these products in identifying storm characteristics associated with TSSN.

TI  - Landsat Hourly Evapotranspiration Flux Assessment Using Lysimeters for the Texas High Plains
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the biggest data gaps in water management due to limited ET measurements, and further, spatial variability in ET is difficult to capture. Satellite-based ET estimation has great potential for water resources planning as it allows estimation of agricultural water use at field, landscape, and watershed scales. However, uncertainties with satellite data derived ET are a major concern. This study evaluates hourly satellite-based ET from 2001-2010 for the growing season (May October) under irrigated and dryland conditions for both tall and short crops. The evaluation was conducted using observed ET from four large weighing lysimeters at the United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) Conservation and Production Research Laboratory in Bushland, Texas. Hourly ET from satellite data were derived using the Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration (METRIC) model. Performance statistics showed that satellite-based hourly estimates compared to lysimeter measurements provided good performance with an root-mean-square error(RMSE) of 0.14 mm, Nash Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.57, and R-2 of 0.62 for ET for dryland crops, and RMSE of 0.16, NSE of 0.63, and R-2 of 0.65 for irrigated crops. METRIC provided accurate hourly ET estimates that may be useful for irrigation scheduling and other water resources management purposes based on the hourly assessment.

M3  - Article
AB  - A dengue outbreak occurred on Hawaii Island between September 2015 and March 2016. Entomological investigations were undertaken between December 2015 and February 2016 to determine which Aedes mosquito species were responsible for the outbreak. A total of 3,259 mosquitoes were collected using a combination of CDC autocidal gravid ovitraps, Biogents BG-Sentinel traps, and hand-nets; immature mosquitoes were collected during environmental surveys. The composition of species was Aedes albopictus (58%), Aedes aegypti (25%), Wyeomyia mitchelli (7%), Aedes vexans (5%), Culex quinquefasciatus (4%), and Aedes japonicus (1%). Adult mosquitoes were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of dengue virus (DENV) RNA. Of the 185 pools of female mosquitoes tested, 15 containing Ae. albopictus were positive for the presence of DENV type 1 RNA. No virus was detected in pools of the remaining species. Phylogenetic analysis showed the virus strain belonged to genotype I and was closely related to strains that were circulating in the Pacific between 2008 and 2014. This is the first report of detection of DENV in Ae. albopictus from Hawaii.

AB  - Introduction: The current research employed a terror management framework to understand the cognitive effects of frequent drug use. The study focused specifically on cannabis users and tested the hypothesis that frequent cannabis use is associated with the development of cannabis-related worldview beliefs that take on an existential function for frequent users. Method: Participants (N = 226) answered questions about their cannabis use and completed a measure of cannabis worldview investment. Thereafter, they were randomly assigned to a cannabis worldview threat (vs. no threat) condition and completed measures of death-thought accessibility (DTA) and cannabis worldview defense. Results: A positive association between frequency of cannabis use and cannabis worldview investment was observed. Moreover, among high frequency cannabis users, those highly invested in the cannabis worldview evinced significantly more DTA following exposure to the worldview threat than no threat condition. Participants with high investment in the cannabis worldview also showed more derogation of the cannabis worldview threat (vs. no threat) essay-author. However, this relationship was not influenced by DTA or frequency of cannabis use. Discussion: A terror management perspective on drug use is discussed, including implications for understanding drug abuse, addiction, and treatment.

TI  - The viability of remote sensing for extracting rubber smallholding information: A case study in Malaysia
T2  - EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Information on rubber smallholdings is undeniably vital for the Malaysian rubber industry because the rubber area is decreasing every year. The rapid development of properties such as high-rise buildings and the plantation activities of other commodities are believed to be the major factors driving rubber land area deterioration. This study was conducted to determine the viability of spectral analysis to detect rubber smallholdings using satellite imagery. The Landsat 8 OLI and the following methods were applied in this study: the False Colour Method, Unsupervised Classification, Supervised Classification and twentyseven Spectral Vegetation Indices (SVIs). Land use data from the Department of Agriculture and available internal data were used for validation. The Supervised Classification Method and EVI gave promising results for identifying rubber smallholdings with accuracies of 82% and 83%, respectively.

TI  - From drought to flood: A water balance analysis of the Tuolumne River basin during extreme conditions (2015-2017)
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - The degree to which the hydrologic water balance in a snow-dominated headwater catchment is affected by annual climate variations is difficult to quantify, primarily due to uncertainties in measuring precipitation inputs and evapotranspiration (ET) losses. Over a recent three-year period, the snowpack in California's Sierra Nevada fluctuated from the lightest in recorded history (2015) to historically heaviest (2017), with a relatively average year in between (2016). This large dynamic range in climatic conditions presents a unique opportunity to investigate correlations between annual water availability and runoff in a snow-dominated catchment. Here, we estimate ET using a water balance approach where the water inputs to the system are spatially constrained using a combination of remote sensing, physically based modelling, and in-situ observations. For all 3 years of this study, the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) combined periodic high-resolution snow depths from airborne Lidar with snow density estimates from an energy and mass balance model to produce spatial estimates of snow water equivalent over the Tuolumne headwater catchment at 50-m resolution. Using observed reservoir inflow at the basin outlet and the well-quantified snowmelt model results that benefit from periodic ASO snow depth updates, we estimate annual ET, runoff efficiency (RE), and the associated uncertainty across these three dissimilar water years. Throughout the study period, estimated annual ET magnitudes remained steady (222 mm in 2015, 151 mm in 2016, and 299 mm in 2017) relative to the large differences in basin input precipitation (547 mm in 2015, 1,060 mm in 2016, and 2,211 mm in 2017). These values compare well with independent satellite-derived ET estimates and previously published studies in this basin. Results reveal that ET in the Tuolumne does not scale linearly with the amount of available water to the basin, and that RE primarily depends on total annual snowfall proportion of precipitation.

TI  - Land Surface Temperature Retrieval for Agricultural Areas Using a Novel UAV Platform Equipped with a Thermal Infrared and Multispectral Sensor
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a fundamental parameter within the system of the Earth's surface and atmosphere, which can be used to describe the inherent physical processes of energy and water exchange. The need for LST has been increasingly recognised in agriculture, as it affects the growth phases of crops and crop yields. However, challenges in overcoming the large discrepancies between the retrieved LST and ground truth data still exist. Precise LST measurement depends mainly on accurately deriving the surface emissivity, which is very dynamic due to changing states of land cover and plant development. In this study, we present an LST retrieval algorithm for the combined use of multispectral optical and thermal UAV images, which has been optimised for operational applications in agriculture to map the heterogeneous and diverse agricultural crop systems of a research campus in Germany (April 2018). We constrain the emissivity using certain NDVI thresholds to distinguish different land surface types. The algorithm includes atmospheric corrections and environmental thermal emissions to minimise the uncertainties. In the analysis, we emphasise that the omission of crucial meteorological parameters and inaccurately determined emissivities can lead to a considerably underestimated LST; however, if the emissivity is underestimated, the LST can be overestimated. The retrieved LST is validated by reference temperatures from nearby ponds and weather stations. The validation of the thermal measurements indicates a mean absolute error of about 0.5 K. The novelty of the dual sensor system is that it simultaneously captures highly spatially resolved optical and thermal images, in order to construct the precise LST ortho-mosaics required to monitor plant diseases and drought stress and validate airborne and satellite data.

TI  - Assessment of Sampling Effects on Various Satellite-Derived Integrated Water Vapor Datasets Using GPS Measurements in Germany as Reference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Passive imagers on polar-orbiting satellites provide long-term, accurate integrated water vapor (IWV) data sets. However, these climatologies are affected by sampling biases. In Germany, a dense Global Navigation Satellite System network provides accurate IWV measurements not limited by weather conditions and with high temporal resolution. Therefore, they serve as a reference to assess the quality and sampling issues of IWV products from multiple satellite instruments that show different orbital and instrument characteristics. A direct pairwise comparison between one year of IWV data from GPS and satellite instruments reveals overall biases (in kg/m(2y)) of 1.77, 1.36, 1.11, and -0.31 for IASI, MIRS, MODIS, and MODIS-FUB, respectively. Computed monthly means show similar behaviors. No significant impact of averaging time and the low temporal sampling on aggregated satellite IWV data is found, mostly related to the noisy weather conditions in the German domain. In combination with SEVIRI cloud coverage, a change of shape of IWV frequency distributions towards a bi-modal distribution and loss of high IWV values are observed when limiting cases to daytime and clear sky. Overall, sampling affects mean IWV values only marginally, which are rather dominated by the overall retrieval bias, but can lead to significant changes in IWV frequency distributions.

TI  - Use of Completion Lymph Node Dissection for Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Melanoma
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 131st Annual Meeting of the Southern-Surgical-Association
CL  - Hot Springs, VA
AB  - BACKGROUND: For patients with sentinel node-positive melanoma (SNPM), randomized trials, first reported in 2015, found no benefit for routine completion lymph node dissection (CLND) in selected patients. This study examines time trends in CLND and explores institutional and clinical factors associated with CLND.STUDY DESIGN: The National Cancer Database was queried for patients older than 18 years from 2012 to 2016 with SNPM. A high-volume center was defined as >80th percentile for number of sentinel node procedures. Poisson regression assessed temporal trends and identified patient, pathologic, and institutional characteristics associated with CLND.RESULTS: From 2012 to 2016, we identified 7,146 patients with SNPM. The proportion of patients undergoing CLND was steady in 2012 to 2014 (61% to 63%), but decreased to 57% in 2015 and 50% in 2016 (p < 0.0001). The proportion of patients with SNPM who underwent CLND decreased over time for both high- (66% to 52%; p < 0.0001) and lower-volume centers (55% to 45%; p = 0.06). Female sex (relative risk [RR] 0.97; p < 0.001) and increasing age (RR 0.98; p < 0.0001) were associated with lower likelihood of CLND. Increased Breslow depth (RR 1.015; p = 0.006), ulceration (RR 1.067; p = 0.02), and high-volume centers (RR 1.180; p < 0.0001) were associated with higher likelihood of CLND. Regional differences in likelihood of CLND were also present (p < 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: Completion lymph node dissection in SNPM decreased over time, with the greatest change in 2016. Several patient, pathologic, and institutional characteristics were associated with likelihood of CLND. As evidence supports close observation for selected patients, efforts should be undertaken to improve and standardize patient selection for CLND across institutions caring for patients with melanoma.

TI  - Evaluation of Multi- and Many-Objective Optimization Techniques to Improve the Performance of a Hydrologic Model Using Evapotranspiration Remote-Sensing Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we explore the use of different multi- and many-objective calibration approaches in hydrological modeling when considering both observed streamflow and remotely sensed actual evapotranspiration (ETa). Eight remotely sensed ETa and an Ensemble products were used in a watershed in Michigan. Regarding the calibration process, the Unified-Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm III was integrated with the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT). The first nine calibrations used a multi-objective approach with two variables, one being streamflow and the other being a remotely sensed ETa products/Ensemble. The tenth calibration was a many-objective calibration with nine objective functions that represented observed streamflow and all eight of the remotely sensed evapotranspiration datasets. Results showed that the multi-objective calibrations were able to successfully calibrate both streamflow and ETa. However, the highest model performances were achieved using the Ensemble ETa product. Meanwhile, the required computational time for the many-objective calibration is significantly higher than the multi-objective calibration. In addition, the overall performance of many-objective method can be improved by considering weighting factors and constraining the search space.

TI  - Optoacustic Imaging - from Light to Sound?
T2  - AKTUELLE DERMATOLOGIE
M3  - Review
AB  - Optoacoustic imaging is a novel imaging modality based on the acquisition and processing of ultrasound signals generated by absorption of laser light within tissue. This method combines optical absorption contrast with high contrast deep in tissue and allows for morphological as well as molecular and functional imaging. Optoacoustic imaging can be performed label free or with contrast dyes and is non-ionizing. The technique is furthermore scalable which means that it can be used for macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic imaging. In recent years several optoacoustic systems have been developed and used in a variety of fields in both preclinical and clinical research. Promising fields of application in dermatology include the examination of melanomas, sentinel lymph nodes and non-melanoma skin cancer as well as the characterization of inflammatory skin diseases. In this review we explain the technical basics of optoacoustic imaging and describe and discuss the current state of research in macroscopic, mesoscopic, and microscopic optoacoustic systems.

TI  - Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen PET/CT Combined with Sentinel Node Biopsy for Primary Lymph Node Staging in Prostate Cancer
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Our objective was to determine the diagnostic capabilities of combined prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) PET/CT and sentinel node (SN) biopsy in PSMA PET/CT-negative patients for primary lymph node (LN) staging in prostate cancer (PCa) patients. Methods: Between January 2017 and March 2019, retrospectively, all consecutive patients with diagnosed intermediate- or high-risk primary PCa who underwent preoperative PSMA PET/CT (Ga-68 or F-18-DCFPyL) followed by robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and extended pelvic LN dissection (ePLND) were included. All patients without suspected LN metastases on PSMA PET/CT were considered candidates for SN biopsy with indocyanine green-Tc-99m-nanocolloid or Tc-99m-nanocolloid with free indocyanine green used as tracers. The ePLND was used as a reference standard. Results: Of 53 patients, 22 had positive PSMA PET/CT results and 31 underwent subsequent SN biopsy after negative PSMA PET/CT results. In total, 23 patients (43%) were pN1, of whom 6 (26%) had negative PSMA PET/CT results and underwent subsequent SN biopsy. The combined use of SN biopsy and PSMA PET/CT identified all pN1 patients (100% sensitivity; 95% confidence interval, 86%-100%) and performed correct nodal staging in 50 of 53 patients (94% diagnostic accuracy; 95% confidence interval, 84%-99%). SN biopsy identified significantly smaller LN metastases (median diameter, 2.0 mm; interquartile range, 1.0-3.8 mm) than PSMA PET/CT (median diameter, 5.5 mm; interquartile range, 2.6-9.3 mm; P = 0.007). Conclusion: Combining both modalities led to a 94% accuracy for nodal staging in diagnosed intermediate- and high-risk primary PCa. Adding SN biopsy in patients with negative PSMA PET/CT results increased the combined sensitivity to 100% for detecting nodal metastases at ePLND. This diagnostic accuracy may provide valuable information for directing further treatment in PCa patients, such as the use of PSMA PET/CT and SN biopsy rather than ePLND as the preferred approach for staging before radiotherapy.

TI  - STUDY ON THE ESTIMATION OF MICROWAVE LAND SURFACE EMISSIVITY OVER EAST ASIA
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Estimation of the land surface emissivity is crucial to evaluate the boundary conditions of atmospheric modeling data assimilation. Brightness temperatures observed by satellite passive microwave radiometer give information on emission forma raindrops and scattering by frozen particles. By applying radiative transfer model of the atmosphere, we can estimate the atmospheric hydrological process (i.e., rainfall, snowfall, water vapor, cloud water, etc.). However it is difficult to estimate microwave land surface emissivity at higher frequencies over land. Because land use, land cover and surface wetness over land are various and heterogeneous by comparing with over ocean. Therefore, we aim to estimate the microwave land surface emissivity over East Asia by using observed data and numerical models.Firstly, we investigate the characteristics of land surface emissivity derived from SSM/I, AMSR-E and AMSR2 over Asia and the relationship between land surface emissivity and land hydrological variables based on satellite data sets and numerical models. Secondary, we estimate the land surface emissivity by applying the Community Microwave Emission Model (CMEM) and Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM).Simulation results shows the estimated LSE is overestimated and its variability is large by comparing the observed data.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In this era of 'big data', there is growing recognition of the value of environmental, health, social and demographic data for research. Open government data initiatives are growing in number and in terms of content. Remote sensing data are finding widespread use in environmental research, including in low- and middle-income settings. While our ability to study environment and health associations across countries and continents grows, data protection rules and greater patient control over the use of their data present new challenges to using health data in research. Innovative tools that circumvent the need for the physical sharing of data by supporting non-disclosive sharing of information, or that permit spatial analysis without researchers needing access to underlying patient data can be used to support analyses while protecting data confidentiality. User-friendly visualizations, allowing small-area data to be seen and understood by non-expert audiences, are revolutionizing public and researcher interactions with data. The UK Small Area Health Statistics Unit's Environment and Health Atlas for England and Wales, and the US National Environmental Public Health Tracking Network offer good examples. Open data facilitates user-generated outputs, and 'mash-ups', and user-generated inputs from social media, mobile devices and wearable tech are new data streams that will find utility in future studies, and bring novel dimensions with respect to ethical use of small-area data.

TI  - Estimating Forest Characteristics for Longleaf Pine Restoration Using Normalized Remotely Sensed Imagery in Florida USA
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Effective forest management is predicated on accurate information pertaining to the characteristics and condition of forests. Unfortunately, ground-based information that accurately describes the complex spatial and contextual nature of forests across broad landscapes is cost prohibitive to collect. In this case study we address technical challenges associated with estimating forest characteristics from remotely sensed data by incorporating field plot layouts specifically designed for calibrating models from such data, applying new image normalization procedures to bring images of varying spatial resolutions to a common radiometric scale, and implementing an ensemble generalized additive modeling technique. Image normalization and ensemble models provided accurate estimates of forest types, presence/absence of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), and tree basal areas and tree densities over a large segment of the panhandle of Florida, USA. This study overcomes several of the major barriers associated with linking remotely sensed imagery with plot data to estimate key forest characteristics over large areas.

TI  - Conterminous United States land cover change patterns 2001-2016 from the 2016 National Land Cover Database
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The 2016 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) product suite (available on www.mrlc.gov), includes Landsat-based, 30 m resolution products over the conterminous (CONUS) United States (U.S.) for land cover, urban imperviousness, and tree, shrub, herbaceous and bare ground fractional percentages. The release of NLCD 2016 provides important new information on land change patterns across CONUS from 2001 to 2016. For land cover, seven epochs were concurrently generated for years 2001, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2013, and 2016. Products reveal that land cover change is significant across most land cover classes and time periods. The land cover product was validated using existing reference data from the legacy NLCD 2011 accuracy assessment, applied to the 2011 epoch of the NLCD 2016 product line. The legacy and new NLCD 2011 overall accuracies were 82% and 83%, respectively, (standard error (SE) was 0.5%), demonstrating a small but significant increase in overall accuracy. Between 2001 and 2016, the CONUS landscape experienced significant change, with almost 8% of the landscape having experienced a land cover change at least once during this period. Nearly 50% of that change involves forest, driven by change agents of harvest, fire, disease and pests that resulted in an overall forest decline, including increasing fragmentation and loss of interior forest. Agricultural change represented 15.9% of the change, with total agricultural spatial extent showing only a slight increase of 4778 km(2), however there was a substantial decline (7.94%) in pasture/hay during this time, transitioning mostly to cultivated crop. Water and wetland change comprised 15.2% of change and represent highly dynamic land cover classes from epoch to epoch, heavily influenced by precipitation. Grass and shrub change comprise 14.5% of the total change, with most change resulting from fire. Developed change was the most persistent and permanent land change increase adding almost 29,000 km(2) over 15 years (5.6% of total CONUS change), with southern states exhibiting expansion much faster than most of the northern states. Temporal rates of developed change increased in 2001-2006 at twice the rate of 2011-2016, reflecting a slowdown in CONUS economic activity. Future NLCD plans include increasing monitoring frequency, reducing latency time between satellite imaging and product delivery, improving accuracy and expanding the variety of products available in an integrated database.

TI  - Is axillary lymph node dissection necessary for positive preoperative aspiration cytology lymph node results?
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Based on international guidelines, axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is recommended in cases of breast cancer if preoperative examinations confirm axillary metastasis. We examined which set of preoperative parameters might render ALND unnecessary.Patients and methods: Preoperative examinations (axillary ultrasound and aspiration cytology) confirmed axillary metastasis in 190 cases out of 2671 patients with breast cancer; primary ALN dissection was performed on these patients with or without prior neoadjuvant therapy. The clinico-pathological results were analysed to determine which parameter might predict the presence of no more than 2 or 3 metastatic ALNs.Results: The final histological examination confirmed 1-3 metastatic lymph nodes in ALND samples in 116 cases and over 3 metastatic lymph nodes in 74 cases.For patients receiving neoadjuvant therapy (59 out of the 190 cases), if the size of the primary tumour was 2 cm or smaller and/or the metastatic ALN was 15 mm or smaller, then the patient was likely to have no more than 3 positive ALNs (stage N0-1 disease) (p <0.001). If the patient did not receive neoadjuvant therapy, stage N2 or N3 disease was very likely. No correlation was found between other clinicopathological characteristics of the tumour and involvement of the ALNs.Conclusion: Axillary lymph node dissection is not necessary for selected breast cancer patients with axillary metastasis receiving neoadjuvant therapy. In these cases, sentinel lymph node biopsy with or without radiation therapy and close follow-up may serve as adequate therapy. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Ash Presence and Abundance Derived from Composite Landsat and Sentinel-2 Time Series and Lidar Surface Models in Minnesota, USA
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Ash trees (Fraxinus spp.) are a prominent species in Minnesota forests, with an estimated 1.1 billion trees in the state, totaling approximately 8% of all trees. Ash trees are threatened by the invasive emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis Fairmaire), which typically results in close to 100% tree mortality within one to five years of infestation. A detailed, wall-to-wall map of ash presence is highly desirable for forest management and monitoring applications. We used Google Earth Engine to compile Landsat time series analysis, which provided unique information on phenologic patterns across the landscape to identify ash species. Topographic position information derived from lidar was added to improve spatial maps of ash abundance. These input data were combined to produce a classification map and identify the abundance of ash forests that exist in the state of Minnesota. Overall, 12,524 km(2) of forestland was predicted to have greater than 10% probability of ash species present. The overall accuracy of the composite ash presence/absence map was 64% for all ash species and 72% for black ash, and classification accuracy increased with the length of the time series. Average height derived from lidar was the best model predictor for ash basal area (R-2 = 0.40), which, on average, was estimated as 16.1 m(2) ha(-1). Information produced from this map will be useful for natural resource managers and planners in developing forest management strategies which account for the spatial distribution of ash on the landscape. The approach used in this analysis is easily transferable and broadly scalable to other regions threatened with forest health problems such as invasive insects.

TI  - Characterizing seismogenic fault of 2016 Dingjie earthquake based on multitemporal DInSAR
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - On May 22, 2016, four M-w 4 similar to 5 earthquakes struck Dingjie County, Tibet, China. Studying the characteristics of the seismogenic fault is of great significance for understanding the regional tectonic. Due to the small magnitude of this earthquake, the interferometric deformation field acquired by a single interferometric pair was affected by large phase noise, especially atmospheric noise. In order to solve this problem, this study applied the multi-temporal interferograms generated by the time series Sentinel-1A SAR imagery. The co-seismic deformation field of this series earthquake was reconstructed by a temporal averaging method. We applied a geodetic inversion based on interferometric displacement map and elastic dislocation models. The slip distribution on seismogenic fault plane was estimated. The calculated the strike, dip and rake of the best solution were 188 degrees, 43 degrees and 78 degrees, respectively. The result shows that accumulative displacement was created by normal faulting with some left-lateral strike slip contribution. The slip was mainly distributed between 0 km to 9 km in the depth, and the maximum amount of slip is about 25 cm at the depth of 3 km. The moment magnitude obtained by the inversion was M-w 5.58. The result of this study showed that the applied temporal averaging solution with spaceborne InSAR data can effectively extract the coseismic deformation field of moderate or small -sized shallow earthquakes. The result implied that this earthquake is closely related to the activity of the Southern Tibet Detachment and Shenzha-Dingjie fault in southern Tibet.

TI  - Semiconductor behavior of halide perovskites AGeX<sub>3</sub> (A = K, Rb and Cs; X = F, Cl and Br): first-principles calculations
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - The structural, elastic and optoelectronic properties for cubic halide perovskites AGeX(3) (A = K, Rb and Cs, X = F, Cl and Br) have been successfully studied in this paper, using the density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE). The modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ-GGA) potential approximation was used to describe the band structure more accurately. The calculated band structure from mBJ gives appropriate optoelectronic properties of these materials. Band structure calculations reveal a semiconducting behavior with a direct band gap at the R-point in the reciprocal lattice space, with values lying between 0.79 and 2.87 eV. The compounds of interest are mechanically stable, anisotropic and ductile in nature. The optical properties indicate that these compounds can be used in various optoelectronic devices operating in the visible and ultraviolet energies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative theoretical prediction of the elastic, electronic and optical properties for these compounds which still awaits experimental confirmation.

TI  - A multi-resolution air temperature model for France from MODIS and Landsat thermal data
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding and managing the health effects of ambient temperature (T-a) in a warming, urbanizing world requires spatially- and temporally-resolved T-a at high resolutions. This is challenging in a large area like France which includes highly variable topography, rural areas with few weather stations, and heterogeneous urban areas where T-a can vary at fine spatial scales. We have modeled daily T-a from 2000 to 2016 at a base resolution of 1 km(2) across continental France and at a 200 x 200 m(2) resolution over large urban areas. For each day we predict three T-a measures: minimum (T-min), mean (T-mean), and maximum (T-max). We start by using linear mixed models to calibrate daily T-a observations from weather stations with remotely sensed MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and other spatial predictors (e.g. NDVI, elevation) on a 1 km(2) grid. We fill gaps where LST is missing (e.g. due to cloud cover) with additional mixed models that capture the relationship between predicted T-a at each location and observed T-a at nearby weather stations. The resulting 1 km T-a models perform very well, with ten-fold cross-validated R-2 of 0.92, 0.97, and 0.95, mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.4 degrees C, 0.9 degrees C, and 1.4 degrees C, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.9 degrees C, 1.3 degrees C, and 1.8 degrees C (T-min, T-mean, and T-max, respectively) for the initial calibration stage. To increase the spatial resolution over large urban areas, we train random forest and extreme gradient boosting models to predict the residuals (R) of the 1 km T-a predictions on a 200 x 200 m(2) grid. In this stage we replace MODIS LST and NDVI with composited top-of-atmosphere brightness temperature and NDVI from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellites. We use a generalized additive model to ensemble the random forest and extreme gradient boosting predictions with weights that vary spatially and by the magnitude of the predicted residual. The 200 m models also perform well, with ten-fold cross-validated R-2 of 0.79, 0.79, and 0.85, MAE of 0.4, 0.3, and 0.3, and RMSE of 0.6, 0.4, and 0.5 (R-min, R-mean, and R-max, respectively). Our model will reduce bias in epidemiological studies in France by improving T-a exposure assessment in both urban and rural areas, and our methodology demonstrates that MODIS and Landsat thermal data can be used to generate gap-free timeseries of daily minimum, maximum, and mean T-a at a 200 x 200 m(2) spatial resolution.

TI  - Tide-Induced Periodic Sea Surface Temperature Drops in the Coral Reef Area of Nanwan Bay, Southern Taiwan
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tidal current-induced cyclonic eddies cause cold-water upwelling and periodic sea surface temperature (SST) drops around the coral reef area in Nanwan Bay, which is located at the southern tip of Taiwan. This study used Himawari-8 satellite data and tide gauge and coastal ocean dynamics application radar (CODAR) data to analyze the characteristics of the SST drops and cyclonic eddy propagation and used an oceanic general circulation model (OGCM) to simulate the tidal current flowing process. According to the CODAR data analysis, the mixed primary semidiurnal tide had an average current velocity of 0.3-0.4 m s(-1) throughout the bay, and the average life cycle of a cyclonic eddy is 6.6 hr, with a propagation speed of 0.35 m s(-1). The SST drop during the spring tide period was greater than that during the neap tide period, and the SST dropped in both summer and winter. The average daily SST drop in the summer reached 2 degrees C with a maximum observed value of 4.7 degrees C, and the SST drop rate was 0.3-0.5 degrees C hr(-1). The annual mean chlorophyll-a concentration was 0.25 mg m(-3). This study explored the special properties of the Nanwan Bay coral reef area from the perspective of ocean physics to allow ecologists to facilitate the implementation of long-term conservation and monitoring programs.Plain Language Summary In recent years, the increased global sea temperatures have caused severe coral bleaching; however, Nanwan Bay has suffered a comparatively smaller impact. To understand why, we analyzed satellite and radar data. We found that Nanwan Bay experienced an almost daily sea surface temperature (SST) drop during the summer and that this periodic variation was caused by a cyclonic eddy upwelling cold water to the surface. In the summer, the SST drop was 2 degrees C on average and dropped at a rate of 0.3-0.5 degrees C hr(-1). The observational record indicated that the water cooled as much as 4.7 degrees C in 1 day. These eddies were caused by the unique topography in this area of the bay; they survived an average of 6.6 hr and moved at a rate of 0.35 m s(-1). The formed eddies disappeared in the bay or flowed southward out of the bay. With this study, we hope to help marine ecologists understand the Nanwan Bay environment from a geophysical perspective so that they have sufficient background knowledge when investigating coral biology and coral reef ecology in the future.

TI  - Dynamical Downscaling of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2016 Over the Contiguous United States Using WRF-VPRM, a Weather-Biosphere-Online-Coupled Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecosystem function (particularly CO2 fluxes and the subsequent atmospheric transport), synoptic-scale weather (e.g., midlatitude cyclones), and interactions between ecosystems and the atmosphere can be investigated using a weather-biosphere-online-coupled model. The Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) was coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in 2008 to simulate "weather-aware" biospheric CO2 fluxes and subsequent transport and dispersion. The ability of the coupled WRF-VPRM modeling system to simulate the CO2 structures within midlatitude cyclones, however, has not been evaluated due to the lack of data within these weather systems. In this study, VPRM parameters previously calibrated off-line using eddy covariance tower data over North America are implemented into WRF-VPRM. The updated WRF-VPRM is then used to simulate spatiotemporal variations of CO2 over the contiguous United States at a horizontal grid spacing of 12 km for 2016 using an optimized downscaling configuration. The downscaled fields are evaluated using remotely sensed data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, Total Carbon Column Observing Network, and in situ aircraft measurements from Atmospheric Carbon and Transport-America missions. Evaluations show that WRF-VPRM captures the monthly variation of column-averaged CO2 concentrations (XCO2) and episodic variations associated with frontal passages. The downscaling also successfully captures the horizontal CO2 gradients across fronts and vertical CO2 contrast between the boundary layer and the free troposphere. WRF-VPRM modeling results indicate that from May to September, biogenic fluxes dominate variability in XCO2 over most of the contiguous United States, except over a few metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles.

TI  - Land Cover Mapping in Cloud-Prone Tropical Areas Using Sentinel-2 Data: Integrating Spectral Features with Ndvi Temporal Dynamics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate remote sensing and mapping of land cover in the tropics remain difficult tasks since data gaps and a heterogenic landscape make it challenging to perform land cover classification. In this paper, we proposed a multi-feature classification method to integrate temporal statistical features with spectral and textural features. This method is designed to improve the accuracy of land cover classification in cloud-prone tropical regions. Sentinel-2 images were used to construct an NDVI stack for a time-series statistical analysis to characterize the temporal variance of land cover. Two statistical indices were calculated and used to represent the variation in annual vegetation. These indices included the mean (NDVI_mean) and coefficient of variation (NDVI_cv) for the NDVI time series. The temporal statistical features were then integrated with spectral and textural features extracted from high-quality Sentinel-2 imagery for Random Forest classification. The performance and contribution of different combinations were assessed based on their classification accuracies. Our results show that the time-series statistical analysis is an effective way to represent land cover category information contained in annual NDVI variance. The method uses clear pixels from dense low-quality images to obtain the NDVI statistical characteristics, thus, to reduce the influence of random factors such as weather conditions on single-date image. The addition of NDVI_mean and NDVI_cv can improve the separability among most types of land cover. The overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient reached values of 0.8913 and 0.8514 when NDVI_mean and NDVI_cv were integrated. Furthermore, the time-series statistical analysis has less stringent requirements regarding image quality and features a high computational efficiency, which shows its great potential to improve the overall accuracy of land cover classification at regional scales in cloud-prone tropical regions.

TI  - Quantitative monitoring in oil spill incidents based on GF-1 satellite: Qingdao oil spill accident case
T2  - Marine Science Bulletin (Beijing)
M3  - Article
AB  - By utilizing GF-1 satellite data, the Qingdao oil spill accident caused by the explosion of the Huangwei oil pipeline in Qingdao on 22 November, 2013 is studied. The extraction of the oil spill information from the sea surface based on GF-1 satellite data on 26 November, 2013 is the first step, which was estimated to cover an area of 0.67 square kilometers. Then, combining with the single-band inversion model of oil film thickness proposed by Xiao Jianwei, the oil film thickness was calculated. It is estimated that the overflow was roughly 0.28 ton. Both the reflectivity of Band 1 and the results of the oil film thickness were applied to a classification of the degree of oil spill pollution based on gray scale segmentation, which could be distinguished into six classes. No significant differences between these two results are found. Therefore, the oil spill pollution can be effectively graded by using the reflectivity to directly divide the oil spill pollution based on gray scale segmentation.

TI  - TO THE VICTORS GO THE EXISTENTIAL SPOILS: THE MENTAL-HEALTH BENEFITS OF CULTURAL WORLDVIEW DEFENSE FOR PEOPLE WHO SUCCESSFULLY MEET CULTURAL STANDARDS AND VALUED GOALS
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Research in support of terror management theory suggests that mortality concerns will activate symbolic defenses associated with cultural worldviews, and when these defenses are activated, mental health will benefit. However, no study to date has examined this process in full. We filled this gap, while testing the moderating effect of feeling successful vis-a-vis cultural value-standards. Method: In two studies, we hypothesized that participants who feel successful at meeting cultural standards would engage cultural worldview defense (WVD) following mortality salience (MS), and as a consequence of their defensiveness, would experience greater mental health. Results: In Study 1, MS increased pro-American WVD only among relatively wealthy participants, which in turn reduced death-thought accessibility. In Study 2, MS increased pro-American WVD only among participants primed with felt success (vs. failure), which in turn reduced anxiety and depression. Conclusions: Culture can relieve death-related distress and promote mental health to the extent that it provides feelings of success.

TI  - Intensified Management of Coffee Forest in Southwest Ethiopia Detected by Landsat Imagery
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The high forests in southwest Ethiopia, some of the last remaining Afromontane forests in the country, are home to significant forest coffee production. While considered as beneficial in maintaining forests, there have been growing concerns about the degradation caused by intensive management for coffee production in these forests. However, no suitable methods have been developed to map the coffee forests. In this study, we developed a tie-point approach to consistently estimate the degree of degradation caused by intensive management by combining use of Landsat imagery with in-situ canopy cover and tree survey data. Our results demonstrate a clear distinction between undisturbed natural forest and heavily managed coffee forest due to changes in forest structure and canopy cover caused by intensive management in the coffee forest. Temporal analysis of 32 years of Landsat imagery reveals a progressive and significant transition in the level of degradation in the coffee forest over this period. This is the first time to our knowledge, that this progressive intensification of coffee forest has been measured. There is a major intensification in the mid-1990s, which follows the introduction of new liberal economic policies by the Federal government established in 1991, rising coffee prices, and changes in state control over access to the forest. The question remains as to how these 20 years of intensive management in coffee forest have affected forest biodiversity and, more importantly, how canopy trees in this forest can be regenerated in the future. This study provides potential satellite-based mapping and ground-based photography and tree survey methods to help investigate the impacts of intensive management within coffee forest on biodiversity and regeneration.

M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, DEMs (Digital elevation model) based on LIDAR, TanDEM-X and UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) are used to analyze topographic change of Gomso tidal flat during a few years. DEM from LIDAR data was observed at 2011 by KHOA (Korean hydrographic and oceanographic agency) and DEM based on TanDEM-X data was generated at Lee and Ryu (2017). UAV data was observed at KM and KH area of Gomso tidal flat. KM area was surveyed at MAY and AUG 2019, and KH area was surveyed at APR 2018 and MAY 2019. During research period, 2011 to AUG 2019, elevation of KM area is decreased 0.24 m in average, and Chenier is retreat to landward about 130 m. In KH area, elevation is increased 0.16 m in average during research period, 2011 to MAY 2019. It is expected that multi-platform remotely sensed data can help to study accurate topographic change of tidal flat.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous studies showed that water column correction in habitat benthic mapping using remote sensing data can increase the accuracy of the information produced. This study aims to look at the distribution of seagrasses with and without water column correction using object-based classification (OBIA) on the Pajanekang Island. Field data on the distribution of seagrass and non-seagrass of a total of 347 points were taken in July-August 2018 with a transect 1x1 m(2). The satellite data used was SPOT-7 imagery acquired on March 27, 2017, with a spatial resolution of 6x6 m(2). Within the OBIA classification method, we used several algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Decision Tree (DT) to map benthic and seagrass habitats. The results showed that the treatment of with and without water column correction in mapping benthic and seagrass ecosystem habitats using several classification algorithms produced no significant difference in the accuracy of classification image product. However, from the four algorithms used, the Bayes algorithm without water column correction produced the highest accuracy value for benthic habitat mapping of 70.36% and seagrass habitat of 66.47%. The results showed that water column correction did not provide better results in the classification of benthic and seagrass habitats of digital satellite imagery than that of without water column correction.

T2  - TEMA-JOURNAL OF LAND USE MOBILITY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Development of the margin of metropolitan cities is always challenging with regard to the continuous urbanization. The forecast of future changes in the rural landscape is one of the most important issues to be considered in the process of sustainable rural development. The apparent characteristics of rural landscape changes are the result of the interaction between several natural and human factors. Landscape analysis, as well as the identification of best management strategies, can be improved when the useful information on its changes is available over a wide period of time to assess the impact of the changes it has existed. In this study, we tried to extract the changes in the selected villages of the Ardabil metropolitan area by using Landsat-7 and Sentinel-2 images. This study was conducted using supervised classification methods and the best method was chosen based on the overall accuracy 98.91, and high Kappa coefficient 0.96. The results showed that the changes area of settlement area in a village from 2000, as compared to 2018, is about approximately 5.1 km(2). Worth noting that, in this study, by increasing the efficiency of the classification of satellite images of Sentinel-2 comparison with Landsat-7, the accuracy of classification has also improved.

TI  - Predation Pressure in Tea (<i>Camellia sinensis</i>) Plantations in Southeastern China Measured by the Sentinel Prey Method
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tea (Camellia sinensis) is an important food product with thousands of years of human use. Being a non-washable food, no pesticide residues are allowed, which increases the importance of natural means of plant protection. Predation, a component of natural pest control, is an important contributor to this, but its level and sustainability are not known in most of the areas of tea production. We quantified predation intensity using the artificial sentinel prey method in a tea-growing landscape containing remnants of the original forest vegetation in Fujian Province, China. The most common predators were chewing arthropods (49.8% of predation events) and birds (48.1%). Overall, predation rates at the edges of forest fragments (18.9% d(-1)) were lower than either in fragment interiors (25.4%d(-1)) or in the surrounding tea plantations (19.2-24.1%d(-1)). Arthropod predation was higher inside, and at the edge of, forest fragments than within plantations, and generally decreased with increasing distance from a fragment edge, indicating limited spillover of arthropod predators from the native habitat remnants to the cultivated matrix at the local scale. Bird predation, though, showed a different trend: it was lower on the inside of forest fragments than in the tea planation, and bird attack rates increased at increasing distances (up to 40 m) from the forest fragment edge. We also found a reciprocal relationship between attack rates by birds and arthropods, suggesting intra-guild predation. Measures protecting arthropod natural enemies could increase the combined pest suppression effect, contributing to pesticide-free tea production in China.

TI  - Automated Inundation Mapping Over Large Areas Using Landsat Data and Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate inundation maps for flooded wetlands and rivers are a critical resource for their management and conservation. In this paper, we automate a method (thresholding of the short-wave infrared band) for classifying peak inundation in the Okavango Delta, northern Botswana, using Landsat imagery and Google Earth Engine. Inundation classification in the Okavango Delta is complex owing to the spectral overlap between inundated areas covered with aquatic vegetation and dryland vegetation classes on satellite imagery, and classifications have predominately been implemented on broad spatial resolution imagery. We present the longest time series to date (1990-2019) of inundation maps for the peak flood season at a high spatial resolution (30 m) for the Okavango Delta. We validated the maps using image-based and in situ data accuracy assessments, with overall accuracy ranging from 91.5% to 98.1%. Use of Landsat imagery resulted in consistently lower (on average, 692 km(2)) estimates of inundation extent than previous studies that used Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (NOAA AVHRR) imagery, likely owing to the increased number of mixed pixels that occur when using broad spatial resolution imagery, which can lead to overestimations of the size of inundated areas. We provide the inundation maps and Google Earth Engine code for public use. This classification method can likely be adapted for inundation mapping in other regions.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Fights Crime and Terrorism at a New Level
T2  - IEEE MULTIMEDIA
M3  - Article
AB  - High expansion of urban population and infrastructure complemented by recent geopolitical world events, triggered an increasingly alarming number of threats. Law enforcement authorities are now challenged to redesign societal security concepts. Although current technological advances eased the information access, e.g., via video surveillance cameras, satellite data, drones, wearables, manual analysis of such big and diverse data to extract strategic knowledge is not a solution anymore. There is the critical need for automatic solutions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the breakthrough of deep neural networks opened a new perspective for providing such solutions with a human-grade accuracy. Here, we provide a snapshot of our AI research for counter terrorism on automatic person and object identification, retrieval of speech intelligence, and dissimulated behavior analysis. The research was carried out during the UEFISCDI SPIA-VA research project at CAMPUS Research Center, University "Politehnica" of Bucharest, with the participation of UTI Grup and of the Military Equipment and Technologies Research Agency (ACTTM), having as public beneficiary the Protection Guard Service, Romania (SPP).

TI  - The prognostic value of tumor mitotic rate in children and adolescents with cutaneous melanoma: A retrospective cohort study
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Mitotic rate is a strong predictor of outcome in adult patients with primary cutaneous melanoma, but for children and adolescent patients this is unknown.Objective: We sought to assess the prognostic value of primary tumor mitotic rate in children and adolescents with primary melanoma.Methods: This was a cohort study of 156 patients who were <20 years of age and who had clinically localized cutaneous melanoma. Patients <12 years of age were classified as children and those 12 to 19 years of age as adolescents. Clinicopathologic and outcome data were collected. Recurrence-free and melanoma-specific survival were calculated. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazard models.Results: Thirteen of 156 patients (8%) were children. The mitotic rate was >= 1/mm(2) in 104 patients (67%) and correlated with increasing Breslow thickness. A positive sentinel node was found in 23 of 61 patients (38%) in whom a sentinel lymph node biopsy specimen was obtained. The median follow-up was 61 months. Five-year melanoma-specific and recurrence-free survival rates were 91% and 84%, respectively. Mitotic rate was a stronger predictor of outcome than tumor thickness and was the only factor independently associated with recurrence-free survival.Limitations: This research was conducted at a single institution and the sample size was small.Conclusion: Mitotic rate is an independent predictor of recurrence-free survival in children and adolescents with clinically localized melanoma.

TI  - Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping and Vessel Wall Imaging as Screening Tools to Detect Microbleed in Sentinel Headache
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: MR-quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) can identify microbleeds (MBs) in intracranial aneurysm (IA) wall associated with sentinel headache (SH) preceding subarachnoid hemorrhage. However, its use is limited, due to associated skull base bonny and air artifact. MR-vessel wall imaging (VWI) is not limited by such artifact and therefore could be an alternative to QSM. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between QSM and VWI in detecting MBs and to help develop a diagnostic strategy for SH. Methods: We performed a prospective study of subjects with one or more unruptured IAs in our hospital. All subjects underwent evaluation using 3T-MRI for MR angiography (MRA), QSM, and pre- and post-contrast VWI of the IAs. Presence/absence of MBs detected by QSM was correlated with aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) on VWI. Results: A total of 40 subjects harboring 51 unruptured IAs were enrolled in the study. MBs evident on the QSM sequence was detected in 12 (23.5%) IAs of 11 subjects. All these subjects had a history of severe headache suggestive of SH. AWE was detected in 22 (43.1%) IAs. Using positive QSM as a surrogate for MBs, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of AWE on VWI for detecting MBs were 91.7%, 71.8%, 50%, and 96.6%, respectively. Conclusions: Positive QSM findings strongly suggested the presence of MBs with SH, whereas, the lack of AWE on VWI can rule it out with a probability of 96.6%. If proven in a larger cohort, combining QSM and VWI could be an adjunctive tool to help diagnose SH, especially in cases with negative or non-diagnostic CT and lumbar puncture.

TI  - Mineral Oil Slicks Identification Using Dual Co-polarized Radarsat-2 and TerraSAR-X SAR Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study is devoted to a generalization of C-band Radarsat-2 and X-band TerraSAR-X synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data in the form of a diagram serving to easily identify mineral oil slicks (crude oil and emulsions) and separate them from the other oil slicks. The diagram is based on the multi-polarization parameter called Resonant to Non-resonant signal Damping (RND) introduced by Ivonin et al. in 2016, which is related to the ratio between damping within the slick of the short waves and wave breakings. SAR images acquired in the North Sea during oil-on-water exercises in 2011-2012 containing three types of oil spills (crude oil, emulsion, and plant oil) were used. The analysis was performed under moderate sea conditions (wind speeds of 2-6 m/s and sea wave heights of less than 2 m), the incidence angles of 27 degrees-49 degrees, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of -3 to 11 dB within slicks. On the diagram plane, created by the RND parameter and the Bragg wave number, the mineral oil samples form a well-outlined zone, called a mineral oil zone. For C-band data, the plant oil samples were clearly distinguished from the mineral oils in the diagram. Determination of the confidence level for the detection of mineral oils versus plant oil was proposed using the mineral oil zone boundaries. The mineral oil data with SNR within slicks better than 2 dB lay within this zone with a confidence level better than 65%. The plant oil data with the same SNR lay outside this zone with a confidence level of better than 80%. For mineral oil with SNR of -3 dB, the confidence level is 55%.

TI  - Change detection of glaciers and snow cover and temperature using remote sensing and GIS: A case study of the Upper Indus Basin, Pakistan
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers and snow cover in the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu-Kush (HKH) mountain ranges are expected to decrease, resulting in serious consequences in terms of water availability for downstream population. This study is an attempt to detect temporal trend of snow cover in the Upper Indus Basin (UIB), in northern Pakistan, with respect to temperature change, spatial variation in land surface temperature, and to evaluate the accuracy of Landsat imagery for detecting land surface temperature. Landsat images, acquired for the period 1993 to 2019 and the Normalized Difference Snow Index (NDSI), were used to map the snow cover. Maximum snow cover of about 20,675 km(2) was observed in April 2017 followed by 1996, and 1999, when it was about 18,800 km2; the minimum of about 14,500 km(2) was recorded in April 1993, 2011 and 2018. The results show that there has been a very slight increase in snow cover area with time. The maximum elevation of snow-covered area, extracted from the Digital Elevation Model of Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM DEM) in the study area, is 7889 m while the minimum elevation is 991 m. Freezing temperature occurs above 3000 m elevation, indicating that these areas are covered by snow and glaciers for much of the year. Temperatures, of -20 degrees C to -25 degrees C, were present only at a few places-at the very high elevation of above 6000 m. We found inconsistencies in the Landsat temperature data, which were corrected using in-situ daily temperature data. Validation of Landsat extracted temperatures before and after using the in-situ daily temperature data improved the accuracy and removed the inconsistencies. We recommend use of in-situ diurnal temperature data to correct Landsat extracted temperature data.

TI  - Global Trends in Evapotranspiration Dominated by Increases across Large Cropland Regions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Irrigated croplands require large annual water inputs and are critical to global food production. Actual evapotranspiration (AET) is a main index of water use in croplands, and several remote-sensing products have been developed to quantify AET at the global scale. In this study, we estimate global trends in actual AET, potential ET (PET), and precipitation rate (PP) utilizing the MODIS Evapotranspiration product (2001-2018) within the Google Earth Engine cloud-computing environment. We then introduce a new index based on a combination of AET, PET, and PP estimates-the evapotranspiration warning index (ETWI)-which we use to evaluate the sustainability of observed AET trends. We show that while AET has not considerably changed across global natural lands, it has significantly increased across global croplands (+14% +/- 5%). The average ETWI for global croplands is -0.40 +/- 0.25, which is largely driven by an extreme trend in AET, exceeding both PET and PP trends. Furthermore, the trends in water and energy limited areas demonstrate, on a global scale, while AET and PET do not have significant trends in both water and energy limited areas, the increasing trend of PP in energy-limited areas is more than water-limited areas. Averaging cropland ETWI trends at the country level further revealed nonsustainable trends in cropland water consumptions in Thailand, Brazil, and China. These regions were also found to experiencing some of the largest increases in net primary production (NPP) and solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), suggesting that recent increases in food production may be dependent on unsustainable water inputs. Globally, irrigated maize was found to be associated with nonsustainable AET trends relative to other crop types. We present an online open access application designed to enable near real-time monitoring and improve the understanding of global water consumption and availability.

TI  - A global canopy water content product from AVHRR/Metop
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatially and temporally explicit canopy water content (CWC) data are important for monitoring vegetation status, and constitute essential information for studying ecosystem-climate interactions. Despite many efforts there is currently no operational CWC product available to users. In the context of the Satellite Application Facility for Land Surface Analysis (LSA-SAF), we have developed an algorithm to produce a global dataset of CWC based on data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor on board Meteorological-Operational (MetOp) satellites forming the EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS). CWC reflects the water conditions at the leaf level and information related to canopy structure. An accuracy assessment of the EPS/AVHRR CWC indicated a close agreement with multi-temporal ground data from SMAPVEX16 in Canada and Dahra in Senegal, with RMSE of 0.19 kg m(-2) and 0.078 kg m(-2) respectively. Particularly, when the Normalized Difference Infrared Index (NDII) was included the algorithm was better constrained in semi-arid regions and saturation effects were mitigated in dense canopies. An analysis of spatial scale effects shows the mean bias error in CWC retrievals remains below 0.001 kg m(-2) when spatial resolutions ranging from 20 m to 1 km are considered. The present study further evaluates the consistency of the LSA-SAF product with respect to the Simplified Level 2 Product Prototype Processor (SL2P) product, and demonstrates its applicability at different spatio-temporal resolutions using optical data from MSI/Sentinel-2 and MODIS/Terra & Aqua. Results suggest that the LSA-SAF EPS/AVHRR algorithm is robust, agrees with the CWC dynamics observed in available ground data, and is also applicable to data from other sensors. We conclude that the EPS/AVHRR CWC product is a promising tool for monitoring vegetation water status at regional and global scales.

TI  - Trends and drivers of land surface temperature along the urban-rural gradients in the largest urban agglomeration of China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat magnitude and effects may represent harbingers of future climate change and the urban-rural gradients provide a unique natural laboratory for identifying both problems and solutions to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Here, we explored the trends and driving forces of land surface temperature (LST) along the urban-rural gradients of 26 cities in the largest urban agglomeration of China, the Yangtze River Delta Urban Agglomeration, using MODIS LST data combined with urban intensity, background climate, vegetation greenness, landscape structure, albedo, population and gross domestic product (GDP). We found that LST generally increased with increasing urban intensity along the urban-rural gradients while with large diurnal and seasonal variability. Large variability also existed between the maximum and minimum LST within the same urban intensity (e.g., 6.4 degrees C), suggesting cities themselves provide ready-made solutions (minimum) to resolving heat island problems. However, the range of LST within the same intensity decreased with the urban intensity and narrowed drastically when the intensity reached certain thresholds (e.g., 58-87% varying with season, time of day, and city), implying that the space for climate mitigation is very limited once the urbanization intensity exceeds critical thresholds. The roles of landscape structure (composition and configuration) for greenspace and urban land have become increasingly important in driving the variation of LST with increasing urban intensity from low (20%-30%), middle (45%-55%) to high (70%80%), clearly indicating that subtle urban landscape designing, such as less aggregated urban configuration and more irregular greenspace shape are effective strategies to mitigate climate change in highly urbanized areas and cities themselves already provide such vivid demonstrations for us to find and learn.

TI  - Stratification-Based Forest Aboveground Biomass Estimation in a Subtropical Region Using Airborne Lidar Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Species-rich subtropical forests have high carbon sequestration capacity and play important roles in regional and global carbon regulation and climate changes. A timely investigation of the spatial distribution characteristics of subtropical forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is essential to assess forest carbon stocks. Lidar (light detection and ranging) is regarded as the most reliable data source for accurate estimation of forest AGB. However, previous studies that have used lidar data have often beenbased on a single model developed from the relationships between lidar-derived variables and AGB, ignoring the variability of this relationship in different forest types. Although stratification of forest types has been proven to be effective for improving AGB estimation, how to stratify forest types and how many strata to use are still unclear. This research aims to improve forest AGB estimation through exploring suitable stratification approaches based on lidar and field survey data. Different stratification schemes including non-stratification and stratifications based on forest types and forest stand structures were examined. The AGB estimation models were developed using linear regression (LR) and random forest (RF) approaches. The results indicate the following: (1) Proper stratifications improved AGB estimation and reduced the effect of under- and overestimation problems; (2) the finer forest type strata generated higher accuracy of AGB estimation but required many more sample plots, which were often unavailable; (3) AGB estimation based on stratification of forest stand structures was similar to that based on five forest types, implying that proper stratification reduces the number of sample plots needed; (4) the optimal AGB estimation model and stratification scheme varied, depending on forest types; and (5) the RF algorithm provided better AGB estimation for non-stratification than the LR algorithm, but the LR approach provided better estimation with stratification. Results from this research provide new insights on how to properly conduct forest stratification for AGB estimation modeling, which is especially valuable in tropical and subtropical regions with complex forest types.

TI  - Prediction score model for non-sentinel and four or more nodal metastases using a combined method of one-step nucleic acid amplification and histology in sentinel node-positive breast cancer patients
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: ALN dissection (ALND) is the only way to obtain information on ALN metastasis status accurately when sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis is present. In this study, we established a model for intraoperatively predicting non-SLN metastasis and the presence of four or more ALNs (pN2), based on the combined use of one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) and histological examination following SLN biopsy.Materials and methods: Subjects comprised 318 consecutive breast cancer patients (cTis-3, N0) who underwent SLN biopsy with a combination of OSNA and histological examination, and who were found to have SLN metastasis and were treated by ALND. We allotted points to each patient according to their SLN metastasis status as defined by both OSNA and histology, then defined the "National Cancer Center sentinel lymph node metastatic score" (NCS score) based on the total points. Correlations between the NCS score and both non-SLN metastasis and pN2 status were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. The accuracy of this score was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis.Results: The NCS score was significantly correlated with both non-SLN metastasis and pN2 status (adjusted odds ratio: 1.26 for non-SLN metastasis, 1.56 for pN2 status). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the NCS score demonstrated 0.74 for non-SLN metastasis, 0.91 for pN2 status.Conclusions: The NCS score was a strong independent predictor of non-SLN metastasis and pN2 status. Use of this score will facilitate the selection of optimal adjuvant therapies without requiring unnecessary ALND. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Estimating Tropical Cyclone Intensity in the South China Sea Using the XGBoost Model and FengYun Satellite Images
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Conventional numerical methods have made significant advances in forecasting tropical cyclone (TC) tracks, using remote sensing data with high spatial and temporal resolutions. However, over the past two decades, no significant improvements have been made with regard to the accuracy of TC intensity prediction, which remains challenging, as the internal convection and formation mechanisms of such storms are not fully understood. This study investigated the relationship between remote sensing data and TC intensity to improve the accuracy of TC intensity prediction. An intensity forecast model for the South China Sea was built using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model and FengYun-2 (FY-2) satellite data, environmental data, and best track datasets from 2006 to 2017. First, correlation analysis algorithms were used to extract the TC regions in which the satellite data were best correlated, with TC intensity at lead times of 6, 12, 18, and 24 h. Then, satellite, best track, and environmental data were used as source data to develop three different XGBoost models for predicting TC intensity: model Al (climatology and persistence predictors + environmental predictors), model A2 (Al + satellite-based predictors extracted as mean values), and model A3 (Al + satellite-based predictors extracted by our method). Finally, we analyzed the impact of the FY-2 satellite data on the accuracy of TC intensity prediction using the forecast skill parameter. The results revealed that the equivalent blackbody temperature (TBB) of the FY-2 data has a strong correlation with TC intensity at 6, 12, 18, and 24 h lead times. The mean absolute error (MAE) of model A3 was reduced by 0.47%, 1.79%, 1.91%, and 5.04% in 6, 12, 18, and 24 h forecasts, respectively, relative to those of model A2, respectively, and by 2.73%, 7.58%, 7.64%, and 5.04% in 6, 12, 18, and 24 h forecasts, respectively, relative to those of model Al. Furthermore, the accuracy of TC intensity prediction is improved by FY-2 satellite images, and our extraction method was found to significantly improve upon the traditional extraction method.

TI  - Innovative Feasibility Study for the Reclamation of the Cascajo Wetlands in Peru Utilizing Sustainable Technologies
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands are an important feature for our society that provides versatile benefits, such as habitat for diverse wildlife, shoreline erosion protection, flood control, and mitigation of climate change through capture and storage of carbon. The aim of this work was to assess the application of nanotechnologies for the restoration of the water quality in the Cascajo Wetlands, Peru, where the water quality was deteriorated. Ceramic-based bio-filters (CBBFs) were used to reduce and buffer the contamination rates of pollutants, whereas micro-nano bubbles (MNBs) were applied to increase the dissolved oxygen and release free radicals in water. Additionally, bio-fence was implemented to prevent water intrusion from the ocean. Remote sensing data through the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) was used to monitor the water surface condition. With treatment of CBBFs and MNBs for 13 months, we observed reduction in the chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphate (TP) in the water body, showing removal percentages of 98.5%, 97.5%, 98.1%, 98.5%, and 94.6%, respectively, in comparison with values before starting the implementation. The trends of NDVI and EVI over seasons are not completely aligned with the results taken from the wetlands treated with MNBs, CBBFs and bio-fence. While TN was highly correlated with the empirical value of TN based on remote sensing, no correlation was observed between COD and empirical COD. The use of eco-friendly techniques has performed efficiently to remove the pollutant.

T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 2nd National Conference on Sustainable Advanced Technologies for Environmental Management (SATEM)
CL  - Shibpur, INDIA
AB  - The city of Kolkata has happened to grow in an unplanned manner expanding towards the southern and the eastern part. The changing land use pattern of the city was studied using Landsat imageries, which were collected for the year 1987, 1997, 2007 and 2017. A study on the variation in runoff is ideal to understand the effect of urbanization on the environment. This paper attempts to study the effect of the changing land use scenario on the amount of runoff in Kolkata. The multi-temporal images were downloaded from USGS site and verified with topographical maps of scale 1: 50,000 obtained from Survey of India. The runoff curve number is an empirical parameter used for predicting the direct runoff. The widely used NRCS-CN method was used to determine the runoff. Hydrology based mathematical expressions were used for direct conversion from Antecedent Moisture Condition I (dry) to Antecedent Moisture Condition III (wet). The runoff was estimated from the curve number which was determined from land use map of the area over time. It is seen that over the years there has been a considerable change in the land use pattern of the city. The built up area rose to as high as 75% in the year 2017, which in turn raised the volume of runoff from 798387 m(3) in 1997 to 861197 m(3) in 2017.

TI  - Epidemiology and Genetic Variability of Circulating Influenza B Viruses in Uruguay, 2012-2019
T2  - MICROORGANISMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza B viruses (IBV) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality during interpandemic periods in the human population. Two phylogenetically distinct IBV lineages, B/Yamagata and B/Victoria, co-circulate worldwide and they present challenges for vaccine strain selection. Until the present study, there was little information regarding the pattern of the circulating strains of IBV in Uruguay. A subset of positive influenza B samples from influenza-like illness (ILI) outpatients and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) inpatients detected in sentinel hospitals in Uruguay during 2012-2019 were selected. The sequencing of the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes showed substitutions at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis reveals the co-circulation of both lineages in almost all seasonal epidemics in Uruguay, and allows recognizing a lineage-level vaccine mismatch in approximately one-third of the seasons studied. The epidemiological results show that the proportion of IBV found in ILI was significantly higher than the observed in SARI cases across different groups of age (9.7% ILI, 3.2% SARI) and patients between 5-14 years constituted the majority (33%) of all influenza B infection (p < 0.05). Interestingly, we found that individuals >25 years were particularly vulnerable to Yamagata lineage infections.

TI  - Validating the ACOSOG Z0011 Trial Result: A Population-Based Study Using the SEER Database
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Z0011 trial demonstrated that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) could be omitted in spite of 1-2 metastatic sentinel lymph nodes. This study aimed to validate the results on a population-based database. The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was searched for patients comparable to the Z0011 participants. The type of axillary surgery was estimated using the total number of examined axillary lymph nodes (ALNs). Breast cancer-specific mortality (BCSM) was compared between patients with >= 10 ALNs (the sentinel lymph node dissection (SLND) and ALND group, or "SLND + ALND group") and patients with one or two ALNs (the "SLND group"). During 2010-2015, the SEER database included 7077 and 6620 patients categorized in the SLND group and the SLND + ALND group, respectively. Death was observed for 515 patients (7.3%) in the SLND group and 589 patients (8.9%) in the SLND + ALND group based on a median follow-up of 41 months. After propensity-score matching, the adjusted hazard ratio for BCSM in the SLND group (vs. the SLND + ALND group) was 1.038 (95% confidence interval: 0.798-1.350). Regardless of the SLND criteria, the outcomes were not significantly different between the two groups. This retrospective cohort study of Z0011-comparable patients revealed that ALND could be omitted based on the Z0011 strategy, even among patients with <= 2 dissected ALNs.

TI  - Surgery trends for osteonecrosis of the femoral head: a fifteen-year multi-centre study in Japan
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ORTHOPAEDICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The most appropriate procedure and at what type and stage of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) these procedures had been argued. We attempted to clarify the trend in surgical operations with respect to the age of patients, type classification, and stage of ONFH over a period of 15 years by using the multi-center sentinel monitoring system in Japan. Methods We evaluated the hips of 3844 patients using this system in three phases of every five years from 2003 to 2017. We classified the surgical procedures as osteotomy (OT), hemiarthroplasty (Hemi), and total hip arthroplasty (THA). We assessed the trend in age, type classification, and stage of ONFH over three time periods; "early," and the "late." We calculated the proportion of surgeries for ONFH in each period. We used the Cochran-Armitage test to evaluate trends in proportion of two levels of characteristics across three time periods. Results The proportion of younger patients significantly decreased. The proportion of OT and Hemi decreased over time, while the proportion of THA increased. The proportion of patients with types C1 and C2 who underwent OT and Hemi decreased over time. In contrast, that of THA increased. The proportion of patients who underwent OT and Hemi significantly decreased; the proportion of patients who underwent THA significantly increased over time at all stages. Conclusions In Japan, the younger patients underwent surgery for ONFH decreased. The patients who underwent OT and Hemi for ONFH decreased, while that of THA increased over time.

TI  - Site Preparedness and Quality of HIV Sentinel Surveillance at Antenatal Care Clinic Sites in India, 2019
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Quality of HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) depends on preparedness of the site and adherence to the standard operating procedures (SOPs) for HSS. A designated sentinel site is considered prepared for the round of sentinel surveillance based on the availability of infrastructure, human resource, and consumables. Objectives: The study objectives were to describe the site level preparedness and adherence to SOP of antenatal care clinic (ANC) sites during the 16th round of HSS in India. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on the findings of the supervisory visits conducted by public health specialists in ANC sites during the 16th round of HSS from January to March 2019. Semi-structured checklists were used to assess site-preparedness and adherence to the SOP for HSS. All supervisors were expected to upload the filled pro forma to the HSS management information system (MIS). We present here a descriptive analysis of the uploaded visit reports. Results: Of 870 HSS sites, 783 (90%) were visited, and 479 (61.2%) reports were uploaded to MIS. Preround HSS training was not attended by one-fifth (22.6%) of the site in-charges; 35.8% of them had never received any HSS training. SOP was followed at most (94%) of the sites. The most frequently reported problem at the sites was inadequate or delayed availability of consumables. Conclusion: The overall quality of site-level preparedness at antenatal clinic sites in India was good. Attention needs to be given to timely and adequate availability of consumables at sentinel sites along with proper administrative support and preround training of site in-charges.

TI  - Reducing error in small-area estimates of multi-source forest inventory by multi-temporal data fusion
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Since the 1990s, forest resource maps and forest variable estimates for small areas have been produced by combining national forest inventory (NFI) field plot data, optical satellite images and numerical map data. A non-parametric -NN method has frequently been employed. In Finland, such multi-source NFI (MS-NFI) forest variable estimates for municipalities have been produced eight times. A relatively large variation has been observed between subsequent estimates. In this study, a large-scale evaluation of small-area estimates from an MS-NFI conducted in 2013 was carried out in comparison with pure NFI field data-based estimates and error estimates. The proportion of municipalities with significant differences was larger than expected, e.g. over 10% for the mean volume, which indicates systematic error in the small-area estimates. A multi-temporal data fusion combining MS-NFI estimators from three time points-2011, 2013 and 2015-was tested as a means to improve single time point MS-NFI estimates of the mean volumes of growing stock and of tree species groups. A generalized least squares (GLS) technique and unweighted averaging were tested. The improvement was small but consistent when validated against the NFI field data-based estimates for the municipalities. The unweighted averaging worked nearly as well as a GLS estimator.

TI  - Unsupervised linear contact distributions segmentation algorithm for land cover high resolution panchromatic images
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Automatic segmentation of land use and land cover from high resolution remote sensing imagery has been an essential research area in image processing for the past two decades. Timely and reliable information of land use and land cover is very much essential in administration for proper planning and decision making in various areas like agriculture, urban development, environment protection, etc. In this paper, a new algorithm ULCDSA (Unsupervised Linear Contact Distributions Segmentation Algorithm) is proposed for unsupervised segmentation of high resolution panchromatic data. Texture features extracted with the help of linear contact distributions and mathematical morphology are used in this paper. The proposed method has been implemented and tested on various panchromatic images of N.R.S.C's Cartosat-II data sets, Google earth images and on other aerial images. The results have then been compared with gray scale co-occurrence matrix algorithms and promising results have been obtained.

TI  - Discharge Estimates for Ungauged Rivers Flowing over Complex High-Mountainous Regions based Solely on Remote Sensing-Derived Datasets
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable information about river discharge plays a key role in sustainably managing water resources and better understanding of hydrological systems. Therefore, river discharge estimation using remote sensing techniques is an ongoing research goal, especially in small, headwater catchments which are mostly ungauged due to environmental or financial limitations. Here, a novel method for river discharge estimation based entirely on remote sensing-derived parameters is presented. The model inputs include average river width, estimated from Landsat imagery by using the modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI) approach; average depth and velocity, based on empirical equations with inputs from remote sensing; channel slope from a high resolution shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model (SRTM DEM); and channel roughness coefficient via further analysis and classification of Landsat images with support of previously published values. The discharge of the Lhasa River was then estimated based on these derived parameters and by using either the Manning equation (Model 1) or Bjerklie equation (Model 2). In general, both of the two models tend to overestimate discharge at moderate and high flows, and underestimate discharge at low flows. The overall performances of both models at the Lhasa gauge were satisfactory: comparisons with the observations yielded Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) and R-2 values >= 0.886. Both models also performed well at the upper gauge (Tanggya) of the Lhasa River (NSE >= 0.950) indicating the transferability of the methodology to river cross-sections with different morphologies, thus demonstrating the potential to quantify streamflow entirely from remote sensing data in poorly-gauged or ungauged rivers on the Tibetan Plateau.

TI  - LAND COVER CLASSIFICATION USING VERY HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION REMOTE SENSING DATA AND DEEP LEARNING
T2  - LATVIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS AND TECHNICAL SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper describes the process of training a convolutional neural network to segment land into its labelled land cover types such as grass, water, forest and buildings. This segmentation can promote automated updating of topographical maps since doing this manually is a time-consuming process, which is prone to human error. The aim of the study is to evaluate the application of U-net convolutional neural network for land cover classification using countrywide aerial data. U-net neural network architecture has initially been developed for use in biomedical image segmentation and it is one of the most widely used CNN architectures for image segmentation. Training data have been prepared using colour infrared images of Ventspils town and its digital surface model (DSM). Forest, buildings, water, roads and other land plots have been selected as classes, into which the image has been segmented. As a result, images have been segmented with an overall accuracy of 82.9 % with especially high average accuracy for the forest and water classes.

TI  - Assessment of Landsat-based terricolous macrolichen cover retrieval and change analysis over caribou ranges in northern Canada and Alaska
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terricolous macrolichens are an important food source for caribou (Rangifer tarandus) and can greatly influence their movement, distribution and demography over time. Mapping the spatial distribution and cover of macrolichens with remote sensing can serve as an important approach for assessing the impact of disturbances (e.g. fire, grazing, trampling) on lichen cover at the landscape scale and for monitoring post-disturbance rates of recovery. Previous remote sensing-based efforts to retrieve the distribution and abundance of lichen have been restricted to particular regions and thus are not indicative of the potential for large extent mapping and monitoring. In this study, we assessed the effectiveness of machine learning methods for retrieving lichen cover and change across different regions in northern Canada and Alaska using Landsat-5 images, topographic and climate data. Global and regional-scale models were evaluated to assess whether regionally specific analyses would improve performance. Of the models tested, the deep neural network was the most accurate for predicting lichen cover (model efficiency (ME) = 0.58, mean absolute error (MAE) < 7%). For the regional analysis, the performance was the best in north-central Canada (ME = 0.56, MAE = 8%) and the worst in north-eastern Canada (ME = 0.22, MAE < 4%) due to lower lichen cover, more exposed ground, and reduced sample quality and distribution. Analysis of trend-based change detection from 1984 to 2011 in the three regional test areas showed the expected directional response with declining lichen cover in north-western Canada in response to climate-induced shrub expansion, slow recovery to wildfire in north-central Canada, and declining lichen cover in north-eastern Canada related to caribou foraging/trampling and shrub expansion.

M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Axillary lymph node dissection for staging of axilla in early breast cancer is associated with morbidity like painful arm, stiffness of shoulder joint and odema of the arm. Sentinel lymph node biopsy selectively removes the first node draining from the primary tumour. Axillary lymph node involvement is a very good prognostic indicator in breast cancer. Unnecessary axillary dissection in these patients can avoid these complications by doing sentinel lymph node biopsy.Aim: To find out the accuracy and complications in sentinel lymph node biopsy by using methylene blue dye in early breast cancer.Methods: Study design: case series conducted from April 2018 to August 2019 at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital Lahore. Sampling technique used was purposive simple random technique. Sample size was 54 patients with diagnosis of breast carcinoma were selected having impalpable axillary nodes on clinical examination. Sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed by using 1% Methylene blue dye subcutaneously at 12 o clock or 6 O clock position. Small separate skin crease incision was given in axilla in case of breast conservative surgery or in modified radical mastectomy same incision was used.Results: Mean age of the patients was 47 years SD 10.3+-. Most of the patients were married 94.5 % and only 5.5% were unmarried. It was stage I in 35 % and stage II in 64%. Breast conservative surgery was performed in 72% and modified radical mastectomy in 27% patients. Sentinel lymph nodes were stained in 96% cases.Metastasis were found in 31%cases and no metastasis in 64% nodes only in 0.03% cases nodes were not stained. Accuracy of SLNB with methylene blue dye was determined after final histopathological report showing same status of axilla in 96% cases. Complications with sentinel lymph node biopsy were seen only in 0.09%cases which were minor.Conclusion: Sentinel lymph node biopsy technique by using methylene blue dye can safely be done in patients with early breast carcinoma having impalpable nodes. Unnecessary axillary dissection can be avoided in these patients which is associated with postoperative morbidity.

TI  - Deep Learning Based Floating Macroalgae Classification Using Gaofen-1 WFV Images
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Every year, the floating macroalgae, green and golden tide, are massively detected at the Yellow Sea and East China Sea. After influx of them to the aquaculture facility or beach, it occurs enormous economic losses to remove them. Currently, remote sensing is used effectively to detect the floating macroalgae flowed into the coast. But it has difficulties to detect the floating macroalgae exactly because of the wavelength overlapped with other targets in the ocean. Also, it is difficult to distinguish between green and golden tide because they have similar spectral characteristics. Therefore, we tried to distinguish between green and golden tide applying the Deep learning method to the satellite images. To determine the network, the optimal training conditions were searched to train the AlexNet. Also, Gaofen1 WFV images were used as a dataset to train and validate the network. Under these conditions, the network was determined after training, and used to confirm the test data. As a result, the accuracy of test data is 88.89%, and it can be possible to distinguish between green and golden tide with precision of 66.67% and 100%, respectively. It is interpreted that the AlexNet can be pick up on the subtle differences between green and golden tide. Through this study, it is expected that the green and golden tide can be effectively classified from various objects in the ocean and distinguished each other.

TI  - Simulation Approach for the Tracing the Marine Pollution Using Multi-Remote Sensing Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal monitoring using multiple platforms/sensors is a very important tools for accurately understanding the changes in offshore marine environment and disaster with high temporal and spatial resolutions. However, integrated observation studies using multiple platforms and sensors are insufficient, and none of them have been evaluated for efficiency and limitation of convergence. In this study, we aimed to suggest an integrated observation method with multi-remote sensing platform and sensors, and to diagnose the utility and limitation. Integrated in situ surveys were conducted using Rhodamine WT fluorescent dye to simulate various marine disasters. In September 2019, the distribution and movement of RWT dye patches were detected using satellite (Kompsat-2/3/3A, Landsat-8 OLI, Sentinel-3 OLCI and GOCI), unmanned aircraft (Mavic 2 pro and Inspire 2), and manned aircraft platforms after injecting fluorescent dye into the waters of the South Sea-Yeosu Sea. The initial patch size of the RWT dye was 2,600 m(2) and spread to 62,000 m(2) about 138 minutes later. The RWT patches gradually moved southwestward from the point where they were first released, similar to the pattern of tidal current flowing southwest as the tides gradually decreased. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) image showed highest resolution in terms of spatial and time resolution, but the coverage area was the narrowest. In the case of satellite images, the coverage area was wide, but there were some limitations compared to other platforms in terms of operability due to the long cycle of revisiting. For Sentinel-3 OLCI and GOCI, the spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were the highest, but small fluorescent dye detection was limited in terms of spatial resolution. In the case of hyperspectral sensor mounted on manned aircraft, the spectral resolution was the highest, but this was also somewhat limited in terms of operability. From this simulation approach, multi-platform integrated observation was able to confirm that time, space and spectral resolution could be significantly improved. In the future, if this study results are linked to coastal numerical models, it will be possible to predict the transport and diffusion of contaminants, and it is expected that it can contribute to improving model accuracy by using them as input and verification data of the numerical models.

TI  - Processes and challenges for the production of Korean active faults map. Journal of the Geological Society of Korea
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF KOREA
M3  - Article
AB  - As the relationship between earthquakes and active faults is known, the necessity for the Korean active faults map has been raised. Therefore, the government recognized the necessity and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) carried out a research project to produce a Korean active faults map from 2009. Although the project had successfully been finished, it was not enough to get agreement among experts for opening to the public. As a result, a new project was planned to upgrade this map, but the progress was struggled due to the lack of government interest and budget. In 2016, the project has suddenly emerged due to the 2016 Ulsan sea earthquake and Gyeongju earthquake. This project basically adopted advanced research techniques to complete the whole Korean active faults map in four stages for 20 years from 2017 starting from the Gyeongju area. It will investigate potential active faults (Quaternary faults) throughout South Korea and will eventually produce a national active faults map. For effective investigation, the Korea Active Fault Research Group (KAFRG) has been set up with experts from the relevant majors required for active fault research. The research group traces, analyzes, and interprets potential active faults using not only the recent remote sensing data such as airborne-LiDAR, but also geomorphology, paleoseismology, Quaternary age dating and structural geology. The data will be databased and properly serviced to public institutions and to the public on the website. Although there were some hurdles due to the lack of understanding by the government and the public for such a research, the research system is gradually being established. However, the issue of private land permission for excavation survey, the lack of professional manpower, and the tracing of active faults in urban areas remain important tasks to be successfully solved in the future.

TI  - Analysis of the Recent Agricultural Situation of Dakhla Oasis, Egypt, Using Meteorological and Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dakhla Oasis is the most highly populated oasis in Egypt. Although the groundwater resource is very large, there is essentially no rainfall and the aquifer from which the water is drawn is not recharged. Therefore, for the future development and sustainability of Dakhla Oasis, it is important to understand how land and water are used in the oasis and meteorological conditions there. In this study, meteorological and satellite data were used to examine the recent agricultural situation and water use. The results showed that the meteorological conditions are suitable for plant production, and the maximum vegetation index value was comparable to the Nile delta. The cultivated area increased between 2001 and 2019 by 13.8 km(2) year(-1), with most of the increase occurring after the 2011 revolution (21.2 km(2) year(-1)). People living in Dakhla Oasis derive their income primarily from agricultural activity, which requires abundant water. Thus, the increasing demand for water is likely to put pressure on the groundwater resource and limit its sustainability.

TI  - Minimally invasive approaches for early gastric cancer in East Asia: current status and future perspective
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - East Asia is well known as a region with higher incidences of gastric cancer compared with the rest of the world. This region has also experienced a rise in the detection of early gastric cancer (EGC) for the past three decades. The success of nationwide screening programs conducted in Japan or South Korea, increasing public awareness of gastric cancer, improved diagnostic ability of gastroenterologists and the aging population of modern societies may all contribute to the increase in EGC detection rates. Along with the increasing diagnosis of EGC, several key advances in the minimally invasive approach to EGC treatment have been made. Endoscopic resection is an ideal procedure for lesions without lymph node involvement, and its indications have expanded based on the results of prospective studies. Laparoscopic surgery with lymph node dissection has been becoming a standard treatment for EGC patients. Additionally, robot-assisted surgery is penetrating the field of gastric cancer surgery as surgeons pursue a more accurate minimally invasive approach with reduced morbidity rates. However, prolonged operation time and high cost remain problems to be solved for robot-assisted surgery. In this context, function-preserving surgery has become ever more important and should be considered as a method to enhance patients' quality of life after a gastrectomy for EGC. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy or proximal gastrectomy is more frequently employed in East Asia and strategies that employ sentinel node (SN) navigation to personalize function-preserving surgery in clinical practice are emerging as several prospective studies investigate its efficacy.

TI  - Automatic Windthrow Detection Using Very-High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Deep Learning
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Wind disturbances are significant phenomena in forest spatial structure and succession dynamics. They cause changes in biodiversity, impact on forest ecosystems at different spatial scales, and have a strong influence on economics and human beings. The reliable recognition and mapping of windthrow areas are of high importance from the perspective of forest management and nature conservation. Recent research in artificial intelligence and computer vision has demonstrated the incredible potential of neural networks in addressing image classification problems. The most efficient algorithms are based on artificial neural networks of nested and complex architecture (e.g., convolutional neural networks (CNNs)), which are usually referred to by a common term-deep learning. Deep learning provides powerful algorithms for the precise segmentation of remote sensing data. We developed an algorithm based on a U-Net-like CNN, which was trained to recognize windthrow areas in Kunashir Island, Russia. We used satellite imagery of very-high spatial resolution (0.5 m/pixel) as source data. We performed a grid search among 216 parameter combinations defining different U-Net-like architectures. The best parameter combination allowed us to achieve an overall accuracy for recognition of windthrow sites of up to 94% for forested landscapes by coniferous and mixed coniferous forests. We found that the false-positive decisions of our algorithm correspond to either seashore logs, which may look similar to fallen tree trunks, or leafless forest stands. While the former can be rectified by applying a forest mask, the latter requires the usage of additional information, which is not always provided by satellite imagery.

TI  - Feeding regimes modulate biomarkers responsiveness in mussels treated with diclofenac
T2  - MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigated the role of the feeding regime on cellular (lysosomal membrane impairment), oxidative (superoxides and nitric oxides generation, as well as lipid peroxidation) and genotoxic (nuclear abnormalities) biomarkers measured in hemocytes of mussels Mytilus ganoprovincialis treated with diclofenac (DCF). Specifically, unfed mussels, or mussels fed ad libitum with algal species Tisochrysis Iutea or Tetraselmis suecica (Tiso/ DCF- and Tetra/DCF- treated mussels, respectively) were exposed to DCF (20 mu gL(-1)) for 4 days. The results showed that biomarkers' responsiveness against DCF, were more pronounced in unfed and Tetra/DCF-, rather than Tiso/DCF- treated mussel hemocytes, thus revealing food deprivation, changes in mussel feeding/filtration rate and digestion processes, as potent factors of mussels' immune efficiency and response against DCF. Those findings could provide valuable data for the optimization of mussels' feeding regime during laboratory studies, in order to assess reliably the effects of emerging contaminants on non-target sentinel organisms, such as mussels.

TI  - RUSSIAN FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITIES AND THE STRUCTURE OF REGIONAL ECONOMY: THE SUBJECTIVE FOUNDATIONS OF THEIR RELATIONS
T2  - VESTNIK TOMSKOGO GOSUDARSTVENNOGO UNIVERSITETA-FILOSOFIYA-SOTSIOLOGIYA-POLITOLOGIYA-TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY SOCIOLOGY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The article provides a general description of a subjective foundation, which is definitive for relations between flagship universities and the regional economic infrastructure in Russia. Russian flagship universities are a new element in the development of regional innovative processes since they act as a link between higher engineering education, the government, society, and business. The aim of this work is to reveal the subjective foundation within the functional ties of a flagship university. This foundation determines the processes of social diversification, social integration, and social development in a given region. The subject of the study, thus, is highly relevant. At the same time, there have been few publications, which systematically addressed relations between flagship universities and society. The selected methodological basis for the investigation is the theory of post-industrial society. There are three independent thematic units in the article: (1) the description of the general problem of the development of the subjective foundation in the process of the flagship university's operation; (2) the role of scientific knowledge in creating and using current volumes of information; (3) the philosophical and worldview aspects of the development of subjective foundations in modern social practices. After a critical analysis of relevant publications on intersectoral integration, the authors have focused on situations which discuss the activities of small creative teams, consisting of university academics, students, young engineers, and sector specialists, who are capable of (in terms of solving a regional problem) selecting a research strategy independently. It is very important for the participants of such teams to be able to think from the position of advanced rational values of post-classical science. Thus, the complex interaction of multidisciplinary, general scientific, and socio-philosophical components in the relations between a university and its intersectoral environment is a most important functional characteristic of the subjective foundation of a flagship university. In this article, special attention is paid to the problem of balance between scientific knowledge and information, along with the influence of this correlation on the innovative changes in social practices. The methodological criterion of obtaining results is the accepted postulate that modern scientific knowledge is the basis for information production and consumption. The study of modern literature on this issue has allowed the authors to make the following conclusion. First, the most stable properties of the object under investigation at the previous stage of its existence are studied. Then, an innovative supplement is developed to informatively perfect the processes of the complex organization of the system. The three dimensions (the scientific ideas of organization, information and communication technologies, and development mechanisms) are brought together into one intellectual assessment of the result. Special attention is paid to the philosophical and methodological investigations of the subjective foundation of a flagship university in connection with its strengthening influence on the development of quantitative and qualitative parameters of social practices in a specific region. This aspect of the investigation of the functional development of a flagship university is primarily aimed at confirming new rationalistic scientific values.In relation to the process of functioning of the flagship university's subjective foundation, the authors have specified the problem of reaching a unity between inner scientific and sociocultural changes introduced by the post-classical scientific revolution into the region's development. In this part of the article, the authors have come to the conclusion that the development principle of a specific economic region must correspond to a specific philosophical thought, which is determined according to a methodological foundation. The choice of a philosophical and worldview model for the economic development of a specific region requires taking into consideration its historical and economic experience. Acquiring relevant meaning in one or another project in history, economic science is built either on a metaphysical (representative) system, or on a dialectic style of scientific knowledge. For the metaphysical style, the key principles are agnosticism, dualism, and anthropocentrism. Dialectics, on the contrary, understands knowledge acquisition as based on the principle of world unity, a universal connection between all phenomena, and the principle of reflection. Depending on the abilities and level of a university's scholarly team, either of the two philosophical ideas may be used to understand economic development.

TI  - New Downscaling Approach Using ESA CCI SM Products for Obtaining High Resolution Surface Soil Moisture
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - ESA CCI SM products have provided remotely-sensed surface soil moisture (SSM) content with the best spatial and temporal coverage thus far, although its output spatial resolution of 25 km is too coarse for many regional and local applications. The downscaling methodology presented in this paper improves ESA CCI SM spatial resolution to 1 km using two-step approach. The first step is used as a data engineering tool and its output is used as an input for the Random forest model in the second step. In addition to improvements in terms of spatial resolution, the approach also considers the problem of data gaps. The filling of these gaps is the initial step of the procedure, which in the end produces a continuous product in both temporal and spatial domains. The methodology uses combined active and passive ESA CCI SM products in addition to in situ soil moisture observations and the set of auxiliary downscaling predictors. The research tested several variants of Random forest models to determine the best combination of ESA CCI SM products. The conclusion is that synergic use of all ESA CCI SM products together with the auxiliary datasets in the downscaling procedure provides better results than using just one type of ESA CCI SM product alone. The methodology was applied for obtaining SSM maps for the area of California, USA during 2016. The accuracy of tested models was validated using five-fold cross-validation against in situ data and the best variation of model achieved RMSE, R-2 and MAE of 0.0518 m(3)/m(3), 0.7312 and 0.0374 m(3)/m(3), respectively. The methodology proved to be useful for generating high-resolution SSM products, although additional improvements are necessary.

TI  - Anomalous Scaling of the Ion Beam Energy in the Current Sheet
T2  - JETP LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The scaling of the energy of ion beams (beamlets) W-N similar to N-A in the N resonant regions of the current sheet in data from the SC-1 and SC-4 CLUSTER satellites has been analyzed. The case on February 5, 2003, for energy dispersive small-scale substructures, which are signatures of 1-20 keV beamlets in the auroral magnetosphere at geocentric distances (4.5-5.3)R-E, where R-E is the radius of the Earth, has been studied. This case is anomalous, since the energies of beamlets in the resonant regions (seven regions N = 1-7 with resonances R = 1-7 are identified and the region with R = 7 is located in the highest latitude auroral region) do not obey a single scaling law. The exponents A are 0.04 and 0.40 for the regions with resonances R = 1-4 and are 0.83 and 1.14 for the regions with R = 5-7 according to the SC-1 and SC-4 data, respectively. The exponents obtained from the CLUSTER satellite data differ from the theoretically predicted value A = 1.33 [L.M. Zeleny et al., JETP Lett. 85, 187 (2007)]. The beamlet energy scales for the regions with R = 5-7 can be explained by taking into account the electric field E-z perpendicular to the plane of the current sheet. The observed exponents A in the regions N = 1-4 can occur because the spatial decrease in the normal component B-z of the magnetic field, which controls the increment of the energy of ion beams in the current sheet, in these resonant regions is smaller than that in the regions N = 5-7.

TI  - Proposal of Technological GIS Support as Part of Resident Parking in Large Cities-Case Study, City of Brno
T2  - SYMMETRY-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the last few years, there has been a significant increase in people's dependence on passenger and freight transport. As a result, traffic infrastructure is congested, especially in big city centers and, at critical times, this is to the point of traffic collapse. This has led to the need to address this situation by the progressive deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS), which are used to optimize traffic, to increase traffic flow, and to improve transport safety, including reduction of adverse environmental impacts. In 2018, the first results of the C-Roads Platform which is a joint initiative of European Member States and road operators for testing and implementing C-ITS services in light of cross-border harmonization and interoperability (C-ROADS) Czech Republic project were put into operation in Brno, closely related to the international initiative to support the data structure for future communication between vehicles and intelligent transport infrastructure. A system of transport organization and safety was introduced in the city of Brno, which manages key information and ensures central management of partial systems of transport organization and safety. The most important part of this system is the parking organization system discussed in this article. The main objective was to streamline the parking system in the city center of Brno and in the immediate vicinity by preventing unauthorized long-term parking, ensuring an increased number of parking places for residents and visitors by increasing the turnover of parking. The aim of the research was to investigate (i) the possibility and optimal use of Geographic Information System (GIS) technology for resident parking system solutions, (ii) the integration of Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) satellite data and image data collected by cameras on the move and (iii) the possibility of using network algorithms to optimize mobile data collection planning. The aim of our study is to design and optimize the integrated collection of image data localized by satellite GNSS technologies in the GIS environment to support the resident parking system, including an evaluation of its effectiveness. To achieve this goal, a residential parking monitoring system was designed and implemented, based on dynamic monitoring of the parking state using a vehicle equipped with a digital camera system and Global Satellite Navigation Systems (GNSS) technology for measuring the vehicle position, controlled by spatial and attribute data flow from static and dynamic spatial databases in the Geographic Information System (GIS), which integrate the whole monitoring system. The control algorithm of a vehicle passing through the street network works on the basis of graph theory with a defined recurrence interval for the same route, taking into account other parameters such as the throughput of the street network at a given time, its traffic signs and the usual level of traffic density. Statistics after one year of operation show that the proposed system significantly increased the economic yield from parking areas from the original 30% to 90%, and reduced the overall violation of parking rules to only 10%. It further increased turnover and thus the possibility of short-term parking for visitors and also ensured availability of parking for residents in the historical center of Brno and surrounding monitored areas.

TI  - Automated lithological mapping by integrating spectral enhancement techniques and machine learning algorithms using AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data in Gold-bearing granite-greenstone rocks in Hutti, India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we proposed an automated lithological mapping approach by using spectral enhancement techniques and Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) using Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer-Next Generation (AVIRIS-NG) hyperspectral data in the greenstone belt of the Hutti area, India. We integrated spectral enhancement techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) transformation and different MLAs for an accurate mapping of rock types. A conjugate utilization of conventional geological map and spectral enhancement products derived from ASTER data were used for the preparation of a high-resolution reference lithology map. Feature selection and extraction methods were applied on the AVIRIS-NG data to derive different input dataset such as (a) all spectral bands, (b) shortwave infrared bands, (c) Joint Mutual Information Maximization (JMIM) based optimum bands, and (d) optimum bands using PCA, to choose optimum input dataset for automated lithological mapping. The comparative analysis of different MLAs shows that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms other Machine Learning (ML) models. The SVM achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) and Kappa Coefficient (k) of 85.48% and 0.83, respectively, using JMIM based optimum bands. The JMIM based optimum bands were more suitable than other input datasets to classify most of the lithological units (i.e. metabasalt, amphibolite, granite, acidic intrusive and migmatite) within the study area. The sensitivity analysis performed in this study illustrates that the SVM is less sensitive to the number of samples and mislabeling in the model training than other MLAs. The obtained high-resolution classified map with accurate litho-contacts of amphibolite, metabasalt, and granite can be coupled with an alteration map of the area for targeting the potential zone of gold mineralization.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
M3  - Proceedings Paper
CP  - 13th International Conference on Sensing Technology (ICST)
CL  - Macquarie Univ, Sydney, AUSTRALIA
AB  - Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and chlorophyll-a concentration are two critical parameters to monitor water quality. Since directly collecting samples for laboratory analysis can be expensive, this paper presents a methodology to estimate this information through remote sensing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. TSS and chlorophyll-a are optically active components, therefore enabling measurement by remote sensing. Two study cases in distinct water bodies are performed, and those cases use different spatial resolution data from Sentinel-2 spectral images and unmanned aerial vehicles together with laboratory analysis data. In consonance with the methodology, supervised ML algorithms are trained to predict the concentration of TSS and chlorophyll-a. The predictions are evaluated separately in both study areas, where both TSS and chlorophyll-a models achieved R-squared values above 0.8.

TI  - Cellular automata Markov chain model based deforestation modelling in the pastoral and agro-pastoral areas of southern Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Permanent conversion of woodland to large-scale commercial agriculture, pastures or urban areas and temporary or partial removal of indigenous trees for shifting cultivation and selective logging remained major environmental challenges in the tropical region. Cognizant of the environmental changes prevailing in the pastoral and agro-pastoral areas of Southern Ethiopia, we have examined the past conversion of woodland to other land uses through the analysis of Landsat Multi-spectral scanner (MSS) 1973, Thematic Mapper(TM) 1986, Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) 2003, Operational Land Imagery (OLI) 2017 and then projected the future change in land use/cover (LUC) as well. We have employed Cellular Automata Markov chain model to simulate and predict LUC changes between 2017 and 2060. Four spatial driver variables such as distance to road and settlement, slope and elevation were used to run the simulation. Prior to the prediction, we have simulated the LUC of 2017 using transition potential maps of 2003 and transition matrix between 1973 and 2003. The predictive power of the model was then examined by comparing the reference and simulated LUC maps of 2017 and also using the kappa index. A good correlation was obtained between the reference and simulated LUC maps of 2017. In addition, the computed kappa index was above 0.9, which implies that the model is effective in predicting change in LUC. The analysis result revealed that in the entire monitoring period (1973-2017) the area lost 89,875 ha of woodland. The loss is expected to continue during the period 2017-2060, with an estimated loss of 32,423 ha of woodland, if a proper measure is not taken against the continuous loss of woodland. Thus, relentless efforts are needed to rehabilitate the already degraded land and also minimize the potential loss of woodland in the future through the implementation of conservation - livelihood approach, REDD + project, and sustainable land use management strategies.

TI  - Remote sensing of shallow waters - A 50 year retrospective and future directions
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Technical advancements have widened the limits of remote sensing in mapping shallow water benthic habitats and bathymetry over the last decades. On the other hand, the needs of shallow water remote sensing have pushed instrument development. In this manuscript we provide 50-year retrospective of the developments in the field in terms of both instrumentation and methods. We also show that spectral features characteristic of the main benthic groups in shallow water are consistent from the tropics to sub-arctic regions and from salty to freshwaters. The fundamental limiting factor in both benthic mapping and bathymetry is absorption of light by water molecules. However, spectral absorption by water molecules is the key to bathymetry derivation. Variable backscattering by particles and absorption by dissolved organic matter is a confounding factor for all objectives. The combination of using the spectral and textural characteristics of bottom features and our knowledge about these features have now resulted in the ability to map habitats over large coastal systems. This manuscript has shown that optically shallow water remote sensing has reached levels where the satellite derived bathymetry and habitat maps are accepted by different end users (including the International Maritime Organisation) and are routinely used in ecological studies, monitoring and management of coastal environments.

TI  - Very High Density Point Clouds from UAV Laser Scanning for Automatic Tree Stem Detection and Direct Diameter Measurement
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Three-dimensional light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) represent a relatively new type of remotely sensed data. Point cloud density of thousands of points per square meter with survey-grade accuracy makes the UAV laser scanning (ULS) a very suitable tool for detailed mapping of forest environment. We used RIEGL VUX-SYS to scan forest stands of Norway spruce and Scots pine, the two most important economic species of central European forests, and evaluated the suitability of point clouds for individual tree stem detection and stem diameter estimation in a fully automated workflow. We segmented tree stems based on point densities in voxels in subcanopy space and applied three methods of robust circle fitting to fit cross-sections along the stems: (1) Hough transform; (2) random sample consensus (RANSAC); and (3) robust least trimmed squares (RLTS). We detected correctly 99% and 100% of all trees in research plots for spruce and pine, respectively, and were able to estimate diameters for 99% of spruces and 98% of pines with mean bias error of -0.1 cm (-1%) and RMSE of 6.0 cm (19%), using the best performing method, RTLS. Hough transform was not able to fit perimeters in unfiltered and often incomplete point representations of cross-sections. In general, RLTS performed slightly better than RANSAC, having both higher stem detection success rate and lower error in diameter estimation. Better performance of RLTS was more pronounced in complicated situations, such as incomplete and noisy point structures, while for high-quality point representations, RANSAC provided slightly better results.

TI  - Estimation of daytime near-surface air temperature from satellite data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The near-surface air temperature is an important factor affecting everyday life and be used in many environmental applications and climate change research. This study aimed to propose a simple methodology for estimating daytime near-surface air temperature (DNSAT) from satellite data. On the one hand, the split-window technique has been used to extract the surface brightness temperature at ground level (SBTG) from thermal infrared data. In this framework, we have used the data of the two channels IR10.8 and IR12 of the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board the first Meteosat Second Generation satellite (MSG1). On the other hand, a regression-based approach has been used for 5210 samples under clear-sky conditions, in which we found that the relationship between DNSAT and SBTG can be considered as a third order polynomial formula. The comparison between the estimated DNSAT in this work and the in-situ DNSAT showed that the suggested methodology can be used for estimating DNSAT with reasonable accuracy, which can be used for climate research and environmental studies.

TI  - Spatial Distribution of Surface Temperature and Land Cover: A Study Concerning Sardinia, Italy
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a key climate variable that has been studied mainly at the urban scale and in the context of urban heat islands. By analyzing the connection between LST and land cover, this study shows the potential of LST to analyze the relation between urbanization and heating phenomena at the regional level. Land cover data, drawn from Copernicus, and LST, retrieved from Landsat 8 satellite images, are analyzed through a methodology that couples GIS and regression analysis. By looking at the Italian island of Sardinia as a case study, this research shows that urbanization and the spatial dynamics of heating phenomena are closely connected, and that intensively farmed areas behave quite similarly to urban areas, whereas forests are the most effective land covers in mitigating LST, followed by areas covered with Mediterranean shrubs. This leads to key policy recommendations that decision-makers could implement to mitigate LST at the regional scale and that can, in principle, be exported to regions with similar climate and land covers. The significance of this study can be summed up in its novel approach to analyzing the relationship between LST and land covers that uses freely available spatial data and, therefore, can easily be replicated in other regional contexts to derive appropriate policy recommendations.

TI  - Predictors of non-sentinel lymph node metastasis in clinical early stage (cT1-2cN0) breast cancer patients with 1/2 metastatic sentinel lymph nodes
T2  - ASIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the risk factors that caused non-sentinel lymph nodes (nonSLNs) metastasis by considering the clinicopathological characteristics of patients who have 1-2 sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis in the clinical early stage (T1-2, NO) breast cancer.Methods: The demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of the patients were recorded retrospectively. Among these, age, size of the primary breast tumor, tumor localization and multifocality/multicentricity status, preoperative serum Neutrophil/ Lymphocyte rate (NLR), c-erbB2/HER2-neu status, Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) status, primary tumor proliferation index (Ki-67), histopathological grade, molecular subtypes, histopathological subtypes, nipple/areola infiltration, Lymphatic Invasion (LI), Vascular Invasion (VI), Perineural Invasion (PNI), number of metastatic SLN m(SLN), mSLN diameter, SLN Ex-tranodal Extension (ENE) status, and number of metastatic nonSLNs were recorded.Results: According to the univariate analysis, the HER2 positivity, Ki-67 >=%20, mSLN diameter, LI, VI, PNI, ENE and molecular subtypes were found to be significant. However, the age, tumor localization, multifocality/multicentricity, T stage, ER and PR status, tumor size, histopathological grade and subtypes, nipple/areola infiltration and NLR were not found to be significant. In the multivariate analysis, significant independent predictors in nonSLN metastasis development were found to be HER2 positivity, PNI, mSLN diameter >= 10,5 mm and ENE.Conclusion: The HER2 positivity, ENE, PNI and mSLN diameter >= 10,5 mm were found to be very strong predictors in nonSLN metastasis development. The findings of this study have the potential to be a guideline for surgeons and oncologists when determining their patients' treatment plan. These components are candidates for inclusion among the clinicopathological factors that may be used in the new nomograms due to their higher sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - The Lymphoscintigraphic Study of Unpredictable Head and Neck Cutaneous Melanoma Lymphatic Drainage
T2  - BIOMEDICINES
M3  - Article
AB  - Head and neck cutaneous melanoma (HNCM) does not always follow standard lymphatic drainage; typical expected lymphatic pathways are associated with unexpected ones. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between the primary HNCM sites and all possible lymphatic drainage pathways by lymphoscintigraphy with a special focus on the unexpected sentinel lymph node (SLNs) detection. We retrospectively analyzed 67 patients (46 M, 21 F; mean age 63 years) who underwent lymphoscintigraphy from January 2004 to November 2018. 99mTc-serum albumin was injected intra-dermally at the dose of 18-37 MBq in 0.2-0.4 mL. All patients underwent dynamic and static image acquisition. For all patients, the relation between the expected and unexpected SLNs was performed using the "Sidney Melanoma Unit Database" as our reference. The relation was performed also according to the primary HNCM localization. Cohens' kappa was calculated. In 61/67 (91%) of patients, SLNs were detected only in predictable sites, while in six/67 (9%), unexpected SLNs were revealed. In all patients, the agreement proportion was 91% (95% confidence interval CI 0.8-0.96) and Cohen's K was 0.11 (95% CI 0-0.43). Regarding the primary melanoma sites, the nasolabial field HNCM showed the highest rate of concordance (K = 0.60; 95%, CI 0.32-0.89) while the preauricular region HNCM revealed the highest rate of discordance with the clinically predictable drainage. The HNCM lymphatic drainage is extremely variable in regard to both the sites and the number of involved SLNs. The lymphoscintigraphic study is highly recommended to identify all possible SLNs in order to perform an accurate staging for all patients and to avoid missing unexpected SLNs.

TI  - Comparison of Rainfall Products over Sub-Saharan Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - An ever-increasing number of rainfall estimates is available. They are used in many important applications such as flood/drought monitoring, water management, or climate monitoring. Such data are especially valuable in sub-Saharan Africa, where rainfall has considerable socioeconomic impacts and the gauge and radar networks are sparse. The choice of a rainfall product can significantly influence the performance of such applications. This study reviews previous works, evaluating or comparing rainfall products over different parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Three types of rainfall products are considered: the gauge-only, the satellite-based, and the reanalysis ones. In addition to the global rainfall products, we included three regional ones specifically developed for Africa: the African Rainfall Climatology version 2 (ARC2), the Rainfall Estimate version 2 (RFE2), and the Tropical Applications of Meteorology Using Satellite Data and Ground-Based Observations (TAMSAT) African Rainfall Climatology and Time Series (TARCAT). The gauge density, the orography, and the rainfall regime, which vary with the climate and the season, influence the performance of the rainfall products. This review does not focus on comparing results, as many other publications doing so are already available. Instead, we propose this review as a guide through the different rainfall products available over Africa, and the factors influencing their performances. With this review, the reader can make informed decisions about which products serve their specific purpose best.

TI  - Different Spectral Domain Transformation for Land Cover Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks with Multi-Temporal Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study compares some different types of spectral domain transformations for convolutional neural network (CNN)-based land cover classification. A novel approach was proposed, which transforms one-dimensional (1-D) spectral vectors into two-dimensional (2-D) features: Polygon graph images (CNN-Polygon) and 2-D matrices (CNN-Matrix). The motivations of this study are that (1) the shape of the converted 2-D images is more intuitive for human eyes to interpret when compared to 1-D spectral input; and (2) CNNs are highly specialized and may be able to similarly utilize this information for land cover classification. Four seasonal Landsat 8 images over three study areas-Lake Tapps, Washington, Concord, New Hampshire, USA, and Gwangju, Korea-were used to evaluate the proposed approach for nine land cover classes compared to several other methods: Random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), 1-D CNN, and patch-based CNN. Oversampling and undersampling approaches were conducted to examine the effect of the sample size on the model performance. The CNN-Polygon had better performance than the other methods, with overall accuracies of about 93%-95 % for both Concord and Lake Tapps and 80%-84% for Gwangju. The CNN-Polygon particularly performed well when the training sample size was small, less than 200 per class, while the CNN-Matrix resulted in similar or higher performance as sample sizes became larger. The contributing input variables to the models were carefully analyzed through sensitivity analysis based on occlusion maps and accuracy decreases. Our result showed that a more visually intuitive representation of input features for CNN-based classification models yielded higher performance, especially when the training sample size was small. This implies that the proposed graph-based CNNs would be useful for land cover classification where reference data are limited.

TI  - Determination of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with Top-of-Canopy (TOC) Reflectance from a KOMPSAT-3A Image Using Orfeo ToolBox (OTB) Extension
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface reflectance data obtained by the absolute atmospheric correction of satellite images are useful for land use applications. For Landsat and Sentinel-2 images, many radiometric processing methods exist, and the images are supported by most types of commercial and open-source software. However, multispectral KOMPSAT-3A images with a resolution of 2.2 m are currently lacking tools or open-source resources for obtaining top-of-canopy (TOC) reflectance data. In this study, an atmospheric correction module for KOMPSAT-3A images was newly implemented into the optical calibration algorithm in the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB), with a sensor model and spectral response data for KOMPSAT-3A. Using this module, named OTB extension for KOMPSAT-3A, experiments on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were conducted based on TOC reflectance data with or without aerosol properties from AERONET. The NDVI results for these atmospherically corrected data were compared with those from the dark object subtraction (DOS) scheme, a relative atmospheric correction method. The NDVI results obtained using TOC reflectance with or without the AERONET data were considerably different from the results obtained from the DOS scheme and the Landsat-8 surface reflectance of the Google Earth Engine (GEE). It was found that the utilization of the aerosol parameter of the AERONET data affects the NDVI results for KOMPSAT-3A images. The TOC reflectance of high-resolution satellite imagery ensures further precise analysis and the detailed interpretation of urban forestry or complex vegetation features.

TI  - Validation of Surface Reflectance Product of KOMPSAT-3A Image Data Using RadCalNet Data
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - KOMPSAT-3A images have been used in various kinds of applications, since its launch in 2015. However, there were limits to scientific analysis and application extensions of these data, such as vegetation index estimation, because no tool was developed to obtain the surface reflectance required for analysis of the actual land environment. The surface reflectance is a product of performing an absolute atmospheric correction or calibration. The objective of this study is to quantitatively verify the accuracy of top-of-atmosphere reflectance and surface reflectance of KOMPSAT-3A images produced from the OTB open-source extension program, performing the cross-validation with those provided by a site measurement data of RadCalNet, an international Calibration/Validation (Cal/Val) portal. Besides, surface reflectance was obtained from Landsat-8 OLI images in the same site and applied together to the cross-validation process. According to the experiment, it is proven that the top-of-atmosphere reflectance of KOMPSAT-3A images differs by up to +/- 0.02 in the range of 0.00 to 1.00 compared to the mean value of the RadCalNet data corresponding to the same spectral band. Surface reflectance in KOMPSAT-3A images also showed a high degree of consistency with RadCalNet data representing the difference of 0.02 to 0.04. These results are expected to be applicable to generate the value-added products of KOMPSAT-3A images as analysis ready data (ARD). The tools applied in this study and the research scheme can be extended as the new implementation of each sensor model to new types of multispectral images of compact advanced satellites (CAS) for land, agriculture, and forestry and the verification method, respectively.

TI  - Baloxavir treatment of ferrets infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus reduces onward transmission
T2  - PLOS PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Influenza viruses cause seasonal outbreaks and pose a continuous pandemic threat. Although vaccines are available for influenza control, their efficacy varies each season and a vaccine for a novel pandemic virus manufactured using current technology will not be available fast enough to mitigate the effect of the first pandemic wave. Antivirals can be effective against many different influenza viruses but have not thus far been used extensively for outbreak control. Baloxavir, a recently licensed antiviral drug that targets the influenza virus endonuclease, has been shown to reduce virus shedding more effectively than oseltamivir, a widely used neuraminidase inhibitor drug. Thus it is possible that treatment with baloxavir might also interrupt onward virus transmission. To test this, we utilized the ferret model, which is the most commonly used animal model to study influenza virus transmission. We established a subcutaneous baloxavir administration method in ferrets which achieved similar pharmacokinetics to the approved human oral dose. Transmission studies were then conducted in two different locations with different experimental setups to compare the onward transmission of A(H1N1)pdm09 virus from infected ferrets treated with baloxavir, oseltamivir or placebo to naive sentinel ferrets exposed either indirectly in adjacent cages or directly by co-housing. We found that baloxavir treatment reduced infectious viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets compared to placebo, and reduced the frequency of transmission amongst sentinels in both experimental setups, even when treatment was delayed until 2 days post-infection. In contrast, oseltamivir treatment did not substantially affect viral shedding or transmission compared to placebo. We did not detect the emergence of baloxavir-resistant variants in treated animals or in untreated sentinels. Our results support the concept that antivirals which decrease viral shedding could also reduce influenza transmission in the community.Author summaryDuring seasonal influenza outbreaks and global pandemics, influenza can cause significant morbidity and mortality and spread rapidly. Influenza viruses constantly change, and the effectiveness of vaccination can be low if the match between the vaccine and circulating viruses is poor. However, antiviral drugs target conserved parts of the virus and therefore typically remain effective against new seasonal or pandemic strains of influenza. The new antiviral baloxavir is more effective than existing drugs, such as oseltamivir, in reducing the amount of virus particles produced by infected people, suggesting it might reduce the onward spread of influenza viruses to others. To test this, we developed an effective way to deliver baloxavir to ferrets, the best available animal model of influenza virus transmission. We then treated influenza-infected ferrets with baloxavir to determine if they were less likely to pass their virus onto healthy ferrets housed in the same cage, or in the adjacent cage. In both cases, we found that compared to oseltamivir or placebo treatment, infected ferrets treated with baloxavir produced fewer virus particles and were less likely to transmit virus to healthy ferrets. Our results suggest baloxavir can contribute to the early control of influenza outbreaks by limiting community-based viral spread.

TI  - Groundwater Potential Mapping Using Remote Sensing and GIS-Based Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Adequate groundwater development for the rural population is essential because groundwater is an important source of drinking water and agricultural water. In this study, ensemble models of decision tree-based machine learning algorithms were used with geographic information system (GIS) to map and test groundwater yield potential in Yangpyeong-gun, South Korea. Groundwater control factors derived from remote sensing data were used for mapping, including nine topographic factors, two hydrological factors, forest type, soil material, land use, and two geological factors. A total of 53 well locations with both specific capacity (SPC) data and transmissivity (T) data were selected and randomly divided into two classes for model training (70%) and testing (30%). First, the frequency ratio (FR) was calculated for SPC and T, and then the boosted classification tree (BCT) method of the machine learning model was applied. In addition, an ensemble model, FR-BCT, was applied to generate and compare groundwater potential maps. Model performance was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method. To test the model, the area under the ROC curve was calculated; the curve for the predicted dataset of SPC showed values of 80.48% and 87.75% for the BCT and FR-BCT models, respectively. The accuracy rates from T were 72.27% and 81.49% for the BCT and FR-BCT models, respectively. Both the BCT and FR-BCT models measured the contributions of individual groundwater control factors, which showed that soil was the most influential factor. The machine learning techniques used in this study showed effective modeling of groundwater potential in areas where data are relatively scarce. The results of this study may be used for sustainable development of groundwater resources by identifying areas of high groundwater potential.

TI  - Analysis of the Multipath Scattering Effects in High-Resolution SAR Images
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to multipath (MP) scattering, many special phenomena and details about the targets in high-resolution synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images are hard to understand. In this letter, a more elaborate improved model combined with the synthetic aperture progress is presented, to analyze the MP scattering. We explore the defocusing and displacement phenomena of MP scattering through signal modeling and time-frequency relationship analysis. The theoretical equations for the displacement of double scattering are derived, and the equation of phase error which causes the defocusing is also given. The SAR raw data simulation of MP scattering and range-Doppler (RD) imaging results validates the correctness of the analysis. From the equations, the effects of MP scattering of different height and different orientation angle in high-resolution SAR images are given. Finally, based on the simulation results, the new interpretation about the relationship between the moustache effect in high-resolution TerraSAR-X SAR images and the height of the structure is obtained.

TI  - Immunohistochemistry for PRAME in the Distinction of Nodal Nevi From Metastatic Melanoma
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SURGICAL PATHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The distinction of metastatic melanoma from melanocytic nevi in lymph nodes can on occasion be difficult. As diffuse immunohistochemical (IHC) PRAME (PReferentially expressed Antigen in MElanoma) expression is detected in the majority of primary and metastatic melanomas, but rarely in nevi, we reasoned that PRAME could be a useful adjunct marker for the diagnosis of melanocytes in lymph nodes. In this study, we examined 45 nodal melanocytic deposits comprising 30 nodal nevi and 15 melanoma metastases. The latter were diagnostically not straightforward because they either coexisted with nodal nevi or were present in perinodal fibrous tissue. All nodal nevi (30/30) were negative for PRAME, whereas all melanoma metastases (15/15) were diffusely positive for PRAME IHC. We additionally report the novel use of a PRAME/Melan A dual-label immunostain. Our results show that PRAME IHC may be useful in the assessment of diagnostically challenging nodal melanocytic deposits, such as intraparenchymal nodal nevi, metastases confined to the capsular fibrous tissue, or in the setting of small metastases coexisting with a nodal nevus in the same lymph node.

TI  - Improving estimation of forest aboveground biomass using Landsat 8 imagery by incorporating forest crown density as a dummy variable
T2  - CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Optical remote sensing data are widely used in estimation of forest aboveground biomass (AGB), and the accuracy of AGE estimations has drawn wide attention. A method to improve the accuracy of remote sensing-based AGB models was developed by combining Landsat 8's Operational Land Imager (OLI) and forest crown density (FCD). Remote sensing-based AGB models with and without an FCD dununy variable were developed using linear regression based on vegetation type (coniferous forest, broadleaf forest, mixed forest, and total vegetation). The differences between the models with and without an FCD dummy variable were analysed and compared. The models involving stratification of vegetation types provided more accurate estimations than the models of total vegetation. The models with an FCD dummy variable performed better than the models without an FCD dummy variable for each vegetation type. In each FCD class, the models with an FCD dummy variable provided more accurate estimations than the models without an FCD dummy variable, and the over- and underestimation problems associated with the models without an FCD dummy variable in thin and dense stands were significantly alleviated by the models with an FCD dummy variable. Therefore, introducing FCD into remote sensing-based AGB models has great potential to improve AGB estimation.

TI  - Retrieval of historical surface displacements of the Baige landslide from time-series SAR observations for retrospective analysis of the collapse event
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Landslides and resultant barrier lakes are significant threats to human lives and infrastructures. Three-dimensional (3D) surface displacements can give vital clues to the exploration of internal structure of landslides, but they are difficult to be retrieved from spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations due to the intrinsic limitation of SAR imaging geometry. Meanwhile, studies on predicting slope failure based on SAR-measured displacements are rarely seen. Here, we used SAR pixel offset tracking to investigate the Baige landslide before the collapse on 10 October 2018. 3D surface displacements retrieved by combining satellite SAR and optical observations revealed heterogeneous spatial patterns within the landslide complex. We observed linear secondary creep and accelerating tertiary creep prior to the failure from multi-sensor SAR data. The possibility of forecasting the failure was demonstrated by applying an inverse velocity method to the time-series displacements measured by Sentinel-1 during the tertiary creep, which is valuable for risk evaluation and disaster early warning.

TI  - Gap-Filling of a MODIS Normalized Difference Snow Index Product Based on the Similar Pixel Selecting Algorithm: A Case Study on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Cloud contamination has largely limited the application of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer(MODIS) normalized difference snow index (NDSI). Here, a novel gap-filling method based on spatial-temporal similar pixel interpolation was proposed to remove cloud occlusions in MODIS NDSI products. First, the widely used Terra and Aqua combination and three-day temporal filter methods were applied. The remaining missing NDSI information was estimated by using similar eligible pixels in the remaining cloud-free portion of a target image through a spatial-temporal similar pixel selecting algorithm (SPSA). The MODIS daily NDSI product data from 2003 to 2018 in the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (China) was used as a case study. The results demonstrate that the three-step methodology can generate almost completely cloud-free, daily MODIS NDSI images, reducing the cloud-gap fraction from >45% to less than 1.5% on average. The validation results of the SPSA method exhibited a high accuracy, with a high R-2 exceeding 0.78, a low mean absolute error of 2.77%, a root mean square error of 3.78%, and a 96.92% overall accuracy. The proposed method can fill cloud gaps without a significant loss of accuracy, especially during snow cover transition periods (autumn and spring), which may provide more accurate cloud-free NDSI data for climate change and energy balance studies.

TI  - Characterizing the 3D hydrogeological structure of a debris landslide using the transient electromagnetic method
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Debris landslides are one of the most common types of landslides in the Wenchuan earthquake area. The characteristics of the hydrogeological structure are the basis for landslide stability evaluation and protection treatment. The preferred seepage paths developed in debris landslides control the flow of groundwater and have a direct impact on the soil instability and sliding surface instability.There fore, it is particularly important to understand the groundwater seepage system. Recently, many joint geophysical surveys have been used to detect the hydrogeological structure of landslides. However, these joint surveys aim to detect structures on a large scale and do not focus on the seepage path systems in debris landslides. It is difficult to detect the 3D structure of the seepage path system in detail, taking into account the portability, penetration, and resolution while meeting the practical needs of landslide prevention. To date, no one method has been identified as the best detection method for characterizing complex 3D hydrogeological structures. To reveal the complex seepage paths efficiently, we investigated a debris landslide in Xishan village, Sichuan Province, China, by using the transient electromagnetic method (TEM), which is a fast and portable method. Additionally, we proposed an effective quasi-3D inversion strategy with kdTree to determine the geoelectric structure and to make a geological interpretation. The interpretation was verified with field engineering surveys, other geophysical surveys, and remote sensing data. The results suggest that the complex 3D structure in this debris landslide is characterized by a dendritic pipe network-like seepage drainage system. In addition, this work assessed the ability to detect different parts of the landslide based on the given resolution. Furthermore, the resolution and detection efficiency of the TEM were compared with those of other geophysical methods. The assessment and comparison demonstrated that the TEM can be used as the main survey method to fulfill the real-world demands of detecting seepage path systems in a debris landslide.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Evolution and Analysis of the Driving Force of Oil Palm Patterns in Malaysia from 2000 to 2018
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Oil palm is the main cash crop grown in Malaysia, and palm oil plays an important role in the world oil market. A number of studies have used multisource remote sensing data to conduct research on oil palms in Malaysia, but there are a lack of long-term oil palm mapping studies, especially when the percentage of oil palm tree cover was higher than other plantations in Malaysia during the period of 2000-2012. To overcome this limitation, we used the Google Earth Engine platform to perform oil palm classification based on Landsat reflectance data. The spatial distribution of oil palms in Malaysia in five periods from 2000 to 2018 was obtained. Then, the planting center of gravity transfer method was applied to analyze the expansion of oil palms in Malaysia from 2000 to 2018 using Landsat data, elevation data, oil palm planting area, crude palm oil price, and other statistical data. Meanwhile, the driving factors affecting the change in oil palm planting area were also analyzed. The results showed that: (1) During 2000-2018, the oil palm planted area in Malaysia increased by 5.06 Mha (million ha), with a growth rate of 83.50%. Specifically, the increased area and growth rate for West Malaysia were 2.05 Mha and 62.05% and for East Malaysia were 3.01 Mha and 109.45%, respectively. (2) Three expansion patterns of oil palms were observed: (i) from a fragmented pattern to a connected area, (ii) expansion along a river, and (iii) from a plain to a gently sloped area. (3) The maximum shift of the center of gravity of the oil palms in West Malaysia was 10 km, while in East Malaysia, it reached 100 km. The East Malaysia oil palm planting potential was greater than that of West Malaysia and showed a trend of shifting from coastal areas to inland areas. (4) Malaysia's oil palms are mainly planted in areas below 100 m above sea level; although a trend of expansion into high altitudes is visible, oil palm plantings extend to areas below 300 m above sea level. (5) Topography, crude palm oil prices, and deforestation are closely related to changes in oil palm planted area.

TI  - A Study on Assimilation of CYGNSS Wind Speed Data for Tropical Convection during 2018 January MJO
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) mission was launched in December 2016. CYGNSS provides ocean surface wind speed retrieval along specular reflection tracks at an interval resolution of approximately 25 km. With a median revisit time of 2.8 h covering a +/- 35 degrees latitude, CYGNSS can provide more frequent and accurate measurements of surface wind over the tropical oceans under heavy precipitation, especially within tropical cyclone cores and deep convection regions, than traditional scatterometers. In this study, CYGNSS v2.1 Level 2 wind speed data were assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model using the WRF Data Assimilation (WRFDA) system with hybrid 3- and 4-dimensional variational ensemble technology. Case studies were conducted to examine the impact of the CYGNSS data on forecasts of tropical cyclone (TC) Irving and a westerly wind burst (WWB) during the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) event over the Indian Ocean in early January 2018. The results indicate a positive impact of the CYGNSS data on the wind field. However, the impact from the CYGNSS data decreases rapidly within 4 h after data assimilation. Also, the influence of CYGNSS data only on precipitation forecast is found to be limited. The assimilation of CYGNSS data was further explored with an additional experiment in which CYGNSS data was combined with Global Precipitation Mission (GPM) Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) hourly precipitation and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) wind vector and were assimilated into the WRF model. A significant positive impact was found on the tropical cyclone intensity and track forecasts. The short-term forecast of wind and precipitation fields were also improved for both TC Irving and the WWB event when the combined satellite data was assimilated.

TI  - Developing a method to estimate building height from Sentinel-1 data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Building height is one of the key variables in studying anthropogenic activities and built environments in the urban system. However, the information of urban building height over large areas is still limited due to the lack of available data. In this study, we developed an approach to estimate building height using the Sentinel-1 Ground Range Detected data. First, we proposed an indicator of VVH that integrates the dual-polarization information (i.e., VV and VH) from the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data. Second, we developed a building height model using the indicator of VVH and the reference building height from airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) images in seven cities in the United States (US). Third, we estimated building height of major cities with area larger than 500 km(2) in the US using the developed model. The root mean square error between estimated and reference height is 1.5 m in seven study cities in the US. The comparison with the Laser observations from the Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite data in available footprints also indicates that the estimated building height from Sentinel-1 data is reliable. The estimated building height from Sentinel-1 data shows a better agreement with the reference data compared to the Advanced Land Observing Satellite data in seven US cities. Our results of building height in major US cities indicate that there are more cities with tall buildings in the Northeastern US compared to the Western and Southern US, with more aggregated tall buildings in central business districts of cities. The information of building height from this study is of great value in urban studies, such as estimating energy consumption and carbon emissions in urban areas.

TI  - Influence of thin cirrus clouds on the short-wave infrared satellite observation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>
T2  - OPTIK
M3  - Article
AB  - Optically thin cirrus clouds have low solar reflectance but are still efficient at absorbing infrared radiation emitted by the surface and atmosphere, which is one of the important factors for satellite detecting the greenhouse gas CO2. The existence of the cloud greatly reduces the utilization of satellite data. Aiming at improving the utilization effectively of XCO2, the effects of thin cirrus clouds on forward modeling spectra and retrieved results are investigated in this study. The cloud base of 6 km, 8 km, 10 km and the thickness of 0.1 km, 0.2 km, 0.3 km, 0.4 km are simulated to obtain spectra of O-2-A (0.76 mu m) and CO2 (1.6 mu m). The simulation results show that the radiation intensity is reduced due to the existence of thin cirrus clouds for O-2-A band, and the radiation intensity is enhanced for the CO2 band. The mean values of spectral residuals for both bands are increased with the increase of cloud base and thickness, and they are nearly zero value. The retrieval results show that the relative errors of O-2-A total column concentration are in the range of 0.08 %-0.09 % for all thin cirrus clouds, and the relative errors of CO2 total column concentration are 0.16 %-0.35 %. Therefore, the relative errors of XCO2 are 0.06 %-0.25 %.

TI  - Present-day interseismic deformation characteristics of the Beng Co-Dongqiao conjugate fault system in central Tibet: implications from InSAR observations
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Numerous V-shaped conjugate strike-slip fault systems distributed between the Lhasa block and the Qiangtang block serve as some of the main structures accommodating the eastward motion of the Tibetan Plateau. The Beng Co-Dongqiao conjugate fault system is a representative section, and determining its tectonic environment is a fundamental issue for understanding the dynamic mechanism of the V-shaped conjugate strike-slip fault systems throughout central Tibet. In this paper, we investigate the deformation rates of the Beng Co-Dongqiao conjugate faults using 3 yr of SAR data from both ascending and descending tracks of Sentinel-1 satellites. Only interferograms with a long temporal baseline were used to increase the proportion of the deformation signals. The external atmospheric delay product and the InSAR stacking strategy were employed to reduce various errors in the large-spatial-coverage Sentinel-1 data. The InSAR results revealed that the fault-parallel deformation velocities along the eastern and western segments of the Beng Co fault are 5 +/- 1 mm/yr and 2.5 +/- 1 mm/yr, respectively. The second invariant of the horizontal strain rates shows that the accumulated strain is centered on the eastern segment of the Beng Co Fault and Gulu rift. The velocity and strain rate fields show that the Anduo-Peng Co faults may be paired with the Beng Co fault to form a new conjugate system and the tectonic transformation between the Beng Co fault and Gulu rift. These results can better explain the tectonic deformation environment of the Beng Co-Dongqiao conjugate fault system and provide insights on the crustal dynamics throughout the entire plateau interior.

TI  - Evaluation of Drought Monitoring Effect of Winter Wheat in Henan Province of China Based on Multi-Source Data
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring agricultural drought is important to food security and the sustainable development of human society. In order to improve the accuracy of soil moisture and winter wheat yield estimation, drought monitoring effects of optical drought index data, meteorological drought data, and passive microwave soil moisture data were explored during individual and whole growth periods of winter wheat in 2003-2011, taking Henan Province of China as the research area. The model of drought indices and relative meteorological yield of winter wheat in individual and whole growth periods was constructed based on multiple linear regression. Results showed a higher correlation between Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) drought indices and 10 cm relative soil moisture (RSM10) than 20 cm (RSM20) and 50 cm (RSM50). In the whole growth period, the correlation coefficient (R) between vegetation supply water index (VSWI) and RSM10 had the highest correlation (R = 0.206), while in individual growth periods, the vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) was superior to the vegetation health index (VHI) and VSWI. Among the meteorological drought indices, the 10-day, 20-day, and 30-day standard precipitation evapotranspiration indices (SPEI1, SPEI2, and SPEI3) were all most relevant to RSM10 during individual and whole growth periods. RSM50 and SPEI3 had a higher correlation, indicating that deep soil moisture was more related to drought on a long time scale. The relationship between Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS soil moisture (AMSR-E SM) and VTCI was stable and significantly positive in individual and whole growth periods, which was better compared to VHI and VSWI. Compared with the drought indices and the relative meteorological yield in the city, VHI had the best monitoring effect during individual and whole growth periods. Results also showed that drought occurring at the jointing-heading stage can reduce winter wheat yield, while a certain degree of drought occurring at the heading-milk ripening stage can increase the yield. In the whole growth period, the combination of SPEI1, SPEI2, and VHI had the best performance, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.282 with the combination of drought indices as the independent variables and relative meteorological yield as the dependent variable. In the individual growth period, the model in the later growth period of winter wheat performed well, especially in the returning green-jointing stage (R-2 = 0.212). Results show that the combination of multiple linear drought indices in the whole growth period and the model in the returning green-jointing period could improve the accuracy of winter wheat yield estimation. This study is helpful for effective agricultural drought monitoring of winter wheat in Henan Province.

TI  - Optimization of Land Reuse Structure in Coal Mining Subsided Areas Considering Regional Economic Development: A Case Study in Pei County, China
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Land subsidence, which has caused large-scale settlement loss and farmland degradation, was regarded as the main constraint for land reclamation in the High Groundwater Coal Basins (HGCBs) in the eastern China plain. Both coal mining and agricultural production are important for regional development in this area. In general, the land reclamation direction in this area is greatly affected by the adequacy of filling materials and the land use demand of regional economic development. Taking seven coal mining subsided areas in Pei county, located in the eastern China plain, for example, this study proposed an integrated model (including the Limit Condition model, Logistic Regression model, Grey Linear Programming model and the conversion of land use and its effects at small regional extent (CLUE-S) model) to simulate and optimize the post-mining land use structure to meet the economic development needs of Pei county. Then, the post-mining land use structure under different scenarios, which were set based on the subsidence depth, were compared to explore the optimal collapse depth for separating the damaged land into the filling area and non-filling area. The landscape structure, ecological benefits, engineering quantity and reclaimed farmland area were used to compare the reclaimed land use structure of different scenarios. The results showed that the integrated model could efficiently simulate the reclaimed land use structure to meet the land demand for regional development. The optimal collapse depth for separating the damaged area into the filling area and non-filling area was 2.6 m. Currently, the reclaimed land use structure not only needs a low quantity of filling material, but also obtains a good landscape structure and elevated ecosystem services value. Furthermore, the reclaimed urban land was mainly distributed around Pei town, and the reclaimed farmland was mostly distributed in the area between Pei town and Weishan lake, which were consistent with the pattern of urbanization. The study provides valuable information for future land use plans for Pei county and will contribute to the methods of post-mining land reclamation in other HGCBs.

TI  - European Radiometry Buoy and Infrastructure (EURYBIA): A Contribution to the Design of the European Copernicus Infrastructure for Ocean Colour System Vicarious Calibration
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of the Copernicus Program, EUMETSAT prioritizes the creation of an ocean color infrastructure for system vicarious calibration (OC-SVC). This work aims to reply to this need by proposing the European Radiometry Buoy and Infrastructure (EURYBIA). EURYBIA is designed as an autonomous European infrastructure operating within the Marine Optical Network (MarONet) established by University of Miami (Miami, FL, USA) based on the Marine Optical Buoy (MOBY) experience and NASA support. MarONet addresses SVC requirements in different sites, consistently and in a traceable way. The selected EURYBIA installation is close to the Lampedusa Island in the central Mediterranean Sea. This area is widely studied and hosts an Atmospheric and Oceanographic Observatory for long-term climate monitoring. The EURYBIA field segment comprises off-shore and on-shore infrastructures to manage the observation system and perform routine sensors calibrations. The ground segment includes the telemetry center for data communication and the processing center to compute data products and uncertainty budgets. The study shows that the overall uncertainty of EURYBIA SVC gains computed for the Sentinel-3 OLCI mission under EUMETSAT protocols is of about 0.05% in the blue-green wavelengths after a decade of measurements, similar to that of the reference site in Hawaii and in compliance with requirements for climate studies.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Land Surface Albedo over the Tibet Plateau from 2001 to 2019
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - As an essential climate variable (ECV), land surface albedo plays an important role in the Earth surface radiation budget and regional or global climate change. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) is a sensitive environment to climate change, and understanding its albedo seasonal and inter-annual variations is thus important to help capture the climate change rules. In this paper, we analyzed the large-scale spatial patterns, temporal trends, and seasonal variability of land surface albedo overall the TP, based on the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43 albedo products from 2001 to 2019. Specifically, we assessed the correlations between the albedo anomaly and the anomalies of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the fraction of snow cover (snow cover), and land surface temperature (LST). The results show that there are larger albedo variations distributed in the mountainous terrain of the TP. Approximately 10.06% of the land surface is identified to have been influenced by the significant albedo variation from the year 2001 to 2019. The yearly averaged albedo was decreased significantly at a rate of 0.0007 (Sen's slope) over the TP. Additionally, the yearly average snow cover was decreased at a rate of 0.0756. However, the yearly average NDVI and LST were increased with slopes of 0.0004 and 0.0253 over the TP, respectively. The relative radiative forcing (RRF) caused by the land cover change (LCC) is larger than that caused by gradual albedo variation in steady land cover types. Overall, the RRF due to gradual albedo variation varied from 0.0005 to 0.0170 W/m(2), and the RRF due to LCC variation varied from 0.0037 to 0.0243 W/m(2) during the years 2001 to 2019. The positive RRF caused by gradual albedo variation or the LCC can strengthen the warming effects in the TP. The impact of the gradual albedo variations occurring in the steady land cover types was very low between 2001 and 2019 because the time series was short, and it therefore cannot be neglected when examining radiative forcing for a long time series regarding climate change.

TI  - Continuous Monitoring of Cotton Stem Water Potential using Sentinel-2 Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring cotton status during the growing season is critical in increasing production efficiency. The water status in cotton is a key factor for yield and cotton quality. Stem water potential (SWP) is a precise indicator for assessing cotton water status. Satellite remote sensing is an effective approach for monitoring cotton growth at a large scale. The aim of this study is to estimate cotton water stress at a high temporal frequency and at a large scale. In this study, we measured midday SWP samples according to the acquisition dates of Sentinel-2 images and used them to build linear-regression-based and machine-learning-based models to estimate cotton water stress during the growing season (June to August, 2018). For the linear-regression-based method, we estimated SWP based on different Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices, where the normalized difference index 45 (NDI45) achieved the best performance (R-2 = 0.6269; RMSE = 3.6802 (-1*swp (bars))). For the machine-learning-based method, we used random forest regression to estimate SWP and received even better results (R-2 = 0.6709; RMSE = 3.3742 (-1*swp (bars))). To find the best selection of input variables for the machine-learning-based approach, we tried three different data input datasets, including (1) 9 original spectral bands (e.g., blue, green, red, red edge, near infrared (NIR), and shortwave infrared (SWIR)), (2) 21 vegetation indices, and (3) a combination of original Sentinel-2 spectral bands and vegetation indices. The highest accuracy was achieved when only the original spectral bands were used. We also found the SWIR and red edge band were the most important spectral bands, and the vegetation indices based on red edge and NIR bands were particularly helpful. Finally, we applied the best approach for the linear-regression-based and the machine-learning-based methods to generate cotton water potential maps at a large scale and high temporal frequency. Results suggests that the methods developed here has the potential for continuous monitoring of SWP at large scales and the machine-learning-based method is preferred.

TI  - Spatial Paradigms in Road Networks and Their Delimitation of Urban Boundaries Based on KDE
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - y An in-depth analysis of urban road network distribution plays a critical role in understanding the urbanization process. However, effective ways to quantitatively analyze the spatial paradigms of road networks are still lacking, and few studies have utilized road networks to rapidly identify urban areas of a region. Thus, using a fast-developing region in the south-eastern costal region of China, Fuzhou City, as a case, we introduced kernel density estimation (KDE) to characterize road networks and quantified the area's spatial heterogeneity using exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) and semivariance analysis (SA). The results show that there is an uneven spatial distribution of the networks both at the regional and downtown levels. At the regional level, there is a conspicuous polarization in the road distribution, with the KDE being much higher in the urban areas than in the rural areas; at the downtown level, the KDE gradually decreases from the center to the periphery. Quantitatively, the ranges of the spatial dependence of the networks are approximately 25 km for the entire study region and 12 km for the downtown area. Additionally, the spatial variations vary among different directions, with greater variations in the northeast southwest and the southeast northwest directions compared with the other directions, which is in line with the urban sprawl policy of the study area. Both the qualitative and quantitative results show that the distribution of road networks has a clear urban rural dual structure, which indicates that road networks can be an active tool in identifying the urban areas of a region. To this end, we propose a quick and easy method to delimit urban areas using KDE. The extraction results of KDE are better than those of the index-based built-up index (IBI), indicating the effectivity and feasibility of our proposed method to identify the urban areas in the region. This research sheds new light on urbanization development research.

TI  - Advanced Ultraviolet Radiation and Ozone Retrieval for Applications Surface Ultraviolet Radiation Products
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - AURORA (Advanced Ultraviolet Radiation and Ozone Retrieval for Applications) is a three-year project supported by the European Union in the frame of its H2020 Call (EO-2-2015) for "Stimulating wider research use of Copernicus Sentinel Data". The project addresses key scientific issues relevant for synergistic exploitation of data acquired in different spectral ranges by different instruments on board the atmospheric Sentinels. A novel approach, based on the assimilation of geosynchronous equatorial orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) fused products by application of an innovative algorithm to Sentinel-4 (S-4) and Sentinel-5 (S-5) synthetic data, is adopted to assess the quality of the unique ozone vertical profile obtained in a context simulating the operational environment. The first priority is then attributed to the lower atmosphere with calculation of tropospheric columns and ultraviolet (UV) surface radiation from the resulting ozone vertical distribution. Here we provide details on the surface UV algorithm of AURORA. Both UV index (UVI) and UV-A irradiance are provided from synthetic satellite measurements, which in turn are based on atmospheric scenarios from MERRA-2 (Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) re-analysis. The UV algorithm is implemented in a software tool integrated in the technological infrastructure developed in the context of AURORA for the management of the synthetic data and for supporting the data processing. This was closely linked to the application-oriented activities of the project, aimed to improve the performance and functionality of a downstream application for personal UV dosimetry based on satellite data. The use of synthetic measurements from MERRA-2 gives us also a "ground truth", against which to evaluate the performance of our UV model with varying inputs. In this study we both describe the UV algorithm itself and assess the influence that changes in ozone profiles, due to the fusion and assimilation, can cause in surface UV levels.

TI  - Subpixel Mapping of Surface Water in the Tibetan Plateau with MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This article presents a comprehensive subpixel water mapping algorithm to automatically produce routinely open water fraction maps in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). A multi-index threshold endmember extraction method was applied to select the endmembers from MODIS images. To incorporate endmember variability, an endmember selection strategy, called the combined use of typical and neighboring endmembers, was adopted in multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), which can assure a robust subpixel water fractions estimation. The accuracy of the algorithm was assessed at both the local scale and regional scale. At the local scale, a comparison using the eight pairs of MODIS/Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) water maps demonstrated that subpixels water fractions were well retrieved with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 7.86% and determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.98. At the regional scale, the MODIS water fraction map in October 2014 matches well with the TP lake data set and the Global Lake and Wetland Database (GLWD) in both latitudinal and longitudinal distribution. The lake area estimation is more consistent with the reference TP lake data set (difference of -3.15%) than the MODIS Land Water Mask (MOD44W) (difference of -6.39%).

TI  - Snow cover estimation from MODIS and Sentinel-1 SAR data using machine learning algorithms in the western part of the Tianshan Mountains
T2  - JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Obtaining the spatial distribution of snow cover in mountainous areas using the optical image of remote sensing technology is difficult because of cloud and fog. In this study, the object-based principle component analysis-support vector machine (PCA-SVM) method is proposed for snow cover mapping through the integration of moderateresolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) snow cover products and the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scattering characteristics. First, derived from the Sentinel-1A SAR images, the feature parameters, including VV/VH backscatter, scattering entropy, and scattering alpha, were used to describe the variations of snow and non-snow covers. Second, the optimum feature combinations of snow cover were formed from the feature parameters using the principle component analysis (PCA) algorithm. Finally, using the optimum feature combinations, a snow cover map with a 20 m spatial resolution was extracted by means of an object-based SVM classifier. This method was applied in the study area of the Xinyuan County, which is located in the western part of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, China. The accuracies in this method were analyzed according to the data observed at different experimental sites. Results showed that the snow cover pixels of the extraction were less than those in the actual situation (FB1=93.86, FB2=59.78). The evaluation of the threat score (TS), probability of detection (POD), and false alarm ratio (FAR) for the snow-covered pixels obtained from the two-stage SAR images were different (TS1=86.84, POD1=90.10, FAR(1)=4.01; TS2=56.40, POD2=57.62, FAR(2)=3.62). False and misclassifications of the snow cover and non-snow cover pixels were found. Although the classifications were not highly accurate, the approach showed potential for integrating different sources to retrieve the spatial distribution of snow covers during a stable period.

TI  - Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Reveals the Potential Mechanism of Abortion in Tobacco <i>sua</i>-Cytoplasmic Male Sterility
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - sua-CMS (cytoplasmic male sterility) is the only male sterile system in tobacco breeding, but the mechanism of abortion is unclear. Cytological characteristics show that abortion in the sua-CMS line msZY occurs before the differentiation of sporogenous cells. In this study, a comparative transcriptomic analysis was conducted on flower buds at the abortion stage of msZY and its male fertile control ZY. A total of 462 differentially expressed genes were identified in msZY and ZY, which were enriched via protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, and circadian rhythm-plant by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Most genes were downregulated in the ER stress pathway, heat-shock protein family, F1F0-ATPase encoding by the mitochondrial genome, and differentiation of stamens. Genes in the programmed cell death (PCD) pathway were upregulated in msZY. The transcriptome results were consistent with those of qRT-PCR. Ultrastructural and physiological analyses indicted active vacuole PCD and low ATP content in msZY young flower buds. We speculated that PCD and a deficiency in ATP synthesis are essential for the abortion of sua-CMS. This study reveals the potential mechanism of abortion of tobacco sua-CMS.

TI  - A sentinel COVID-19 case in Houston, Texas: Informing frontline emergency department screening and preparedness.
T2  - Journal of the American College of Emergency Physicians open
M3  - Case Reports
AB  - In December 2019, a cluster of severe pneumonia cases of unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. A novel strain of coronavirus belonging to the same family of viruses that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was identified. In February 2020, cases began being identified in the United States. We describe a sentinel COVID-19 patient in Houston, Texas, who first presented on March 1, 2020. The patient did not meet criteria for a Person Under Investigation (PUI) as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at the time. This case has broad implications for emergency department screening and preparedness for COVID-19 and other future infectious diseases.

TI  - An Optimized Object-Based Random Forest Algorithm for Marsh Vegetation Mapping Using High-Spatial-Resolution GF-1 and ZY-3 Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Discriminating marsh vegetation is critical for the rapid assessment and management of wetlands. The study area, Honghe National Nature Reserve (HNNR), a typical freshwater wetland, is located in Northeast China. This study optimized the parameters (mtry and ntrees) of an object-based random forest (RF) algorithm to improve the applicability of marsh vegetation classification. Multidimensional datasets were used as the input variables for model training, then variable selection was performed on the variables to eliminate redundancy, which improved classification efficiency and overall accuracy. Finally, the performance of a new generation of Chinese high-spatial-resolution Gaofen-1 (GF-1) and Ziyuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite images for marsh vegetation classification was evaluated using the improved object-based RF algorithm with accuracy assessment. The specific conclusions of this study are as follows: (1) Optimized object-based RF classifications consistently produced more than 70.26% overall accuracy for all scenarios of GF-1 and ZY-3 at the 95% confidence interval. The performance of ZY-3 imagery applied to marsh vegetation mapping is lower than that of GF-1 imagery due to the coarse spatial resolution. (2) Parameter optimization of the object-based RF algorithm effectively improved the stability and classification accuracy of the algorithm. After parameter adjustment, scenario 3 for GF-1 data had the highest classification accuracy of 84% (ZY-3 is 74.72%) at the 95% confidence interval. (3) The introduction of multidimensional datasets improved the overall accuracy of marsh vegetation mapping, but with many redundant variables. Using three variable selection algorithms to remove redundant variables from the multidimensional datasets effectively improved the classification efficiency and overall accuracy. The recursive feature elimination (RFE)-based variable selection algorithm had the best performance. (4) Optical spectral bands, spectral indices, mean value of green and NIR bands in textural information, DEM, TWI, compactness, max difference, and shape index are valuable variables for marsh vegetation mapping. (5) GF-1 and ZY-3 images had higher classification accuracy for forest, cropland, shrubs, and open water.

TI  - INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS AND THE WAR OF ANTI-TRADITIONALISM WITH IDENTITY
T2  - MIROVAYA EKONOMIKA I MEZHDUNARODNYE OTNOSHENIYA
M3  - Article
AB  - The article analyzes the withstanding of two worldviews - traditionalism and anti-traditionalism - in the context of international relations. The authors define the ideology of the modern liberal order as anti-traditionalism (the new type of liberalism). Its basic feature is an intention to overcome every identity. The "liberal revolution" of the second half of the 20th century step by step formed the values that were recognized at the international level as fundamental (those are first of all the rights of minorities, liberalization of immigration policy, the values of globalism), or all human values which could not be discussed. The traditionalist worldview is not limited to the "populism" or "nationalism" as often represented in mass-media, but has more deep roots traced back to defending the sovereignty of states, societies, cultures, religions and identity as a basic idea instead of globalization of values. In 2010s it became evident that the struggle of anti-traditionalists and traditionalists already exists between the states. On that ideological ground, the U.S. president D. Trump opposes to his liberal critics inside and outside the country. On the same ground the traditionalist governments of Poland and Hungary, politicians in Italy oppose to the symbol of the new liberalism - the European Union structures. Russia has become one of the world's centers of the traditionalist ideology defending the sovereignty against the new liberalism. The conservatives from Europe and the USA (the "League" from Italy, "Alternative for Germany", "National Front" from France, conservatives around D. Trump, etc.) perceive Russia as a more monolith and united force, while in other European countries traditionalists rather dissociate. In international relations, traditionalists feel themselves as still defending and retreating side but that only escalate the struggle.

TI  - Analysis of factors related to N2-or N3-stage breast cancer associated with 1-2 positive sentinel lymph nodes in Chinese patients
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL CANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: This study aims to determine the incidence of N2- or N3-stage disease in a cohort of patients with T1-T2 invasive breast cancer and one or two positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs), and identify the risk factors for N2/3 disease in this cohort.Methods: The present study involved 298 patients with T1-T2 tumors who underwent SLN biopsy and were found to have one or two metastatic SLNs. 'Me proportion of patients with N2/3 disease was calculated in the whole cohort, and in the TI and T2 subgroups. Furthermore, univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the risk factors for N2/3 disease in the cohort.Results: The final N stage, as determined by the postoperative pathological examination, was Ni for 250 (83.9%) patients, and N2 or N3 for 48 (16.1%) patients (11.41% had clinical N2 disease, while 4.70% had clinical N3 disease). Among the 156 patients with T1 tumors, 17 (10.9%) patients had N2/3 disease, while for the 142 patients with T2 tumors, 31 (21.8%) patients had N2/3 disease. T2 stage, lymphovascular invasion, and the number of positive SLNs were independent predictors of N2/3 disease in the cohort (P<0.05).Conclusions: N2/3 lymph node metastasis occurs in patients with T1-T2 breast cancer, and one or two positive SLNs, particularly in patients with T2 tumors. The rate of N2/3 disease is not negligible. T2 stage, lymphovascular invasion, and the number of positive SLNs were independent predictors of N2/3 disease in the present patient population.

TI  - Sun-Angle Effects on Remote-Sensing Phenology Observed and Modelled Using Himawari-8
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remote sensing of vegetation at regional to global scales is undertaken at considerable variations in solar zenith angle (SZA) across space and time, yet the extent to which these SZA variations matter for the retrieval of phenology remains largely unknown. Here we examined the effect of seasonal and spatial variations in SZA on retrieving vegetation phenology from time series of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) across a study area in southeastern Australia encompassing forest, woodland, and grassland sites. The vegetation indices (VI) data span two years and are from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI), which is onboard the Japanese Himawari-8 geostationary satellite. The semi-empirical RossThick-LiSparse-Reciprocal (RTLSR) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model was inverted for each spectral band on a daily basis using 10-minute reflectances acquired by H-8 AHI at different sun-view geometries for each site. The inverted RTLSR model was then used to forward calculate surface reflectance at three constant SZAs (20 degrees, 40 degrees, 60 degrees) and one seasonally varying SZA (local solar noon), all normalised to nadir view. Time series of NDVI and EVI adjusted to different SZAs at nadir view were then computed, from which phenological metrics such as start and end of growing season were retrieved. Results showed that NDVI sensitivity to SZA was on average nearly five times greater than EVI sensitivity. VI sensitivity to SZA also varied among sites (biome types) and phenological stages, with NDVI sensitivity being higher during the minimum greenness period than during the peak greenness period. Seasonal SZA variations altered the temporal profiles of both NDVI and EVI, with more pronounced differences in magnitude among NDVI time series normalised to different SZAs. When using VI time series that allowed SZA to vary at local solar noon, the uncertainties in estimating start, peak, end, and length of growing season introduced by local solar noon varying SZA VI time series, were 7.5, 3.7, 6.5, and 11.3 days for NDVI, and 10.4, 11.9, 6.5, and 8.4 days for EVI respectively, compared to VI time series normalised to a constant SZA. Furthermore, the stronger SZA dependency of NDVI compared with EVI, resulted in up to two times higher uncertainty in estimating annual integrated VI, a commonly used remote-sensing proxy for vegetation productivity. Since commonly used satellite products are not generally normalised to a constant sun-angle across space and time, future studies to assess the sun-angle effects on satellite applications in agriculture, ecology, environment, and carbon science are urgently needed. Measurements taken by new-generation geostationary (GEO) satellites offer an important opportunity to refine this assessment at finer temporal scales. In addition, studies are needed to evaluate the suitability of different BRDF models for normalising sun-angle across a broad spectrum of vegetation structure, phenological stages and geographic locations. Only through continuous investigations on how sun-angle variations affect spatiotemporal vegetation dynamics and what is the best strategy to deal with it, can we achieve a more quantitative remote sensing of true signals of vegetation change across the entire globe and through time.

TI  - Monitoring Plant Functional Diversity Using the Reflectance and Echo from Space
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Plant functional diversity (FD) is an important component of biodiversity. Evidence shows that FD strongly determines ecosystem functioning and stability and also regulates various ecosystem services that underpin human well-being. Given the importance of FD, it is critical to monitor its variations in an explicit manner across space and time, a highly demanding task that cannot be resolved solely by field data. Today, high hopes are placed on satellite-based observations to complement field plot data. The promise is that multiscale monitoring of plant FD, ecosystem functioning, and their services is now possible at global scales in near real-time. However, non-trivial scale challenges remain to be overcome before plant ecology can capitalize on the latest advances in Earth Observation (EO). Here, we articulate the existing scale challenges in linking field and satellite data and further elaborated in detail how to address these challenges via the latest innovations in optical and radar sensor technologies and image analysis algorithms. Addressing these challenges not only requires novel remote sensing theories and algorithms but also urges more effective communication between remote sensing scientists and field ecologists to foster mutual understanding of the existing challenges. Only through a collaborative approach can we achieve the global plant functional diversity monitoring goal.

TI  - External validation of the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition melanoma staging system: who needs adjuvant treatment?
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Now effective adjuvant therapy has arrived in melanoma, accurate staging and patient selection to optimize its risk/benefit ratio is crucial. The American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system is the most widely used and validated melanoma staging system, which recently released its 8th edition. We aimed to externally validate the prognostic and discriminatory ability for survival of the 8th edition compared to the 7th edition and evaluate prognostic factors. Prospective database of stage III melanoma (2000-2016). Prognostic factors for melanoma-specific survival and distant metastasis-free survival were analyzed. Survival differentiation of the 7th and 8th edition was assessed with log-rank tests and Cox proportional hazards models. Discriminatory ability was compared using the receiver operating characteristic and Akaike's Information Criterion. Six hundred forty patients were included (median follow-up 59 months). Median melanoma-specific survival was 138 months, distant metastasis-free survival 96 months. Age, Breslow thickness, ulceration of the primary tumor and number of positive lymph nodes (N) were independent prognostic parameters for distant metastasis-free survival and melanoma-specific survival. The 8th edition performed slightly better than the 7th edition in terms of survival discrimination but showed slightly worse distant metastasis-free survival and melanoma-specific survival differentiation between stage IIIA and IIIB. Sentinel node (SN) metastasis size cutoff of 1 mm differentiated survival in both 7th and 8th edition stage IIIA, showing excellent distant metastasis-free survival and melanoma-specific survival for patients with a SN metastasis size <1 mm. The 8th edition performed at least comparably, if not better than the 7th in terms of survival discrimination. However, survival in both 7th and 8th edition stage IIIA melanoma remains heterogeneous. EORTC SN tumor burden criteria can further stratify survival and help patient selection for adjuvant therapy.

TI  - NDVI dynamics in different phases of the ENSO phenomenon in the Laguna Blanca Biosphere Reserve (Catamarca, Argentina)
T2  - Ecologia Austral
M3  - Article
AB  - El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an oceanic-climatic phenomenon which shows two contrasting phases and an intermediate or neutral phase that affect different regions of the world. In some ecoregions of northwestern Argentina (NOA), these phases would induce years with lower or higher rainfall than the historical average, corresponding to El Nino and La Nina, respectively. These differences in water availability cause changes in vegetation cover and land degradation, as well. Changes in the water regime due to natural or anthropic causes, which affect the productivity of different ecosystems, can be inferred through differences in spectral indices, such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index). The main objectives of this research were to characterize the dynamics of the vegetation cover estimated by mean of NDVI and study the temporal relationships among ENSO, rainfall and NDVI in the most conspicuous communities of the Puna in the Laguna Blanca Biosphere Reserve. NDVI data from the MODIS sensor (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were obtained from a published map of plant communities in the reserve; precipitation, from the GPCC (Global Precipitation Climatology Center), and the El Nino Oceanic Index (ONI), from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The highest difference of this last index among the different phases of the ENSO was reached between September and February. As a consequence of the monsoon regime, rainfall reached its peak a quarter later, being the highest in La Nina events. The maximum NDVI also showed a delay of one to two quarters with respect to ONI depending on the community considered. Results suggest that there is a connection among NDVI, rainfall and ENSO phases in Catamarca's Puna. In extreme years La Nina and El Nino, both in steppes of the arid and semi-arid Puna, significant differences in NDVI values were observed. The results suggest that ONI monitoring would allow anticipating the application of appropriate strategies for desertification control.

TI  - A Multi-Decadal Investigation of Tidal Creek Wetland Changes, Water Level Rise, and Ghost Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetlands play a vital role in protecting coastlines, which makes the loss of forested and emergent wetlands devastating for vulnerable coastal communities. Tidal creeks are relatively small hydrologic areas that feed into larger estuaries, are on the front lines of the interface between saltwater and freshwater ecosystems, and are potentially the first areas to experience changes in sea level. The goal of this study was to investigate wetland changes through time at two tidal creeks (Smith Creek and Town Creek) of the Cape Fear River estuary in southeastern North Carolina, USA, to determine if there is a spatial relationship between habitat change, physical geography characteristics, and the rate of wetland migration upstream. Historic aerial photography and recent satellite imagery were used to map land cover and compute change through time and were compared with derived physical geography metrics (sinuosity, creek width, floodplain width, floodplain elevation, and creek slope). The primary results were: (1) there was a net gain in emergent wetlands even accounting for the area of wetlands that became water, (2) wetlands have migrated upstream at an increasing rate through time, (3) land cover change was significantly different between the two creeks (P = 0.01) where 14% (67.5 ha) of Smith Creek and 18% (272.3 ha) of Town Creek transitioned from forest to emergent wetland, and (4) the transition from emergent wetland to water was significantly related to average change in creek width, floodplain elevation, and average water level. In conclusion, this research correlated habitat change with rising water level and identified similarities and differences between neighboring tidal creeks. Future research could apply the methodologies developed here to other coastal locations to further explore the relationships between tides, sea level, land cover change, and physical geography characteristics.

TI  - Mapping an invasive goldenrod of <i>Solidago altissima</i> in urban landscape of Japan using multi-scale remote sensing and knowledge-based classification
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - An invasive goldenrod, Solidago altissima, is abundant in urban environment of Japan and a threat to native biodiversity. Aerial remote sensing approach would be useful for effective monitoring and management of the species. However, it is challenging for remote sensing technique to detect a specific single plant species with a small crown and population size in highly heterogeneous urban environments. This study investigated the ability to upscale the in-situ hyperspectral reflectance signature obtained at crown level for landscape scale detection. Field hyperspectral sensors were used to obtain the spectral signatures of Solidago altissima and its surrounding features at crown scale (5 cm x 5 cm, instantaneous field of view (IFOV)). By using the first derivative analysis, the hyperspectral indices namely SAFI (S. altissima flower index) was developed based on the sensitive and peak reflectance of full blooming flower. This index was subsequently applied to identify the blooming S. altissima at population scale (1 m x 1 m) and landscape scale (5 m x 5 m) using field hyperspectral sensor and satellite data respectively. The results at crown scale showed that SAFI was able to discriminate S. altissima from their surrounding features with average probability of 72%. At the population scale with (1 m plot), SAFI can discriminate plot with different S. altissima flower distribution starting from 45%dominance. At landscape scale, effective detection was found at SAFI value over 0.3 to 0.5. The sites which hadhigh SAFI values but no actual presence of S. altissima were often under intensive land management such as frequent mowing. We conclude that the detection of S. altissima distribution at landscape scale by direct upscaling crown scale hyperspectral signature was possible using high resolution satellite image with availability of green(similar to 480 nm) and yellow (similar to 600 nm) spectrum bands at fine resolution (similar to 5 m). The detection, however, were influenced by the phenology state of the flowering stages, community size and adjacent plant that possesses similar carotenoid characteristics.

TI  - Satellite Observations for Detecting and Forecasting Sea-Ice Conditions: A Summary of Advances Made in the SPICES Project by the EU's Horizon 2020 Programme
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The detection, monitoring, and forecasting of sea-ice conditions, including their extremes, is very important for ship navigation and offshore activities, and for monitoring of sea-ice processes and trends. We summarize here recent advances in the monitoring of sea-ice conditions and their extremes from satellite data as well as the development of sea-ice seasonal forecasting capabilities. Our results are the outcome of the three-year (2015-2018) SPICES (Space-borne Observations for Detecting and Forecasting Sea-Ice Cover Extremes) project funded by the EU's Horizon 2020 programme. New SPICES sea-ice products include pancake ice thickness and degree of ice ridging based on synthetic aperture radar imagery, Arctic sea-ice volume and export derived from multisensor satellite data, and melt pond fraction and sea-ice concentration using Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) radiometer data. Forecasts of July sea-ice conditions from initial conditions in May showed substantial improvement in some Arctic regions after adding sea-ice thickness (SIT) data to the model initialization. The SIT initialization also improved seasonal forecasts for years with extremely low summer sea-ice extent. New SPICES sea-ice products have a demonstrable level of maturity, and with a reasonable amount of further work they can be integrated into various operational sea-ice services.

AB  - The Cape Region (CR) of Baja California Sur is located in the southernmost tip of the Baja California peninsula, Mexico. The vegetation of this region is dominated by scrubland (SRB) and tropical dry forest (TDF), but oak (OW) and oak-pine woodland (OWP) are also found in Sierra La Laguna Biosphere Reserve. These vegetation types, in this relatively small area, make the CR a contrasting and highly biodiverse region. This research used the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to describe spatiotemporal variability of the vegetation cover in the CR. The analysed NDVI data derived from Landsat 7 during the growing season (September-November) from 2001-2015. Its spatial distribution showed the highest values in the TDF, OW and OPW. Higher variability was observed in SRB. Temporal variations of the annual NDVI mean of the growing season fluctuated in a range from 0.292 to 0.522, and with the highest values in 2014 while the lowest were observed in 2011. A general increasing trend was observed for the growing season over the period 2001-2015 for all analysed vegetation types. Remote sensing change detection methods combined with Geographic Information Systems, suggested that the vegetation of the area was well conserved during the period of study.

TI  - Declining trend in osteoporosis management and screening following vertebral compression fractures - a national analysis of commercial insurance and medicare advantage beneficiaries
T2  - SPINE JOURNAL

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Despite the increasing national incidence, osteoporosis and its associated comanagement, often remain an overlooked issue in the orthopedic world. Screening and associated management of osteoporosis is often only considered by providers when patients present with multiple fragility fractures. Current evidence with regard to the trends in screening and medical comanagement/antiosteoporotic therapy of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) remains limited.PURPOSE: To understand trends, costs, and clinical impact associated the utilization of antiosteoporotic medication and screening with the 1 year following occurrences of sentinel/primary osteoporotic VCFs.STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Retrospective review of 2008-2015Q3 Humana Administrative Claims (HAC) database.PATIENT SAMPLE: The 2008-2015Q3 HAC database was queried using International Classification of Diseases 9th Edition (ICD-9) diagnosis codes 805.2 and 805.4 to identify patients with primary closed osteoporotic thoracolumbar VCFs. Patients with a concurrent diagnosis of trauma and/or malignancy were excluded. Patients experiencing a fragility fracture of the hip, distal radius or proximal humerus, and/or those already on osteoporotic medications within the year before the VCF were excluded to prevent an overlap in the screening and/or antiresorptive medication rates. Finally, only those patients who had complete 2-year follow-up data were analyzed.OUTCOME MEASURES: To understand trends over time in the utilization of medication for osteoporosis and screening within 1 year following sentinel VCFs. The study also aimed to report per-prescription and per-patient average costs associated with different antiosteoporotic medications. As secondary objectives, we also assessed (1) risk factors associated with not receiving antiosteoporotic medication within the year following sentinel VCFs and (2) differences in rates of experiencing a secondary fragility fracture of vertebrae, hip, distal radius, and proximal humerus between patients who received medication following the sentinel VCF versus those who did not receive any medication.RESULTS: A total of 6,464 primary osteoporotic VCFs were retrieved from the database. A majority of the VCFs were seen in females (N=5,199; 80.4%). Only 28.8% (N=1,860) patients received some form of medication for osteoporosis medication in the year following the VCF. Over a 6-year interval, treatment with medication for osteoporosis declined from 38% in 2008 to 24% in 2014. The average cost of antiosteoporotic treatment per patient was $1,511. The most commonly prescribed treatment and associated average cost/patient was alendronate sodium (N=1,239; 66.6% to $120/patient). The most costly prescribed treatment was Forteo (N=177; 2.7%) with an average cost/patient of $12,074 and cost/injection being $2,373. Only 36.7% (N=2,371) received a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry/bone density scan in the year following the VCF with an average cost/patient of $76. Risk factors associated with no prescription of medication for osteoporosis within 1 year of VCF were male gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.17 [95% confidence interval {CI} 1.01-1.35]; p=.027), history of cerebrovascular accident/stroke (OR 1.56 [95% CI 1.08-2.32]; p=.022), history of diabetes mellitus (OR 1.28 [95% CI 1.04-1.58]; p=.023). Of note, patients in the West versus Midwest (OR 1.26 [95% CI 1.04-1.51]; p=.016) and commercial insurance beneficiaries (OR 1.95 [95% CI 1.08-3.52]; p=.027) were more likely to receive antiosteoporotic medication. Patients who were placed on antiosteoporotic medication were significantly less likely to suffer a second fragility fracture compared with patients that did not receive medication (OR 0.27 [95% CI 0.24-0.31]; p=.033).CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of patients starting antiosteoporotic medication within a year after a VCF remains low (28.8%). Furthermore, a declining trend of antiosteoporotic medication prescription was noted over time. Providers who care for patients with sentinel VCFs need to be more diligent in their efforts to diagnose and treat the underlying osteoporosis to reduce the burden of future fragility fractures.

TI  - A Random Forest Modelling Procedure for a Multi-Sensor Assessment of Tree Species Diversity
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Earth observation data can provide important information for tree species diversity mapping and monitoring. The relatively recent advances in remote sensing data characteristics and processing systems elevate the potential of satellite imagery for providing accurate, timely, consistent, and robust spatially explicit estimates of tree species diversity over forest ecosystems. This study was conducted in Northern Pindos National Park, the largest terrestrial park in Greece and aimed to assess the potential of four satellite sensors with different instrumental characteristics, for the estimation of tree diversity. Through field measurements, we originally quantified two diversity indices, namely the Shannon diversity index (H') and Simpson's diversity (D1). Random forest regression models were developed for associating remotely sensed spectral signal with tree species diversity within the area. The models generated from the use of the WorldView-2 image were the most accurate with a coefficient of determination of up to 0.44 for H' and 0.37 for D1. The Sentinel-2 -based models of tree species diversity performed slightly worse, but were better than the Landsat-8 and RapidEye models. The coefficient of variation quantifying internal variability of spectral values within each plot provided little or no usage for improving the modelling accuracy. Our results suggest that very-high-spatial-resolution imagery provides the most important information for the assessment of tree species diversity in heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems.

TI  - Mapping and Assessing the Dynamics of Shifting Agricultural Landscapes Using Google Earth Engine Cloud Computing, a Case Study in Mozambique
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover maps obtained at high spatial and temporal resolutions are necessary to support monitoring and management applications in areas with many smallholder and low-input agricultural systems, as those characteristic in Mozambique. Various regional and global land cover products based on Earth Observation data have been developed and made publicly available but their application in regions characterized by a large variety of agro-systems with a dynamic nature is limited by several constraints. Challenges in the classification of spatially heterogeneous landscapes, as in Mozambique, include the definition of the adequate spatial resolution and data input combinations for accurately mapping land cover. Therefore, several combinations of variables were tested for their suitability as input for random forest ensemble classifier aimed at mapping the spatial dynamics of smallholder agricultural landscape in Vilankulo district in Mozambique. The variables comprised spectral bands from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, vegetation indices and textural features and the classification was performed within the Google Earth Engine cloud computing for the years 2012, 2015, and 2018. The study of three different years aimed at evaluating the temporal dynamics of the landscape, typically characterized by high shifting nature. For the three years, the best performing variables included three selected spectral bands and textural features extracted using a window size of 25. The classification overall accuracy was 0.94 for the year 2012, 0.98 for 2015, and 0.89 for 2018, suggesting that the produced maps are reliable. In addition, the areal statistics of the class classified as agriculture were very similar to the ground truth data as reported by the Servicos Distritais de Actividades Economicas (SDAE), with an average percentage deviation below 10%. When comparing the three years studied, the natural vegetation classes are the predominant covers while the agriculture is the most important cause of land cover changes.

TI  - Molecular Characterization and Antimicrobial Susceptibility of <i>C. jejuni</i> Isolates from Italian Wild Bird Populations
T2  - PATHOGENS
M3  - Article
AB  - Poultry is considered a major reservoir of human campylobacteriosis. It also been reported that not only poultry, but also wild birds, are capable of carrying C. jejuni, thus demonstrating to be a risk of spreading the bacteria in the environment. To gain insight into the population structure and investigate the antimicrobial resistance genotypes and phenotypes, we analyzed a collection of 135 C. jejuni from 15 species of wild birds in Italy. MLST revealed the presence of 41 sequence types (STs) and 13 clonal complexes (CCs). ST-179 complex and the generalist ST-45 complex were the most prevalent. Core genome MLST revealed that C. jejuni from ST-45 complex clustered according to the bird species, unlike the ST-179 complex which featured 3 different species in the same cluster. Overall we found a moderate prevalence of resistance to tetracycline (12.5%), ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid (10%). The novel ST isolated from one pigeon showed resistance to all the antibiotics tested. The ST-179 complex (33.3%) was identified with significantly higher nalidixic acid resistance relative to other tested STs. Nine AMR genes (tet(O), cmeA, cmeB, cmeC, cmeR, aad, blaOXA-61, blaOXA-184 and erm(B)) and 23S rRNA and gyrA-associated point mutations were also described, indicating a concordance level between genotypic and phenotypic resistance of 23.3%, 23.4% and of 37.5% for streptomycin, tetracycline and quinolones/fluoroquinolones, respectively. We recommend that particular attention should be given to wild birds as key sentinel animals for the ecosystem contamination surveillance.

TI  - Terrestrial shallow water hydrothermal outflow characterized from out of space
T2  - MARINE GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - We investigate the potential of satellite imagery to map and monitor the activity of shallow-water hydrothermal systems, which are often found around volcanic islands. For this study, we used publicly available data and proprietary WorldView-2 satellites images, with spectral bands that can penetrate up to water depths of 30 m. Shallow water hydrothermal sites are visible on satellite imagery, primarily with publicly available data, demonstrating the potential of satellite imagery to study and monitor shallow water hydrothermal activity. We focus our work on volcanic islands, showing intense near-shore, shallow-water hydrothermal activity, and distinct styles of hydrothermal venting. Satellite imagery constrains regional outflow geometry and the temporal variability or stability of these systems. Milos Island shows hydrothermal outflow associated with reflective mineral precipitates and/or bacterial mats, which are stable over time (2010-2014). These outflows locally define polygonal patterns likely associated with hydrothermal convection in porous media. In Kueishantao Island individual hydrothermal plumes charged with particles are visible at the sea surface, and display great variability in intensity and distribution of plume sources (2002-2019). Worldwide we have identified similar to 15 shallow water hydrothermal sites with satellite imagery, that are similar to either the Milos system (e.g., Vulcano and Panarea, Italy), or the Kueishantao system (numerous sites in Pacific volcanic islands). This study demonstrates that satellite imagery can be used to map and monitor different types of shallow-water hydrothermal systems, at regional scale, and monitor their evolution. Satellite data provide not only regional and temporal information on these systems, unavailable to date, but also the regional context for follow-up in situ field data and observations (e.g., instrumental monitoring, sampling, observations and mapping with divers or AUVs) to understand both the nature and dynamics of these systems, and ultimately the associated fluxes.

TI  - Effect of retention processes on the recruitment of tropical arrow squid (<i>Doryteuthis pleii</i>): An individual-based modeling case study in southeastern Brazil
T2  - FISHERIES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Squid recruitment depends on paralarvae survival, as the parental stock dies following reproduction. Therefore, the biotic and abiotic environmental conditions experienced by paralarvae control recruitment strength`To benefit from the favorable environments (i.e. nursery grounds) in the dynamic pelagic domain, paralarvae rely on passive retention by currents to remain in suitable nursery habitat. To evaluate the retention conditions for tropical arrow squid (Doryteuthis pleii) paralarvae off the South Brazil Bight (SBB, 22-29 degrees S), we ran a series of particle-tracking Individual-Based Models (IBM) coupled to a 3D Princeton Ocean Model (POM). We forced the hydrodynamic model with observed satellite data obtained from January 2000 to December 2010. The IBM-POM models considered two transport scenarios: (1) passive Lagrangian transport and (2) Dial Vertical Migration (DVM). The results show a high retention on actual and putative nursery grounds that could retain paralarvae in a suitable environment for survival, growth, and ultimately to recruit to the adult population. Moreover, model outputs showed high correlation between autumn-winter retention indexes and spring-summer commercial and artisanal landings in the following year. Considering the nine-month post-hatching lifespan of the species, autumn-winter retention indexes potentially provide forthcoming adult biomass predictions.

TI  - Methods of Using Ensembles of Heterogeneous Models to Identify Remote Sensing Objects
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION AND IMAGE ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper proposes a technique that uses on ensembles of models for identifying remote sensing objects. As models, we consider a multilayer convolutional neural network, an ensemble of convolutional neural networks and SVM models, and a hybrid convolutional neural network. It is proposed to determine the optimal hyperparameters of the model by a mesh or random search methods using k-fold cross validation. A method for improving the accuracy of identifying objects with an ensemble of neural networks is shown. The results of an experiment using remote sensing data are presented. The problem of identifying objects of two classes is solved; images obtained with a synthetic aperture radar are used as the test data.

AB  - Information from emergency department (ED) visits for methamphetamine-related injuries and poisonings between 1 April 2011 and 9 August 2019 were captured from 19 sentinel sites across Canada for all ages.Overall, 1093 cases (97.6/100 000 eCHIRPP cases) were identified (59.4% male), with female patients experiencing more poisonings (71% vs 57.4% for males). Unintentional injuries and poisoning accounted for 14.8% of ED presentations. Self-harm (while or as a result of consuming methamphetamine) accounted for 11.4 % of cases. The circumstances surrounding injuries and poisonings associated with methamphetamine are varied and include self-harm, fall-related brain injuries, mental illness, criminal activity and other circumstances. These domains should be taken into account when developing mitigation strategies.

TI  - Remote Sensing Application for Exploring Changes in Land-Use and Land-Cover Over a District in Northern India
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to detect land-use and land-cover changes in Baramulla district of Kashmir valley using geospatial technology. This district is affected by large-scale changes in agriculture, horticulture, built-up and dense forest. Satellite data of 1979, 2001 and 2018 are used to generate land-use and land-cover classification using on-screen digitization. This classification includes agriculture, horticulture, built-up, dense forest, barren land, water body, pasture, scrub and sparse forest. Furthermore, census data of 2001 and 2011 are correlated with the thematic maps generated from on-screen digitization. Environmental driving factors like precipitation, temperature and black carbon (BC) data were used to relate with land-use and land-cover changes over the study area. The present research reports a decrease of about 54.99% in agricultural area form 1979 (401.81 km(2)) to 2018 (180.87 km(2)). Furthermore, horticulture has increased by 35.52% from 1979 (334.38 km(2)) to 2018 (518.65 km(2)). Dense forest shows a decrease of about 27.46% from 1979 (777.54 km(2)) to 2018 (563.99 km(2)). We also report a decadal increase of about 7.71 nm during winter and 3.47 during summer in black carbon. Increase in BC concentration and temperature over study area results in snow melt. We also report an annual decreasing trend of about 1.74 cm in precipitation over study area. Decrease in precipitation results in conversion from agriculture to horticulture. Results presented in this research highlight the importance of policy making to minimize the rapid changes in land-use and land-cover over study area.

AB  - Study Design:Prospective study.Objectives:To develop, operationally define, and seek consensus from procedure experts on the metrics that best characterize a reference approach to the performance of a minimally invasive unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (ULBD) for lumbar spinal stenosis.Methods:A Metrics Group consisting of 3 experienced spine surgeons (2 neurosurgeons, 1 orthopedic surgeon), each with over 25 years of clinical practice, and an educational expert formed the Metrics Group that characterized a lumbar decompression surgery for spinal stenosis as a "reference" procedure. In a modified Delphi panel, 26 spine surgeons from 14 countries critiqued these metrics and their operational definitions before reaching consensus.Results:Performance metrics consisting of 6 phases with 42 steps, 21 errors, and 17 sentinel errors were identified that characterize the procedure. During the peer review, these were evaluated, modified, and agreed.Conclusions:Surgical procedures can be broken down into elemental tasks necessary for the safe and effective completion of a reference approach to a specified surgical procedure. Spinal experts from 16 countries reached consensus on performance metrics for the procedure. This metric-based characterization can be used in a training curriculum and also for assessment of training and performance in clinical practice.

TI  - Seasonal influenza surveillance (2009-2017) for pandemic preparedness in the WHO South-East Asia Region.
T2  - WHO South-East Asia journal of public health
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Influenza causes seasonal outbreaks each year and periodically causes a pandemic. The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) has contributed to global understanding of influenza patterns, but limited regional analysis has occurred. This study describes the virological patterns and influenza surveillance systems in the 11 countries of the WHO South-East Asia Region.METHODS: Virological data were extracted in January 2018 from FluNet, GISRS's web-based reporting tool, for 10 of the 11 countries that had data available for the years 2009 to 2017. Descriptive data for 2017 on influenza surveillance systems, including the number of sentinel sites, case definitions and reporting frequency, were collected through an annual questionnaire.RESULTS: Data on surveillance systems were available for all 11 Member States, and 10 countries reported virological data to FluNet between 2009 and 2017. Influenza surveillance in the region and national participation increased over the 8 years. Seasons varied between countries, with some experiencing two peak seasons and others having one main predominant season. Bangladesh, Indonesia and Myanmar have only one season: Bangladesh and Myanmar have a mid-year pattern and Indonesia an end-year pattern. Influenza A was the predominant circulating type for all years except 2012 and 2016, when A and B co-circulated. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was dominant in 2009 and 2010 (77% and 76%, respectively), 2015 (72%) and 2017 (54%); influenza A(H3) accounted for approximately half of the positive specimens in 2011 (46%), 2013 (51%) and 2014 (47%); and influenza B (lineage not determined) made up over 49% of positive specimens in 2012.CONCLUSION: Although the timings of peaks varied from country to country, the viruses circulating within the region were similar. Influenza surveillance remains a challenge in the region. However, timely reporting and regional sharing of information about influenza may help countries that have later peaks to allow them to prepare for the potential severity and burden associated with prevailing strains.

TI  - A New, Satellite NDVI-Based Sampling Protocol for Grape Maturation Monitoring
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Vineyards are sampled on multiple occasions during the growing season for a range of purposes, particularly to assess fruit maturation. The objective of this work was to determine if satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) vineyard images could be used to compute optimal spatially explicit sampling protocols for determining fruit maturation and quality, and minimize the number of locations physically sampled in a vineyard. An algorithm was designed to process Landsat images to locate three consecutive pixels that best represent the three quantile means representing the left tail, center, and right tail of the NDVI pixel population of a vineyard block. This new method (NDVI3) was compared to a commonly used method (CM8) and random sampling (R20) in 13 and 16 vineyard blocks in 2016 and 2017, respectively, in the Central Valley of California. Both NDVI3 and CM8 were highly correlated with R20 in pairwise comparisons of soluble sugars, pH, titratable acidity, and total anthocyanins. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests indicated that NDVI pixels sampled via the NDVI3 method generally better represented the block population than pixels selected by CM8 or R20. Analysis of 24 blocks over a 3-year period indicated that sampling solutions were temporally stable.

TI  - Monitoring the development of artisanal mines in South Africa
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN INSTITUTE OF MINING AND METALLURGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) activities have risen significantly in sub-Saharan Africa and other developing regions. ASM is increasingly being recognized as a viable pathway for sustainable livelihood building and poverty alleviation. Lack of information regarding the spatial distribution of artisanal mines and their growth over time has created significant gaps in terms of awareness in the affected communities. The systematic documentation of ASM mining is often made challenging by the seasonality and nomadic nature of these rudimentary operations. In this study, we aimed to quantify changes in vegetation cover, bare soil, and mined open pits from 2014 to 2018 due to the impacts of ASM using SPOT 6 satellite imagery. With Prieska, South Africa as a case study, morphological classification was used to delineate mined open pits and the Spectral Angle Mapper to map the changes in vegetation and bare soil. The results show a progressive increase in areas being mined for the semiprecious stone tiger's eye from 2014 to 2018. High classification accuracies of above 92% in mapping were achieved to identify artisanal open pits using morphological profiles, and classification accuracies of above 80% for mapping vegetated areas and bare areas using Spectral Angle Mapper. The results of this study also show the continuous decrease of vegetated areas and expansion of bare soil surfaces from 2014 to 2018, making the areas more vulnerable to land degradation, particularly soil erosion.

TI  - Haute Couture or Ready-To-Wear? Tailored Pelvic Radiotherapy for Prostate Cancer Based on Individualized Sentinel Lymph Node Detection
T2  - CANCERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Prostate cancer (PCa) pelvic radiotherapy fields are defined by guidelines that do not consider individual variations in lymphatic drainage. We examined the feasibility of personalized sentinel lymph node (SLN)-based pelvic irradiation in PCa. Among a SLN study of 202 patients, we retrospectively selected 57 patients with a high risk of lymph node involvement. Each single SLN clinical target volume (CTV) was individually segmented and pelvic CTVs were contoured according to Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) guidelines. We simulated a radiotherapy plan delivering 46 Gy and calculated the dose received by each SLN. Among a total of 332 abdominal SLNs, 305 pelvic SLNs (beyond the aortic bifurcation) were contoured (mean 5.4/patient). Based on standard guidelines, CTV missed 67 SLNs (22%), mostly at the common iliac level (40 SLNs). The mean distance between iliac vessels and the SLN was 11mm, and despite a 15mm margin around the iliac vessels, 9% of SLNs were not encompassed by the CTV. Moreover, 42 SLNs (63%) did not receive 95% of the prescribed dose. Despite a consensus on contouring guidelines, a significant proportion of SLNs were not included in the pelvic CTV and did not receive the prescribed dose. A tailored approach based on individual SLN detection would avoid underdosing pelvic lymph nodes that potentially contain tumor cells.

TI  - TOWARDS AN ANXIETY-BUFFER DISRUPTION APPROACH TO DEPRESSION: ATTACHMENT ANXIETY AND WORLDVIEW THREAT HEIGHTEN DEATH-THOUGHT ACCESSIBILITY AND DEPRESSION-RELATED FEELINGS
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In two studies, we tested an anxiety-buffer disruption approach to depression, examining the effects of attachment insecurities, worldview threat, and death concerns on depression-related feelings. Method: In both studies, Israeli undergraduates reported on their attachment insecurities (anxiety, avoidance), were exposed to a worldview threat or a no-threat condition, and then rated their current level of depression-related feelings. Results: In Study 1 (N = 124), we also measured death-thought accessibility and found that a worldview threat (versus no-threat) heightened death-thought accessibility and depression feelings only among participants scoring relatively high on attachment anxiety, and that death-thought accessibility mediated the effects of worldview threat and attachment anxiety on feelings of depression. In Study 2 (N = 240), we randomly assigned participants to a mortality salience or a control condition and found that heightened death concerns caused more depression only when a worldview threat was present and participants' attachment anxiety was high. Discussion: The roles that disruption of anxiety buffering systems and death-related concerns play in depression were discussed.

TI  - Land-Use Change and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in an Urbanizing Area of South India: A Population-Based Cohort Study
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: Land-use changes in city fringes due to urbanization can lead to a reduction of greenspace that may reduce its associated health benefits.OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the association between changes in residential surrounding built-up land use and cardiometabolic risk factors in an urbanizing pen -urban area of south India and explored the mediating roles of air pollution, physical activity, and stress in these associations.METHODS: We analyzed data on 6,039 adults from the third follow-up of the Andhra Pradesh Children and Parent Study (APCAPS) cohort (2010-2012). We generated trajectories of change in residential surrounding built-up land use (buffer areas) from 1995-2009 (stable, slow increase, fast increase) using remote sensing data and image classification methods. We estimated associations between built-up land use trajectories and natural log-transformed blood pressure, waist circumference, triglycerides, fasting glucose, and non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol using linear mixed models. We accounted for multiple mediators and the multilevel structure of the data in mediation analyses.RESULTS: We observed positive associations between a fast increase in built-up land use within 300 m of the home and all cardiometabolic risk factors. Compared with participants with stable trajectories, those with the largest increase in built-up land use had 1.5% (95% CI: 0.1, 2.9) higher systolic blood pressure, 2.4% (95% CI: 0.6, 4.3) higher diastolic blood pressure, 2.1% (95% CI: 0.5, 3.8) higher waist circumference, and 1.6% (95% CI: -0.6, 3.8) higher fasting glucose in fully adjusted models. Associations were positive, but not statistically significant, for triglycerides, fasting glucose, and non-HDL cholesterol. Physical activity and ambient particulate matter <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) partially mediated the estimated associations. Associations between fast build-up and all cardiometabolic risk factors except non-HDL cholesterol were stronger in women than men.DISCUSSION: Increases in built-up land use surrounding residences were consistently associated with higher levels of cardiometabolic risk factors. Our findings support the need for better integration of health considerations in urban planning in rapidly urbanizing settings.

TI  - Urban Heat Island Monitoring and Impacts on Citizen's General Health Status in Isfahan Metropolis: A Remote Sensing and Field Survey Approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Urban heat islands (UHIs) are one of the urban management challenges, especially in metropolises, which can affect citizens' health and well-being. This study used a combination of remote sensing techniques with field survey to investigate systematically the effects of UHI on citizens' health in Isfahan metropolis, Iran. For this purpose, the land surface temperature (LST) over a three-year period was monitored by Landsat-8 satellite imagery based on the split window algorithm. Then, the areas where UHI and urban cold island (UCI) phenomena occurred were identified and a general health questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28) was applied to evaluate the health status of 800 citizens in terms of physical health, anxiety and sleep, social function, and depression in UHI and UCI treatments. The average LST during the study period was 45.5 +/- 2.3 degrees C and results showed that the Zayandeh-Rood river and the surrounding greenery had an important role in regulating the ambient temperature and promoting the citizens' health. Citizens living in the suburban areas were more exposed to the UHIs phenomena, and statistical analysis of the GHQ-28 results indicated that they showed severe significant (P < 0.05) responses in terms of non-physical health sub-scales (i.e., anxiety and sleep, social functioning, and depression). Therefore, it can be concluded that not all citizens in the Isfahan metropolis are in the same environmental conditions and city managers and planners should pay more attention to the citizens living in the UHIs. The most important proceedings in this area would be the creation and development of parks and green belts, as well as the allocation of health-medical facilities and citizen education.

TI  - Evaluation of Radial Ocean Surface Currents Derived From Sentinel-1 IW Doppler Shift Using Coastal Radar and Lagrangian Surface Drifter Observations
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS
M3  - Article
AB  - Ocean surface radial velocities (RVLs) derived from the Sentinel-1 A/B Interferomic Wide (IW) mode Doppler frequency shift observations are regularly acquired over the Norwegian coastal zone. These data can be used to complement existing ocean observation systems with high-resolution (up to 1.5 x 1.5 km) spatial ocean surface current (OSC) maps. In this study, Sentinel-1 IW Level 2 OSC retrievals were obtained from 2 months (October-November 2017) of raw Doppler shift observations acquired over the Norwegian Coastal Current (NCC). The results were evaluated using coastal high-frequency radar (HFR) and Lagrangian ocean surface drifter observations. The analysis shows that distinct patterns of the NCC, with range directed currents reaching up to 0.7 m/s, can be detected in the SAR data. The mean bias between Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and HFR observations was -0.08 m/s and the root mean square deviation (RMSD) was 0.25 m/s. In comparison, the agreement between the SAR-derived OSC and the trajectories from Lagrangian surface drifters showed a mean bias of 0.02 m/s and an RMSD of 0.24 m/s. The accuracy of the SAR OSC retrievals rely on precise wind-wave bias correction. Hence, the accuracy of the model wind field (speed and direction) is crucial. The sea state contribution must also be taken into account during the bias correction. A typical required accuracy of the OSC velocity is on the order of 0.1 m/s. Therefore, the comparisons demonstrate that the use of SAR for OSC retrieval is promising.Plain Language Summary Knowledge of ocean surface currents is crucial for tracking oil spills and marine debris (e.g., plastic), search and rescue operations, and fisheries. Traditionally, surface currents are studied using shipboard measurements or trajectory of buoys drifting within the water flow. Despite their accuracy, these measurements are also costly to collect and therefore irregular in time and space. The Doppler shift recorded by a radar placed on board of a satellite can be used for providing systematic snapshots of surface currents over vast areas of the ocean. However, these observations must be evaluated before application. In this study, we evaluated observations of the Norwegian Coastal Current acquired by the Sentinel-1 satellite in October-November 2017. Satellite observations were compared with collocated coastal radar and ocean surface drifters data. The analysis shows that distinct patterns of the surface current can be systematically detected in the Sentinel-1 data. The accuracy of the observations is within the range of user requirements. We underlined the importance of accurate information about wind field and ocean waves for analysis of the radar observation. The performed study demonstrates that the use of Sentinel-1 observations for the ocean surface current retrieval is promising.

TI  - Drawing the baseline of trace element levels in the vulnerable Mediterranean osprey <i>Pandion haliaetus</i>: variations by breeding location, habitats, and egg components
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to its peculiarity to accumulate environmental contaminants, the osprey Pandion haliaetus is a sentinel species for the biomonitoring of contaminants in aquatic ecosystems. Despite this, no information on trace element concentration exists for the Mediterranean area, where relict and vulnerable osprey populations exist. We evaluated the geographical patterns of heavy metals and selenium in osprey eggs from three different populations of the Mediterranean basin (Balearic Islands, Corsica, and Tuscany), to identify any possible contaminant sources. Pattern of metal concentration followed the order: Fe > Zn > Cu > Se > Hg > Pb > Cd. Differences in contaminant concentrations between habitats and among egg components were found. Egg content and inner membrane showed higher mercury levels (1.06 +/- 0.89 and 0.67 +/- 0.62 mg/kg dw, respectively) than those recorded in the eggshell. Mercury concentration was ca. two times higher in marine than in wetland samples, and even higher (3.6 times) when referred to the eggshell. Cu, Fe, Zn, and Se had higher concentration in the inner membrane. We stress how the choice of the biological material can have significant implications for the correct evaluation of contamination. Our study represents a first regional scale survey for the vulnerable Mediterranean osprey populations and provides baseline data for their long-term biomonitoring.

TI  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer: Does response in the breast predict axillary node response?
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: Determining the extent of residual disease in the breast and axilla following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is vital for surgical planning. Traditionally patients with incomplete radiological response in the breast after NACT undergo axillary node clearance, regardless of axillary clinical and radiological response. The aim of this study was to determine whether radiological and/or pathological response in the breast to NACT were predictive of axillary response.Materials and methods: A retrospective cohort study of patients with operable breast cancer with histologically proven axillary lymph node involvement who received NACT and underwent definitive surgical treatment between 1/1/2016 and 31/12/2018 were included. All had MRI and/or US of the breast and axilla before, mid-treatment and at the end of NACT.Results: The 83 patients had a median age of 50 years (range 25-77). MRI had a positive predictive value (PPV) of 52.6% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 81.8% for breast pathological complete response (pCR). For axillary pCR, US had a PPV of 60.0% and NPV of 89.6%. Only 71% of patients had radiological concordance; 15.9% had radiological complete response (rCR) in breast and axilla whilst 55.1% had neither breast nor axillary rCR. 85.6% of patients had pathological concordance (20.5% with breast and axillary pCR: 65.1% with residual disease in both).Conclusion: Radiological and pathological response in the breast to NACT does not accurately predict axillary response. The axilla and the breast should be viewed and assessed as two separate entities for treatment plans.

TI  - Embracing Cubism: Poul Henningsen's Negotiations of Danish National Traditions and International Modernism
T2  - ART HISTORY
M3  - Article
AB  - The Danish architect, designer and cultural critic, Poul Henningsen (1894-1967), was one of the most internationally oriented figures of Danish modernism. During the 1920s, however, he insisted that Danish conditions and traditions were different from elsewhere, and that Danish art and architecture had developed its own way into modernism; that is to say, he subscribed to Danish exceptionalism. Henningsen voiced reservations about Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius; they were too propagandistic and had reduced modernist ideas to a narrow set of stylistic motifs or even fads. His change in conviction in 1930 developed through a somewhat belated re-engagement with cubism, which he understood as an aesthetic and ideologic worldview expressed in art and architecture, design and fashion, and through which he also embraced the international style. Henningsen represents an interesting case study in the continuous negotiations and conflicts around the role of national traditions and international influences in art, design and architecture in Denmark.

TI  - Fusion of Remote Sensing and Applied Geophysics for Sinkholes Identification in Tabular Middle Atlas of Morocco (the Causse of El Hajeb): Impact on the Protection of Water Resource
T2  - RESOURCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - The Causse of El Hajeb belongs to the Tabular Middle Atlas (TMA), in which thousands of karst landforms have been identified. Among them, collapse dolines and dissolution sinkholes have been highlighted as a source of environmental risks and geo-hazards. In particular, such sinkholes have been linked to the degradation of water quality in water springs located in the junction of the TMA and Saiss basin. Furthermore, the developments of collapse dolines in agricultural and inhabited areas enhance the risk of life loss, injury, and property damage. Here, the lack of research on newly formed cavities has exacerbated the situation. The limited studies using remote sensing or geophysical methods to determine the degree of karstification and vulnerability of this environment fail to provide the spatial extent and depth location of individual karst cavities. In order to contribute to the effort of sinkhole risk reduction in TMA, we employed remote sensing and geophysical surveys to integrate electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and self-potential (SP) for subsurface characterization of four sinkholes identified in the Causse of El Hajeb. The results revealed the existence of sinkholes, both visible and non-accessible at the surface, in carbonate rocks. The sinkholes exhibited distinct morphologies, with depths reaching 35 m. Topography, geographic coordinates and land cover information extracted on remote sensing data demonstrated that these cavities were developed in depressions in which agricultural activities are regularly performed. The fusion of these methods benefits from remote sensing in geophysical surveys, particularly in acquisition, georeferencing, processing and interpretation of geophysical data. Furthermore, our proposed method allows identification of the protection perimeter required to minimize the risks posed by sinkholes.

TI  - Detection of Changes in Land Cover and Land Surface Temperature Using Multi Temporal Landsat Data
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover changes and land surface temperature have rose in the tropical regions of Myanmar especially in the surrounding areas of Magway city due to the rapid growth of urban sprawl. This study investigated the patterns of land cover and the trend of land surface temperature in Magway city area between 1989 and 2017. For this purpose, Landsat 5 TM and Landsat 8 OLI were used and land surface temperatures (LST) were calculated through thermal data with Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). After obtaining the land cover map by using maximum likelihood algorithm for each study period, the accuracy of this map was tested using 100 ground checkpoints in an error matrix. A statistical analysis of the results showed the increase of the built-up area by 11.7% and the decline of the vegetation area by 19.7% from 1989 to 2017. Moreover, land surface temperature has risen by 4 degrees C during this 28 years period. Therefore, this study is intended to help the Magway city development council plan effective land cover management in the future.

TI  - Ultrasound guided surgery under Dilutional Local Anaesthesia and no sedation in breast cancer patients
T2  - SURGEON-JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL COLLEGES OF SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH AND IRELAND
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast cancer surgery under local anaesthesia (LA) can be challenging due to limitation of dose and quantity of anaesthetic agent that can be used safely. Elderly patients with breast cancer and with multiple co-morbidities are often prevented from having a standard treatment as they are considered unfit for general anaesthesia. We describe a technique of surgery under local anaesthesia without sedation that employs dilution to generate large volumes of LA and infiltration under ultrasound guidance.Methods: We present a case series by a single surgeon of breast cancer patients who underwent surgery under LA. 40 mls of 1% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline was diluted with 160 mis of normal saline to make a total of 200 mis, resulting in dilution to a concentration of 0.2% lignocaine. Radioactive isotope having been injected before patient's arrival in theatre, 1 ml of diluted anaesthetic solution is used with 2 mis of 2.5% patent blue to inject in the sub-areolar space. Local anaesthetic is infiltrated at operative site under ultrasound guidance using a long echogenic needle.Results: A total of 71 patients with breast cancer underwent surgery under the LA between September 2015 and October 2018. 64 (90%) patients had wide local excisions and 7 (10%) had mastectomies. All had axillary surgery, 65 (91.5%) had dual technique sentinel lymph node biopsy as a day case and 6 (8.5%) patients had axillary clearance. 8 patients had re excision (12.5%). All patients had '0' pain score and no postoperative analgesia was required in recovery. Local anaesthetic used did not exceed the maximum safe dose in any of the cases. One patient returned to theatre for postoperative wound bleeding. No other postoperative complication was observed.Conclusion: Ultrasound guided infiltration allows accurate placement of large volume of diluted local anaesthetic solution safely and provides effective anaesthesia.

TI  - Bias Correction of Multi-sensor Total Column Ozone Satellite Data for 1978-2017
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY OF JAPAN
M3  - Article
AB  - This study constructs a merged total column ozone (TCO) dataset using 20 available satellite Level 2 TCO (L2SAT) datasets over 40 years from 1978 to 2017. The individual 20 datasets and the merged TCO dataset are corrected against ground-based Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometer TCO (GD) measurements. Two bias correction methods are used: simple linear regression (SLR) as a function of time and multiple linear regression (MLR) as a function of time, solar zenith angle, and effective ozone temperature. All of the satellite datasets are consistent with GD within +/- 2-3 %, except for some degraded data from the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer/Earth Probe during a period of degraded calibration and from the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite (OMPS) provided from NOAA at an early stage of measurements. OMPS data provided from NASA show fairly stable L2SAT-GD differences. The Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment/MetOp-A and -B datasets show abrupt changes of approximately 8 DU coincident with the change of retrieval algorithm. For the TCO merged datasets created by averaging all coincident data located within a grid cell from the 20 satellite-borne TCO datasets, the differences between corrected and uncorrected TCOs by MLR are generally positive at lower latitudes where the bias correction increases TCO because of low effective ozone temperature. In the trend analysis, the difference between corrected and uncorrected TCO trends by MLR shows clear seasonal and latitudinal dependency, whereas such seasonal and latitudinal dependency is lost by SLR. The root mean square difference of L2SAT-GD for the uncorrected merged datasets, 8.6 DU, is reduced to 8.4 DU after correction using SLR and MLR. Therefore, the empirically corrected merged TCO datasets that are converted into time-series homogenization with high temporal-resolution are suitable as a data source for trend analyses as well as assimilation for long-term reanalysis.

TI  - Spatiotemporal Variability of Soil Organic Carbon Content Over India Based on an Ecosystem Model and Regional Databases
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A study on spatiotemporal variability of soil organic carbon content (SOC) over India is carried out based on a remote sensing data-driven terrestrial ecosystem model and the regional databases. The model is initialized with the equilibrated solutions corresponding to undisturbed balanced biosphere condition and then marched forward with realistic forcing for the recent decades. Both the model solution and regional data show a good agreement between them with a large SOC values with mean 12 kg m(-2) for the forest and cropland-dominated regions, a moderate value (8 kg m(-2)) for the mixed shrub and grassland, and small for the grassland regions (4 kg m(-2)) correspondingly for 30 m upper active layer of the soil. The model SOC shows a significant seasonal variability across all the vegetation types with peak value during spring season (March-April) and trough during the autumn (September-October). The SOC budget of the country is around 13 Pg for the top active layer of the soil. It has shown a significant increasing trend of 22 Tg year(-1) for the study period resulted from the positive growth rate of 25 Tg year(-1) for the cropland and negative growth rate of 3 Tg year(-1) for the forest region. The extrapolated annual national SOC budget is 25 Pg correspondingly for 1 m depth soil layer.

TI  - Comparative Study Regarding the Properties of Methylene Blue and Proflavine and Their Optimal Concentrations for In Vitro and In Vivo Applications
T2  - DIAGNOSTICS
M3  - Review
AB  - Methylene blue and proflavine are fluorescent dyes used to stain nucleic acid from the molecular level to the tissue level. Already clinically used for sentinel node mapping, detection of neuroendocrine tumors, methemoglobinemia, septic shock, ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, and photodynamic inactivation of RNA viruses, the antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effect of methylene blue has been demonstrated in different in vitro and in vivo studies. Proflavine was used as a disinfectant and bacteriostatic agent against many gram-positive bacteria, as well as a urinary antiseptic involved in highlighting cell nuclei. At the tissue level, the anti-inflammatory effects of methylene blue protect against pulmonary, renal, cardiac, pancreatic, ischemic-reperfusion lesions, and fevers. First used for their antiseptic and antiviral activity, respectively, methylene blue and proflavine turned out to be excellent dyes for diagnostic and treatment purposes. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that both dyes are efficient as perfusion and tissue tracers and permitted to evaluate the minimal efficient concentration in different species, as well as their pharmacokinetics and toxicity. This review aims to identify the optimal concentrations of methylene blue and proflavine that can be used for in vivo experiments to highlight the vascularization of the skin in the case of a perforasome (both as a tissue tracer and in vascular mapping), as well as their effects on tissues. This review is intended to be a comparative and critical presentation of the possible applications of methylene blue (MB) and proflavine (PRO) in the surgical field, and the relevant biomedical findings from specialized literature to date are discussed as well.

TI  - Micrometeorological measurements in an arid environment: Diurnal characteristics and surface energy balance closure
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - The goal of this study is to assess the surface energy balance closure (SEBC) in an arid environment through a comprehensive analysis of surface radiation, heat fluxes, and other micrometeorological measurements. These were taken from a 2.3-m eddy covariance (EC) flux tower at Al Ain (24 degrees 16'26.5535 '' N, 55 degrees 37'03.2196 '' E; 243 m a.m.s.l.) during the periods April - October 2017 and February 2018 - January 2019. The SEBC is investigated on seasonal and diurnal time-scales using the Energy Balance Ratio (EBR) and residual flux (Delta E) values. An analyses of the SEBC reveals that during daytime a three-way balance between the sensible heat, ground heat fluxes and the net surface radiative flux prevails, while at night the last two essentially balance each other. These fluxes are roughly 25% larger in the summer compared to the winter season. The surface downward shortwave radiation flux and latent heat flux peak in spring, despite the latter having rather small magnitudes (< 20 W m(-2)) throughout the year. The EBR during daytime is in the range 0.60 to 0.75. The mean Delta E during daytime (nighttime) is 30 W m(-2) (-14 W m(-2)) respectively. Further analysis of the SEBC with respect to the prevailing wind direction revealed that the maximum closure is observed for north-northwesterly winds and the minimum for southerly winds. This may be explained by the surface heterogeneity and the presence of a building to the south of the site. The SEBC is better for daytime and for periods when the friction velocity is higher.

TI  - Multi-variable calibration of hydrological model in the upper Omo-Gibe basin, Ethiopia
T2  - ACTA GEOPHYSICA
M3  - Article
AB  - The calibration of any hydrological model in any river basin is generally performed using a single hydrological variable. Spatially distributed hydrological modeling provides an opportunity to enhance the use of multi-variable calibration models. The objective of this study is to test the efficiency of satellite-based actual evapotranspiration in the HBV hydrological model to render the catchment water balance using multi-variable calibration in the upper Omo-Gibe basin in Ethiopia. Five years (2000-2004) meteorological data, streamflow, and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) based on remote sensing were used for calibration and validation purposes. The performance of the HBV model and the efficiency of SEBS-ETa were evaluated using certain calibration criteria (objective function). The model is first calibrated using only streamflow data to test HBV model performance and then calibrated using a multi-variable (streamflow and ETa) dataset to evaluate the efficiency of SEBS-ETa. Both model setups were validated in a multi-variable evaluation using streamflow and ETa data. In the first case, the model performed well enough for streamflow and poor for ETa, while in the latter case, the performance efficiency of SEBS-ETa and streamflow data shows satisfactory to good. This implies that the performance of hydrological models is enhanced by employing multi-variable calibration.

TI  - Assessment of TerraClass and MapBiomas data on legend and map agreement for the Brazilian Amazon biome
T2  - ACTA AMAZONICA
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable environmental monitoring and evaluation require high-quality maps of land use and land cover. For the Amazon biome, the TerraClass and MapBiomas projects apply different methodologies to create these maps. We evaluated the agreement between land cover and land use maps generated by TerraClass and MapBiomas (Collections 2 and 3) for the Brazilian Amazon biome, from 2004 to 2014. Specifically, we: (1) described both project legends based on the LCCS (Land Cover Classification System); (2) analyzed the differences between their classes; and (3) compared the mapping differences among the Brazilian states that are totally or partially covered by the Amazon biome. We compared the classifications with a per-pixel approach and performed an evaluation based on agreement matrices. The overall agreement between the projects was 87.4% (TerraClass x MapBiomas 2) and 92.0% (TerraClass x MapBiomas 3). We analyzed methodological differences to explain the disagreements in class identification. We conclude that using these maps together without a properly adapted legend is not recommended for the analysis of land use and land cover change. Depending on the application, one mapping system may be more suitable than the other.

TI  - Intensity Simulation of a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper introduces an intensity simulation for the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer whose core element is the Michelson interferometer to provide support for the on-orbit monitoring of the instrument and to improve the data processing and application of the Fourier transform spectrometer. The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Imager (GIIRS) aboard on Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) satellite, which will be launched in 2020, aims to provide hyperspectral infrared observations. An intensity simulation of the Michelson interferometer based on the GIIRS's instrument parameters is systematically analyzed in this paper. Off-axis effects and non-linearity response are two important factors to be considered in this simulation. Off-axis effects mainly cause the wavenumber shift to induce a large brightness temperature error compared with the input spectrum, and the non-linearity response reduces the energy received by the detector. Then, off-axis effects and a non-linearity response are added to the input spectrum successively to obtain the final spectrum. Off-axis correction and non-linearity correction are also developed to give a full simulation process. Comparing the corrected spectrum with the input spectrum, we can see that the brightness temperature errors have a magnitude of 10(-3) K, and this fully proves the reliability and rationality of the whole simulation process.

TI  - Exploring temperature indices by deriving relationship between land surface temperature and urban landscape
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global warming and climate change are two indispensable phenomena that cannot be overlooked. These can be inferred to the unrelenting rise in surface temperature globally. Unplanned and speedy urbanization is one of the foremost causes of surface temperature rise as it alters the landscape. Urbanization defines the socio-economic value of city and management but if inadvertent, it can lead to serious insinuations on environmental parameters. As a result of globalization and industrialization, a sheer increase in population was observed due to migration, improved health facilities, better job opportunities and superior living standards. It is necessary to inculcate the demand of these rising urban dwellers in the form of infrastructure, energy, clean air and water. As a result of this, landscape restructuring befalls that can be understood by conversion of green or open spaces into concrete structures. This alters the surface properties causing changes in latent and sensible heat flux leading to increased surface temperature as well as ambient air temperatures. With clustered urban spaces and decrease in vegetation cover and water that acts as sinks, the temperature of urban region shoots more than nearby rural areas leading to the development of urban heat islands. These parameters are directly and indirectly related to air pollution, increased summer days, energy requirement, heat-related diseases, emission of GHGs (greenhouse gases). The communication focuses on the recent challenges and criticism faced by developing Indian cities with very minimum landscape to house burgeoning population, immediate strategies and action-plan required to tackle increasing temperatures and mitigate negative environmental impacts and effects on human beings. The study is an attempt to establish a relationship between surface temperature and land use pattern for Kolkata Metropolitan Area. Study also deals with the estimation of various temperature indices for defining and understanding the variation in surface temperature precisely. Application of these results will help in developing necessary policy measures and sustainable actions that are required to reduce anthropogenic effects on urban and natural environment.

TI  - Estimating oak forest parameters in the western mountains of Iran using satellite-based vegetation indices
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing is an important tool for studying and modeling forest stands. Vegetation indices obtained from Landsat-8 remotely sensed data were used to estimate the forest parameters in the western mountains of Iran. Thirty-four sample points were selected on the map of Bayangan County, Kermanshah province, Iran. At each point, a cluster of five rectangular plots of 8100 m(2) and 200 m apart was established. Some clusters were primarily sampled to determine the variance of the forest parameters. The coefficient of variation was used as a criterion for sample allocation. Stand density, canopy cover and basal area per hectare were calculated for each plot. Vegetation indices were extracted from the Landsat-8 images for each plot. Simple linear and nonlinear regressions were conducted to develop the models. The models were validated using an independent data set. Stability of model parameters was statistically evaluated. The results showed that Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and Transformed normalized difference vegetation index (TNDVI) followed by Simple ratio vegetation index (SRVI) were the best predictors, explaining up to 91% of the variations with high precision. For NDVI, Soil adjusted vegetation index 2 (SAVI2) and SRVI, the cubic model was more appropriate than the linear model for predicting the forest parameters. For this model, the R-square value increased while NRMSE decreased significantly. For Infrared percentage vegetation index (IPVI), the quadratic model was better, but, for other vegetation indices, nonlinear models were not superior to linear ones. Finally, it can be concluded that Landsat-8 imagery is suitable for predicting forest parameters in the oak forests of western Iran. Of course, large plots must be selected, and pre-classification is necessary to gain accurate and precise estimations.

TI  - Application of Fluorescent Dyes in Visceral Surgery: State of the Art and Future Perspectives
T2  - VISCERAL MEDICINE
M3  - Review
AB  - Background: Through the improvement and implementation of advanced intraoperative imaging, the indications for intraoperative fluorescence have spread to various fields of visceral surgery. Indocyanine green (ICG)-based fluorescence angiography and the imaging systems using this certain dye are currently the cornerstone of intraoperative, fluorescence-based medical imaging. Summary: The article focuses on principles and approaches of intraoperative fluorescence in general surgery. The current clinical practice of intraoperative fluorescence and its evidence are described. Emerging new fields of application are put in a perspective. Furthermore, the technique and possible pit-falls in the performance of intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography are described in this review article. Key Messages: Overall growing evidence suggests that intraoperative fluorescence imaging delivers valuable additional information to the surgeon, which might help to perform surgery more exactly and reduce perioperative complications. Perfusion assessment can be a helpful tool when performing critical anastomoses. There is evidence from prospective and randomized trials for the benefit of intraoperative ICG fluorescence angiography during esophageal reconstruction, colorectal surgery, and surgery for mesenteric ischemia. Most studies suggest the administration of 2.5-10 mg of ICG. Standardized settings and documentation are essential. The benefit of ICG fluorescence imaging for gastrointestinal sentinel node detection and detection of liver tumors and colorectal metastases of the liver cannot clearly be estimated duo to the small number of prospective studies. Critical points in the use of intraoperative fluorescence imaging remain the low standardization and reproducibility of the results and the associated difficulty in comparing the results of the existing trials. Furthermore, little is known about the influence of hemodynamic parameters on the quantitative assessment of ICG fluorescence during surgery.

TI  - Change Detection and Land Suitability Analysis for Extension of Potential Forest Areas in Indonesia Using Satellite Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The objective of this research was to detect changes in forest areas and, subsequently, the potential forest area that can be extended in the South Sumatra province of Indonesia, according to the Indonesian forest resilience classification zones. At first, multispectral satellite remote sensing datasets from Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI were classified into four classes, namely urban, vegetation, forest and waterbody to develop Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) maps for the year 2003 and 2018. Secondly, criteria, namely distance from rivers, distance from roads, elevation, LULC and settlements were selected and the reclassified maps were produced from each of the criteria for the land suitability analysis for forest extension. Thirdly, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was incorporated to add expert opinions to prioritize the criteria referring to potential areas for forest extension. In the change detection analysis, Tourism Recreation Forest (TRF), Convertible Protection Forest (CPF) and Permanent Production Forest (PPF) forest zones had a decrease of 20%, 13% and 40% in area, respectively, in the forest class from 2003 to 2018. The Limited Production Forest (LPF) zone had large changes and decreased by 72% according to the LULC map. In the AHP method, the influential criteria had higher weights and ranked as settlements, elevation, distance from roads and distance from rivers. CPF, PPF and LPF have an opportunity for extension in the highly suitable classification (30%) and moderately suitable classification (41%) areas, to increase coverage of production forests. Wildlife Reserve Forests (WRFs) have potential for expansion in the highly suitable classification (30%) and moderately suitable classification (52%) areas, to keep biodiversity and ecosystems for wildlife resources. Nature Reserve Forests (NRFs) have an opportunity for extension in the highly suitable classification (39%) and moderately suitable classification (48%) areas, to keep the forests for nature and biodiversity. In case of TRF, there is limited scope to propose a further extension and is required to be managed with collaboration between the government and the community.

AB  - High-resolution airborne electromagnetic (AEM) remote sensing data have been used for the quantification of hydrological properties of a catchment-scale clay-sand-gravel aquifer. The AEM data have been integrated with limited ground-based electrical resistivity and borehole data to infer the sub-surface electrical conductivity distribution. By using theoretical models to connect microscale electrical properties with macroscale conductivity inferred from the AEM data, it is possible to estimate the in situ porosity distribution in clay-sand-gravel mixtures after calibration with measurements of cation exchange capacity, grain size distribution and pore fluid salinity at a borehole. The approach provides constraints on the estimation of a three-dimensional hydraulic conductivity distribution at catchment scale using models linking grain size distribution, porosity and electrical conductivity with hydraulic conductivity. The AEM data have assisted with the identification and quantification of groundwater resources in a clay-sand-gravel aquifer but require calibration even if this consists only of limited surface electrical resistivity, electromagnetic and hydrogeological data.

TI  - Deep learning Using Physically-Informed Input Data for Wetland Identification
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING & SOFTWARE
M3  - Article
AB  - Automated and accurate wetland identification algorithms are increasingly important for wetland conservation and environmental planning. Deep learning for wetland identification is an emerging field that shows promise for advancing these efforts. Deep learning is unique to traditional machine learning techniques for its ability to consider the spatial context of object characteristics within a landscape scene. However, applying deep learning typically requires very large datasets for training the algorithms, which limits their application for many environmental applications including wetland identification. Using four study sites across Virginia with field delineated wetlands, we provide insight into the potential for deep learning for wetland detection from limited, but typical, wetland delineation training data. Our proposed workflow performs a wetland semantic segmentation using DeepNets, a deep learning architecture for remote sensing data, and an input dataset consisting of high-resolution topographic indices and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index. Results show that models trained and evaluated for a single site were able to achieve high accuracy (up to 91% recall and 56% precision) and similar accuracy can be obtained for models trained across multiple sites (up to 91% recall and 57% precision). Through this analysis we found that, across all sites, input data configurations taking advantage of hydrologic properties derived from elevation data consistently outperformed models using the elevation data directly, showing the benefit of physically-informed inputs in deep learning training for wetland identification. By refining the wetland identification workflow presented in this paper and collecting additional training data across landscapes, there is potential for deep learning algorithms to support a range wetland conservation efforts.

TI  - Spatial and Temporal Variation of Aerosol and Water Vapour Effects on Solar Radiation in the Mediterranean Basin during the Last Two Decades
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to calculate and analyse the spatial and temporal variation of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) and precipitable water vapour (PWV) and their effects on solar radiation at the surface in the Mediterranean basin, one of the maritime areas with the largest aerosol loads in the world. For the achievement of this objective, a novel and validated methodology was applied. Satellite data, specifically CERES (Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System) SYN1deg products during the period 2000-2018, were used. Results show that the spatial distribution of AOT and PWV are closely linked to the spatial distributions of its effects on solar radiation. These effects are negative, indicating a reduction of solar radiation reaching the surface due to aerosol and water vapour effects. This reduction ranges between 2% and 8% for AOT, 11.5% and 15% for PWV and 14% and 20% for the combined effect. The analysis of the temporal distribution has focused on the detection of trends from their anomalies. This study has contributed to a better understanding of AOT and PWV effects on solar radiation over the Mediterranean basin, one of the most climatically sensitive regions of the planet, and highlighted the importance of water vapour.

AB  - BackgroundPatients with grade 3, deeply invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma are typically managed with primary surgery. The role and type of adjuvant therapy used is controversial. We sought to evaluate the role of adjuvant radiation and/or chemotherapy in women with deeply invasive grade 3 endometrioid tumors.MethodsA multi-center retrospective chart review was performed at three large medical institutions in the United States. Patients with grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma invading >50% of the myometrium were included. Medical records were queried to evaluate whether lymph node assessment was performed, the status of the lymph nodes, adjuvant treatment strategy used, and dates of death or recurrence.ResultsBetween 1984 and 2013, 257 patients were identified with a median follow-up of 3.08 years. Most patients (84.7%) had evaluation of pelvic and/or para-aortic lymph nodes and 43% had positive lymph nodes. For node negative patients, there was no difference in overall survival (OS) between those who received adjuvant pelvic radiation +/- vaginal brachytherapy (n=52) vs brachytherapy alone (n=46) (5-year probabilities were 0.73 vs 0.70, P=0.729). Among patients with positive lymph nodes (n=92), the adjuvant treatment strategy utilized impacted OS, with women undergoing a combination of chemotherapy and external beam radiation having the best outcomes (P=0.003).ConclusionsAmong women with grade 3, deeply invasive endometrioid adenocarcinoma, vaginal cuff brachytherapy alone resulted in similar survival when compared with pelvic radiation in node negative patients. The combination of chemotherapy with external beam radiation was associated with improved OS for women with positive nodes.

TI  - Vehicle and Vessel Detection on Satellite Imagery: A Comparative Study on Single-Shot Detectors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of automatic small object detection, such as vehicles and vessels, in satellite imagery with a spatial resolution between 0.3 and 0.5 m. The main challenges of this task are the small objects, as well as the spread in object sizes, with objects ranging from 5 to a few hundred pixels in length. We first annotated 1500 km(2), making sure to have equal amounts of land and water data. On top of this dataset we trained and evaluated four different single-shot object detection networks: YOLOV2, YOLOV3, D-YOLO and YOLT, adjusting the many hyperparameters to achieve maximal accuracy. We performed various experiments to better understand the performance and differences between the models. The best performing model, D-YOLO, reached an average precision of 60% for vehicles and 66% for vessels and can process an image of around 1 Gpx in 14 s. We conclude that these models, if properly tuned, can thus indeed be used to help speed up the workflows of satellite data analysts and to create even bigger datasets, making it possible to train even better models in the future.

M3  - Proceedings Paper

AB  - The slopes of the Ardre valley, which cuts deeply into the Soissonnais plateau, have evolved by camber. The analysis of the surface structure deriving from this process is based on a double approach: geophysics - electrical resistivity profiles obtained by gradient method, and remote sensing - calculation and interpretation of surface reflectance (Sentinel -2 satellite imagery). The crossing of the two methods, supplemented by field observations, makes it possible to reconstitute the cross-section and plan distribution of the blocks of Middle Lutetian limestone draping the slopes. The diversity of the camber facies is explained by the variation in structural and hydrogeological parameters. This process determines a specific: transverse profile, associating a narrow valley bottom with long and gently sloping slopes.The valley sides of the Ardre River, which deeply incised the plateau of Soissonnais, exhibit typical cambering features. Analysis of the superficial structure resulting from the cambering process is based on a geophysical approach - electrical resistivity tomography, and on remote sensing assessments - measurement and interpretation of surface reflectance (satellite imagery Sentinel -2). The simultaneous use of both methods, completed by field observations, allows the Lutetian calcareous slabs plan and cross-sectional repartition to be reconstructed. The diversity of cambering facies is explained by the spatial variation of the structural and hyclrogeological parameters. Valley -side cambering leads to a particular cross sectional profile that associates narrow valley floor and long and gently sloping valley sides. Cambering process, associated with valley downcutting, and requiring an excess in the hydrological balance, is no longer active. Cambering features are inherited landforms, and the valley slopes are stable.

TI  - GIS-Based Modeling for Selection of Dam Sites in the Kurdistan Region, Iraq
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Iraq, a country in the Middle East, has suffered severe drought events in the past two decades due to a significant decrease in annual precipitation. Water storage by building dams can mitigate drought impacts and assure water supply. This study was designed to identify suitable sites to build new dams within the Al-Khabur River Basin (KhRB). Both the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the weighted sum method (WSM) were used and compared to select suitable dam sites. A total of 14 layers were used as input dataset (i.e., lithology, tectonic zones, distance to active faults, distance to lineaments, soil type, land cover, hypsometry, slope gradient, average precipitation, stream width, Curve Number Grid, distance to major roads, distance to towns and cities, and distance to villages). Landsat-8/Operational Land Imager (OLI) and QuickBird optical images were used in the study. Three types of accuracies were tested: overall, suitable pixels by number, and suitable pixels by weight. Based on these criteria, we determined that 11 sites are suitable for locating dams for runoff harvesting. Results were compared to the location of 21 preselected dams proposed by the Ministry of Agricultural and Water Resources (MAWR). Three of these dam sites coincide with those proposed by the MAWR. The overall accuracies of the 11 dams ranged between 76.2% and 91.8%. The two most suitable dam sites are located in the center of the study area, with favorable geology, adequate storage capacity, and in close proximity to the population centers. Of the two selection methods, the AHP method performed better as its overall accuracy is greater than that of the WSM. We argue that when stream discharge data are not available, use of high spatial resolution QuickBird imageries to determine stream width for discharge estimation is acceptable and can be used for preliminary dam site selection. The study offers a valuable and relatively inexpensive tool to decision-makers for eliminating sites having severe limitations (less suitable sites) and focusing on those with the least restriction (more suitable sites) for dam construction.

TI  - Effectiveness of Sentinel-2 in Multi-Temporal Post-Fire Monitoring When Compared with UAV Imagery
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become popular in recent years and are now used in a wide variety of applications. This is the logical result of certain technological developments that occurred over the last two decades, allowing UAVs to be equipped with different types of sensors that can provide high-resolution data at relatively low prices. However, despite the success and extraordinary results achieved by the use of UAVs, traditional remote sensing platforms such as satellites continue to develop as well. Nowadays, satellites use sophisticated sensors providing data with increasingly improving spatial, temporal and radiometric resolutions. This is the case for the Sentinel-2 observation mission from the Copernicus Programme, which systematically acquires optical imagery at high spatial resolutions, with a revisiting period of five days. It therefore makes sense to think that, in some applications, satellite data may be used instead of UAV data, with all the associated benefits (extended coverage without the need to visit the area). In this study, Sentinel-2 time series data performances were evaluated in comparison with high-resolution UAV-based data, in an area affected by a fire, in 2017. Given the 10-m resolution of Sentinel-2 images, different spatial resolutions of the UAV-based data (0.25, 5 and 10 m) were used and compared to determine their similarities. The achieved results demonstrate the effectiveness of satellite data for post-fire monitoring, even at a local scale, as more cost-effective than UAV data. The Sentinel-2 results present a similar behavior to the UAV-based data for assessing burned areas.

TI  - Seamless retrievals of chlorophyll-<i>a</i> from Sentinel-2 (MSI) and Sentinel-3 (OLCI) in inland and coastal waters: A machine-learning approach
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Consistent, cross-mission retrievals of near-surface concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chla) in various aquatic ecosystems with broad ranges of trophic levels have long been a complex undertaking. Here, we introduce a machine-learning model, the Mixture Density Network (MDN), that largely outperforms existing algorithms when applied across different bio-optical regimes in inland and coastal waters. The model is trained and validated using a sizeable database of co-located Chla measurements (n = 2943) and in situ hyperspectral radiometric data resampled to simulate the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) and the Ocean and Land Color Imager (OLCI) onboard Sentinel-2A/B and Sentinel-3A/B, respectively. Our performance evaluations of the model, via two-thirds of the in situ dataset with Chla ranging from 0.2 to 1209 mg/m(3) and a mean Chla of 21.7 mg/m(3), suggest significant improvements in Chla retrievals. For both MSI and OLCI, the mean absolute logarithmic error (MAE) and logarithmic bias (Bias) across the entire range reduced by 40-60%, whereas the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) and the median absolute percentage error (MAPE) improved two-to-three times over those from the state-of-the-art algorithms. Using independent Chla matchups (n < 800) for Sentinel-2A/B and -3A, we show that the MDN model provides most accurate products from recorded images processed via three different atmospheric correction processors, namely the SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS), POLYMER, and ACOLITE, though the model is found to be sensitive to uncertainties in remote-sensing reflectance products. This manuscript serves as a preliminary study on a machine-learning algorithm with potential utility in seamless construction of Chla data records in inland and coastal waters, i.e., harmonized, comparable products via a single algorithm for MSI and OLCI data processing. The model performance is anticipated to enhance by improving the global representativeness of the training data as well as simultaneous retrievals of multiple optically active components of the water column.

TI  - Model-Based Reduced-Rank Pansharpening
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Observation of the Earth using satellites mounted with optical sensors is an important application of remote sensing. Owing to physical constraints, multispectral (MS) sensors acquire images of lower spatial resolution than a single-band panchromatic (PAN) sensor that acquires images of the same scene. Pansharpening fuses the MS and PAN images to obtain an MS image with the same spatial resolution as the PAN image. In this letter, we propose to expand a method, initially developed for Sentinel-2 single-sensor sharpening, for pansharpening. The expanded method is based on solving a non-convex MS acquisition model using optimization methods based on cyclic decent and manifold optimization. The tuning parameters of the method are chosen using Bayesian optimization with reduced-scale evaluation. The proposed method is compared with a number of established pansharpening methods and is validated using both synthetic and real data sets.

TI  - Semantic Labeling in Remote Sensing Corpora Using Feature Fusion-Based Enhanced Global Convolutional Network with High-Resolution Representations and Depthwise Atrous Convolution
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - One of the fundamental tasks in remote sensing is the semantic segmentation on the aerial and satellite images. It plays a vital role in applications, such as agriculture planning, map updates, route optimization, and navigation. The state-of-the-art model is the Enhanced Global Convolutional Network (GCN152-TL-A) from our previous work. It composes two main components: (i) the backbone network to extract features and (ii) the segmentation network to annotate labels. However, the accuracy can be further improved, since the deep learning network is not designed for recovering low-level features (e.g., river, low vegetation). In this paper, we aim to improve the semantic segmentation network in three aspects, designed explicitly for the remotely sensed domain. First, we propose to employ a modern backbone network called "High-Resolution Representation (HR)" to extract features with higher quality. It repeatedly fuses the representations generated by the high-to-low subnetworks with the restoration of the low-resolution representations to the same depth and level. Second, "Feature Fusion (FF)" is added to our network to capture low-level features (e.g., lines, dots, or gradient orientation). It fuses between the features from the backbone and the segmentation models, which helps to prevent the loss of these low-level features. Finally, "Depthwise Atrous Convolution (DA)" is introduced to refine the extracted features by using four multi-resolution layers in collaboration with a dilated convolution strategy. The experiment was conducted on three data sets: two private corpora from Landsat-8 satellite and one public benchmark from the "ISPRS Vaihingen" challenge. There are two baseline models: the Deep Encoder-Decoder Network (DCED) and our previous model. The results show that the proposed model significantly outperforms all baselines. It is the winner in all data sets and exceeds more than 90% of F1: 0.9114, 0.9362, and 0.9111 in two Landsat-8 and ISPRS Vaihingen data sets, respectively. Furthermore, it achieves an accuracy beyond 90% on almost all classes.

TI  - Cutaneous melanoma in a 9-year-old girl: case report and review of literature
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PAEDIATRIC DERMATOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Melanoma in children is a rare entity with an estimated incidence of one/million/year. Only 1.3% of melanomas reported in the United States of America affect individuals under the age of 20 years, and this neoplasm accounts for only 0.9% of all malignancies in children under the age of 15 years. Melanoma is particularly rare in prepubertal children before the age of 10 years. We present a case of a 9-year-old girl with a melanoma of the right foot. Her sentinel node biopsy was positive for isolated melanoma cells, and none of 5 additional lymph nodes removed following inguinal dissection were found to contain malignant melanoma cells. To our knowledge, this is the youngest melanoma patient recorded in the Greek population. The histological diagnosis of melanoma in this age group can be extremely difficult, and physicians ought to be cautious. The rarity of the disease results in small series of cases from which reliable figures are difficult to obtain. Unfortunately, this also applies to currently available treatments whose effectiveness is unclear.

TI  - A Pathway to the Automated Global Assessment of Water Level in Reservoirs with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Global measurements of reservoir water levels are crucial for understanding Earth's hydrological dynamics, especially in the context of global industrialization and climate change. Although radar altimetry has been used to measure the water level of some reservoirs with high accuracy, it is not yet feasible unless the water body is sufficiently large or directly located at the satellite's nadir. This study proposes a gauging method applicable to a wide range of reservoirs using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar data and a digital elevation model (DEM). The method is straightforward to implement and involves estimating the mean slope-corrected elevation of points along the reservoir shoreline. We test the model on six case studies and show that the estimated water levels are accurate to around 10% error on average of independently verified values. This study represents a substantial step toward the global gauging of lakes and reservoirs of all sizes and in any location where a DEM is available.

TI  - Evaluation on Spectral Analysis in ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Stripmap-ScanSAR Interferometry
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - It is well known that alluvial sediment located in coastal region has been easily affected by geohazard like ground subsidence, marine or meteorological disasters which threaten invaluable lives and properties. The subsidence is a sinking of the ground due to underground material movement that mostly related to soil compaction by water extraction. Thus, continuous monitoring is essential to protect possible damage from the ground subsidence in the coastal region. Radar interferometric application has been widely used to estimate surface displacement from phase information of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Thanks to advanced SAR technique like the Small BAseline Subset (SBAS), a time-series of surface displacement could be successfully calculated with a large amount of SAR observations (>20). Because the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band observations maintain higher coherence compared with other shorter wavelength like X- or C-band, it has been regarded as one of the best resources for Earth science. However, the number of ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 observations might be not enough for the SBAS application due to its global monitoring observation scenario. Unfortunately, the number of the ALOS2 PALSAR-2 Stripmap images in area of our interest, Busan which located in the Southeastern Korea, is only 11 which is insufficient to apply the SBAS time-series analysis. Although it is common that the radar interferometry utilizes multiple SAR images collected from same acquisition mode, it has been reported that the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Stripmap-ScanSAR interferometric application could be possible under specific acquisition mode. In case that we can apply the Stripmap-ScanSAR interferometry with the other 18 ScanSAR observations over Busan, an enhanced time-series surface displacement with better temporal resolution could be estimated. In this study, we evaluated feasibility of the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 Stripmap-ScanSAR interferometric application using Gamma software considering differences of chirp bandwidth and pulse repetition frequency (PRF) between two acquisition modes. In addition, we analyzed the interferograms with respect to spectral shift of radar carrier frequency and common band filtering. Even though it shows similar level of coherence regardless of spectral shift in the radar carrier frequency, we found periodic spectral noises in azimuth direction and significant degradation of coherence in azimuth direction after common band filtering. Therefore, the characteristics of spectral bandwidth in the range and azimuth direction should be considered cautiously for the ALOS2 PALSAR-2 Stripmap-ScanSAR interferometry.

TI  - Recent ENSO influence on East African drought during rainy seasons through the synergistic use of satellite and reanalysis data
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study identified a relationship between the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and East African drought during the two rainy seasons (i.e., short rain from October to December and long rain from March to May). ENSO shows a positive relationship with the East African short rain during the entire period analyzed (1949-2016). Meanwhile, a statistically significant relationship between ENSO and East African long rain appears only in a recent period (2000-2016), which is unprecedented in the past 50 years before the 2000s. The strengthened interannual relationship between ENSO and East African long rain is associated with distinguished Indian Ocean Walker cell in boreal spring, implying that their relationship could be affected by either multidecadal natural variability or anthropogenic forcing. Various satellite-based drought indices which consider vegetation health, land surface temperature, evapotranspiration, and precipitation with 1 km spatial resolution showed a robust relationship between ENSO and East African drought in the recent period (2000-2016) during the both rainy seasons. In the case studies of June 2005, August 2007, and November 2010, the anomalous wet condition in East Africa during the mature phase of El Nino became dry as La Nina developed in the following year, thereby a lagged response was observed in vegetation-related drought indices and long-term meteorological drought indices. Satellite-based high resolution (1 km) drought indices often showed heterogeneous drought patterns under the same drought condition from reanalysis data at coarse resolution (2.5 degrees), indicating the importance of spatiotemporally continuous high-resolution measurements for drought monitoring in East Africa. Consequently, the synergetic use of high resolution satellite observations and reanalysis data is crucial to provide the effective monitoring, assessment, and seasonal outlook of East African drought.

TI  - Separation of Church and Trait: Trait Death Anxiety is Universal, Distressing, and Unbuffered by Worldview in Emerging Adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - We begin with a review of death anxiety in emerging adults and then report on a descriptive survey study using the Revised Livingston-Zimet Death Anxiety Scale (RLZDAS). Research questions dealt with the RLZDAS' factor structure, demographic patterns, and hypothesized correlations with distress and religiosity/spirituality. We surveyed university-enrolled emerging adults (n = 706). Findings included a 3-factor solution on the RLZDAS (cognitive, repressive, and affective) and no appreciable relationships with demographic factors. Clinical symptomatology was correlated with death anxiety (r = .40), particularly cognitive death anxiety (r = .45), especially in non-believers (r = .58). Religiosity/spirituality did not buffer death anxiety, and some components were actually positively correlated. We argue that death anxiety in emerging adults is multidimensional, clinically relevant, and relatively universal and that broad notions of worldview/belief are not necessarily protective factors.

TI  - ROCK-LANDFORM-SOIL RELATIONSHIP FOR GEOMORPHOPEDOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION IN THE REGION OF LAVRA VELHA, OCCIDENTAL CHAPADA DIAMANTINA, BAHIA
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - The Lavra Velha region is situated on the western edge of the Chapada Diamantina and comprised of a crystalline basement and a metasedimentary cover that corresponds to the Ibitiara Granitoid and the Espinhaco Supergroup, respectively. The Chapada Diamantina is internationally recognized for mineral production and tourism, and because of that it has become a constant target for novel research that aims at characterizing its main geological and physiographic aspects. The present work aims at pointing out geomorphopedological associations of the Lavra Velha region by analyzing the interdependence between rock, landform and soil. To this end, geology, geomorphology and pedology data were obtained from literature, remote sensing data and field expeditions. In the studied area, we recognized metasedimentary and crystalline rocks, on which flat to gently undulating landforms beside crests and cliffs developed. Oxisols occur on flat to gently undulating landforms while Entisols, Inceptisols and rock outcrops appear in the aligned crests, cliffs and undulating hills. Alfisols predominate in undulating hills associated with mafic rocks. Features of the landscape show landforms resembling the Appalachian geomorphological model as first described by William Morris Davis, and they suggest landform evolution by geochemical and mechanical erosion under a strong litho-structural control. The geomorphopedological associations allowed the understanding of the relationship between the major elements of the physical environment from Lavra Velha region and, consequently, a predictive model of the rock-landform-soil distribution that can be useful for geomorphopedological mapping of the western edge of the Chapada Diamantina.

TI  - Retrieval of Snow Depth and Snow Water Equivalent Using Dual Polarization SAR Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper deals with the retrieval of snow depth (SD) and snow water equivalent (SWE) using dual-polarization (HH-VV) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The effect of different snowpack conditions on the SD and SWE inversion accuracy was demonstrated by using three TerraSAR-X acquisitions. The algorithm is based on the relationship between the SD, the co-polar phase difference (CPD), and particle anisotropy. The Dhundi observatory in the Indian Himalaya was selected as a validation test site where a field campaign was conducted for ground truth measurements in January 2016. Using the field measured values of the snow parameters, the particle anisotropy has been optimized and provided as an input to the SD retrieval algorithm. A spatially variable snow density (<mml:semantics>rho s</mml:semantics>) was used for the estimation of the SWE, and a temporal resolution of 90 m was achieved in the inversion process. When the retrieval accuracy was tested for different snowpack conditions, it was found that the proposed algorithm shows good accuracy for recrystallized dry snowpack without distinct layering and low wetness (w). The statistical indices, namely, the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute difference (MAD), and percentage error (PE), were used for the accuracy assessment. The algorithm was able to retrieve SD with an average MAE and RMSE of 6.83 cm and 7.88 cm, respectively. The average MAE and RMSE values for SWE were 17.32 mm and 21.41 mm, respectively. The best case PE in the SD and the SWE retrieval were 8.22 cm and 18.85 mm, respectively.

TI  - Mapping soil organic carbon and clay using remote sensing to predict soil workability for enhanced climate change adaptation
T2  - GEODERMA
M3  - Article
AB  - Climate change is presenting sizeable challenges for agricultural production around the world. In some regions, shifting precipitation patterns in the spring and fall are negatively impacting farm operation by reducing the number of "workable days" or the days fields can be worked with heavy equipment without damaging soil structure. This can be particularly problematic for farms on clay soils and/or poor drainage. Approximating a water content threshold at which a soil is not workable due to soil structure destruction can be helpful for planning effective farm operations. In this study, we applied advanced remote sensing and machine learning tools to produce digital maps of soil organic carbon (SOC) and clay (CL) content and used them in existing pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to predict a workability threshold (WT) across a study area in Delta, British Columbia, Canada. We combined field data, soil and vegetation indices derived from multiple Landsat satellite images, topographic indices, and soil survey information to digitally map SOC and CL of the agricultural lands in Delta using random forest (RF) and generalized boosted regression model (GBM). When validated against an independent field dataset, the RF model outperformed GBM for all accuracy measures (coefficient of determination - R-2, concordance correlation coefficient - CCC, and normalized root mean square error - nRMSE). We then spatially applied several PTFs using our digital maps to estimate the plasticity limits of the soil and produce WT map. The WT map was then tested against independent field samples of the soil water content at - 10 kPa and we achieved R-2 of 0.59, CCC of 0.70, and nRMSE of 0.15. Our analysis showed that 40% of the fields in the study area had WT < 30%, a threshold that is already being impacted by reduced workable days. This WT map could be used to improve spatial prioritizations of investments for climate change adaptation at farm to regional scales.

TI  - Dynamics of Ecosystem Water Use Efficiency in Citrus Orchards of Central India Using Eddy Covariance and Landsat Measurements
T2  - ECOSYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate quantification of water use efficiency (WUE) and characterization of its variability across multiple time scales can help to initiate appropriate management measures for cropland ecosystems in response to natural and anthropogenic changes. This study is aimed to understand the diurnal and seasonal patterns in WUE and its dominant controls in the citrus orchards of central India. We used eddy covariance measurements to estimate the evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary product (GPP) fluxes from two crop cycles (2016 and 2017). On a daily scale, ET and GPP exhibited similar patterns, with peaks occurring during the fruit development stage. The daily WUE ranged from 0.22 to 3.39 g C kg(-1) H2O with a mean of 1.77 g C kg(-1) H2O. We observed high interseasonal variability in WUE, which emphasized the need to partition the fluxes between the growth stages. Landsat images were then acquired to characterize the spatiotemporal variability in WUE at the regional scale. Satellite-derived ET, GP and WUE (= GPP/ET) estimates were consistent with ground-based measurements (R-2 > 0.80, n = 16). Eight biophysical indices derived from Landsat were then regressed with WUE estimates to see whether these indices, either independently or in combination, can explain the WUE dynamics in citrus orchards. Our results indicated that the enhanced vegetation index and soil-adjusted vegetation index are strongly related to WUE with correlation strengths greater than 0.75 at all growth stages. We then developed the constitutive relations between WUE and biophysical indices that could be utilized by water managers to improve crop water productivity in response to changing agro-climatic conditions.

TI  - Multi-Scale and Multi-Dimensional Time Series InSAR Characterizing of Surface Deformation over Shandong Peninsula, China
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Shandong peninsula, the largest peninsula of China, is prone to severe land subsidence hazards along the coastline. In this paper, we provide, for the first time, multi-scale and multi-dimensional time series deformation measurements of the entire Shandong peninsula with advanced time series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) techniques. We derive the spatiotemporal evolutions of the land subsidence by integrating multi-track Sentinel-1A/B and RADARSAT-2 satellite images. InSAR measurements are cross validated by the independent deformation rate results generated from different SAR tracks, reaching a precision of less than 1.3 cm/a. Two-dimensional time series over the Yellow River Delta (YRD) from 2017 to 2019 are revealed by integrating time series InSAR measurements from both descending and ascending tracks. Land subsidence zones are mainly concentrated on the YRD. In total, twelve typical localized subsidence zones are identified in the cities of Dongying (up to 290 mm/a; brine and groundwater exploitation for industrial usage), Weifang (up to 170 mm/a; brine exploitation for industrial usage), Qingdao (up to 70 mm/a; aquaculture and land reclamation), Yantai (up to 50 mm/a; land reclamation) and Rizhao (up to 60 mm/a; land reclamation). The causal factors of localized ground deformation are discussed, encompassing groundwater and brine exploitation, aquaculture and land reclamation. Multi-scale surveys of spatiotemporal deformation evolution and mechanism analysis are critical to make decisions on underground fluid exploitation and land reclamation.

TI  - Estimating Water pH Using Cloud-Based Landsat Images for a New Classification of the Nhecolandia Lakes (Brazilian Pantanal)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Nhecolandia region, located in the southern portion of the Pantanal wetland area, is a unique lacustrine system where tens of thousands of saline-alkaline and freshwater lakes and ponds coexist in close proximity. These lakes are suspected to be a strong source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere, the water pH being one of the key factors in controlling the biogeochemical functioning and, consequently, production and emission of GHGs in these lakes. Here, we present a new field-validated classification of the Nhecolandia lakes using water pH values estimated based on a cloud-based Landsat (5 TM, 7 ETM+, and 8 OLI) 2002-2017 time-series in the Google Earth Engine platform. Calibrated top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance collections with the Fmask method were used to ensure the usage of only cloud-free pixels, resulting in a dataset of 2081 scenes. The pH values were predicted by applying linear multiple regression and symbolic regression based on genetic programming (GP). The regression model presented an R-2 value of 0.81 and pH values ranging from 4.69 to 11.64. A lake mask was used to extract the predicted pH band that was then classified into three lake classes according to their pH values: Freshwater (pH < 8), oligosaline (pH 8-8.9), and saline (<greater than or equal to>9). Nearly 12,150 lakes were mapped with those with saline waters accounting for 7.25%. Finally, a trend surface map was created using the ALOS PRISM Digital Surface Model (DSM) to analyze the correlation between landscape features (topography, connection with the regional drainage system, size, and shape of lakes) and types of lakes. The analysis was in consonance with previous studies that pointed out that saline lakes tend to occur in lower positions compared to freshwater lakes. The results open a relevant perspective for the transfer of locally acquired experimental data to the regional balances of the Nhecolandia lakes.

TI  - Evaluation of Prescribed Fires from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) Imagery and Machine Learning Algorithms
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Prescribed fires have been applied in many countries as a useful management tool to prevent large forest fires. Knowledge on burn severity is of great interest for predicting post-fire evolution in such burned areas and, therefore, for evaluating the efficacy of this type of action. In this research work, the severity of two prescribed fires that occurred in "La Sierra de Uria" (Asturias, Spain) in October 2017, was evaluated. An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with a Parrot SEQUOIA multispectral camera on board was used to obtain post-fire surface reflectance images on the green (550 nm), red (660 nm), red edge (735 nm), and near-infrared (790 nm) bands at high spatial resolution (GSD 20 cm). Additionally, 153 field plots were established to estimate soil and vegetation burn severity. Severity patterns were explored using Probabilistic Neural Networks algorithms (PNN) based on field data and UAV image-derived products. PNN classified 84.3% of vegetation and 77.8% of soil burn severity levels (overall accuracy) correctly. Future research needs to be carried out to validate the efficacy of this type of action in other ecosystems under different climatic conditions and fire regimes.

TI  - Context Modeling in Problems of Compressing Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data
T2  - PATTERN RECOGNITION AND IMAGE ANALYSIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The article is devoted to developing a compression method using context modeling of a sequence of bits and wavelet transform, which make it possible to take into account the specifics and properties of the initial hyperspectral remote sensing data. Two algorithms for compressing hyperspectral data (lossy and lossless) based on wavelet transform are proposed, the distinguishing features of which are reduction in the required memory size, acceleration of the search for significant wavelet coefficients using a pyramid with approximating coefficients, and an increase in the compression coefficient. Recommendations for applying these algorithms are formulated. A distinctive feature of the hyperspectral data compression method is the ability to control the compression coefficient owing to parametric adjustment of the algorithms, application of context modeling and adaptation to the type of initial data (classical cube or Fourier interferogram). The efficiency of the technique has been experimentally confirmed using examples of compression of classical data and real Fourier interferograms with compression ratios of 4.1 and 2.4, corresponding to the level of the best global results, as well as analytically with data distortion in a compressed stream.

TI  - Mapping Mediterranean Forest Plant Associations and Habitats with Functional Principal Component Analysis Using Landsat 8 NDVI Time Series
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The classification of plant associations and their mapping play a key role in defining habitat biodiversity management, monitoring, and conservation strategies. In this work we present a methodological framework to map Mediterranean forest plant associations and habitats that relies on the application of the Functional Principal Component Analysis (FPCA) to the remotely sensed Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series. FPCA, considering the chronological order of the data, reduced the NDVI time series data complexity and provided (as FPCA scores) the main seasonal NDVI phenological variations of the forests. We performed a supervised classification of the FPCA scores combined with topographic and lithological features of the study area to map the forest plant associations. The supervised mapping achieved an overall accuracy of 87.5%. The FPCA scores contributed to the global accuracy of the map much more than the topographic and lithological features. The results showed that (i) the main seasonal phenological variations (FPCA scores) are effective spatial predictors to obtain accurate plant associations and habitat maps; (ii) the FPCA is a suitable solution to simultaneously express the relationships between remotely sensed and ecological field data, since it allows us to integrate these two different perspectives about plant associations in a single graph. The proposed approach based on the FPCA is useful for forest habitat monitoring, as it can contribute to produce periodically detailed vegetation-based habitat maps that reflect the "current" status of vegetation and habitats, also supporting the study of plant associations.

TI  - THE USE OF AUTOMATIC RELIEF MAPPING METHODS FOR ANALYSIS OF GLACIAL FORMS
T2  - REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GEOMORFOLOGIA
M3  - Article
AB  - Geomorphological mapping of glacial environments can be more accurate with the application of digital classification generated by Digital Elevation Models (MDEs). This paper evaluates the potential of geomorphon methodology for the identification of relief types in glacial mountain environments. New nomenclatures are proposed for the classification obtained directly by geomorphon when applied to glacial geomorphological mapping. The method is called Revised Geomorphon Digital Classification (RGDC). Morphometric and hydrological parameters, extracted from SRTMGL 1 and ALOS PALSAR MDEs, in a sector of the Cordillera Branca, Peru, were used in the new classification proposal. The identified classes were interpreted as horns, aretes, aretes strongly reworked by weathering, advancing moraines, slopes, circus valleys (amphitheater), U-valleys and V-valleys. The class of aretes is most easily identified using the geomorphons, same for horn classes. The results show the potential of the automatic method of digital classification of MDEs for the mapping of glacial relief shape types. Moraines with higher topographic amplitude were easily identified due to the spatial resolution and vertical accuracy of the DEMs used. The geomorphon identifies more relief types than classical methodologies for relief identification by MDEs, 7 relief types, while the Dikau et al. (1995) and ITP methods only provide 3 types. The ALOS PALSAR MDE, with higher spatial resolution, shows no difference in the identification of relief forms. The generated mapping can improve the reconstruction of geomorphological evolution, supporting paleoglaciological interpretation and understanding of territorial occupation along the Holocene.

TI  - Revision of Vajiralongkorn Dam's Reservoir Characteristic Curves Using NDWI Derived from Landsat 8 Data
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Reservoir characteristics are the essential information for water management planning and reservoir operation. Regular monitoring and assessment of the reservoir characteristics can reduce risks associated with the reservoir operation. This research assessed the reservoir characteristics (water surface, volume) of Vajiralongkorn Dam using remote sensing. Reservoir water surface was classified using the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) derived from the Landsat 8 data, and validated using the streamline matching rate (SMR) and the streamline matching error (SME) techniques for shoreline accuracy assessment. The volume between two water levels was calculated using the prismatic equation. The storage capacity curve was constructed from the reservoir water level and cumulative volume. The accuracy of NDWI technique was satisfactory in identifying reservoir water surface with a good accuracy of shoreline delineation (SMR>95% and SME=11.7 m). The water surface has decreased on the average of 8.2 km(2) (2.8%) compared with the original data in 1980. The storage capacity has decreased 495 3 million m(3 )(MCM) over 38 years from 1980 to 2018, an annual capacity loss of 13 MCM. Finally, sustainable service of the reservoir needs better knowledge of the effects of storage loss, the erosion and sediment-transport processes, and conservation measures.

TI  - Machine Learning for Gully Feature Extraction Based on a Pan-Sharpened Multispectral Image: Multiclass vs. Binary Approach
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Gullies reduce both the quality and quantity of productive land, posing a serious threat to sustainable agriculture, hence, food security. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are essential tools in the identification of gullies and can assist in strategic decision-making relevant to soil conservation. Nevertheless, accurate identification of gullies is a function of the selected ML algorithms, the image and number of classes used, i.e., binary (two classes) and multiclass. We applied Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF) on a Systeme Pour l'Observation de la Terre (SPOT-7) image to extract gullies and investigated whether the multiclass (m) approach can offer better classification accuracy than the binary (b) approach. Using repeated k-fold cross-validation, we generated 36 models. Our findings revealed that, of these models, both RFb (98.70%) and SVMm (98.01%) outperformed the LDA in terms of overall accuracy (OA). However, the LDAb (99.51%) recorded the highest producer's accuracy (PA) but had low corresponding user's accuracy (UA) with 18.5%. The binary approach was generally better than the multiclass approach; however, on class level, the multiclass approach outperformed the binary approach in gully identification. Despite low spectral resolution, the pan-sharpened SPOT-7 product successfully identified gullies. The proposed methodology is relatively simple, but practically sound, and can be used to monitor gullies within and beyond the study region.

TI  - Optimizing the treatment algorithm for sentinel lymph node mapping in endometrial cancer
T2  - SEMINARS IN ONCOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - The incidence of endometrial cancer, the most common gynecological malignancy, is increasing as life expectancy and obesity both rise. Lymph node status is the most important predictor for outcome, yet routine lymphadenectomy does not confer a survival benefit and is associated with substantial surgical morbidity. In the last decade, sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping has emerged as a feasible and accurate alternative to full lymphadenectomy. Yet, SLN has introduced a distinction between micro- and macrometastasis, and the entity of non-SLN involvement with their attendant impact on outcome. Included among the raised issues is the question of whether positive sentinel nodes should be followed by pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy dependent on the presence of macrometastasis at frozen section or other criteria. Moreover, the proper adjuvant treatment for individual cases with micrometastasis and/or isolated tumor cells is unclear. Recently published data on this topic are summarized in order to optimize the current treatment algorithm as it relates to the results of SLN assessment in endometrial cancer. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

TI  - Errors related to the automatized satellite-based change detection of boreal forests in Finland
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - The majority of the boreal forests in Finland are regularly thinned or clear-cut, and these actions are regulated by the Forest Act. To generate a near-real time tool for monitoring management actions, an automatic change detection modelling chain was developed using Sentinel-2 satellite images. In this paper, we focus mainly on the error evaluation of this automatized workflow to understand and mitigate incorrect change detections. Validation material related to clear-cut, thinned and unchanged areas was collected by visual evaluation of VHR images, which provided a feasible and relatively accurate way of evaluating forest characteristics without a need for prohibitively expensive fieldwork. This validation data was then compared to model predictions classified in similar change categories. The results indicate that clear-cuts can be distinguished very reliably, but thinned stands exhibit more variation. For thinned stands, coverage of broadleaved trees and detections from certain single dates were found to correlate with the success of the modelling results. In our understanding, this relates mainly to image quality regarding haziness and translucent clouds. However, if the growing season is short and cloudiness frequent, there is a clear trade-off between the availability of good-quality images and their preferred annual span. Gaining optimal results therefore depends both on the targeted change types, and the requirements of the mapping frequency.

TI  - Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of a human monoclonal antibody targeting the G glycoprotein of henipaviruses in healthy adults: a first-in-human, randomised, controlled, phase 1 study
T2  - LANCET INFECTIOUS DISEASES
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The monoclonal antibody m102.4 is a potent, fully human antibody that neutralises Hendra and Nipah viruses in vitro and in vivo. We aimed to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of m102.4 in healthy adults.Methods In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-centre, dose-escalation, phase 1 trial of m102.4, we randomly assigned healthy adults aged 18-50 years with a body-mass index of 18.0-35.0 kg/m(2) to one of five cohorts. A sentinel pair for each cohort was randomly assigned to either m102.4 or placebo. The remaining participants in each cohort were randomly assigned (5:1) to receive m102.4 or placebo. Cohorts 1-4 received a single intravenous infusion of m102.4 at doses of 1 mg/kg (cohort 1), 3 mg/kg (cohort 2), 10 mg/kg (cohort 3), and 20 mg/kg (cohort 4), and were monitored for 113 days. Cohort 5 received two infusions of 20 mg/kg 72 h apart and were monitored for 123 days. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability. Secondary outcomes were pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity. Analyses were completed according to protocol. The study was registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12615000395538.Findings Between March 27, 2015, and June 16, 2016, 40 (52%) of 77 healthy screened adults were enrolled in the study. Eight participants were assigned to each cohort (six received m102.4 and two received placebo). 86 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported, with similar rates between placebo and treatment groups. The most common treatment-related event was headache (12 [40%] of 30 participants in the combined m102.4 group, and three [30%] of ten participants in the pooled placebo group). No deaths or severe adverse events leading to study discontinuation occurred. Pharmacoldnetics based on those receiving m102.4 (n=30) were linear, with a median half-life of 663.3 h (range 474.3-735.1) for cohort 1, 466.3 h (382.8-522.3) for cohort 2, 397.0 h (333. 9-491- 8) for cohort 3, and 466 . 7 h (351.0-889.6) for cohort 4. The elimination kinetics of those receiving repeated dosing (cohort 5) were similar to those of single-dose recipients (median elimination half-time 472.0 [385.6-592.0]). Anti-m102.4 antibodies were not detected at any time-point during the study.Interpretation Single and repeated dosing of m102.4 were well tolerated and safe, displayed linear pharmacokinetics, and showed no evidence of an immunogenic response. This study will inform future dosing regimens for m102.4 to achieve prolonged exposure for systemic efficacy to prevent and treat henipavirus infections. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The seasonal and long-term variability of sea ice concentration in the Chukchi Sea in 1997-2016 was analyzed using all available satellite data on sea ice conditions. It is shown that the zone of maximum variability is situated in the areas with the ice concentration equal to (4-6)/10 and follows the displacements of this area: it moves to the north in the first half of the warm season (June-November) and moves back to the south in the second half of the period. The analysis of spectral components for the first three empirical orthogonal functions of sea ice concentration revealed quasiperiodic components with the periods of about 2-4 and 6-8 years.

TI  - Evaluation of the National Healthcare Safety Network standardized infection ratio risk adjustment for healthcare-facility-onset <i>Clostridioides difficile</i> infection in intensive care, oncology, and hematopoietic cell transplant units in general acute-care hospitals
T2  - INFECTION CONTROL AND HOSPITAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: To evaluate the National Health Safety Network (NHSN) hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infection (HO-CDI) standardized infection ratio (SIR) risk adjustment for general acute-care hospitals with large numbers of intensive care unit (ICU), oncology unit, and hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients. Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Eight tertiary-care referral general hospitals in California. Methods: We used FY 2016 data and the published 2015 rebaseline NHSN HO-CDI SIR. We compared facility-wide inpatient HO-CDI events and SIRs, with and without ICU data, oncology and/or HCT unit data, and ICU bed adjustment. Results: For these hospitals, the median unmodified HO-CDI SIR was 1.24 (interquartile range [IQR], 1.15-1.34); 7 hospitals qualified for the highest ICU bed adjustment; 1 hospital received the second highest ICU bed adjustment; and all had oncology-HCT units with no additional adjustment per the NHSN. Removal of ICU data and the ICU bed adjustment decreased HO-CDI events (median, -25%; IQR, -20% to -29%) but increased the SIR at all hospitals (median, 104%; IQR, 90%-105%). Removal of oncology-HCT unit data decreased HO-CDI events (median, -15%; IQR, -14% to -21%) and decreased the SIR at all hospitals (median, -8%; IQR, -4% to -11%). Conclusions: For tertiary-care referral hospitals with specialized ICUs and a large number of ICU beds, the ICU bed adjustor functions as a global adjustment in the SIR calculation, accounting for the increased complexity of patients in ICUs and non-ICUs at these facilities. However, the SIR decrease with removal of oncology and HCT unit data, even with the ICU bed adjustment, suggests that an additional adjustment should be considered for oncology and HCT units within general hospitals, perhaps similar to what is done for ICU beds in the current SIR.

TI  - Assessing Earthquake-Induced Urban Rubble by Means of Multiplatform Remotely Sensed Data
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Earthquake-induced rubble in urbanized areas must be mapped and characterized. Location, volume, weight and constituents are key information in order to support emergency activities and optimize rubble management. A procedure to work out the geometric characteristics of the rubble heaps has already been reported in a previous work, whereas here an original methodology for retrieving the rubble's constituents by means of active and passive remote sensing techniques, based on airborne (LiDAR and RGB aero-photogrammetric) and satellite (WorldView-3) Very High Resolution (VHR) sensors, is presented. Due to the high spectral heterogeneity of seismic rubble, Spectral Mixture Analysis, through the Sequential Maximum Angle Convex Cone algorithm, was adopted to derive the linear mixed model distribution of remotely sensed spectral responses of pure materials (endmembers). These endmembers were then mapped on the hyperspectral signatures of various materials acquired on site, testing different machine learning classifiers in order to assess their relative abundances. The best results were provided by the C-Support Vector Machine, which allowed us to work out the characterization of the main rubble constituents with an accuracy up to 88.8% for less mixed pixels and the Random Forest, which was the only one able to detect the likely presence of asbestos.

T2  - EMINAK
M3  - Article
AB  - The activity of Lonhyn Tsehelskyi, a well-known Ukrainian public, political leader and statesman, is analyzed. The state and degree of this issue scientific study are clarified.The formation of L. Tsehelskyi's worldview and personality is traced. The little-known pages of his biography are emphasized. It is found out that the determining periods that particularly influenced the process of forming the personality of L. Tsehelskyi and his subsequent life position were his childhood and youth, especially the family environment and upbringing.Lonhyn Tsehelskyi's personality as a politician and public figure in the last period of the Austro-Hungarian Empire is considered. It is noted that with the beginning of the 20th century L. Tsehelskyi, to some extent moved away from activities in student organizations, and became actively involved in the work of political and public societies.L. Tsehelskyi's participation in the Ukrainian National Democratic Party is described, and his ambassadorial activity is analyzed. It is emphasized that L. Tsehelskyi's ambassadorial activity began at a time when Western Ukrainian society was in the legal field of the AustroHungarian Monarchy. Thanks to his clear position and oratory skills, he exposed the antipeople policy of the imperial government, criticized and condemned Galician Moscophilia, and defended the interests and rights of Ukrainian peasants.The state-building and diplomatic activity of L. Tsehelskyi during the years of national liberation struggles of Ukrainian people is analyzed. It is noted that among the Galician politykum L. Tsehelskyi stood out for his theoretical and political knowledge, foresight, and convincing position. From the beginning of the liberation struggle, the politician advocated the full provision of autonomy and political equality of national minorities, the realization of which could be carried out primarily by peaceful, legitimate, and legal methods.It is noted that the period of L. Tsehelskyi's life, connected with his state-building activity during the times of the Western Ukrainian People's Republic, deserves special attention. L. Tsehelskyi was the initiator of various state and political actions, showed considerable activity in various meetings, gatherings, demonstrations, and sessions.The social and political, scientific and cultural activity of L. Tsehelskyi in emigration to the USA is also shown. The worldview position of the scholar is traced, and his contribution to the development of the scientific, social, and political life of Ukrainian community in exile and the establishment of Ukraine-United States relations are analyzed.

TI  - Integrating airborne laser scanning data, space-borne radar data and digital aerial imagery to estimate aboveground carbon stock in Hyrcanian forests, Iran
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A framework for estimating aboveground forest carbon stock (AFCS) is required for measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) systems under the United Nations Collaborative Program on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) in Developing Countries. Recently, methods for estimating the spatial distribution of AFCS using remotely sensed datasets and multiple prediction techniques have been found to be useful, particularly given the prohibitive costs of acquiring the necessary sample sizes for sufficiently precise pure field-based estimation of this variable. The objective of the study was to assess and compare the capabilities of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data, L-band radar data and UltraCam images in combination with four commonly used prediction techniques for estimating mean AFCS per unit area: multiple linear regression (MLR) and the nonparametric k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest (RF) algorithms. Our study area was a part of Hyrcanian deciduous forests in two managed and unmanaged stands at Shast Kalateh forest. We used a systematic sample consisting of 308 circular field plots of 0.1 ha located at the intersections of a 150 x 200 m grid with a random starting point and remote sensing-derived metrics as auxiliary data. We used 67% of the sample plots for training purposes and the remaining 33% for validation. Also, we used the model-assisted estimators to statistically rigorously estimate mean AFCS per unit area and its standard error (SE).Among the remotely sensed datasets, considered singly, the ALS data with R-2* = 0.34, rRMSE = 47.42% and relative efficiency (RE) = 1.51 produced the greatest accuracy and precision for AFCS estimation. RE can be interpreted as the factor by which the sample size for the pure field-based estimator would have to be increased to obtain the same precision as for the model-assisted estimator using auxiliary data. Among the remotely sensed datasets considered in combination, the ALS and PALSAR dataset with R-2* = 0.41, rRMSE = 44.80% and RE = 1.70 produced the greatest prediction accuracy and precision and increased the proportion of variability explained relative to ALS and PALSAR separately by 7% and 36%, respectively. Contrary to our expectation, the combination of PALSAR and UltraCam data decreased the precision of AFCS estimates. All the remotely sensed datasets, singly and in combination, with the most accurate prediction techniques for each combination produced estimates of AFCS that were within the 95% confidence interval for the field-based estimate.

TI  - Soil Color and Mineralogy Mapping Using Proximal and Remote Sensing in Midwest Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Soil color and mineralogy are used as diagnostic criteria to distinguish different soil types. In the literature, 350-2500 nm spectra were successfully used to predict soil color and mineralogy, but these attributes currently are not mapped for most Brazilian soils. In this paper, we provided the first large-extent maps with 30 m resolution of soil color and mineralogy at three depth intervals for 850,000 km(2) of Midwest Brazil. We obtained soil 350-2500 nm spectra from 1397 sites of the Brazilian Soil Spectral Library at 0-20 cm, 20-60, and 60-100 cm depths. Spectra was used to derive Munsell hue, value, and chroma, and also second derivative spectra of the Kubelka-Munk function, where key spectral bands were identified and their amplitude measured for mineral quantification. Landsat composites of topsoil and vegetation reflectance, together with relief and climate data, were used as covariates to predict Munsell color and Fe-Al oxides, and 1:1 and 2:1 clay minerals of topsoil and subsoil. We used random forest for soil modeling and 10-fold cross-validation. Soil spectra and remote sensing data accurately mapped color and mineralogy at topsoil and subsoil in Midwest Brazil. Hematite showed high prediction accuracy (R-2 > 0.71), followed by Munsell value and hue. Satellite topsoil reflectance at blue spectral region was the most relevant predictor (25% global importance) for soil color and mineralogy. Our maps were consistent with pedological expert knowledge, legacy soil observations, and legacy soil class map of the study region.

TI  - Wildfire effects on permafrost and soil moisture in spruce forests of Interior Alaska
T2  - JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - In the summer of 2015, hundreds of forest fires burned across the state of Alaska. Several uncontrolled wildfires near the town of Tanana on the Yukon River were responsible for the largest portion of the area burned statewide. In July 2017, field measurements were carried out in both unburned and burned forested areas nearly adjacent to one another, all within 15 miles of the village of Tanana. These surveys were used to first visually verify locations of different burn severity classes, (low, moderate, or high), estimated in 2016 from Landsat images (collected before and after the 2015 Tanana-area wildfires). Surface and soil profile measurements to 30-cm depth at these same locations were collected for evidence of moss layer and forest biomass burning. Soil temperature and moisture content were measured to 30-cm depth, and depth to permafrost was estimated by excavation wherever necessary. Digital thermal infra-red images of the soil profiles were taken at each site location, and root-zone organic layer samples were extracted for further chemical analysis. Results supported the hypothesis that the loss of surface organic layers is a major factor determining post-fire soil water and temperature changes and the depth of permafrost thawing. In the most severely burned forest sites, complete consumption of the living moss organic layer was strongly associated with both warming at the surface layer and increases in soil water content, relative to unburned forest sites. Soil temperatures at both 10-cm and 30-cm depths at burned forest sites were higher by 8-10 degrees C compared to unburned sites. Below 15 cm, temperatures of unburned sites dropped gradually to frozen levels by 30 cm, while soil temperatures at burned sites remained above 5 degrees C to 30-cm depth. The water content measured at 3 cm at burned sites was commonly in excess of 30% by volume, compared to unburned sites. The strong correlation between burn index values and depth to permafrost measured across all sites sampled in July 2017 showed that the new ice-free profile in severely burned forest areas was commonly 50-cm deeper than in unburned soils.

TI  - Assessment of surface water quality around opencast coal mines for sustainable utilization potentials: a case study in Jharkhand, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Opencast coal mining has caused severe environmental degradation globally. In India, Jharkhand is infamous for the environmental damage already caused by unregulated coal mining practices so far. In the present investigation, surface water samples from 31 locations in Charhi and Kuju coal mining areas were analysed for physical and chemical parameters of water. Statistical analysis was performed to understand the magnitude of contamination and suitability of the water samples for agricultural as well as domestic uses. Analysis of variance indicated significant site-wise (6 out of 15 parameters) and seasonal variations (13 out of 15 parameters), while Pearson correlation indicated significant positive correlations between TDS-EC (r(2) = 0.74-0.99) and total hardness-HCO3- (r(2) = 0.95-0.98). Scatter plot between Ca, Mg and HCO3 revealed a positive interrelationship in all the three seasons. Surface water quality indices exhibited variable results of sustainable utilization potential of the water for various uses. Though water quality index advocated the quality of water to be good in the majority of the samples, health water quality index based on selected parameters hinted, the majority of the samples to be of poor category. Observations collated together suggest that though the area is in the initial phases of mining, contamination of the surface water bodies is increasing gradually and higher concentrations of metals (As, Fe, Mn, Se) are the most significant problem now. This study can serve as a baseline data and an early sentinel towards the increasing pollution and its effective environmental management in similar mining regions of the world.

TI  - Introducing APiC for regionalised land cover mapping on the national scale using Sentinel-2A imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Overcoming the obstacle of frequent cloud coverage in optical remote sensing data is essential for monitoring dynamic land surface processes from space. APiC, a novel adaptable pixel-based compositing and classification approach, is especially designed to use high resolution spatio-temporal space-borne data.Here, pixel-based compositing is used separately for training data and prediction data. First, cloud-free pixels covered by reference data are used within adapted composite periods to compile a training dataset. The compiled training dataset contains samples of spectral reflectances for respective land cover classes at each composite period. For land cover prediction, pixel-based compositing is then applied region-wide. Multiple prediction models are used based on temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset to dynamically account for cloud coverage at pixel level. Thus we present a data-driven classification approach which is applicable in regions with different weather conditions, species composition and phenology.The capability of our method is demonstrated by mapping 19 land cover classes across Germany for the year 2016 based on Sentinel-2A data. Since climatic conditions and thus plant phenology change on a large scale, the classification was carried out separately in six landscape regions of different biogeographical characteristics. The study drew on extensive ground validation data provided by the federal states of Germany.For each landscape region, composite periods of different lengths have been established, which differ regionally in their temporal arrangement as well as in their total number, emphasising the advantage of a flexible regionalised classification procedure. Using a random forest classifier and evaluating outcomes with independent reference data, an overall accuracy of 88% was achieved, with particularly high classification accuracy of around 90% for the major land cover types. We found that class imbalances have significant influence on classification accuracy. Based on multiple temporal subsets of the compiled training dataset, over 10,000 random forest models were calculated and their performance varied considerably across and within landscape regions. The calculated importance of composite periods show that a high temporal resolution of the compiled training dataset is necessary to better capture the different phenology of land cover types.In this study we demonstrate that APiC, due to its data-driven nature, is a very flexible compositing and classification approach making efficient use of dense satellite time series in areas with frequent cloud coverage. Hence, regionalisation can be given greater focus in future broad-scale classifications in order to facilitate better integration of small-scale biophysical conditions and achieve even better results in detailed land cover mapping.

TI  - Variations in Winter Surface Temperature of the Purog Kangri Ice Field, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, 2001-2018, Using MODIS Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In the context of global warming, the land surface temperature (LST) from remote sensing data is one of the most useful indicators to directly quantify the degree of climate warming in high-altitude mountainous areas where meteorological observations are sparse. Using the daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST product (MOD11A1 V6) after eliminating pixels that might be contaminated by clouds, this paper analyzes temporal and spatial variations in the mean LST on the Purog Kangri ice field, Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, in winter from 2001 to 2018. There was a large increasing trend in LST (0.116 +/- 0.05 degrees C.a(-1)) on the Purog Kangri ice field during December, while there was no evident LST rising trend in January and February. In December, both the significantly decreased albedo (-0.002 a(-1), based on the MOD10A1 V6 albedo product) on the ice field surface and the significantly increased number of clear days (0.322 d.a(-1)) may be the main reason for the significant warming trend in the ice field. In addition, although the two highest LST of December were observed in 2017 and 2018, a longer data set is needed to determine whether this is an anomaly or a hint of a warmer phase of the Purog Kangri ice field in December.

TI  - Monitoring Effect of Spatial Growth on Land Surface Temperature in Dhaka
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Spatial urban growth and its impact on land surface temperature (LST) is a high priority environmental issue for urban policy. Although the impact of horizontal spatial growth of cities on LST is well studied, the impact of the vertical spatial distribution of buildings on LST is under-investigated. This is particularly true for cities in sub-tropical developing countries. In this study, TerraSAR-X add-on for Digital Elevation Measurement (TanDEM-XDEM), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER)-Global Digital Elevation Model (GDEM), and ALOS World 3D-30m (AW3D30) based Digital Surface Model (DSM) data were used to investigate the vertical growth of the Dhaka Metropolitan Area (DMA) in Bangladesh. Thermal Infrared (TIR) data (10.6-11.2 mu m) of Landsat-8 were used to investigate the seasonal variations in LST. Thereafter, the impact of horizontal and vertical spatial growth on LST was studied. The result showed that: (a) TanDEM-X DSM derived building height had a higher accuracy as compared to other existing DSM that reveals mean building height of the Dhaka city is approximately 10 m, (b) built-up areas were estimated to cover approximately 94%, 88%, and 44% in Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC), Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC), and Fringe areas, respectively, of DMA using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification method, (c) the built-up showed a strong relationship with LST (Kendall tau coefficient of 0.625 in summer and 0.483 in winter) in comparison to vertical growth (Kendall tau coefficient of 0.156 in the summer and 0.059 in the winter), and (d) the 'low height-high density' areas showed high LST in both seasons. This study suggests that vertical development is better than horizontal development for providing enough open spaces, green spaces, and preserving natural features. This study provides city planners with a better understating of sustainable urban planning and can promote the formulation of action plans for appropriate urban development policies.

TI  - A Systematic Review on Case Studies of Remote-Sensing-Based Flood Crop Loss Assessment
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Review
AB  - This article reviews case studies which have used remote sensing data for different aspects of flood crop loss assessment. The review systematically finds a total of 62 empirical case studies from the past three decades. The number of case studies has recently been increased because of increased availability of remote sensing data. In the past, flood crop loss assessment was very generalized and time-intensive because of the dependency on the survey-based data collection. Remote sensing data availability makes rapid flood loss assessment possible. This study groups flood crop loss assessment approaches into three broad categories: flood-intensity-based approach, crop-condition-based approach, and a hybrid approach of the two. Flood crop damage assessment is more precise when both flood information and crop condition are incorporated in damage assessment models. This review discusses the strengths and weaknesses of different loss assessment approaches. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat are the dominant sources of optical remote sensing data for flood crop loss assessment. Remote-sensing-based vegetation indices (VIs) have significantly been utilized for crop damage assessments in recent years. Many case studies also relied on microwave remote sensing data, because of the inability of optical remote sensing to see through clouds. Recent free-of-charge availability of synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 will advance flood crop damage assessment. Data for the validation of loss assessment models are scarce. Recent advancements of data archiving and distribution through web technologies will be helpful for loss assessment and validation.

TI  - Integrating Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Time Series Data for Yield Prediction of Sugarcane Crops at the Block Level
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Early prediction of sugarcane crop yield at the commercial block level (unit area of a single crop of the same variety, ratoon or planting date) offers significant benefit to growers, consultants, millers, policy makers, crop insurance companies and researchers. This current study explored a remote sensing based approach for predicting sugarcane yield at the block level by further developing a regionally specific Landsat time series model and including individual crop sowing (or previous seasons' harvest) date. For the Bundaberg growing region of Australia this extends over a five months period, from July to November. For this analysis, the sugarcane blocks were clustered into 10 groups based on their specific planting or ratoon commencement date within the specified five months period. These clustered or groups of blocks were named 'bins'. Cloud free (<20%) satellite data from the polar-orbiting Landsat-8 (launched 2013), Sentinel-2A (launched 2015) and Sentinel-2B (launched 2017) sensors were acquired over the cane growing region in Bundaberg (area of 32,983 ha), from the growing season starting in July 2014, with the average green normalised difference vegetation index (GNDVI) derived for each block. The number of images acquired for each season was defined by the number of cloud free acquisitions. Using the Simple Linear Machine Learning (ML) algorithm, the extracted Landsat derived GNDVI values for each of the blocks were converted to Sentinel GNDVI. The average GNDVI of each 'bin' was plotted and a quadratic model was fitted through the time series to identify the peak growth stage defined as the maximum GNDVI value. The model derived maximum GNDVI values for each of the bins were then regressed against the average actual yield (tha(-1)) achieved for the respective bin over the five growing years, producing strong correlations (R-2 = 0.92 to 0.99). The quadratic curves developed for the different bins were shifted according to the specific planting or ratoon date of an individual block allowing for the peak GNDVI value of the block to be calculated, regressed against the actual block yield (tha(-1)) and the prediction of yield to be made. To validate the accuracies of the 10 time series algorithms representing each of the 10 bins, 592 individual blocks were selected from the Bundaberg region during the 2019 harvest season. The crops were clustered into the appropriate bins with the respective algorithm applied. From a Sentinel image acquired on the 5 May 2019, the prediction accuracies were encouraging (R-2 = 0.87 and RMSE = 11.33 (ta(-1))) when compared to actual harvested yield, as reported by the mill. The results presented in this paper demonstrate significant progress in the accurate prediction of sugarcane yield at the individual sugarcane block level using a remote sensing, time-series based approach.

T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: In 2017, the sampling procedure for HIV sentinel surveillance (HSS) among all high-risk groups was changed from the consecutive sampling to random sampling along with the introduction of linked anonymous testing strategy with informed written consent. Objective: The objective of this study was to assess whether the inclusion of informed consent affects the HIV positivity rate among the participants and nonparticipants injecting drug users (IDU) in HSS 2017 in four states of Central Zone of India. Methods: This study was a cross-sectional study. All sentinel sites from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, and Uttarakhand located at targeted intervention facilities in 2017 were included in the study. Information about the participation and nonparticipation of each high-risk individual at the sentinel site was gathered from the master list, respective registers, and website portal of the National AIDS Control Organization. A total of 8639 individuals were included in the analysis. Results: Overall, 16 sites in four states were included in the study. Overall, the nonparticipation rate of IDUs was 14.3%; highest being for Delhi (17.2%), followed by Uttar Pradesh (14.6%), Uttarakhand (10.9%), and Jharkhand (4.4%). Overall, the HIV-positivity rate among nonparticipants (9.6%) was significantly higher (P = 0.009) compared to the participants (6.7%). Conclusion: Change in methodology and seeking written informed consent might have an effect on the nonparticipation in all four states. This, in turn, could have led to the underestimation of HIV-positivity rates among IDU in the states.

TI  - Surgical management of breast cancer in outpatient versus overnight hospitalization: Satisfaction study
T2  - GYNECOLOGIE OBSTETRIQUE FERTILITE & SENOLOGIE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives. - Breast cancer is the primary female cancer. In cancerology, it is essential to give to the patient some support. The advent of outpatient surgery optimizes the care path. This need for support of patients raises the question of its compatibility with the day surgery. The purpose is to compare the satisfaction of outpatients with those who stay overnight after surgery of breast cancer.Methods. - Patients who underwent breast conservative surgery were included. It is a mixed study, a quantitative, observational and prospective one using a satisfaction survey and a qualitative one which consisted on semi - directive individual interviews. We compared the satisfaction rate (highest marks).Results. - There were 91 patientes, 38 in the ambulatory group and 53 in the overnight group. There was no significant difference in satisfaction between the two groups (P = 0.18). The difficulties frequently highlighted by the patients during their stay were the organizational management, the lack of hospital comfort and the sometimes long wait. The need for human support was unanimous.Conclusion. - The satisfaction was excellent in the study. The mode of hospitalization does not seem to play a role here on satisfaction. This hospitalization mode can only be envisaged by providing sufficient human and technical resources. Enhanced recovery after surgery appears to be an alternative to outpatient surgery.

TI  - Hospital-based sentinel surveillance for <i>Streptococcus pneumoniae</i> and other invasive bacterial diseases in India (HBSSPIBD): design and methodology
T2  - BMJ OPEN
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction Streptococcus pneumoniae is one of the frequently isolated organisms and an important aetiological agent of invasive bacterial diseases (IBD) like pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis. As a measure to control the burden of IBD, the Government of India introduced Pneumoccocal Conjugate Vaccine-13 (PCV-13) in the Universal Immunization Program in high burden districts of five states in a phased manner from 2017 onwards. It is essential to understand the trend of circulating pneumococcal serotypes associated with IBD in the prevaccination and postvaccination scenarios to decide on the expansion of vaccination programmes and PCV reformulation. This manuscript describes the protocol for hospital-based sentinel surveillance for S. pneumoniae and other organisms causing IBD across various geographical regions in India.Methods and analysis Hospital-based surveillance is established in selected hospitals to recruit children aged 1-59 months with symptoms of pneumonia and other IBD. Diagnostic criteria were adapted from standard WHO case definitions. Case Report Forms (CRFs) are used to collect data from the enrolled children. Blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and other normally sterile body fluids are collected and subjected to microscopy, cytology, latex agglutination, biochemistry, bacteriological culture and real-time PCR as applicable. Pneumococcal isolates are serotyped and tested for assessing antimicrobial resistance patterns. Data will be analysed by simple descriptive statistics to estimate the proportion of pneumonia and other IBD due to S. pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae type b and Neisseria meningitidis. Prevalence of bacterial infection, circulating pneumococcal serotypes, antibiotic resistance patterns, serotype variability across seasons and regions will be described in terms of percentage with 95% confidence interval.

TI  - Recovery of Rapid Water Mass Changes (RWMC) by Kalman Filtering of GRACE Observations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - We demonstrate a new approach to recover water mass changes from GRACE satellite data at a daily temporal resolution. Such a product can be beneficial in monitoring extreme weather events that last a few days and are missing by conventional monthly GRACE data. The determination of the distribution of these water mass sources over networks of juxtaposed triangular tiles was made using Kalman Filtering (KF) of daily GRACE geopotential difference observations that were reduced for isolating the continental hydrology contribution of the measured gravity field. Geopotential differences were obtained from the along-track K-Band Range Rate (KBRR) measurements according to the method of energy integral. The recovery approach was validated by inverting synthetic GRACE geopotential differences simulated using GLDAS/WGHM global hydrology model outputs. Series of daily regional and global KF solutions were estimated from real GRACE KBRR data for the period 2003-2012. They provide a realistic description of hydrological fluxes at monthly time scales, which are consistent with classical spherical harmonics and mascons solutions provided by the GRACE official centers but also give an intra-month/daily continuity of these variations.

T2  - ENGINEERING REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Texture analysis is widely performed in the current time as it is considered as an intimate property of the surface. It is widely used in the field of image processing, remote sensing applications, biomedical analysis, document processing, and so on. In this investigation, we present a detailed study of four different methodologies that have been developed for texture classification. These methodologies include gray level cooccurrence matrix (GLCM), local binary pattern (LBP), autocorrelation function (ACF), and histogram pattern. The detailed investigation on these methods suggests that GLCM is best for analyzing the surface texture, land-use/landcover classification, and satellite data processing. LBP is widely used to analyze the facial features of an individual. The autocorrelation is used to identify the regularity of the textured surface. Finally, through histograms, one can visually identify the changes developed while analyzing the texture of the image data. Furthermore, we present a brief summary for newly developed texture classification techniques such as binary Gabor pattern, local spiking pattern, SRITCSD method, scale inversion, and deep perception models for texture analysis. Some benchmark texture datasets used in image processing are also discussed in this work.

TI  - Remote sensing images super-resolution with deep convolution networks
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Remote sensing image data have been widely applied in many applications, such as agriculture, military, and land use. It is difficult to obtain remote sensing images in both high spatial and spectral resolutions due to the limitation of implements in image acquisition and the law of energy conservation. Super-resolution (SR) is a technique to improve the resolution from a low-resolution (LR) to a high-resolution (HR). In this paper, a novel deep convolution network (DCN) SR method (SRDCN) is proposed. Based on hierarchical architectures, the proposed SRDCN learns an end-to-end mapping function to reconstruct an HR image from its LR version; furthermore, extensions of SRDCN based on residual learning and multi scale version are investigated for further improvement,namely Developed SRDCN(DSRDCN) and Extensive SRDCN(ESRDCN). Experimental results using different types of remote sensing data (e.g., multispectral and hyperspectral) demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform the traditional sparse representation based methods.

TI  - Estimating biochemical parameters of paddy using satellite and near-proximal sensor data in Sahibganj Province, Jharkhand (India)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rice is one of the most important crops in India, and chlorophyll (Chl) and nitrogen (N) content of leaf serve as a significant indicator for monitoring crop status and precision farming. These biochemical parameters can be obtained from remote sensing data, but can have limitation on the precision of these parameters. In this aspect, near-proximal optical sensors placed in contact with the crop and can provide a rapid assessment of Chl content and N status. So, in this study, both satellite data and proximal sensors were used to estimate Chl content and N status of paddy in Sahibganj district in the state of Jharkhand (India). The key findings showed that multiple regression (MR) based models comprising RVI, NDVI, and EVI were more competent to estimate the Chl content and crop nitrogen status (CNS) with r-value of 0.72 and 0.77, respectively. Notably, the ratio vegetation index (RVI) based model was also promising with r-value of 0.69 and 0.74 for Chl and CNS estimation, respectively. It was noticed that the empirically derived Chl content and N status of paddy were in general hyped than the satellite-based estimates as represented by the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute deviation (MAD).

TI  - Linking the Recent Glacier Retreat and Depleting Streamflow Patterns with Land System Changes in Kashmir Himalaya, India
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports the changes in glacier extent and streamflow similar to many Himalayan studies, but takes the unusual step of also linking these to downstream land use changes in Kashmir Valley. This study assessed changes in the area, snout, and equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of four parts of the Kolahoi Glacier using earth observation data from 1962 to 2018. Changes in the discharge of the two streams flowing out from Kolahoi Glacier into the Jhelum basin were also assessed between 1972 and 2018. Additionally, satellite data was used to track the downstream land system changes concerning agriculture, orchards, and built-up areas between 1980 and 2018. This analysis suggested a cumulative deglaciation of 23.6% at a rate of 0.42% per year from 1962 to 2018. The snout of two larger glaciers, G1 and G2, retreated at a rate of 18.3 m a(-1) and 16.4 m a(-1), respectively, from 1962 to 2018, although the rate of recession accelerated after 2000. Our analysis also suggested the upward shift of ELA by approximate to 120 m. The streamflows measured at five sites showed statistically significant depleting trends that have been a factor in forcing extensive land system changes downstream. Although the area under agriculture in Lidder watershed shrunk by 39%, there was a massive expansion of 176% and 476% in orchards and built-up areas, respectively, from 1980 to 2018. The conversion of irrigation-intensive agriculture lands (rice paddy) to less water-intensive orchards is attributed to economic considerations and depleting streamflow.

TI  - Can Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Predict Various Levels of Echelon Nodes in Oral Cancers?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL ARCHIVES OF OTORHINOLARYNGOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction The efficacy of sentinel node biopsy in early stage oral cancer is well established. Its evolving role can be reinforced by further studies. Objective Analyzing the predictability of the levels of echelon nodes for various oral cavity tumor subsites on sentinel node biopsy. Methods A prospective study of 20 patients with stage I/II oral squamous cell carcinoma who underwent sentinel node biopsy-guided neck dissection between January 2017 and 2018 at our institute. The procedure included radiotracer injection, imaging (lymphoscintigraphy, single photon emission computed tomography-computed tomography), and gamma probe application. Sentinel node detection on imaging and gamma probe were compared. Results Out of 20 patients, 13 (65%) had carcinoma of the tongue, 6 (30%) had buccal mucosa carcinoma, and 1 (5%) had retromolar trigone carcinoma. The mean age of the patients was 52.3 years. A total of 13 (65%) patients were male, and 7 (35%) were female. The sentinel node identification rates with imaging and gamma probe were of 70% and 100% respectively. In tongue and retromolar trigone primaries, the most common first-echelon nodes in both modalities were levels IIA and IB respectively. For buccal mucosa primaries, first-echelon nodes were detected only with the gamma probe, which was level IB. On imaging, second-echelon nodes were detected only for tongue primaries, and had equivalent incidence of levels II, III, and IV. On the gamma probe, level IIA, followed by III, and IV for the tongue, and level IIA were the most common second-echelon nodes for the buccal mucosa. Third-echelon nodes were detected only with the gamma probe for tongue carcinoma at level IV. Conclusion The combined use of imaging and gamma probe provides the best results, with high identification rate and predictability of echelon levels.

TI  - Beyond counts and averages: Relating geodiversity to dimensions of biodiversity
T2  - GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim We may be able to buffer biodiversity against the effects of ongoing climate change by prioritizing the protection of habitat with diverse physical features (high geodiversity) associated with ecological and evolutionary mechanisms that maintain high biodiversity. Nonetheless, the relationships between biodiversity and habitat vary with spatial and biological context. In this study, we compare how well habitat geodiversity (spatial variation in abiotic processes and features) and climate explain biodiversity patterns of birds and trees. We also evaluate the consistency of biodiversity-geodiversity relationships across ecoregions.Location Contiguous USA.Time period 2007-2016.Taxa studied Birds and trees.Methods We quantified geodiversity with remotely sensed data and generated biodiversity maps from the Forest Inventory and Analysis and Breeding Bird Survey datasets. We fitted multivariate regressions to alpha, beta and gamma diversity, accounting for spatial autocorrelation among Nature Conservancy ecoregions and relationships among taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional biodiversity. We fitted models including climate alone (temperature and precipitation), geodiversity alone (topography, soil and geology) and climate plus geodiversity.Results A combination of geodiversity and climate predictor variables fitted most forms of bird and tree biodiversity with < 10% relative error. Models using geodiversity and climate performed better for local (alpha) and regional (gamma) diversity than for turnover-based (beta) diversity. Among geodiversity predictors, variability of elevation fitted biodiversity best; interestingly, topographically diverse places tended to have higher tree diversity but lower bird diversity.Main conclusions Although climatic predictors tended to have larger individual effects than geodiversity, adding geodiversity improved climate-only models of biodiversity. Geodiversity was correlated with biodiversity more consistently than with climate across ecoregions, but models tended to have a poor fit in ecoregions held out of the training dataset. Patterns of geodiversity could help to prioritize conservation efforts within ecoregions. However, we need to understand the underlying mechanisms more fully before we can build models transferable across ecoregions.

TI  - Irrigation Performance Assessment of Janpad Major of Nagarjuna Sagar Project Using Remote Sensing and GIS
T2  - BIOSCIENCE BIOTECHNOLOGY RESEARCH COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - An Investigation on irrigation performance assessment of Janpad major, Left bank canal, Nagarjuna Sagar Project (NSP), Andhra Pradesh, India using remote sensing and GIS was conducted during rabi (2008-09) at Water Technology Center, ANGRAU, Rajendranagar, Hyderabad. Multi temporal remote sensing (RS) data-based crop inventory and generation of NDVI was carried out over the Janpad major command of NSP, using Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS-P6) and Linear Imaging and Self Scanning -III (LISS-III) data. In this study, six comparative indicators for the assessment of irrigation system performance were applied to Janpad major command area, during rabi season (2008-09). The irrigation intensity (%), out put per cropped area (t/ha), out put per unit cultivable command (t/ha), water utilization index (ha/M.m3), water productivity (kg/m3) were computed. Overall consumption rate (Efficiency) was computed by comparing the crop water requirement with the water release data. Irrigation intensity, output per unit cropped area and out put per unit cultivable command was 96 %, 4.44 t ha(-1) and 4.27 t ha(-1) respectively for the Janpad major command. Water utilization index, overall consumption rate (Efficiency) and Water productivity was found as 124 ha/M.m3, 67.7 per cent and 0.64 kg m(3), respectively Above set of performance indicators describes the performance of an irrigation project for decision making. With satellite remote sensing and calculating actual ET of the crop and overall consumption rate (OCR) helps the policy makers in irrigation water supply as per crop. By knowing the supply and demand of irrigation water of a project is necessary for better irrigation efficiencies and improving the water productivity of irrigation project.

TI  - Laser Spot Center Location Method for Chinese Spaceborne GF-7 Footprint Camera
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Gaofen-7 (GF-7) satellite is equipped with two area array sensor footprint cameras to capture the laser altimeter spot. In order to establish a direct correspondence between the laser data and the stereo image data, a new method is proposed to fit the center of the spot using the brightness difference between the spot image and the footprint image. First, the geometric registration between the spot image and the footprint image is completed based on feature matching or template matching. Then, the brightness values between the two images are extracted from the corresponding image position to form a measurement, and the least squares adjustment method is used to calculate the parameters of the brightness conversion model between the spot image and the footprint image. Finally, according to the registration relationship, the center of the identified spots is respectively positioned in the footprint images, so that the laser spots are accurately identified in the along-track stereo footprint images. The experimental results show that the spot error of this method is less than 0.7 pixel, which has higher reliability and stability, and can be used for a GF-7 satellite footprint camera.

TI  - Evaluation of Atmospheric Correction Algorithms for Sentinel-2-MSI and Sentinel-3-OLCI in Highly Turbid Estuarine Waters
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The present study assesses the performance of state-of-the-art atmospheric correction (AC) algorithms applied to Sentinel-2-MultiSpectral Instrument (S2-MSI) and Sentinel-3-Ocean and Land Color Instrument (S3-OLCI) data recorded over moderately to highly turbid estuarine waters, considering the Gironde Estuary (SW France) as a test site. Three spectral bands of water-leaving reflectance (Rhow) are considered: green (560 nm), red (655 or 665 nm) and near infrared (NIR) (865 nm), required to retrieve the suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations in clear to highly turbid waters (SPM ranging from 1 to 2000 mg/L). A previous study satisfactorily validated Acolite short wave infrared (SWIR) AC algorithm for Landsat-8-Operational Land Imager (L8-OLI) in turbid estuarine waters. The latest version of Acolite Dark Spectrum Fitting (DSF) is tested here and shows very good agreement with Acolite SWIR for OLI data. L8-OLI satellite data corrected for atmospheric effects using Acolite DSF are then used as a reference to assess the validity of atmospheric corrections applied to other satellite data recorded over the same test site with a minimum time difference. Acolite DSF and iCOR (image correction for atmospheric effects) are identified as the best performing AC algorithms among the tested AC algorithms (Acolite DSF, iCOR, Polymer and C2RCC (case 2 regional coast color)) for S2-MSI. Then, the validity of six different AC algorithms (OLCI Baseline Atmospheric Correction (BAC), iCOR, Polymer, Baseline residual (BLR), C2RCC-V1 and C2RCC-V2) applied to OLCI satellite data is assessed based on comparisons with OLI and/or MSI Acolite DSF products recorded on a same day with a minimum time lag. Results show that all the AC algorithms tend to underestimate Rhow in green, red and NIR bands except iCOR in green and red bands. The iCOR provides minimum differences in green (slope = 1.0 +/- 0.15, BIAS = 1.9 +/- 4.5% and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) = 12 +/- 5%) and red (slope = 1.0 +/- 0.17, BIAS = -9.8 +/- 9% and MAPE = 28 +/- 20%) bands with Acolite DSF products from OLI and MSI data. For the NIR band, BAC provides minimum differences (slope = 0.7 +/- 0.13, BIAS = -33 +/- 17% and MAPE = 55 +/- 20%) with Acolite DSF products from OLI and MSI data. These results based on comparisons between almost simultaneous satellite products are supported by match-ups between satellite-derived and field-measured SPM concentrations provided by automated turbidity stations. Further validation of satellite products based on rigorous match-ups with in-situ Rhow measurements is still required in highly turbid waters.

TI  - Tissue-specific pathways extrude activated ILC2s to disseminate type 2 immunity
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are tissue-resident cells prominent at barrier sites. Although precursors are found in blood, mature ILC2s can enter the circulation after small intestinal perturbation by migratory helminths and move to distant tissues to influence the local reparative response. Using fate-mapping and methods to bypass the lung or intestinal phases of Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection, we show that blood ILC2s comprise heterogeneous populations derived from distinct tissues that are dependent on alarmins matched to the receptor profile of the specific tissue ILC2s. Activation of local ILC2s by tissue-specific alarmins induced their proliferation, lymph node migration, and blood dissemination, thus systemically distributing type 2 cytokines. These studies uncover a possible mechanism by which local innate responses transition to systemic type 2 responses by extrusion of activated sentinel ILC2s from tissue into the circulation.

TI  - Monitoring Winter Stress Vulnerability of High-Latitude Understory Vegetation Using Intraspecific Trait Variability and Remote Sensing Approaches
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - In this study, we focused on three species that have proven to be vulnerable to winter stress: Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea and Hylocomium splendens. Our objective was to determine plant traits suitable for monitoring plant stress as well as trait shifts during spring. To this end, we used a combination of active and passive handheld normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) sensors, RGB indices derived from ordinary cameras, an optical chlorophyll and flavonol sensor (Dualex), and common plant traits that are sensitive to winter stress, i.e. height, specific leaf area (SLA). Our results indicate that NDVI is a good predictor for plant stress, as it correlates well with height (r = 0.70, p < 0.001) and chlorophyll content (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). NDVI is also related to soil depth (r = 0.45, p < 0.001) as well as to plant stress levels based on observations in the field (r = 0.60, p < 0.001). Flavonol content and SLA remained relatively stable during spring. Our results confirm a multi-method approach using NDVI data from the Sentinel-2 satellite and active near-remote sensing devices to determine the contribution of understory vegetation to the total ecosystem greenness. We identified low soil depth to be the major stressor for understory vegetation in the studied plots. The RGB indices were good proxies to detect plant stress (e.g. Channel G%: r = 0.77, p < 0.001) and showed high correlation with NDVI (r = 0.75, p < 0.001). Ordinary cameras and modified cameras with the infrared filter removed were found to perform equally well.

AB  - Objectives The neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inflammatory biomarker which is useful in cancer prognostication. We aimed to investigate the differences in baseline NLR between patients with localised and metastatic cutaneous melanoma and how this biomarker changed over time with the recurrence of disease. Methods This multicentre cohort study describes patients treated for Stage I-III cutaneous melanoma over 10 years. The baseline NLR was measured immediately prior to surgery and again at the time of discharge or disease recurrence. The odds ratios (OR) for sentinel node involvement are estimated using mixed-effects logistic regression. The risk of recurrence is estimated using multivariable Cox regression. Results Overall 1489 individuals were included. The mean baseline NLR was higher in patients with palpable nodal disease compared to those with microscopic nodal or localised disease (2.8 versus 2.4 and 2.3, respectively; p < 0.001). A baseline NLR >= 2.3 was associated with 30% higher odds of microscopic metastatic melanoma in the sentinel lymph node [adjusted OR 1.3 (95% CI 1.3, 1.3)]. Following surgery, 253 patients (18.7%) developed recurrent melanoma during surveillance although there was no statistically significant association between the baseline NLR and the risk of recurrence [adjusted HR 0.9 (0.7, 1.1)]. Conclusion The NLR is associated with the volume of melanoma at presentation and may predict occult sentinel lymph metastases. Further prospective work is required to investigate how NLR may be modelled against other clinicopathological variables to predict outcomes and to understand the temporal changes in NLR following surgery for melanoma.

AB  - Airborne lidar study of lake ecosystems is still a relatively unexplored field. In this paper we present measurements of the diffuse attenuation coefficient of downwelling irradiance (K-d) obtained using a 532 nm airborne lidar in flights during 2004 and 2016 over Yellowstone Lake, Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. We compare the lidar measurements with MODIS K-d data, discuss the impact that local weather and river inflows/outflows may have had on the data, compare to previous models of the diffuse attenuation coefficient, and examine several published relationships converting K-d to Secchi disk depth.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to COVID-19, which is a type of pneumonia produced by a coronavirus family virus, the Peruvian government has decreed mandatory social isolation. This isolation is extended until 26 April 2020. Due to this situation, people must stay at home and only go out to make purchases to cover basic needs. This situation, between other things, probably causes pollution reduction that is important for our ecosystem. In Peru, there is not a measurable way to quantify the impact of social isolation on air pollution. The present work aims to show more objectively how much decrease the aerosol pollution in Peru. For this purpose, one uses remote sensing data from Copernicus Data Hub of the European Space Agency, specifically, Sentinel-5 Precursor satellite. The results show an essential reduction of aerosol pollution in different regions of Peru, especially in Lima and the Amazon regions.

AB  - Traditional choropleth maps, created on the basis of administrative units, often fail to accurately represent population distribution due to the high spatial heterogeneity and the temporal dynamics of the population within the units. Furthermore, updating the data of spatial population statistics is time-consuming and costly, which underlies the relative lack of high-resolution and high-quality population data for implementing or validating population modeling work, in particular in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Dasymetric modeling has become an important technique to produce high-resolution gridded population surfaces. In this study, carried out in Dhaka City, Bangladesh, dasymetric mapping was implemented with the assistance of a combination of an object-based image analysis method (for generating ancillary data) and Geographically Weighted Regression (for improving the accuracy of the dasymetric modeling on the basis of building use). Buildings were extracted from WorldView 2 imagery as ancillary data, and a building-based GWR model was selected as the final model to disaggregate population counts from administrative units onto 5 m raster cells. The overall accuracy of the image classification was 77.75%, but the root mean square error (RMSE) of the building-based GWR model for the population disaggregation was significantly less compared to the RMSE values of GWR based land use, Ordinary Least Square based land use and building modeling. Our model has potential to be adapted to other LMIC countries, where high-quality ground-truth population data are lacking. With increasingly available satellite data, the approach developed in this study can facilitate high-resolution population modeling in a complex urban setting, and hence improve the demographic, social, environmental and health research in LMICs.

TI  - Mapping of Maximum and Minimum Inundation Extents in the Amazon Basin 2014-2017 with ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR Time-Series Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Seasonal inundation is an important effect that governs the distribution of ecosystems in the tropics. In the Amazon Basin, the seasonal flood pulse causes a difference in high and low water levels that can exceed 15 m. The associated flood duration and extent play an important role in land-atmosphere carbon exchange and affect the ecosystem's carbon pool that originates from organic matter transported from upland and flooded forests. Studies of wetlands inundation across the Amazon Basin have utilized dual season mosaics from JERS-1 and wide-swath ScanSAR data from ALOS PALSAR to characterize inundation across the basin. This study builds upon past efforts with JERS-1 and ALOS PALSAR and uses ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 ScanSAR data to generate annual maximum and minimum inundation extent maps over the full Amazon Basin for the period spanning November 2014-October 2017. The study uses decision tree classification to create a maximum and a minimum inundation extent map for each year over this time period. The results show that a generalized algorithm that fits the entire basin has an 86% overall accuracy compared with a classification made for a local region from the same PALSAR-2 datasets. Comparisons with previous full-basin inundation maps by other L-band radars shows similar results for inundated areas during maximum inundation. The maps derived previously from JERS-1 and ALOS PALSAR show 7.3% and 6.9% inundated vegetation, respectively, and this study using PALSAR-2 shows values ranging between 5.5% and 7.0% across the three study years. Comparisons between the stage data across the basin and acquisition dates/periods for JERS-1 and PALSAR-2 show that the sensors capture the nature of the maximum and minimum flooding across the basins but have not successfully captured the exact maximum and minimum flood levels that have been recorded in the stage data. The inundation maps are publicly available under a Creative Commons (CC BY 4.0) licensefrom the Alaska Satellite Facility.

TI  - Pelvic floor disorders in women who consult primary care clinics: development and validation of case definitions using primary care electronic medical records.
T2  - CMAJ open
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, there has been no validated method to identify cases of pelvic floor disorders in primary care electronic medical record (EMR) data. We aimed to develop and validate symptom-based case definitions for urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse in women, for use in primary care epidemiologic or clinical research.METHODS: Our retrospective study used EMR data from the Southern Alberta Primary Care Research Network (SAPCReN) and the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) in southern Alberta. Trained researchers remotely reviewed a random sample of EMR charts of women aged 18 years or older from 6 rural and urban clinics to validate case definitions for urinary incontinence, fecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV), and estimated SAPCReN prevalence as appropriate.RESULTS: Charts of 900 women were included. Sensitivity was 81.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 75.1-87.2) for urinary incontinence, 61.2% (95% CI 46.2-74.5) for fecal incontinence, and 51.8% (95% CI 40.6-62.8) for pelvic organ prolapse. Corresponding specificity values were 71.9% (95% CI 68.4-75.1), 99.2% (95% CI 98.2-99.6) and 98.8% (95% CI 97.7-99.4), PPVs 40.6% (95% CI 35.4-46.0), 81.1% (95% CI 64.3-91.4) and 81.1% (95% CI 67.6-90.1), and NPVs 94.4% (95% CI 92.1-96.1), 97.8% (95% CI 96.5-98.6) and 95.3% (95% CI 93.6-96.6). The SAPCReN-observed prevalence for urinary incontinence was 29.7% (95% CI 29.3-30.0), but the adjusted prevalence was 2.97%.INTERPRETATION: The case definition for urinary incontinence met our standard for validity (sensitivity and specificity > 70%), and the case definitions for fecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse had PPVs greater than 80%. The urinary incontinence definition may be used in epidemiologic research, and those for fecal incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse may be used in quality-improvement studies or creation of disease registries. Our symptom-based case definitions could also be adapted for research in other EMR settings.

TI  - A conterminous United States analysis of the impact of Landsat 5 orbit drift on the temporal consistency of Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat 5 orbit changed more than expected over its three-decade mission life. Previous modelling research indicated that the resulting Landsat 5 overpass time and so acquisition solar zenith differences will have caused non-negligible reflectance and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) temporal differences. Rather than use a modelling approach this paper presents the results of a comprehensive examination of the Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data. Ten years of summer Landsat 5 TM Analysis Ready Data (ARD) sampled at >19.3 million 30 m pixel locations across the conterminous United States (CONUS) are considered. The acquisition solar zenith, red, near infrared (NIR), shortwave infrared (SWIR) (similar to 2.1 mu m) surface reflectance, and NDVI, are compared between five consecutive periods (1995 versus 2006, 1996 versus 2007, 1997 versus 2008, 1998 versus 2009, and 1999 versus 2010) that span years with very different Landsat 5 overpass times, and are also compared between 1998 and 1999 that have similar overpass times. The different years of Landsat 5 TM data are plotted against each other and reduced major axis (RMA) regressions passing though the origin are developed and compared with the acquisition solar geometry changes. The red, SWIR and NDVI RMA slopes are proportional to the magnitude of solar zenith change between years and are indicative of CONUS-wide differences due to orbit drift. The greatest differences occurred between 1995 and 2006, the years with the greatest solar zenith differences (median CONUS difference 8.43 degrees) with RMA regression slopes quite far from unity (1.14 for the red and SWIR bands, 0.91 for NDVI). In years with smaller solar zenith differences the RMA slopes are closer to unity. As agricultural crops may be managed inconsistently through time, and as drought may have pronounced effects on reflectance, the analysis is also undertaken masking out crop pixels and considering locations that have similar precipitation and evapotranspiration conditions between years. These experiments indicate that, at CONUS scale, the cause of the changing RMA regression slopes between years is not due to agricultural changes or to the influence of above normal drought or wetness. The results confirm previous published modelling based findings but are based on direct examination of CONUS Landsat 5 TM data. They indicate that certain research and applications that require temporally consistent red, SWIR and NDVI data may need to take Landsat 5 orbit drift effects into account.

TI  - Impact of Various Atmospheric Corrections on Sentinel-2 Land Cover Classification Accuracy Using Machine Learning Classifiers
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Atmospheric correction is one of the key parts of remote sensing preprocessing because it can influence and change the final classification result. This research examines the impact of five different atmospheric correction processing on land cover classification accuracy using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Those are surface reflectance (SREF), standardized surface reflectance (STDSREF), Sentinel-2 atmospheric correction (S2AC), image correction for atmospheric effects (iCOR), dark object subtraction (DOS) and top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance without any atmospheric correction. Sentinel-2 images corrected with stated atmospheric corrections were classified using four different machine learning classification techniques namely extreme gradient boosting (XGB), random forests (RF), support vector machine (SVM) and catboost (CB). For classification, five different classes were used: bare land, low vegetation, high vegetation, water and built-up area. SVM classification provided the best overall result for twelve dates, for all atmospheric corrections. It was the best method for both cases: when using Sentinel-2 bands and radiometric indices and when using just spectral bands. The best atmospheric correction for classification with SVM using radiometric indices is S2AC with the median value of 96.54% and the best correction without radiometric indices is STDSREF with the median value of 96.83%.

TI  - Aberrant Lymphatic Drainage in the Contralateral Axilla in Patients with Isolated Ipsilateral Breast Tumor Recurrence
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - The management and implications of aberrant lymphatic drainage in the contralateral axilla during repeat sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in patients with isolated ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) are not well understood. We analyzed the outcomes of contralateral SLNB in cases of isolated IBTR compared to ipsilateral SLNB. We conducted a retrospective review of cases reported at Samsung Medical Center between 1995 and 2015. All patients with isolated IBTR that underwent ipsilateral and contralateral SLNB with clinically negative lymph nodes but lymphatic drainage on the ipsilateral or contralateral axilla were included. Among 233 patients with isolated IBTR, 31 patients underwent repeat SLNB, 11 underwent ipsilateral SLNB, and nine underwent contralateral SLNB. None of the patients showed contralateral axillary metastasis in cases with isolated IBTR in the absence of clinically suspicious drainage on the contralateral axilla. Contralateral drainage was associated with a longer interval to IBTR (68.4 vs.18.6 months, p = 0.001) and the overall median follow-up duration (102.6 vs. 45.4 months, p = 0.002). There was no significant difference in the recurrence after the second operation (1 of 11 vs. 1 of 9, p = 1.000). Only one patient in both groups experienced recurrence after the second operation. Two patients (22.2%) who underwent contralateral SLNB had lymphedema. We demonstrate that no patient had contralateral metastasis in patients with isolated IBTR in the absence of clinically suspicious drainage in the contralateral axilla. Further study is warranted to better understand and optimize the management of these rare and challenging cases.

TI  - Effects of Climatic Warming and Wildfires on Recent Vegetation Changes in the Lake Baikal Basin
T2  - CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The vegetation changes in the area of the Russian part of the Lake Baikal water basin for the period 2010-2018 were investigated using MCD12C1 land cover. The decline in swamp systems area began in 2012 and continued until 2015, after which it partially recovered during the heavy rain season in 2018. During the period of 2010-2018, the area covered by forests did not exceed 20.3% of the Baikal basin of the total portion of the Baikal basin under study. Deforestation began in 2013 and continued until 2017. Over 2013-2018, the forest level decreased by 12.1% compared to the forest state in 2013. The analysis of summer rainfalls and aridity indexes was performed by using CRU TS and GPCC climatic datasets. It is shown that the interannual variations of precipitation and aridity changes are determined by the variability of the global circulation of moist air masses. The MCD64A1 (burned area) and MCD14ML (active fires) MODIS products were used for investigation of the influence of wildfires on vegetation changes. The spatial hotspot distributions and burned areas in general correspond to aridity zones, but they cannot explain the 20-fold increase in the number of wildfires. Most of the hotspot locations are away from settlements, roads, and loggings, in difficult-to-access mountainous areas, as well as in the low-inhabited areas of Siberia. We assume that the nature of such ignitions includes dry thunderstorms, pyrocumulus lightning, or remote impact.

TI  - The Diurnal Cycle of Rainfall and the Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves over the Maritime Continent
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - Precipitation variability over the Maritime Continent is predominantly explained by its diurnal cycle and large-scale disturbances such as the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) and convectively coupled equatorial waves (CCEWs). To advance our understanding of their interactions and physical processes, this study uses satellite data to examine changes in the diurnal cycle of rainfall associated with the MJO and CCEWs over the Maritime Continent. We find that diurnal cycle modulations associated with the passage of any type of large-scale disturbance are closely tied to changes in rain types and land-sea diurnal propagation of rainfall. When the amplitude of the diurnal cycle increases over the islands, the phase of the diurnal cycle is delayed by a few hours as clouds are more organized and rainfall from stratiform-anvil clouds increases. Enhanced amplitude of the diurnal cycle can alter the speed of land-sea diurnal propagation of rainfall, which then influences the timing of diurnal rainfall over coastal regions. These changes in the diurnal cycle occur asymmetrically across the island terrain associated with the MJO and equatorial Rossby waves, while such asymmetric modulations are not observed for other waves. Geographical and wave dependencies of the diurnal cycle are linked to differences in large-scale lower tropospheric wind, vertical motion, and moisture profile perturbations, which are in turn tied to differences in cloud population evolution. The results of this study highlight the importance of further improving our understanding of the sensitivity of cloud populations to varying large-scale phenomena.

TI  - A Data-Intensive Approach to Address Food Sustainability: Integrating Optic and Microwave Satellite Imagery for Developing Long-Term Global Cropping Intensity and Sowing Month from 2001 to 2015
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - It is necessary to develop a sustainable food production system to ensure future food security around the globe. Cropping intensity and sowing month are two essential parameters for analyzing the food-water-climate tradeoff as food sustainability indicators. This study presents a global-scale analysis of cropping intensity and sowing month from 2000 to 2015, divided into three groups of years. The study methodology integrates the satellite-derived normalized vegetation index (NDVI) of 16-day composite Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and daily land-surface-water coverage (LSWC) data obtained from The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E/2) in 1-km aggregate pixel resolution. A fast Fourier transform was applied to normalize the MODIS NDVI time-series data. By using advanced methods with intensive optic and microwave time-series data, this study set out to anticipate potential dynamic changes in global cropland activity over 15 years representing the Millennium Development Goal period. These products are the first global datasets that provide information on crop activities in 15-year data derived from optic and microwave satellite data. The results show that in 2000-2005, the total global double-crop intensity was 7.1 million km(2), which increased to 8.3 million km(2) in 2006-2010, and then to approximately 8.6 million km(2) in 2011-2015. In the same periods, global triple-crop agriculture showed a rapid positive growth from 0.73 to 1.12 and then 1.28 million km(2), respectively. The results show that Asia dominated double- and triple-crop growth, while showcasing the expansion of single-cropping area in Africa. The finer spatial resolution, combined with a long-term global analysis, means that this methodology has the potential to be applied in several sustainability studies, from global- to local-level perspectives.

TI  - Comparison of Cloud Cover Detection Algorithms on Sentinel-2 Images of the Amazon Tropical Forest
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical forests regulate the global water and carbon cycles and also host most of the world's biodiversity. Despite their importance, they are hard to survey due to their location, extent, and particularly, their cloud coverage. Clouds hinder the spatial and radiometric correction of satellite imagery and also diminishing the useful area on each image, making it difficult to monitor land change. For this reason, our purpose is to identify the cloud detection algorithm best suited for the Amazon rainforest on Sentinel-2 images. To achieve this, we tested four cloud detection algorithms on Sentinel-2 images spread in five areas of the Amazonia. Using more than eight thousand validation points, we compared four cloud detection methods: Fmask 4, MAJA, Sen2Cor, and s2cloudless. Our results point out that FMask 4 has the best overall accuracy on images of the Amazon region (90%), followed by Sen2Cor's (79%), MAJA (69%), and S2cloudless (52%). We note the choice of method depends on the intended use. Since MAJA reduces the number of false positives by design, users that aim to improve the producer's accuracy should consider its use.

TI  - Influence of digital elevation models on the simulation of rainfall-induced landslides in the hillslopes of Guwahati, India
T2  - ENGINEERING GEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Topographic input parameters such as slope, curvature, and drainage area are derived from a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) representing the spatial elevation, and are widely used as important sources of geospatial information. Based on the chosen DEM and its derived paramters, physically based GIS models, such as TAIGRS, can compute the transient degradation of the hillslope stability due to rainfall infiltration to identify the landslide occurrences in the considered region. Hence, it is inadvertent that the accuracy of the DEM will significantly affect the outcome of the TAIGRS simulations. Obtaining a high-resolution DEM (using LiDAR, dGPS or other such ground based advanced surveying methods) for a large area is an expensive affair and unavailable in most cases. Hence, under such circumstances, DEMs available in public domain vis., CartoDEM, ALOS-AW3D30-DEM, SRTM-DEM, and ASTER-GDEM, serves to be the sole option. Each of these DEMs are obtained from varying sources using different data collection and processing techniques, thereby leading to DEMs of varying resolutions and different accuracies. Although there is ample literature on the effects of the resolution of specific DEMs, the influence of the varying accuracies of DEMs chosen for TAIGRS simulation has not been adequately reported. Considering the landslide scenario of Guwahati city as the study region, the effect of dissimilarity in DEMs on the prediction of the rainfall-induced landslides in the hillslopes of the study area is reported in this paper. Three rainfall events triggering landslides were considered as input into TAIGRS, and the simulation outcome of the different DEMs were compared with reported landslide locations. Significantly different outputs were obtained for the DEMs highlighting the importance of the analysis. Based on two different evaluation methodologies, i.e. the ROC and LRclass, landslide occurrences identified by ALOS-3D DEM provided the best agreements with the reported landslides, followed by those identified by Carlo-DEMs.

TI  - Combining Radar and Optical Imagery to Map Oil Palm Plantations in Sumatra, Indonesia, Using the Google Earth Engine
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Monitoring the expansion of commodity crops in the tropics is crucial to safeguard forests for biodiversity and ecosystem services. Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is one such crop that is a major driver of deforestation in Southeast Asia. We evaluated the use of a semi-automated approach with random forest as a classifier and combined optical and radar datasets to classify oil palm land-cover in 2015 in Sumatra, Indonesia, using Google Earth Engine. We compared our map with two existing remotely-sensed oil palm land-cover products that utilized visual and semi-automated approaches for the same year. We evaluated the accuracy of oil palm land-cover classification from optical (Landsat), radar (synthetic aperture radar (SAR)), and combined optical and radar satellite imagery (Combined). Combining Landsat and SAR data resulted in the highest overall classification accuracy (84%) and highest producer's and user's accuracy for oil palm classification (84% and 90%, respectively). The amount of oil palm land-cover in our Combined map was closer to official government statistics than the two existing land-cover products that used visual interpretation techniques. Our analysis of the extents of disagreement in oil palm land-cover indicated that our map had comparable accuracy to one of them and higher accuracy than the other. Our results demonstrate that a combination of optical and radar data outperforms the use of optical-only or radar-only datasets for oil palm classification and that our technique of preprocessing and classifying combined optical and radar data in the Google Earth Engine can be applied to accurately monitor oil-palm land-cover in Southeast Asia.

TI  - Application of Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, ASTER and WorldView-3 Spectral Imagery for Exploration of Carbonate-Hosted Pb-Zn Deposits in the Central Iranian Terrane (CIT)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The exploration of carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization is challenging due to the complex structural-geological settings and costly using geophysical and geochemical techniques. Hydrothermal alteration minerals and structural features are typically associated with this type of mineralization. Application of multi-sensor remote sensing satellite imagery as a fast and inexpensive tool for mapping alteration zones and lithological units associated with carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn deposits is worthwhile. Multiple sources of spectral data derived from different remote sensing sensors can be utilized for detailed mapping a variety of hydrothermal alteration minerals in the visible near infrared (VNIR) and the shortwave infrared (SWIR) regions. In this research, Landsat-8, Sentinel-2, Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) and WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite remote sensing sensors were used for prospecting Zn-Pb mineralization in the central part of the Kashmar-Kerman Tectonic Zone (KKTZ), the Central Iranian Terrane (CIT). The KKTZ has high potential for hosting Pb-Zn mineralization due to its specific geodynamic conditions (folded and thrust belt) and the occurrence of large carbonate platforms. For the processing of the satellite remote sensing datasets, band ratios and principal component analysis (PCA) techniques were adopted and implemented. Fuzzy logic modeling was applied to integrate the thematic layers produced by image processing techniques for generating mineral prospectivity maps of the study area. The spatial distribution of iron oxide/hydroxides, hydroxyl-bearing and carbonate minerals and dolomite were mapped using specialized band ratios and analyzing eigenvector loadings of the PC images. Subsequently, mineral prospectivity maps of the study area were generated by fusing the selected PC thematic layers using fuzzy logic modeling. The most favorable/prospective zones for hydrothermal ore mineralizations and carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization in the study region were particularly mapped and indicated. Confusion matrix, field reconnaissance and laboratory analysis were carried out to verify the occurrence of alteration zones and highly prospective locations of carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization in the study area. Results indicate that the spectral data derived from multi-sensor remote sensing satellite datasets can be broadly used for generating remote sensing-based prospectivity maps for exploration of carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn mineralization in many metallogenic provinces around the world.

TI  - ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 SAR data sensitivity analysis to surface soil moisture over bare and vegetated agricultural fields
T2  - COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is one of the important variables that help to understand the physical process between the land and the atmosphere. Thus, temporal and spatial distribution of SSM is crucial for a sustainable environment. Radar remote sensing, especially Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), is an important technology for the estimation of spatio-temporal SSM. The aim of this study is to examine the potential of L-band ALOS-2 and C-band Sentinel-1 SAR data for SSM estimation over bare and vegetated agricultural fields in a dry season (no irrigation). Field campaigns were carried out simultaneous with ALOS-2 acquisitions on 22 April 2016 (bare surfaces) and 12 June 2016 (vegetation covered surfaces). In addition, in-situ SSM, Plant Coverage (PC) and surface roughness were measured in these campaigns. The sensitivity of ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 polarizations was investigated for bare and vegetation covered surfaces. For bare soil surfaces, the highest sensitivity was obtained from HH polarization of ALOS-2 (R-2 = 0.36) and VV polarization of Sentinel-1 (R-2 = 0.74). The results demonstrated that the potential of Sentinel-1 for SSM estimation was higher than ALOS-2 over bare soil surfaces. Three models, namely Dubois semi-empirical model and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis for bare soil surfaces, and Water Cloud Model (WCM) for vegetated surfaces, were regarded for SSM estimation. Dubois model did not respond well for both data sets. Considering the MLR analyses, the testing results showed that Sentinel-1 (R-2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 1.76 vol %) presented better accuracy results than ALOS-2 (R-2 = 0.57 and RMSE = 2.29 vol%). WCM was effective in eliminating the vegetation backscattering effect and the inversion of WCM presented satisfactory results in estimating SSM with both ALOS-2 and Sentinel-1 data. Furthermore, L-band ALOS-2 provided slightly better results than C-band Sentinel-1 in WCM analysis.

TI  - Pre-seismic ionospheric anomalies and spatio-temporal analyses of MODIS Land surface temperature and aerosols associated with Sep, 24 2013 Pakistan Earthquake
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND SOLAR-TERRESTRIAL PHYSICS
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to investigate the behaviors of the potential earthquake precursors such as Total Electron Content (TEC), daytime/nighttime Land Surface Temperature (LST) and aerosols before and after the 2013 Mw 7.7 Awaran (Pakistan) earthquake. TEC values were obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements, and LST and aerosol values were retrieved from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites, respectively. In order to detect the anomalies, moving median method was used in TEC analyses and +2 sigma (95% confidence level) interval was utilized in LST and Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) analyses as anomaly indicator. TEC anomalies were identified 3 days (21.09.2013) and 5 days (19.09.2013) before the earthquake. In daytime/nighttime LST analyses, three regions of interest for spatial analyses were determined including epicenter, 10 km impact area around the epicenter and Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) 7.5 contour which was presented in the United States Geological Survey (USGS)'s shake map. Different anomalous days of LST were observed from these three regions of interest. In AOD analysis, only MMI 7.5 contour was considered due to its low spatial resolution (10 x 10km pixel size). The anomaly in AOD values was observed on 29.09.2013, 5 days after the earthquake. However, the abnormal behavior of AOD on 21.09.2013 was consistent with GPS-TEC anomaly. Furthermore, considering daytime/nighttime LST values on epicenter and 10 km impact area, we observed a systematic increase culminated near the earthquake event and a decrease after the earthquake. On the contrary, a systematic decrease and then increase of the AOD values were identified. The obtained results showed that TEC, LST and AOD were important potential precursors for Earthquake prediction; however, further developments on methods, data types and statistical analyses are still required.

T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite-based actual evapotranspiration (ETa) is becoming increasingly reliable and available for various water management and agricultural applications from water budget studies to crop performance monitoring. The Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop) model is currently used by the US Geological Survey (USGS) Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET) to routinely produce and post multitemporal ETa and ETa anomalies online for drought monitoring and early warning purposes. Implementation of the global SSEBop using the Aqua satellite's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature and global gridded weather datasets is presented. Evaluation of the SSEBop ETa data using 12 eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites over six continents indicated reasonable performance in capturing seasonality with a correlation coefficient up to 0.87. However, the modeled ETa seemed to show regional biases whose natures and magnitudes require a comprehensive investigation using complete water budgets and more quality-controlled EC station datasets. While the absolute magnitude of SSEBop ETa would require a one-time bias correction for use in water budget studies to address local or regional conditions, the ETa anomalies can be used without further modifications for drought monitoring. All ETa products are freely available for download from the USGS FEWS NET website.

TI  - A generalized regression-based unmixing model for mapping forest cover fractions throughout three decades of Landsat data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Landsat archive offers great potential for monitoring forest cover change, and new approaches moving from categorical towards continuous change products emerge rapidly. Most approaches, however, require vast amounts of high-quality reference data, limiting their applicability across space and time. We here propose the use of a generalized regression-based unmixing approach to overcome this limitation. The unmixing approach relies on temporally generalized machine learning regression models (random forest regression [RFR] and support vector regression [SVR]), which are trained on synthetically mixed data from a multi-year library of pure and hence easy to identify image spectra. We apply the model to three decades of Landsat data, mapping both overall forest cover and broadleaved/coniferous forest cover fractions across space and time. The resulting maps well represented the spatial-temporal patterns of forest (change) in our study region. The SVR model outperformed the RFR model, yielding accuracies of r(2) = 0.74/RMSE = 0.18 for the forest cover fraction maps, r(2) = 0.50/RMSE = 0.24 for the broadleaved forest cover fraction maps, and r(2) = 0.59/RMSE = 0.23 for coniferous forest cover fraction maps, respectively. Highest map errors were found in mature stands, residential areas, and recently disturbed forests. We also found some variability in forest cover fractions for stable forest pixels over time, which were explained by variation in Landsat image acquisition dates. We conclude that regression-based unmixing using synthetically mixed training data from a multi-year spectral library offers an innovative strategy for mapping forest cover fractions and forest types throughout the Landsat archive that likely can be extended to large areas.

TI  - Long-term Trend Analysis of NOx and SOx over in East Asia Using OMI Satellite Data and National Emission Inventories (2005-2015)
T2  - KOREAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite and national emission inventories were used in this study to analyze air quality in East Asia and estimate the impact of domestic and foreign emissions on South Korea's air quality, based on which future emissions were predicted. The concentration trends of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in East Asia from 2005 to 2015 showed that both substances were highest in North East China (NEC), followed by South East China (SEC) and Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). The average SO2 concentration was 1.63 times higher in NEC than in SMA. Analysis on the ratios of NO2/SO2 and NOx/SOx provides an indirect picture of the effect of transboundary air pollutants on atmospheric composition in Korea. The concentration ratio of NO2/SO2 in all study areas peaked in 2013 and SMA's emission ratio of NOx/SOx increased in 2015 by over 22% from 2013. Despite the reduction in domestic emissions, the concentration-to-emission ratios (NO2/NOx, SO2/SOx) rose gradually, which implies that other factors besides domestic emissions (e.g., foreign sources, lifetime, etc.) influence air quality in SMA. We estimated future emissions of NOx and SOx in SMA to be 296.2 and 39.0 ktons in 2025 and 284.4 and 33.8 ktons in 2035, respectively. Application of the inter-comparison techniques of this study to the data from the Geostationary Environment Monitoring Instrument (GEMS) is expected to provide concrete information which can be used to improve national emission inventories and figure out factors and sources that affect domestic air quality.

TI  - Occurrence and trophic magnification profile of triphenyltin compounds in marine mammals and their corresponding food webs
T2  - ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The occurrence of triphenyltin (TPT) compounds, a highly toxic antifouling biocide, has been documented in marine environments and organisms all over the world. While some studies showed that marine mammals can be used as sentinel organisms to evaluate the pollution status of emerging contaminants in the environment because of their long lifespans and high trophic levels, information regarding the contamination status of TPT in marine mammal species has been limited over the past decade. More importantly, the primary bioaccumulation pathway of TPT in these long-lived apex predators and the corresponding marine food web is still uncertain. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the contamination statuses of TPT in two marine mammal species, namely the finless porpoise and the Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and assess the trophic magnification potential of TPT along the food webs of these two species, using stable isotope analysis, and chemical analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The results showed that TPT is the predominant residue in majority of the analyzed individuals of two marine mammals, with concentrations ranging from 426.2 to 3476.6 ng/g wet weight in their muscle tissues. Our results also demonstrated an exponential increase in the concentration of TPT along the marine food web, indicating that trophic magnification occurs in the respective food webs of the two marine mammals. The range of trophic magnification factors of TPT in the food webs of finless porpoise and Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin was 2.51-3.47 and 2.45-3.39, respectively. These results suggest that high trophic organisms may be more vulnerable to the exposure of TPT-contaminated environments due to the high trophic magnification potential, and thus ecological risk of these compounds ought to be assessed with the consideration of their bioaccumulation potentials in these marine mammals.

TI  - Natural Enemy Community Composition and Impact on Brown Marmorated Stink Bug (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) Eggs in Minnesota Apple Orchards
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Halyomorpha halys is an invasive, polyphagous insect that feeds on many major crops, including apple. Statewide monitoring in Minnesota has shown continued increase of H. halys populations and occurrence of this pest in apple orchards. Potential arthropod natural enemies of H. halys and other pests have not been studied in Minnesota apple orchards. The purpose of this study was to characterize the composition of natural enemy communities; compare their abundances, richness and diversities between apple cultivars using different sampling methods; and assess the impact of natural enemies on sentinel eggs of H. halys in Minnesota apple orchards. Sampling occurred during the summers of 2017 and 2018 on Zestar! and Honeycrisp cultivars in four different apple orchards. In vacuum samples, arachnids, neuropterans, and coccinellids had the highest relative abundances. On yellow sticky traps, anthocorids were the most abundant. The total predator abundance differed between the cultivars sampled across years, with more predators found on Zestar! compared with Honeycrisp. No differences were observed in richness or diversity between cultivars with the exception of yellow sticky traps in 2017, which showed a greater diversity of predators in Zestar!. Despite the abundance of natural enemies sampled, sentinel egg masses deployed in the orchards each summer suffered on average <2% predation and no parasitism across years. Knowledge of differences in predator abundance between cultivars could inform management decisions; however, with current management practices, the potential for biological control of H. halys in conventional apple orchards appears low.

TI  - Influence of iron and carbon on the occurrence of <i>Ulva prolifera</i> (Ulvophyceae) in the Yellow Sea
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Over the past decade, massive outbreaks of Ulva prolifera have occurred in the Yellow Sea, China, and caused negative effects to the coastal environments. In response, many scientific investigations have been conducted to ascertain the origins of and reasons for the algal bloom that has resulted in continuous green tides. In this work, we explored the influences of iron and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) on the occurrence of green algal blooms. The moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data showed the blooming areas and movement of U. prolifera. Field observation showed that higher Fe(II) concentrations (average 0.145 mg L-1) can be correlated with large Ulva prolifera blooms. Furthermore, lower pH might enhance the accumulation of dissolved carbon into the green algae; a premise that was supported by higher concentrations of CO2(0.037 mmol L-1), HCO3- (2.58 mmol L-1) and the lowest pH value (7.69) being found together at site H11. The indoor iron- and bicarbonateenrichment experiments further confirmed that higher concentrations of Fe(II) and HCO3- and a lower pH can increase the growth rate of U. prolifera. This study indicates that seawater chemical factors contribute to the long term, ongoing green tides in the Yellow Sea and provides new thoughts for the causes of U. prolifera blooms.

TI  - The recent emergence of a highly related virulent <i>Clostridium difficile</i> clade with unique characteristics
T2  - CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives: Clostridium difficile is a major global human pathogen divided into five clades, of which Glade 3 is the least characterized and consists predominantly of PCR ribotype (RT) 023 strains. Our aim was to analyse and characterize this Glade.Methods: In this cohort study the clinical presentation of C. difficile RT023 infections was analysed in comparison with known 'hypervirulent' and non-hypervirulent strains, using data from the Netherlands national C. difficile surveillance programme. European RT023 strains of diverse origin were collected and whole-genome sequenced to determine the genetic similarity between isolates. Distinctive features were investigated and characterized.Results: Clinical presentation of C. difficile RT023 infections show severe infections akin to those seen with 'hypervirulent' strains from clades 2 (RT027) and 5 (RT078) (35%, 29% and 27% severe CDI, respectively), particularly with significantly more bloody diarrhoea than RT078 and non-hypervirulent strains (RT023 8%, other RTs 4%, p 0.036). The full genome sequence of strain CD305 is presented as a robust reference. Phylogenetic comparison of CD305 and a further 79 previously uncharacterized European RT023 strains of diverse origin revealed minor genetic divergence with >99.8% pairwise identity between strains. Analyses revealed distinctive features among Glade 3 strains, including conserved pathogenicity locus, binary toxin and phage insertion toxin genotypes, glycosylation of S-layer proteins, presence of the RT078 four-gene trehalose cluster and an esculinase-negative genotype.Conclusions: Given their recent emergence, virulence and genomic characteristics, the surveillance of Glade 3 strains should be more highly prioritized.

T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Air temperature (Ta) is an essential climatological component that controls and influences various earth surface processes. In this study, we make the first attempt to employ deep learning for Ta mapping mainly based on space remote sensing and ground station observations. Considering that Ta varies greatly in space and time and is sensitive to many factors, assimilation data and socioeconomic data are also included for a multi-source data fusion based estimation. Specifically, a 5-layers structured deep belief network (DBN) is employed to better capture the complicated and non-linear relationships between Ta and different predictor variables. Layer-wise pre-training process for essential features extraction and fine-tuning process for weight parameters optimization ensure the robust prediction of Ta spatio-temporal distribution. The DBN model was implemented for 0.01 degrees daily maximum Ta mapping across China. The ten-fold cross-validation results indicate that the DBN model achieves promising results with the RMSE of 1.996 degrees C, MAE of 1.539 degrees C, and R of 0.986 at the national scale. Compared with multiple linear regression (MLR), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and random forest (RF) method, the DBN model reduces the MAE values by 1.340 degrees C, 0.387 degrees C and 0.222 degrees C, respectively. Further analysis on spatial distribution and temporal tendency of prediction errors both validate the great potentials of DBN in Ta estimation.

TI  - Observation of abnormal coastal cold-water outbreak in the Taiwan Strait and the cold event at Penghu waters in the beginning of 2008
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SYSTEMS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Penghu archipelago locates near the Tropic of Cancer, guarding the southern entrance of the Taiwan Strait (TWS). Since the archipelago is usually surrounded by warm waters from the Kuroshio branch and the South China Sea, the marine ecosystem in the waters surrounding the archipelago is mainly tropical. However, this area may be invaded by cold water, which can cause serious ecological disasters. Among the few rare events ever documented, the cold event in early 2008 represented a typical case in this regard. In this paper, we investigated this event using in situ measurements and remote sensing data. Our analyses show that during the destructive snow and ice storm of early 2008, strong cold winds persisted for similar to 40 days over the TWS area, with a mean prevailing wind speed of about 15 m/s, and the water temperature in the strait dropped sharply, especially along the mainland coast. On the other side of the strait, the Penghu area experienced extremely low temperatures, leading to a cold event. Note that the time of temperature reduction in Penghu was earlier than the time of temperature reduction in the area farther north along the coast of Taiwan. This indicates that a cross-strait outbreak of the mainland coastal cold-water (MCCW) caused the cold event, and thus triggered the cold disaster. The outbreak resulted from the combined effect of favorable background hydrographic conditions, persistent strong northeasterly, strong mainland coastal current (MCC), and the interaction of current and waves with the bottom topography of the Taiwan Bank (TWB). Remotely generated coastal trapped waves (CTWs) may also play a role.

TI  - Spatial relationship of greenspace landscape pattern with land surface temperature in three cities of southern Fujian
T2  - Shengtaixue Zazhi
M3  - Article
AB  - Exploring the effects of greenspace landscape pattern on thermal environment is of great significance to improving urban ecological environment. Based on Landsat remote sensing data in Xiamen, Zhangzhou and Quanzhou of southern Fujian, landscape ecology and spatial autocorrelation theory were used to quantify spatial distribution characteristics of greenspace landscape and land surface temperature. Further, we used bivariate spatial autocorrelation and spatial autoregressive model to analyze the spatial relationships. The results showed that both of green space and land surface temperature had significant spatial autocorrelation. In the inland areas with high elevations, greenspace was significantly concentrated with relatively low land surface temperature, while in urban areas, towns and large areas of cultivated land, greenspace was less distributed and relatively high land surface temperature. Greenspace landscape pattern had stronger effects on the land surface temperature in Zhangzhou and Quanzhou than in Xiamen. The percentage of landscape, largest patch index, aggregation index and mean patch area of greenspace were negatively correlated with land surface temperature, whereas patch density was positively correlated with land surface temperature. The correlation between edge density, mean shape index and land surface temperature is uncertain. Spatial lag model and spatial error model performed better in explaining the spatial relationship between greenspace landscape pattern and land surface temperature.

TI  - Grossing and reporting of breast cancer specimens: An evidence-based approach
T2  - INDIAN JOURNAL OF CANCER
M3  - Review
AB  - A histopathology report offers important prognostic and predictive information that helps plan systemic therapy in breast cancer. However, in many cases a pathologist fails to provide relevant information chiefly due to the lack of awareness of the impact of these parameters in clinical decision-making. This review seeks to put forth common practice points in grossing and reporting of specimens harboring breast cancer with focus on latest revisions in the same. Just as it is important to document tumor size, tumor type, margins, estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor (ER/PR/HER2) in breast cancer, we need to also focus on sentinel node grossing, nodal burden, size of nodal metastasis, and extranodal extension. In parallel, increasing number of patients are getting neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer and points in grossing and reporting of such specimens are also alluded to. This article will serve as reference guide to pathologists on what we do and why we do the same.

TI  - Integration of Selective Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Mineral Exploration Using ASTER Satellite Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - There are a significant number of image processing methods that have been developed during the past decades for detecting anomalous areas, such as hydrothermal alteration zones, using satellite images. Among these methods, dimensionality reduction or transformation techniques are known to be a robust type of methods, which are helpful, as they reduce the extent of a study area at the initial stage of mineral exploration. Principal component analysis (PCA), independent component analysis (ICA), and minimum noise fraction (MNF) are the dimensionality reduction techniques known as multivariate statistical methods that convert a set of observed and correlated input variables into uncorrelated or independent components. In this study, these techniques were comprehensively compared and integrated, to show how they could be jointly applied in remote sensing data analysis for mapping hydrothermal alteration zones associated with epithermal Cu-Au deposits in the Toroud-Chahshirin range, Central Iran. These techniques were applied on specific subsets of the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) spectral bands for mapping gossans and hydrothermal alteration zones, such as argillic, propylitic, and phyllic zones. The fuzzy logic model was used for integrating the most rational thematic layers derived from the transformation techniques, which led to an efficient remote sensing evidential layer for mineral prospectivity mapping. The results showed that ICA was a more robust technique for generating hydrothermal alteration thematic layers, compared to the other dimensionality reduction techniques. The capabilities of this technique in separating source signals from noise led to improved enhancement of geological features, such as specific alteration zones. In this investigation, several previously unmapped prospective zones were detected using the integrated hydrothermal alteration map and most of the known hydrothermal mineral occurrences showed a high prospectivity value. Fieldwork and laboratory analysis were conducted to validate the results and to verify new prospective zones in the study area, which indicated a good consistency with the remote sensing output. This study demonstrated that the integration of remote sensing-based alteration thematic layers derived from the transformation techniques is a reliable and low-cost approach for mineral prospectivity mapping in metallogenic provinces, at the reconnaissance stage of mineral exploration.

TI  - Probing recent environmental changes and resident perceptions in Upper Himalaya, Nepal
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We studied time series of MODIS satellite imagery (2000-2018) to characterize trends in vegetation as well as permanent snow/ice cover in the Upper Mustang Region (UMR) of Nepal and evaluated the relationships between rainfall and MODIS-derived vegetation cover. To examine local perceptions of change we interviewed residents from two villages; Yara and Samzong located in the study region. The spatial analysis showed decreasing trends in rangeland vegetation in UMR over the past 19 years. We found low correlations between rainfall and vegetation, which suggests the rangeland vegetation is more influenced by factors other than rainfall such as snowfall in winter, water accumulated from permanent snow/ice cover and overgrazing. Our study showed decreasing permanent snow/ice cover in the region. Air temperature was found to be increasing whereas rainfall had a declining trend over the last 30 years. A comparison of the local people's perceptions with the results from the biophysical analysis showed there was a good agreement of weather, vegetation and snow cover trends; however, it was found that locals might not recognize their own influence on changes in particular on vegetation cover by attributing all changes to climatic variations. Incorporating local perceptions can contribute to our understanding of land cover and climate change effects on rural livelihoods and land management.

TI  - Effects of Model Coupling on Typhoon Kalmaegi (2014) Simulation in the South China Sea
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Typhoon Kalmaegi (2014) in the South China Sea (SCS) is simulated using a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-wave model (COAWST). A set of sensitivity experiments are conducted to investigate the effects of different model coupling combinations on the typhoon simulation. Model results are validated by employing in-situ data at four locations in the SCS, and best-track and satellite data. Correlation and root-mean-square difference are used to assess the simulation quality. A skill score system is defined from these two statistical criteria to evaluate the performance of model experiments relative to a baseline. Atmosphere-ocean feedback is crucial for accurate simulations. Our baseline experiment successfully reconstructs the atmospheric and oceanic conditions during Typhoon Kalmaegi. Typhoon-induced sea surface cooling that weakens the system due to less heat and moisture availability is captured best in a Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS)-coupled run. The Simulated Wave Nearshore (SWAN)-coupled run has demonstrated the ability to estimate sea surface roughness better. Intense winds lead to a larger surface roughness where more heat and momentum are exchanged, while the rougher surface causes more friction, slowing down surface winds. From our experiments, we show that these intricate interactions require a fully coupled Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)-ROMS-SWAN model to best reproduce the environment during a typhoon.

AB  - From the investigations that began with the completion of a doctoral thesis, research has continued on the intercultural dialogue of knowledge that constitutes the Caribbean ethos in northern Colombia in the South American continent and, if this has been the subject of interest for Psychology that is addressed in this context and in the training of professionals in this discipline, initially addressing-from the three pioneering university programs in such work, two private (emerged the first five years of the seventies of the twentieth century) and a public, offered at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The text is based on the phenomenological, qualitative paradigm and the historical-hermeneutical method, triangulating through the consultation of bibliographic and archival sources, semi-structured interviews with psychologists, pedagogues and sociologists and testimonial contributions of some teachers-administrative and graduates of the three programs of Psychology at the Metropolitan and Northern Universities in Barranquilla and the University of Magdalena in Santa Marta. One way of approaching the results, points to an enormous distance or fragmentation, a non-dialogue or if this occurs, even incipient, between the ancestral knowledge-worldview of the original peoples settled in this region and the Eurocentrist emphasis-scientific knowledge and Anglo-Saxons that are part of the curricula, research and publications in these university context-programs.

TI  - Extended Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer Patients who Achieve Complete Nodal Response with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF BREAST HEALTH
M3  - Review
AB  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) can eradicate axillary disease in breast cancer (BC) patients. Sentinel node biopsy (SNB) in patients with positive axilla who accomplish complete clinical response after NAC is a new opportunity for changing paradigms and decreasing the extension and the morbidity of axillary surgery. The aim of this article is to review the limits of SNB in this setting and present the current status of an expanded modification of this technique. False-negative rates (FNRs) of conventional SNB exceed the threshold of 10%, and are not acceptable. The extended SNB (ESNB) entails the removal of at least 3 lymph nodes (1Ns) including the sentinel node (SN) mapped by dual tracers and a marked lymph node (LN) that was found previously metastatic. This node by node removal procedure greatly reduces the FNRs of the procedure. Despite that axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is still the standard of care for patients with involved LNs before NAC, the ESNB is a valid option for selected patients in whom axillary positive disease is converted to negative. 'When ESNB is negative in such cases (immunohistochemistry included), the omission of ALND seems to be safe.

TI  - Modified possibilistic c-means with constraints (MPCM-S) approach for incorporating the local information in a remote sensing image classification
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In this research letter a Modified Possibilistic c-Means with constraints (MPCM-S) algorithm has been proposed for an image classification. This algorithm has been presented to overcome the shortcoming of Possibilistic c-Means (PCM) and Modified Possibilistic c-Means (MPCM). It is done by incorporating the local information using the spatial constraints and expected to control the effect of neighbouring terms. This Neighbourhood labelling has been introduced in MPCM-S by introducing local window (NR) including noise minimizer (lambda(i)) and regularizer parameter (eta(i)). Experiments have been conducted on the Formosat-2 and Landsat-8 satellite imagery of study area Haridwar, India. The classified outputs generated for both types of satellite data by applying the algorithms viz., PCM, Possibilistic c-Means with constraints (PCM-S), MPCM and Modified Possibilistic c-Means with constraints (MPCM-S) were optimized using an independent assessment method known as Mean Membership Difference (MMD). Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) has been conducted to test the proposed algorithms. RMSE has been computed between original and noisy classified image for Formosat-2 satellite imagery in which MPCM-S produces least RMSE. Furthermore, the Fuzzy Error Matrix (FERM) based assessment of accuracy method has been used to evaluate the classified outputs from Landsat-8 data using the Formosat-2 as reference data. The proposed algorithm has also been able to extract heterogeneously distributed land cover classes. The results of this study show that proposed MPCM-S classifier is effective in minimizing noisy pixels and outliers and maximize the fuzzy overall accuracy than PCM and MPCM.

TI  - ScatSat-1 Leaf Area Index Product: Models Comparison, Development, and Validation Over Cropland
T2  - IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - The leaf area index (LAI) is a crucial parameter that governs the physical and biophysical processes of plant canopies and acts as an input variable in land surface and soil moisture modeling. The ScatSat-1 is the latest microwave Ku-band scatterometer mission of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), provides data at a higher temporal and spatial resolution for various applications. Due to its all-weather operational capability, it could be used as an alternative to the optical/IR sensors for the LAI estimation. In the technical literature domain, no testing has been done to estimate the LAI using ScatSat-1 scatterometer data. Therefore, the objective of this study is to retrieve the LAI using the ScatSat-1 backscattering by modifications of two different models viz. water cloud model (WCM) and the recently developed Oveisgharan et al. model and compared against the PROBA-V, MODIS, and ground-based LAI products. To assess the performance of these models, coefficient of determination ( $R<^>{2}$ ), root-mean-squared error (RMSE) and bias are computed. For Oveisgharan et al., the values of $R<^>{2}$ , RMSE and bias were obtained as 0.87, 0.57 m(2)m(-2), and 0.05 m(2)m(-2) respectively, whereas for WCM model, the values were found as 0.82, 0.67 m(2)m(-2), and 0.32 m(2)m(-2) respectively. This investigation showed that the modifications in Oveisgharan et al. model provide marginally better results in the retrieval of LAI using ScatSat-1 data than the WCM model. The models' limitation may be less serious for crop management studies because the majority of crops attains its maturity at LAI values less than 6 m(2)/m(2).

TI  - Estimation of leaf area index using PROSAIL based LUT inversion, MLRA-GPR and empirical models: Case study of tropical deciduous forest plantation, North India
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests play a vital role in biological cycles and environmental regulation. To understand the key processes of forest canopies (e.g., photosynthesis, respiration and transpiration), reliable and accurate information on spatial variability of Leaf Area Index (LAI), and its seasonal dynamics is essential. In the present study, we assessed the performance of biophysical parameter (LAI) retrieval methods viz. Look-Up Table (LUT)-inversion, MLRA-GPR (Machine Learning Regression Algorithm- Gaussian Processes Regression) and empirical models, for estimating the LAI of tropical deciduous plantation using ARTMO (Automated Radiative Transfer Models Operator) tool and Sentinel-2 satellite images. The study was conducted in Central Tarai Forest Division, Haldwani, located in the Uttarakhand state, India. A total of 49 ESUs (Elementary Sampling Unit) of 30 m x 30 m size were established based on variability in composition and age of plantation stands. In-situ LAI was recorded using plant canopy imager during the leaf growing, peak and senescence seasons. The PROSAIL model was calibrated with site-specific biophysical and biochemical parameters before used to the predicted LAI. The plantation LAI was also predicted by an empirical approach using optimally chosen Sentinel-2 vegetation indices. In addition, Sentinel-2 and MODIS LAI products were evaluated with respect to LAI measurements. MLRA-GPR offered best results for predicting LAI of leaf growing (R-2 = 0.9, RMSE = 0.14), peak (R-2 = 0.87, RMSE = 0.21) and senescence (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.31) seasons while LUT inverted model outperformed VI's based parametric regression model. Vegetation indices (VIs) derived from 740 nm, 783 nm and 2190 nm band combinations of Sentinel-2 offered the best prediction of LAI.

TI  - Mapping wetland characteristics using temporally dense Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data: A case study in the St. Lucia wetlands, South Africa
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Wetlands have been determined as one of the most valuable ecosystems on Earth and are currently being lost at alarming rates. Large-scale monitoring of wetlands is of high importance, but also challenging. The Sentinel-1 and -2 satellite missions for the first time provide radar and optical data at high spatial and temporal detail, and with this a unique opportunity for more accurate wetland mapping from space arises. Recent studies already used Sentinel-1 and -2 data to map specific wetland types or characteristics, but for comprehensive wetland characterisations the potential of the data has not been researched yet. The aim of our research was to study the use of the high-resolution and temporally dense Sentinel-1 and -2 data for wetland mapping in multiple levels of characterisation. The use of the data was assessed by applying Random Forests for multiple classification levels including general wetland delineation, wetland vegetation types and surface water dynamics. The results for the St. Lucia wetlands in South Africa showed that combining Sentinel-1 and -2 led to significantly higher classification accuracies than for using the systems separately. Accuracies were relatively poor for classifications in high-vegetated wetlands, as subcanopy flooding could not be detected with Sentinel-1's C-band sensors operating in VV/VH mode. When excluding high-vegetated areas, overall accuracies were reached of 88.5% for general wetland delineation, 90.7% for mapping wetland vegetation types and 87.1% for mapping surface water dynamics. Sentinel-2 was particularly of value for general wetland delineation, while Sentinel-1 showed more value for mapping wetland vegetation types. Overlaid maps of all classification levels obtained overall accuracies of 69.1% and 76.4% for classifying ten and seven wetland classes respectively.

TI  - The effect of the snow weighting on the temporal stability of hydrologic model efficiency and parameters
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the current changing climate, the importance of temporal stability of hydrological models is increasing. The objective of this paper is to assess the effects of the changing weight of snow (w(S)) in a multiple objective calibration of a conceptual hydrological model in terms of the temporal stability of runoff and snow model efficiency and hydrologic model parameters. The methodology was tested by a lumped conceptual hydrological model (the TUW model), which was calibrated and validated in 213 Austrian catchments in two climatically different decades (i.e., 1981-1990 and 2001-2010). The results indicate that the runoff and snow model efficiencies are almost insensitive to a large range of wS, i.e., from 0 to 0.9 for the runoff and from 0.75 to 1.0 for the snow. This relationship is similar in the two different decades; however, the calibration runoff model efficiency (i.e., Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency) was about 5 to 10% greater in flatland catchments in the warmer decade (2001-2010). The main impact of wS on the snow model efficiency is the reduction of snow underestimation errors in the flatland catchments. The relative improvement of the snow simulations in the validation periods is greater in the flatland catchments and is in a range of 45-60% compared to 13% and 31% in the alpine catchments. The evaluation of the temporal stability indicates that increasing the weight of the snow increases the temporal stability of the degree-day factor and the parameters of the snowfall and rainfall thresholds. A change in the weight of the snow has the greatest impact on glacerized catchments, which were the most sensitive to changes in the mean annual air temperature between the two decades.

TI  - FREE MAN AND TALION PRINCIPLE IN RUSSIAN BIBLICAL DISCOURSE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND THEOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The relevance of studying this topic is determined by two factors: 1) the lack of a comprehensive insight into the crisis processes that have struck modern civilization, 2) the genetic affinity of objective contradictions underlying the ideological crises of the turn of the XIX-XX and XX-XXI centuries. The purpose of this study is to identify the conceptual relationship of religious archetypes with anthropological, legal and ontological spheres of biblical discourse of the twentieth century. The all-encompassing revaluation of values affected the deep structures of human mind and led to the emergence of new ideals. First of all, the destruction affected the philosophical and religious foundations of the European worldview The rationalistic optimism is displaced by pessimistic idea, the expansion of religious modernism contributes to the successes of occultism and theosophy, Realism is retreating under the pressure of the Decadence. These processes are directly reflected in the rethinking of the human freedom concept, the question of the meaning and measure of justice and the question of the necessary nature of the institutions recorded in the Old and New Testaments. The authors define the particular features of destruction and deformation of conceptually significant relations present in the biblical discourse. The data obtained upon the analysis show that the archetypes of 'man', 'freedom', 'justice' and 'retribution' in the period of ideological crisis tend to displace or destroy the basic archetypes of biblical discourse and form their own religious, philosophical and legal space, seeking to deploy itself in actual existence. The materials of the article are of practical value for researchers of the religious and philosophical discourse of the twentieth century. In addition, the results obtained can be used in the study of general and particular problems of religious and philosophical anthropology, religious teachings on law and religious and philosophical concepts of culture.

TI  - An allometric area-based approach-a cost-effective method for stand volume estimation based on ALS and NFI data
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable information concerning stand volume is fundamental to making strategic decisions in sustainable forest management. A variety of remotely sensed data and different inventory methods have been used for the estimation of forest biometric parameters. Particularly, airborne laser scanning (ALS) point clouds are widely used for the estimation of stand volume and forest biomass using an area-based approach (ABA) framework. This method relies on the reference measurements of field plots with the necessary prerequisite of a precise co-registration between ground reference plots and the corresponding ALS samples. In this research, the allometric area-based approach (AABA) is proposed in the context of stand volume estimation of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) stands. The proposed method does not require detailed information about the coordinates of the field plots. We applied Polish National Forest Inventory data from 9400 circular field plots (400 m(2)) to develop a plot level stand volume allometric model using two independent variables: top height (TH) and relative spacing index (RSI). The model was developed using the multiple linear regression method with a log-log transformation of variables. The hypothesis was that, the field measurements of TH and RSI could be replaced with corresponding ALS-derived metrics. It was assumed that TH could be represented by the maximum height of the ALS point cloud, while RSI can be calculated based on the number of tree crowns delineated within the ALS-derived canopy height model. Performance of the developed AABA model was compared with the semi-empirical ABA(SE) (with two predictors: TH and RSI) and empirical ABA(E) (several point cloud metrics as predictors). The models were validated at the plot level using 315 forest management inventory plots (400 m(2)) and at the stand level using the complete field measurements from 42 Scots pine dominated forest stands in the Milicz forest district (Poland). The AABA model showed a comparable accuracy to the traditional ABA models with relatively high accuracy at the plot (relative root mean square error (RMSE)=22.8 per cent; R-2=0.63) and stand levels (RMSE=17.8 per cent, R-2=0.65). The proposed novel approach reduces time- and cost-consuming field work required for the classic ABA method, without a significant reduction in the accuracy of stand volume estimations. The AABA is potentially applicable in the context of forest management inventory without the necessity for field measurements at local scale. The transportability of the approach to other species and more complex stands needs to be explored in future studies.

TI  - ANALYSIS THE POTENTIAL OF VEGETATION INDICES (NDVI) FOR LAND USE / COVER CLASSIFRICATION IN KARACHI BY LANDSAT 8 DATA
T2  - International Journal of Biology and Biotechnology
M3  - Article
AB  - Vegetation is a crucial and essential element of an ecosystem. The urban ecosystem can also not be completed without the presences of urban flora. Assessment of urban vegetation and its classification is a difficult task with the traditional method. Several techniques have been used for vegetation and environmental assessment nowadays, including remote sensing. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is well-known techniques in remote sensing which is used to classify and quantifying vegetation. The main objective of this paper is the classification of urban vegetation with the help of NDVI Index using Remote Sensing and Geographical Information System for Karachi and its neighbourhood. In this study we used Landsat 8 satellite images for monitoring and assessing vegetation. We classified vegetation types and land categories including cropping, farming, orchard, urban parks, playgrounds, built-up areas and transportation corridors.

TI  - Review of Satellite Interferometry for Landslide Detection in Italy
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Review
AB  - Landslides recurrently impact the Italian territory, producing huge economic losses and casualties. Because of this, there is a large demand for monitoring tools to support landslide management strategies. Among the variety of remote sensing techniques, Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) has become one of the most widely applied for landslide studies. This work reviews a variety of InSAR-related applications for landslide studies in Italy. More than 250 papers were analyzed in this review. The first application dates back to 1999. The average production of InSAR-related papers for landslide studies is around 12 per year, with a peak of 37 papers in 2015. Almost 70% of the papers are written by authors in academia. InSAR is used (i) for landslide back analysis (3% of the papers); (ii) for landslide characterization (40% of the papers); (iii) as input for landslide models (7% of the papers); (iv) to update landslide inventories (15% of the papers); (v) for landslide mapping (32% of the papers), and (vi) for monitoring (3% of the papers). Sixty-eight percent of the authors validated the satellite results with ground information or other remote sensing data. Although well-known limitations exist, this bibliographic overview confirms that InSAR is a consolidated tool for many landslide-related applications.

TI  - The Methodology of Landscape Quality (LQ) Indicators Analysis Based on Remote Sensing Data: Polish National Parks Case Study
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape quality (LQ) encompasses diverse characteristic of the natural and cultural environment. The most effective tool to analyze LQ is the use of indicators. The main problem in the assessment of LQ is not the lack of indicators, but its multitude. That is why, the indicators' categorization is a problematic issue. The paper aims to introduce and test the methodology for selecting the suitable indicators based on the example of two national parks located in the south-east part of Poland. The method composed of the following stages: (1) Selection of spatial units being analyzed; (2) selection of indicators type(s); (3) selection of specific indicators; (4) calculation of indicator set no 1; (5) analysis of the correlation between indicators' pairs; (6) selection of a final set of indicators; (7) analysis of effectiveness. The latter stage, refers to the statistical analysis of significance between results obtained dependently on the data sources, a spatial unit of analysis and analyzed regions. The results showed that the categorization composed of ten, mainly composite indicators, can be applied to conclude on different levels of LQ of protected areas. The differences between two analyzed data sources, different spatial units, as well as diverse regions, occurred to be statistically insignificant. Generally, the results of the effectiveness analysis showed that a final categorization of LQ indicators is adequate to conclude on the diverse dimensions of LQ of analyzed protected areas.

TI  - Mapping Kenyan Grassland Heights Across Large Spatial Scales with Combined Optical and Radar Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Grassland monitoring can be challenging because it is time-consuming and expensive to measure grass condition at large spatial scales. Remote sensing offers a time- and cost-effective method for mapping and monitoring grassland condition at both large spatial extents and fine temporal resolutions. Combinations of remotely sensed optical and radar imagery are particularly promising because together they can measure differences in moisture, structure, and reflectance among land cover types. We combined multi-date radar (PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1) and optical (Sentinel-2) imagery with field data and visual interpretation of aerial imagery to classify land cover in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya using machine learning (Random Forests). This study area comprises a diverse array of land cover types and changes over time due to seasonal changes in precipitation, seasonal movements of large herds of resident and migratory ungulates, fires, and livestock grazing. We classified twelve land cover types with user's and producer's accuracies ranging from 66%-100% and an overall accuracy of 86%. These methods were able to distinguish among short, medium, and tall grass cover at user's accuracies of 83%, 82%, and 85%, respectively. By yielding a highly accurate, fine-resolution map that distinguishes among grasses of different heights, this work not only outlines a viable method for future grassland mapping efforts but also will help inform local management decisions and research in the Masai Mara National Reserve.

TI  - Spatially Quantifying Forest Loss at Landscape-scale Following a Major Storm Event
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Large scale forest disturbances are becoming more frequent across the world, and remote sensing must play a role in informing and prioritizing immediate, short-term and long-term disaster response and recovery. However, such evaluations from remote sensing are currently limited (e.g., burned area severity and change NDVI) and do not always explicitly relate to change in resources of interest. Herein we demonstrate a novel method to predict basal area loss, validated by independent field evaluations. Hurricane Michael made landfall on Mexico Beach in the Florida panhandle as a Category 5 storm on October 10th, 2018. The storm affected roughly 2 million hectares of largely forested land in the area. In this study, we use Sentinel-2 imagery and 248 forest plots collected prior to landfall in 2018 in the forests impacted by Hurricane Michael to build a general linear model of tree basal area across the landscape. The basal area model was constrained to areas where trees were present using a tree presence model as a hurdle. We informed the model with post-hurricane Sentinel-2 imagery and compared the pre- and post- hurricane basal area maps to assess the loss of basal area following the hurricane. The basal area model had an r-squared value of 0.508. Plots were revisited to ground truth the modelled results; this showed that the model performed well at categorizing forest hurricane damage. Our results validate a novel method to create a landscape scale spatial dataset showing the location and intensity of basal area loss at 10-m spatial resolution which can be used for quantifying forest disturbances worldwide.

T2  - JURNAL ILMU DAN TEKNOLOGI KELAUTAN TROPIS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Worldview-2 imagery application with groud truth habitat data still has shortcomings that require a long time, limited access, high costs and risk factors. Surveying techniques using drones can reduce these limitations. This study aims to classify and test the accuracy of shallow water habitat classification results in Lancang Island and Sebaru Besar Island from Worldview-2 imagery with ground truth habitat (GTH) and virtual ground truth (VGT) input data and explore the spatial resolution of drone images at altitude different. Overall accuracy results were obtained for 7 habitat classes on Lancang Island with GTH and VGT data of 65.5% and 60.6%, respectively. Whereas in Sebaru Besar Island they were 67.5% and 64.6%, respectively. Comparison of the accuracy of the classification results obtained 4.9% selisi on Lancang Island and 2.9% on Sebaru Besar Island. Significance test results of the GTH and VGT methods on Lancang Island were significantly different with a Z value of 2.0851, while on Sebaru Besar Island it was not significantly different from the Z value of 0.5255, so that benthic habitat mapping with the VGT method could be used as an alternative in-situ field observation, however this still requires further research.

TI  - Ethnobotanical Knowledge Encoded in Weenhayek Oral Tradition
T2  - JOURNAL OF ETHNOBIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Stories that reference plants occur throughout Indigenous oral traditions. It is widely recognized among local and academic knowledge holders that such stories store and transmit valuable ethnobotanical knowledge. However, there has been little detailed investigation of the quantity and kinds of information conveyed or the ways in which this information is encoded in oral texts. In this paper, we explore in detail the nature of this transmitted ethnobotanical knowledge, investigating the extent to which stories encode and convey information useful for identifying, locating, harvesting, processing, and predicting availability of important plant resources. Using an existing collection of traditional narratives from the Weenhayek of the Bolivian Gran Chaco, we searched for stories about wild plants and plant products. This search yielded a sample of 40 narratives, which were analyzed for the presence of information about plant characteristics, associated ecological cues, habitat and distribution, management, extraction and processing, availability, uses, and worldview (i.e., prescriptions and proscriptions related to plant management, extraction, processing, or use). Results are discussed in light of the constraints imposed by human attentional and memory systems, and their implications for knowledge storage and transmission.

TI  - Spatial-Temporal Characteristics of Coastline Changes in Indonesia from 1990 to 2018
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - As a valuable resource in coastal areas, coastlines are not only vulnerable to natural processes such as erosion, siltation, and disasters, but are also subjected to strong pressures from human processes such as urban growth, resource development, and pollution discharge. This is especially true for reef nations with rich coastline resources and a large population, like Indonesia. The technical joint of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) has significant advantages for monitoring coastline changes on a large scale and for quantitatively analyzing their change mechanisms. Indonesia was taken as an example in this study because of its abundant coastline resources and large population. First, Landsat images from 1990 to 2018 were used to obtain coastline information. Then, the index of coastline utilization degree (ICUD) method, the changes in land and sea patterns method, and the ICUD at different scales method were used to reveal the spatiotemporal change pattern for the coastline. The results found that: (1) Indonesia's total coastline length has increased by 777.40 km in the past 28 years, of which the natural coastline decreased by 5995.52 km and the artificial coastline increased by 6771.92 km. (2) From the analysis of the island scale, it was known that the island with the largest increase in ICUD was Kalimantan, at the expense of the mangrove coastline. (3) On the provincial scale, the province with the largest change of ICUD was Sumatera Selatan Province, which increased from 100 in 1900 to 266.43 in 2018. (4) The change trend of the land and sea pattern for the Indonesian coastline was mainly expanded to the sea. The part that eroded to the land was relatively small; among which, Riau Province had the most significant expansion of land area, about 177.73 km(2), accounting for 23.08% of the increased national land area. The worst seawater erosion was in the Jawa Barat Province. Based on the analysis of population and economic data during the same period, it was found that the main driving mechanism behind Indonesia's coastline change was population growth, which outweighed the impact of economic development. However, the main constraint on the Indonesian coastline was the topographic factor. The RS and GIS scheme used in this study can not only provide support for coastline resource development and policy formulation in Indonesia, but also provide a valuable reference for the evolution of coastline resources and environments in other regions around the world.

TI  - Medium-Scale Soil Map of the Crimea Southern Coast
T2  - EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Digital medium-scale (1 : 100 000) soil map of the Southern Coast from the Aia Cape on the west to the town of Feodosiya on the east was compiled on the basis of field data obtained by the authors. This map contains actual information on the soil cover of natural, humanly transformed landscapes, and urbanized territories. The map was created using GIS and remote sensing methods (multispectral Landsat images were applied). The legend to the map was based on the Classification and Diagnostic System of Russian Soils (2004). The map comprises 1053 polygons and 34 soil units, which are arranged in four groups: natural soils, soils of terraced slopes, agricultural soils, and soils of urbanized territories. There is also information about rock outcrops, soil erosion intensity, and share of natural soils in the areas of human-modified soils. The analysis of the map demonstrates that natural soils occupy 63% of the area. The main natural soils are Dystric Cambisols (they compose approximately 35% of all natural soils) and Eutric Cambisols (about 23%). Among human-modified soils, soils of urbanized areas make up about 15%; agricultural soils, 12%; and soils of terraced slopes (Escalic qualifier in the WRB) under forest plantations, 10%. The latter soils are widespread and may be named "Postturbozems"; this term is absent in the Classification and Diagnostic System of Russian Soils (2004). The new digital soil map reflects the features of the present-day soil cover of the Southern Coast of Crimea and may be used for agricultural and forest management purposes, as well as for geographical, pedological, and ecological studies.

TI  - Air pollution associated respiratory mortality risk alleviated by residential greenness in the Chinese Elderly Health Service Cohort
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Although residing in lower surrounding greenness and transient exposure to air pollution are independently associated with higher risk of adverse health outcomes, little is known about their interactions. Objectives: We examine whether residential neighborhood greenness modifies the short-term association between air pollution and respiratory mortality among the participants of Chinese Elderly Health Service Cohort in Hong Kong.Methods: We estimated residential surrounding greenness by measuring satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from Landsat within catchments of residential addresses of participants who died of respiratory diseases between 1998 and 2011. We first dichotomized NDVI into low and high greenness and used a time-stratified case-crossover approach to estimate the percent excess risk of respiratory mortality associated with fine particulate matter (PM2.5), respirable particulate matter (PM10), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (03). We further classified NDVI into greenness quartiles and introduced an interaction term between air pollution and the assigned median values of the NDVI quartiles into the models to assess the trend of greenness modification on the air pollution and respiratory mortality associations.Results: Among 3159 respiratory deaths during the follow-up, 2058 were from pneumonia and 947 from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Elders living in the low greenness areas were associated with a higher risk of pneumonia mortality attributed to NO2 (p = 0.049) and O-3 (p = 0.025). The mortality risk of pneumonia showed a decreasing trend for NO2 (p for trend = 0.041), O-3 (p for trend = 0.006), and PM2.5 (p for trend = 0.034) with greenness quartiles increasing from Quartile 1 (lowest) to Quartile 4 (highest).Conclusions: Our findings suggest that elders living in higher greenness areas are less susceptible to pneumonia mortality associated with air pollution, which provides evidence for optimizing allocation, siting, and quality of urban green space to minimize detrimental health effects of air pollution.

TI  - The Trend Inconsistency between Land Surface Temperature and Near Surface Air Temperature in Assessing Urban Heat Island Effects
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The credible urban heat island (UHI) trend is crucial for assessing the effects of urbanization on climate. Land surface temperature (LST) and near surface air temperature (SAT) have been extensively used to obtain UHI intensities. However, the consistency of UHI trend between LST and SAT has rarely been discussed. This paper quantified the temporal stability and trend consistency between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST and in situ SAT. Linear regressions, temporal trends and coefficients of variations (CV) were analyzed based on the yearly mean, maximum and minimum temperatures. The findings in this study were: (1) Good statistical consistency (R-2 = 0.794) and the same trends were found only in mean temperature between LST-UHI and SAT-UHI. There are 54% of cities that showed opposite temporal trends between LST-UHI and SAT-UHI for minimum temperature while the percentage was 38% for maximum temperature. (2) The high discrepancies in temporal trends were observed for all cities, which indicated the inadequacy of LST for obtaining reliable UHI trends especially when using the maximum and minimum temperatures. (3) The larger uncertainties of LST-UHI were probably due to high inter-annual fluctuations of LST. The topography was the predominant factor that affected the UHI variations for both LST and SAT. Therefore, we suggested that SAT should be combined with LST to ensure the dependable temporal series of UHI. This paper provided references for understanding the UHI effects on various surfaces.

TI  - Reconstruction of GRACE Data on Changes in Total Water Storage Over the Global Land Surface and 60 Basins
T2  - WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Launched in May 2018, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO)-the successor of the erstwhile GRACE mission-monitors changes in total water storage, which is a critical state variable of the regional and global hydrologic cycles. However, the gap between data of the two missions is breaking the continuity of the observations and limiting its further application. In this study, we used three learning-based models, that is, deep neural network, multiple linear regression (MLR), and seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables, and six GRACE solutions (i.e., Jet Propulsion Laboratory spherical harmonics (JPL-SH), Center for Space Research SH (CSR-SH), GeoforschungsZentrum Potsdam SH (GFZ-SH), JPL mass concentration blocks (mascons) (JPL-M), CSR mascons (CSR-M), and Goddard Space Flight Center mascons (GSFC-M)) to reconstruct the missing monthly data at a grid cell scale. Evaluation showed that the three learning-based models were reliable for the reconstruction of GRACE data in areas with humid and no/low human interventions. The deep neural network models slightly outperformed the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous variables models and significantly outperformed the multiple linear regression models in most of 60 basins studied. The three GRACE mascon data sets performed better than the SH data sets at the basin scale. The models with SH solutions showed similar performance, but the models with the mascon solutions varied markedly in some basins. Results of this study are expected to provide a reference for bridging the data gaps between the GRACE and GRACE-FO satellites and for selecting suitable GRACE solutions for regional hydrologic studies.Key PointsGaps between the GRACE and GRACE-FO data sets are filled across global land areas Performance of reconstructing total water storage anomalies using three learning-based models and six GRACE solutions is evaluated Findings of this study improve understanding of global and regional hydrologic cycles, various GRACE products, and learning models

TI  - Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis Using the Platelet-to-lymphocyte Ratio in T1 Breast Cancer
T2  - ANTICANCER RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background/Aim: The host's systemic inflammatory response is thought to affect the progression of cancer and the antitumor effects of chemotherapy. Meta-analyses have reported that the peripheral blood platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) is a prognostic indicator of this effect. Therefore, we hypothesized that PLR may differ, depending on sentinel lymph node metastasis (SLNM) in patients diagnosed with cT1N0M0 breast cancer by preoperative imaging. This study investigated the ability of preoperative PLR to predict SLNM in patients diagnosed with cT1N0M0 breast cancer. Patients and Methods: This study included 475 patients with cT1N0M0 breast cancer diagnosed by preoperative imaging. Peripheral blood was obtained at diagnosis, i.e., before surgery. PLR was calculated from preoperative blood tests, by dividing the absolute platelet count by the absolute lymphocyte count. Results: The probability of SLNM was significantly higher (p=0.002) in cases where the tumor diameter was larger than 10 mm. The incidence of SLNM was significantly high in the high (preoperative) PLR group (p=0.031). Multivariate analysis revealed that high PLR [compared to low PLR, p=0.021, odds ratio (OR)=1.815, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.093-3.090] and large tumor size (compared to small tumor size, p=0.001, OR=2.688, 95%CI=1.524-4.997) were independent factors influencing SLNM. Conclusion: PLR may act as a predictor of SLNM in cT1N0M0 breast cancer.

TI  - Mapping rice crop using sentinels (1 SAR and 2 MSI) images in tropical area: A case study in Fogera wereda, Ethiopia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Though optical remote sensing has various importance for land-cover mapping and monitoring, it is very difficult to assess and monitor rice agriculture over large areas due to its cloud cover and the nature of rice agriculture. Therefore, we integrate Sentinel-1A Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with Sentinel-2 multispectral sensor (MSI) images to map rice field extent in a tropical area between 1774 and 2494 m above sea level (Fogera wereda, Ethiopia). First, we extract the temporal backscatter (TB) value of rice fields and background land-cover types at the Vertical transmitted and Vertically received (VV) and Vertically transmitted and Horizontal received (VH) polarizations. Second, Classification And Regression Trees (CART) model was applied to identify the optimal node and map the rice field and other Land Use Land Covers. Third, the map from Sentinel-1A image was integrated with Sentinel-2A image products (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI)) to improve the classification accuracy. The result shows that the TB value of rice increased sharply at the early planting stage and decreased during the high flooding stages. The increase in rice backscatter is more sustained at the Sentinel-1A VH polarization, and two-class separability measure further shows that VH is better than VV in discriminating rice fields. The CART model result shows August 01, 2017 is the best imaging date to map rice fields that account 19,892.5 ha of the study area with F1-macro accuracy 0.71. The integration of NDVI and MNDWI from Sentinel-2A image with TB increased the accuracy by 0.08. The refined land use land-cover map shows 19,157.8 ha of rice field.

TI  - Spatio-temporal Index Based on Time Series of Leaf Area Index for Identifying Heavy Metal Stress in Rice under Complex Stressors
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Crops under various types of stresses, such as stress caused by heavy metals, drought and pest/disease exhibit similar changes in physiological-biochemical parameters (e.g., leaf area index [LAI] and chlorophyll). Thus, differentiating between heavy metal stress and nonheavy metal stress presents a great challenge. However, different stressors in crops do cause variations in spatiotemporal characteristics. This study aims to develop a spatiotemporal index based on LAI time series to identify heavy metal stress under complex stressors on a regional scale. The experimental area is located in Zhuzhou City, Hunan Province. The situ measured data and Sentinel-2A images from 2017 and 2018 were collected. First, a series of LAI in rice growth stages was simulated based on the WOrld FOod STudies (WOFOST) model incorporated with Sentinel 2 images. Second, the local Moran's I and dynamic time warping (DTW) of LAI were calculated. Third, a stress index based on spatial and temporal features (SIST) was established to assess heavy metal stress levels according to the spatial autocorrelation and temporal dissimilarity of LAI. Results revealed the following: (1) The DTW of LAI is a good indicator for distinguishing stress levels. Specifically, rice subjected to high stress levels exhibits high DTW values. (2) Rice under heavy metal stress is well correlated with high-high SIST clusters. (3) Rice plants subjected to high pollution are observed in the northwest of the study regions and rice under low heavy metal stress is found in the south. The results suggest that SIST based on a sensitive indicator of rice biochemical impairment can be used to accurately detect regional heavy metal stress in rice. Combining spatial-temporal features and spectral information appears to be a highly promising method for discriminating heavy metal stress from complex stressors.

TI  - An Interaction Methodology to Collect and Assess User-Driven Requirements to Define Potential Opportunities of Future Hyperspectral Imaging Sentinel Mission
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Evolution in the Copernicus Space Component is foreseen in the mid-2020s to meet priority user needs not addressed by the existing infrastructure, and/or to reinforce existing services. In this context, the European Commission is intending to evaluate the overall potential utility of a complementary Copernicus hyperspectral mission to be added to the Copernicus Sentinels fleet. Hyperspectral imaging is a powerful remote sensing technology that, allowing the characterization and quantification of Earth surface materials, has the potential to deliver significant enhancements in quantitative value-added products. This study aims to illustrate the interaction methodology that was set up to collect and assess user-driven requirements in different thematic areas to demonstrate the potential benefit of a future Copernicus hyperspectral mission. Therefore, an ad hoc interaction matrix was circulated among several user communities to gather preferences about hyperspectral-based products and services. The results show how the involvement of several user communities strengthens the identification of these user requirements. Moreover, the requirement evaluation is used to identify potential opportunities of hyperspectral imaging in addressing operational needs associated with policy obligations at European, national, and local levels. The frequency distribution of spectral range classes and spatial and temporal resolutions are also derived from the preference expressed by the user communities in each thematic area investigated.

TI  - Complementary role of <SUP>18</SUP>F-FDG PET/CT for sentinel lymph node algorithm in endometrial cancer with high-risk factors for lymphatic metastasis
T2  - NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - ObjectiveNational Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) sentinel lymph node (SLN) algorithm includes 'mandatory steps' for evaluating pelvic lymph nodes, but assessment of paraaortic area is left to surgeon's discretion. In this study, we aimed to investigate the complementary role of preoperative F-18-FDG PET/computed tomography (CT) scan in detecting pelvic and especially paraaortic lymphatic metastasis in endometrial cancer patients with high-risk factor(s) according to Mayo Clinic Criteria and underwent SLN algorithm.MethodsPatients who underwent preoperative F-18-FDG PET/CT scan, intraoperative SLN algorithm followed by systematic lymphadenectomy (LND) and had at least one high-risk criterion for lymphatic metastasis were included in this study. F-18-FDG PET/CT and SLN algorithm were compared with final histopathological results of systematic LND.ResultsThirty-eight patients were eligible for the study. Lymphatic metastasis was seen in 10 patients (26.3%). Four cases had paraaortic lymphatic metastases which were together with pelvic (n:2) or isolated (n:2) metastases. SLN algorithm was able to detect all pelvic lymph node metastases. However, isolated paraaortic metastases were diagnosed only by F-18-FDG PET/CT. In 76 hemipelvises, sensitivity and negative predictive value of SLN algorithm for diagnosis of pelvic nodal metastasis were 100%, while sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of F-18-FDG PET/CT were 45.4, 95.3, 62.5 and 91.1%, respectively.ConclusionsAlthough SLN algorithm has an excellent diagnostic value for pelvic nodal metastasis, paraaortic metastasis might be underdiagnosed. F-18-FDG PET/CT may be a feasible tool to exclude paraaortic lymphatic metastasis in high-risk patients for lymphatic metastasis who will undergo SLN algorithm.

TI  - Acellular dermal matrices as an adjunct to implant breast reconstruction: Analysis of outcomes and complications
T2  - EJSO
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose: Acellular dermal matrices (ADM) are increasingly used in implant-based breast reconstruction (IBR). Uncertainty remains with regard to their efficacy and complications. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes and complication rates associated with the use of ADMs in IBR.Methods: Retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing ADM-assisted IBR between 2008 and 2013. Cases were identified from a prospectively collected database. Simple descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were performed.Results: A total of 110 patients (175 mastectomies) were included in the analysis. The median age was 46 (19-75) years and the median BMI was 22.2 (16.2-41.5). Seventy nine mastectomies were performed for therapeutic purposes. The median mastectomy weight was 244 (185-335) gr. The majority of re-constructions were performed with fixed volume (n = 115, 66%) or permanent expandable implants (n = 53, 30%) as one-stage procedures. Forty mastectomies were associated with at least one complication. The infection rate was 2.3% (n = 4). Post-operative haematoma developed in 5 cases (2.9%), but only 2 required surgical interventions. Three mastectomies were complicated by nipple necrosis (3.6%), 3 with skin necrosis (1.7%) and 9 with wound dehiscence (5.1%). The capsule formation rate was 2.3% (n = 4). Reconstruction failure with implant loss occurred in 3 cases (1.7%).Conclusions: The complication rates following ADM-assisted IBR can be very low with appropriate patient selection and meticulous surgical technique. This supports the safety of using ADM in carefully selected patients. Further research is warranted to assess the health economics of ADM use in IBR.

TI  - Exposure of real estate properties to the 2018 Hurricane Florence flooding
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Quantifying the potential exposure of property to damages associated with storm surges, extreme weather and hurricanes is fundamental to developing frameworks that can be used to conceive and implement mitigation plans as well as support urban development that accounts for such events. In this study, we aim at quantifying the total value and area of properties exposed to the flooding associated with Hurricane Florence that occurred in September 2018. To this aim, we implement an approach for the identification of affected areas by generating a map of the maximum flood extent obtained from a combination of the flood extent produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's) water marks with those obtained from spaceborne radar remote-sensing data. The use of radar in the creation of the flood extent allows for those properties commonly missed by FEMA's interpolation methods, especially from pluvial or non-fluvial sources, and can be used in more accurately estimating the exposure and market value of properties to event-specific flooding. Lastly, we study and quantify how the urban development over the past decades in the regions flooded by Hurricane Florence might have impacted the exposure of properties to present-day storms and floods. This approach is conceptually similar to what experts are addressing as the "expanding bull's eye effect", in which "targets" of geophysical hazards, such as people and their built environments, enlarge as populations grow and spread. Our results indicate that the total value of property exposed to flooding during Hurricane Florence was USD 52 billion (in 2018 USD), with this value increasing from USD similar to 10 billion at the beginning of the past century to the final amount based on the expansion of the number of properties exposed. We also found that, despite the decrease in the number of properties built during the decade before Florence, much of the new construction was in proximity to permanent water bodies, hence increasing exposure to flooding. Ultimately, the results of this paper provide a new tool for shedding light on the relationships between urban development in coastal areas and the flooding of those areas, which is estimated to increase in view of projected increasing sea level rise, storm surges and the strength of storms.

TI  - Water productivity monitoring by using geotechnological tools in contrasting social and environmental conditions: Applications in the Sao Francisco River basin, Brazil
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - We used the SAFER (Simple Algorithm for Evapotranspiration Retrieving) algorithm together with the Monteith's RUE (Radiation Use Efficiency) model, for large-scale water productivity assessments in different social and environmental conditions of the Sao Francisco River sub basins, Brazil, by coupling remote sensing parameters from MODIS images and a net of agrometeorological stations, during the year 2016. Variations on actual evapotranspiration (ET) and biomass production (BIO) among ecosystems and sub basins were strongly detected, affecting the water productivity based on ET (WP = BIO/ET). The mean ET daily rates were 2.1 mm d(-1) for both, Forest Zone (FZ) and Savanna (SV), and 1.3 mm d(-1) for Caatinga (CA), while regarding BIO they were 67, 68 e 33 kg ha(-1) d(-1), for FZ, SV, and CA, respectively resulting in corresponding average WP values of 2.6; 2.5, and 1.7 kg m(-3). The modelling by using the MODIS reflectance product together with gridded weather data presented operational applicability for monitoring water and vegetation dynamics at a 16-day period and at a 250 m spatial resolution along the year, under conditions of distinct water availability. The satisfactory results highlighted the suitability of geotechnological tools to subsidize the rational natural resources management on large scales in societies with different environmental vulnerabilities.

TI  - Differences of Regulative Flexibility between Hydrological Isolated and Connected Lakes in a Large Floodplain: Insight from Inundation Dynamics and Landscape Heterogeneity
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The inundation areas of floodplains are crucial to wetland ecosystems, especially in supporting biodiversity. Accurately identifying the spatial and temporal patterns of inundation areas is important for understanding floodplain ecosystem processes. Here, lakes in the Yangtze River Floodplain were divided into two types according to hydrological conditions: the natural connected lakes (Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake) with natural water level fluctuations and the isolated lakes (lakes in Jianghan Plain) with stable water levels. We established a method to identify inundation areas using multi-sources remote sensing data based on the Google Earth Engine. The dynamics of inundation areas were determined, and the relative indices were calculated in common year (2017) and a drought year (2018). The differences between the connected lakes and the isolated lakes were analyzed, and impacts of hydrological fluctuations on inundation area and habitat quality were evaluated. The results show that lakes with natural hydrological fluctuations have a greater regulative flexibility, with both patch density (PD) and submerged elasticity index (SEI) values higher than that of isolated lakes. The trend of the vegetation index in the connected lakes and in the isolated lakes is also different. The mean EVI in Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake showed a U-shaped trend which is similar to the shape of the trend of PD. The trend of mean enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the isolated lakes is the opposite and has a lower range of variation over a year. This study provides new indicators and rapid methods for habitat quality assessment in floodplains, as well as presenting scientific information useful for improving wetland management in the middle and lower Yangtze River.

TI  - Country Is Yarning to Me: Worldview, Health and Well-Being Amongst Australian First Nations People
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF SOCIAL WORK
M3  - Article
AB  - Health inequalities experienced by Australian First Nations People are amongst the most marked in the world, with First Nations People dying some ten years earlier than non-Indigenous Australians. The failure of existing responses to health inequalities suggests new knowledges and questions that need to be explored. It is likely that these new knowledges sit outside of western research or practice paradigms. Through the Indigenous practice of yarning, the importance of worldview and Country emerged as an under-acknowledged social determinant of Australian First Nations People well-being. Yarning is a process of storytelling that involves both sound and silence. It requires embodied deep listening through which stories emerge that create new knowledge and understanding. We anchor our learning by re-telling John's creation story, a story of healing through discovering his Aboriginal Worldview through reconnecting to Country. Country for First Nations People is more than a physical place; it is a place of belonging and a way of believing. We argue for the recognition of trauma, recognition of diversity and the use of yarning in social work practice. We conclude that reconnecting to Aboriginal Worldview provides hopeful insights into the well-being of Australia's First Nations People and the social determinants of health.

TI  - Landsat Time-series Images-based Urban Heat Island Analysis: The Effects of Changes in Vegetation and Built-up Land on Land Surface Temperature in Summer in the Hanoi Metropolitan Area, Vietnam
T2  - Environment and Natural Resources Journal
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid and unplanned urbanization leads to temperature rise, urban vegetation decrease and built-up land increase, forming an urban heat island (UHI). This study investigated the effects of changes in vegetation and built-up land on land surface temperature (LST) in summer, based on remotely sensed images. LST was first retrieved by means of the Radiative Transfer Model (RTM). Scatter-plots and an univariate linear regression model (ULRM) were first employed to independently measure the influence of NDVI on LST, and of NDBI on LST, respectively. In order to assess the effects of changes in vegetation and built-up land on LST, a multivariate linear regression model (MLRM) was finally employed to improve the accuracy of the predicted model in the identification of the joint effect of both the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the normalized difference built-up index (NDBI) on LST. The result from the case from the Hanoi Metropolitan Area (HMA), Vietnam using Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-8 OLI/TIRS time-series images during the 1996-2016 period shows that there exists a negative effect of built-up land and a positive effect of vegetation on LST. In addition, indications of intensifying UHI effects were detected in the HMA, especially tending to expand faster and wider to the parts of western, north-western and south-western HMA during the 1996-2007 period. These findings suggest that vegetation weakens the effect of UHIs, whereas, built-up land greatly strengthens the effect of UHIs in the HMA.

T2  - ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background Optimal management of regional lymph nodes for thin cutaneous melanoma is uncertain. We evaluated regional lymph node involvement and 5-year melanoma-specific survival (MSS) in patients with thin (<= 1 mm) primary melanoma.Methods Patients with a melanoma, American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging 8th Edition pT1a (<0.8 mm) or pT1b (ulceration; and/or 0.8-1.0 mm), diagnosed during 2001-2015 were identified from the Queensland Oncology Repository. We extracted demographic, pathology and clinical details, including sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), regional nodal dissection and nodal recurrence. Poisson regression was used to assess recurrence risk in patients who did not undergo SLNB. The 5-year MSS was calculated using the Kaplan-Maier method with Cox regression to compare survival outcomes according to SLNB performance.Results Of the 27 824 eligible patients, 240 (0.9%) underwent SLNB. One hundred and seventy-eight patients (0.6%) without SLNB had nodal recurrence. Of the 4848 patients with a pT1b lesion, 166 (3.4%) had SLNB with 12 (7.2%) positive; of the remainder, 99 (2.1%) had clinical recurrence. Risk of recurrence was higher in males, nodular subtype and T1b lesions and lower if patients were aged >60 years. The 5-year MSS was similar for observed and SLNB cohorts (99.66% versus 98.92%) but worse for T1b lesions (98.90%) and clinical nodal recurrence (66.89%).Conclusion Overall prognosis for T1 melanoma is excellent with nodal involvement being rare. However, the American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th Edition T1b melanoma correlates with significantly worse 5-year MSS and increased regional nodal recurrence (notably for 0.8-1.0 mm lesions with ulceration). Further characterization of high-risk groups for nodal positivity that impacts patient outcome is needed for the pT1 melanoma cohort.

TI  - Magnitude, short-term outcomes and risk factors for hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy at abha maternity and children hospital, Abha City, Saudi Arabia and literature review
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NEONATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: When hypoxia is the cause for neonatal encephalopathy, a clinical syndrome has been described known as hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Aim of the Study: This study aimed to determine the magnitude of HIE occurrence, its short-term outcomes, and associated risk factors. Literature review was included for comparing our reported findings with other published ones. Methods: A retrospective, case-control study was conducted at "Abha Maternity and Children Hospital" (AMCH) that included all inborn term and late-preterm newborns with the "admission diagnosis" of HIE during 2016-2017. Healthy newborn babies were taken as controls. Data were extracted from neonatal medical files for HIE cases and maternal medical files for the controls. Results: Of 15,790 livebirths, 124 cases had HIE (7.85/1000 livebirths), of whom 3.98/1000 and 3.86/1000 livebirths were staged as mild and moderate-to-severe HIE, respectively. Short-term outcomes for HIE were 14 deaths (11.3%) and 33 cases with seizures (26.6%), which occurred exclusively among moderate-severe HIE cases; 87 cases (70.2%) required positive pressure ventilation, and 45 cases (36.3%) required mechanical ventilation, with significantly higher rate among moderate-severe HIE than mild cases (P < 0.001). By the 7th day of admission, moderate-to-severe HIE cases showed significantly higher rates for both lack of nutritive sucking reflex and respiratory support than mild HIE ones (P = 0.016 and P < 0.001, respectively). Among HIE cases who required cooling, 96.2% were subjected to it within the "therapeutic window" of <= 6 h. Risk factors associated with HIE were urinary tract infection/vaginitis (P = 0.001), late preterm (P = 0.002), meconium stain (P = 0.003), abnormal cardiotocographic tracing (P < 0.001), prolonged second stage of labor (P = 0.001), assisted delivery (P = 0.011), sentinel events (P = 0.027), and low 1-min APGAR scores (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The burden of moderate-to-severe HIE at AMCH is high with an associated high mortality rate. Early identification of high-risk pregnancy with improved antepartum, intrapartum, and neonatal care can reduce occurrence of HIE.

TI  - Long-Term Land Use/Land Cover Change Assessment of the Kilombero Catchment in Tanzania Using Random Forest Classification and Robust Change Vector Analysis
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Information about land use/land cover (LULC) and their changes is useful for different stakeholders to assess future pathways of sustainable land use for food production as well as for nature conservation. In this study, we assess LULC changes in the Kilombero catchment in Tanzania, an important area of recent development in East Africa. LULC change is assessed in two ways: first, post-classification comparison (PCC) which allows us to directly assess changes from one LULC class to another, and second, spectral change detection. We perform LULC classification by applying random forests (RF) on sets of multitemporal metrics that account for seasonal within-class dynamics. For the spectral change detection, we make use of the robust change vector analysis (RCVA) and determine those changes that do not necessarily lead to another class. The combination of the two approaches enables us to distinguish areas that show (a) only PCC changes, (b) only spectral changes that do not affect the classification of a pixel, (c) both types of change, or (d) no changes at all. Our results reveal that only one-quarter of the catchment has not experienced any change. One-third shows both, spectral changes and LULC conversion. Changes detected with both methods predominantly occur in two major regions, one in the West of the catchment, one in the Kilombero floodplain. Both regions are important areas of food production and economic development in Tanzania. The Kilombero floodplain is a Ramsar protected area, half of which was converted to agricultural land in the past decades. Therefore, LULC monitoring is required to support sustainable land management. Relatively poor classification performances revealed several challenges during the classification process. The combined approach of PCC and RCVA allows us to detect spatial patterns of LULC change at distinct dimensions and intensities. With the assessment of additional classifier output, namely class-specific per-pixel classification probabilities and derived parameters, we account for classification uncertainty across space. We overlay the LULC change results and the spatial assessment of classification reliability to provide a thorough picture of the LULC changes taking place in the Kilombero catchment.

TI  - Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Mangrove Above-Ground Biomass Using Multiple Source Remote Sensing Data in the Red River Delta Biosphere Reserve, Vietnam
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - This study proposes a hybrid intelligence approach based on an extreme gradient boosting regression and genetic algorithm, namely, the XGBR-GA model, incorporating Sentinel-2, Sentinel-1, and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data to estimate the mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB), including small and shrub mangrove patches in the Red River Delta biosphere reserve across the northern coast of Vietnam. We used the novel extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGBR) technique together with genetic algorithm (GA) optimization for feature selection to construct and verify a mangrove AGB model using data from a field survey of 105 sampling plots conducted in November and December of 2018 and incorporated the dual polarimetric (HH and HV) data of the ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band and the Sentinel-2 multispectral data combined with Sentinel-1 (C-band VV and VH) data. We employed the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R-2) to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The capability of the XGBR-GA model was assessed via a comparison with other machine-learning (ML) techniques, i.e., the CatBoost regression (CBR), gradient boosted regression tree (GBRT), support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR) models. The XGBR-GA model yielded a promising result (R-2 = 0.683, RMSE = 25.08 Mgha(-1)) and outperformed the four other ML models. The XGBR-GA model retrieved a mangrove AGB ranging from 17 Mgha(-1) to 142 Mgha(-1) (with an average of 72.47 Mgha(-1)). Therefore, multisource optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) combined with the XGBR-GA model can be used to estimate the mangrove AGB in North Vietnam. The effectiveness of the proposed method needs to be further tested and compared to other mangrove ecosystems in the tropics.

TI  - Data Fusion Analysis of Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 Simulated Ozone Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC TECHNOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The complete data fusion method, generalized to the case of fusing profiles of atmospheric variables retrieved on different vertical grids and referred to different true values, is applied to ozone profiles retrieved from simulated measurements in the ultraviolet, visible, and thermal infrared spectral ranges for the Sentinel-4 and Sentinel-5 missions of the Copernicus program. In this study, the production and characterization of combined low Earth orbit (Sentinel-5) and geostationary Earth orbit (Sentinel-4) fused ozone data is performed. Fused and standard products have been compared and a performance assessment of the generalized complete data fusion is presented. The analysis of the output products of the complete data fusion algorithm and of the standard processing using quality quantifiers demonstrates that the generalized complete data fusion algorithm provides products of better quality when compared with standard products.

TI  - Land surface phenology in the highland pastures of montane Central Asia: Interactions with snow cover seasonality and terrain characteristics
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Many studies have shown that high elevation environments are among very sensitive to climatic changes and where impacts are exacerbated. Across Central Asia, which is especially vulnerable to climate change due to aridity, the ability of global climate projections to capture the complex dynamics of mountainous environments is particularly limited. Over montane Central Asia, agropastoralism constitutes a major portion of the rural economy. Extensive herbaceous vegetation forms the basis of rural economies in Kyrgyzstan. Here we focus on snow cover seasonality and the effects of terrain on phenology in highland pastures using remote sensing data for 2001-2017. First, we describe the thermal regime of growing season using MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) land surface temperature (LST) data, analyzing the modulation by elevation, slope, and aspect. We then characterized the phenology in highland pastures with metrics derived from modeling the land surface phenology using Landsat normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series together with MODIS LST data. Using rank correlations, we then analyzed the influence of four metrics of snow cover seasonality calculated from MODIS snow cover composites-first date of snow, late date of snow, duration of snow season, and the number of snow-covered dates (SCD)-on two key metrics of land surface phenology in the subsequent growing season, specifically, peak height (PH; the maximum modeled NDVI) and thermal time to peak (TTP; the amount of growing degree-days accumulated during modeled green-up phase). We evaluated the role of terrain features in shaping the relationships between snow cover metrics and land surface phenology metrics using exact multinomial tests of equivalence. Key findings include (1) a positive relationship between SCD and PH occurred in over 1664 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 5793 km(2) at p < 0.05, which account for > 8% of 68,881 km(2) of the pasturelands analyzed in Kyrgyzstan; (2) more negative than positive correlations were found between snow cover onset and PH, and more positive correlations were observed between snowmelt timing and PH, indicating that a longer snow season can positively influence PH; (3) significant negative correlations between TTP and SCD appeared in 1840 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 6208 km(2) at p < 0.05, and a comparable but smaller area showed negative correlations between TTP and last date of snow (1538 km(2) at p < 0.01 and 5188 km(2) at p < 0.05), indicating that under changing climatic conditions toward earlier spring warming, decreased duration of snow cover may lead to lower pasture productivity, thereby threatening the sustainability of montane agropastoralism; and (4) terrain had a stronger influence on the timing of last date of snow cover than on the number of snow-covered dates, with slope being more important than aspect, and the strongest effect appearing from the interaction of aspect and steeper slopes. In this study, we characterized the snow-phenology interactions in highland pastures and revealed strong dependencies of pasture phenology on timing of snowmelt and the number of snow-covered dates.

TI  - The influences of environmentalism and attitude towards physical activity on mode choice: The new evidences
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - The worldview on environmentalism has evolved significantly from traditional environmental concerns to the emergence of some new concepts, such as the limit to the human ability and the balance of nature. Transport policymakers may pose a question of whether this new way of thinking has an effect on mode choice. However, a clear answer to this question has not been found. Similarly, the intuitive expectation that physical activity can be a motivation for the selection of more physically active travel modes has not been well documented. This study attempts to investigate the potential influences of the ecological view on environmentalism and attitude towards physical activity on mode choice. The analytic data comes from a sample of 821 respondents with 1840 reported trips in an online survey conducted in Nagoya, Japan in 2018. The postulated effects were investigated in the framework of an integrated choice and latent variable model and a latent class choice model. The estimates from our models showed that environmentalism had a positive effect on the share of rail though its effect on class assignment, and attitude towards physical activity had a positive effect on both utilities and shares of bicycling and walking. In addition, findings from our study signified the importance of heterogeneity treatments in mode choice models with latent variables.

TI  - Recurrence risk of early-stage melanoma of the external ear: an investigation of surgical approach and sentinel lymph node status
T2  - MELANOMA RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Surgical management of external ear melanoma presents unique technical challenges based on the unique anatomy and reconstruction concerns. Surgical technique, including preservation of cartilage, is variable and impact on recurrence is unclear. Our goal was to investigate surgical approach, including extent of surgical resection and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), and the impact on recurrence. In this retrospective review of primary clinical stage 1/2 external ear melanoma, demographics, tumor characteristics, surgical resection technique (including cartilage-sparing vs. cartilage removal), and SLNB results were evaluated for recurrence risk. One hundred and fifty-six patients total had an average follow-up of 5.6 years. Twenty-nine (18.6%) patients underwent cartilage-sparing surgery and 99 (63.5%) patients underwent SLNB, 14.1% of whom had micrometastatic disease. Ten (6.4%) patients recurred loco-regionally. Recurrence was associated with Breslow depth, initial stage at diagnosis, and SLNB status. Cartilage-sparing surgery was not associated with increased recurrence. Sentinel lymph node identification rate was 100% based on clinical detection with use of lymphoscintigraphy. In addition to confirming established risk factors for melanoma recurrence, we confirm the feasibility of SLNB in stratifying recurrence risk. Although we did not see an increased recurrence risk with surgical technique and cartilage-sparing approaches, these findings are limited by small sample size.

TI  - Competing Vegetation Structure Indices for Estimating Spatial Constrains in Carabid Abundance Patterns in Chinese Grasslands Reveal Complex Scale and Habitat Patterns
T2  - INSECTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Carabid communities are influenced by landscape features. Chinese steppes are subject to increasing desertification processes that are changing land-cover characteristics with negative impacts on insect communities. Despite those warnings, how land-cover characteristics influence carabid communities in steppe ecosystems remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate how landscape characteristics drive carabid abundance in different steppes (desert, typical, and meadow steppes) at different spatial scales. Carabid abundances were estimated using pitfall traps. Various landscape indices were derived from Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. Indices expressing moisture and productivity were, in general, those with the highest correlations. Different indices capture landscape aspects that influence carabid abundance at different scales, in which the patchiness of desert vegetation plays a major role. Carabid abundance correlations with landscape characteristics rely on the type of grassland, on the vegetation index, and on the scale considered. Proper scales and indices are steppe type-specific, highlighting the need of considering various scales and indices to explain species abundances from remotely sensed data.

TI  - Synergy between Ocean Variables: Remotely Sensed Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll Concentration Coherence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The similarity of mesoscale and submesoscale features observed in different ocean scalars indicates that they undergo some common non-linear processes. As a result of quasi-2D turbulence, complicated patterns of filaments, meanders, and eddies are recognized in remote sensing images. A data fusion method used to improve the quality of one ocean variable using another variable as a template is used here as an extrapolation technique to improve the coverage of daily Aqua MODIS Level-3 chlorophyll maps by using MODIS SST maps as a template. The local correspondence of SST and Chl-a multifractal singularities is granted due to the existence of a common cascade process which makes it possible to use SST data to infer Chl-a concentration where data are lacking. The quality of the inference of Level-4 Chl-a maps is assessed by simulating artificial clouds and comparing reconstructed and original data.

TI  - Seismogenic Source Model of the 2019, M<sub>w</sub> 5.9, East-Azerbaijan Earthquake (NW Iran) through the Inversion of Sentinel-1 DInSAR Measurements
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this work, we investigate the M-w 5.9 earthquake occurred on 7 November 2019 in the East-Azerbaijan region, in northwestern Iran, which is inserted in the tectonic framework of the East-Azerbaijan Plateau, a complex mountain belt that contains internal major fold-and-thrust belts. We first analyze the Differential Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (DInSAR) measurements obtained by processing the data collected by the Sentinel-1 constellation along ascending and descending orbits; then, we invert the achieved results through analytical modelling, in order to better constrain the geometry and characteristics of the seismogenic source. The retrieved fault model shows a rather shallow seismic structure, with a center depth at about 3 km, approximately NE-SW-striking and southeast-dipping, characterized by a left-lateral strike-slip fault mechanism (strike = 29.17 degrees, dip = 79.29 degrees, rake = -4.94 degrees) and by a maximum slip of 0.80 m. By comparing the inferred fault with the already published geological structures, the retrieved solution reveals a minor fault not reported in the geological maps available in the open literature, whose kinematics is compatible with that of the surrounding structures, with the local and regional stress states and with the performed field observations. Moreover, by taking into account the surrounding geological structures reported in literature, we also use the retrieved fault model to calculate the Coulomb Failure Function at the nearby receiver faults. We show that this event may have encouraged, with a positive loading, the activation of the considered receiver faults. This is also confirmed by the distribution of the aftershocks that occurred near the considered surrounding structures. The analysis of the seismic events nucleated along the left-lateral strike-slip minor faults of the East-Azerbaijan Plateau, such as the one analyzed in this work, is essential to improve our knowledge on the seismic hazard estimation in northwestern Iran.

TI  - Investigating the topographic and climatic effects on vegetation using remote sensing and GIS: a case study of Kharestan region, Fars Province, Iran
T2  - THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - This study seeks to investigate the effect of topographic (slope, elevation, and aspect) and climatic (precipitation and temperature) factors on vegetation in Kharestan region using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques. To this aim, therefore, the changes occurred in such vegetation indices as normalized difference index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and difference vegetation index (DVI) between 2008 and 2015 were evaluated, using Landsat ETM7. The findings of the study showed that the highest density for the NDVI, EVI, SAVI, and DVI could be found at an elevation range of 2000 to 2800 and the lowest density could be found at elevations lower than 2000 and higher than 2800 m. In addition, the maximum values for the indices at elevation range of 2050 to 2250 were 0.56, 0.54, 0.4, and 0.25 respectively. Moreover, the highest values for the indices were found at such aspects as the northeast (64 degrees and 42 degrees) and the north (348 degrees), while the lowest ones were observed at the eastern (74 degrees) and southwestern (243 degrees and 206 degrees) aspects. As for the density of the vegetation, the maximum mean values for the indices were found to be located at slope range of 4 and 12 degrees. These findings indicate that lower elevations, shaded sides of the domains, and gentle slope enjoy appropriate conditions for the growth of vegetation. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the indices, the temperature, and the precipitation (P < 0.01). Considering the aforementioned results, it could be argued that environmental factors such as elevation, aspect, slope, precipitation, and temperature are among the main factors, which control the vegetation in the region studied in this research.

AB  - Changing climate is expected to cause more extreme weather patterns in many parts of the world. In the Carpathian Basin, it is expected that the frequency of intensive precipitation will increase causing inland excess water (IEW) in parts of the plains more frequently, while currently the phenomenon already causes great damage. This research presents and validates a new methodology to determine the extent of these floods using a combination of passive and active remote sensing data. The method can be used to monitor IEW over large areas in a fully automated way based on freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 remote sensing imagery. The method is validated for two IEW periods in 2016 and 2018 using high-resolution optical satellite data and aerial photographs. Compared to earlier remote sensing data-based methods, our method can be applied under unfavorite weather conditions, does not need human interaction and gives accurate results for inundations larger than 1000 m(2). The overall accuracy of the classification exceeds 99%; however, smaller IEW patches are underestimated due to the spatial resolution of the input data. Knowledge on the location and duration of the inundations helps to take operational measures against the water but is also required to determine the possibilities for storage of water for dry periods. The frequent monitoring of the floods supports sustainable water management in the area better than the methods currently employed.

TI  - Monitoring Woody Cover Dynamics in Tropical Dry Forest Ecosystems Using Sentinel-2 Satellite Imagery
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Dry forests in Sub-Saharan Africa are of critical importance for the livelihood of the local population given their strong dependence on forest products. Yet these forests are threatened due to rapid population growth and predicted changes in rainfall patterns. As such, large-scale woody cover monitoring of tropical dry forests is urgently required. Although promising, remote sensing-based estimation of woody cover in tropical dry forest ecosystems is challenging due to the heterogeneous woody and herbaceous vegetation structure and the large intra-annual variability in the vegetation due to the seasonal rainfall. To test the capability of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery for producing accurate woody cover estimations, two contrasting study sites in Ethiopia and Tanzania were used. The estimation accuracy of a linear regression model using the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR), and a Random Forest regression model using both single-date and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images were compared. Additionally, the robustness and site transferability of these methods were tested. Overall, the multi-temporal PLSR model achieved the most accurate and transferable estimations (R-2 = 0.70, RMSE = 4.12%). This model was then used to monitor the potential increase in woody coverage within several reforestation projects in the Degua Tembien district. In six of these projects, a significant increase in woody cover could be measured since the start of the project, which could be linked to their initial vegetation, location and shape. It can be concluded that a PLSR model combined with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery is capable of monitoring woody cover in these tropical dry forest regions, which can be used in support of reforestation efforts.

TI  - Assessment of spatio-temporal changes in land use and land cover, urban sprawl, and land surface temperature in and around Vijayawada city, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - The urban agglomeration is the unplanned growth of a city into its surrounding peri/rural areas causing unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. This leads to an increase in the land surface temperature that in turn results in climatic issues ranging from local to global scales. In the current study, an attempt has been made to map the urban growth and its associated land surface temperature variations in and around Vijayawada city of Andhra Pradesh state, India. Temporal Landsat satellite images from 4 years, viz. 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2018, were used to generate land use/land cover maps with four major classes such as built-up, vegetation, water body, and others. Change detection and transition of the natural land cover to man-made land use were statistically computed for the study area. Sprawl analysis of the city was carried out by generating multiple buffer rings over the study region to evaluate the urban density and annual urban growth rate. Shannon's entropy was employed to identify the nature of city expansion. The seasonal variation of the land surface temperature was studied using Mono-window algorithm. The temperature variation over individual classes was computed with the aid of a self-designed random point method. Results showed a steady increasing trend in the urban density and land surface temperature with the distinct formation of a heat island over the city, especially during winters throughout the study period. The settlement area has increased from 28.20 km(2) in 1990 to 138.01 km(2) in 2018. The directional growth analysis captured the pattern of city growth as tentacle-type development in conjunction with infill development. The sprawl happening around Vijayawada ignores the depletion of natural resources, leading to anomalies in the land surface temperature.

TI  - Modelling of early winter snow density using fully polarimetric C-band SAR data in the Indian Himalayas
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The seasonal snow cover contributes significantly to the water resource in the Indian Himalayas, and snow density is one of the vital parameters in the determination of the hydrological potential of snow. The application of conventional methods for snow density retrieval using fully polarimetric SAR data is constrained by the properties of snow primarily due to the melt and frost cycles, as compared to fresh dry snow. The surface component of backscatter is significant in case of melt and frost. In the conventional decomposition based methods, the surface component is not considered for the inversion of permittivity, as proposed in this study. In this paper, we also propose a methodology for the estimation of snow density using bi-temporal fully polarimetric C-band RADARSAT-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. We utilize the relation between the differential modified Mueller matrix components, the attenuation constants, and the Fresnel transmission coefficients. The permittivity of snow is derived using the inversion of the Fresnel transmission coefficients which is used to determine the snow density using a state of the art empirical relation. The snow density estimates from the proposed method are compared with other methods based on coherency matrix decomposition and evaluated against in-situ measurements collected during a field campaign carried out in Dhundi in the state of Himachal Pradesh in India. The snow density estimates using the proposed method are observed to correlate with the in-situ measurements and were also found to be better than the decomposition based methods.

TI  - A 20-Year MODIS-Based Snow Cover Dataset for Svalbard and Its Link to Phenological Timing and Sea Ice Variability
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate in Svalbard has been warming dramatically compared with the global average for the last few decades. Seasonal snow cover, which is sensitive to temperature and precipitation changes, is therefore expected to undergo both spatial and temporal changes in response to the changing climate in Svalbard. This will in turn have implications for timing of terrestrial productivity, which is closely linked to the disappearance of seasonal snow. We have produced a 20-year snow cover fraction time series for the Svalbard archipelago, derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) Terra data to map and identify changes in the timing of the first snow-free day (FSFD) for the period 2000-2019. Moreover, we investigate the influence of sea ice concentration (SIC) variations on FSFD and how FSFD is related to the start of the phenological growing season in Svalbard. Our results revealed clear patterns of earlier FSFD in the southern and central parts of the archipelago, while the northernmost parts exhibit little change or trend toward later FSFD, resulting in weaker trends in summer and winter duration. We found that FSFD preceded the onset of the phenological growing season with an average difference of 12.4 days for the entire archipelago, but with large regional variations that are indicative of temperature dependence. Lastly, we found a significant correlation between variations of time-integrated SIC and variations in FSFD, which maximizes when correlating SIC northeast of Svalbard with FSFD averaged over Nordaustlandet. Prolonged sea ice cover in the spring was correlated with late snow disappearance, while lower-than-average sea ice cover correlated with early snow disappearance, indicating that proximity to sea ice plays an important role in regulating the timing of snow disappearance on land through influencing the regional air temperature and therefore rate of spring snowmelt.

TI  - Mapping of Groundwater Spring Potential in Karst Aquifer System Using Novel Ensemble Bivariate and Multivariate Models
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Groundwater is an important natural resource in arid and semi-arid environments, where discharge from karst springs is utilized as the principal water supply for human use. The occurrence of karst springs over large areas is often poorly documented, and interpolation strategies are often utilized to map the distribution and discharge potential of springs. This study develops a novel method to delineate karst spring zones on the basis of various hydrogeological factors. A case study of the Bojnourd Region, Iran, where spring discharge measurements are available for 359 sites, is used to demonstrate application of the new approach. Spatial mapping is achieved using ensemble modelling, which is based on certainty factors (CF) and logistic regression (LR). Maps of the CF and LR components of groundwater potential were generated individually, and then, combined to prepare an ensemble map of the study area. The accuracy (A) of the ensemble map was then assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Results of this analysis show that LR (A = 78%) outperformed CF (A = 67%) in terms of the comparison between model predictions and known occurrences of karst springs (i.e., calibration data). However, combining the CF and LR results through ensemble modelling produced superior accuracy (A = 85%) in terms of spring potential mapping. By combining CF and LR statistical models through ensemble modelling, weaknesses in CF and LR methods are offset, and therefore, we recommend this ensemble approach for similar karst mapping projects. The methodology developed here offers an efficient method for assessing spring discharge and karst spring potentials over regional scales.

TI  - Applicability of MODIS land cover and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) for the assessment of spatial and temporal changes in strength of vegetation in tropical rainforest region of Borneo
T2  - REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Rainforests in the equatorial tropical regions are facing severe changes in strength and distribution due to natural and anthropogenic activities. Climate change causes major issues in vegetation characteristics whereas logging and developmental activities destruct the natural characteristics of terrain and vegetation. In the present research, MODIS vegetation cover type and vegetation indices (Enhanced Vegetation Index -EVI) data were interpreted to assess the decade (2008-2017) variation in vegetation types and strength characteristics in the Baram River Basin (BRB) in Borneo. International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme (IGBP) based classification identified ten land cover types in the BRB and the mean EVI in most periods varies between -0.30 and greater than 0.80. Results showed spatial and temporal variation in the area covered by individual land cover during the period of analysis and the fluctuation in mean EVI values indicates variation in strength characteristics of land cover types in the region. Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation (r > 0.50) of mean EVI values between consecutive years of analysis. Though the IGBP classification scheme could not categorise the most dominant land use activities in the BRB i.e. logging and oil palm plantations, the findings of the present research validate the use of MODIS data in equatorial tropical rainforest regions for characterising the regional scale vegetation dynamics.

TI  - Mangrove Forests Evolution and Threats in the Caribbean Sea of Colombia
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Colombia has approximately 379,954 hectares of mangrove forests distributed along the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea coasts. Such forests are experiencing the highest annual rate of loss recorded in South America and, in the last three decades, approximately 40,000 hectares have been greatly affected by natural and, especially, human impacts. This study determined, by the use of Landsat multispectral satellite images, the evolution of three mangrove forests located in the Colombian Caribbean Sea: Malloquin, Totumo, and La Virgen swamps. Mangrove forest at Mallorquin Swamp recorded a loss of 15 ha in the period of 1985-2018, associated with alterations in forest hydrology, illegal logging, urban growth, and coastal erosion. Totumo Swamp lost 301 ha in the period 1985-2018 associated with changes in hydrological conditions, illegal logging, and increased agricultural and livestock uses. La Virgen Swamp presented a loss of 31 ha in the period of 2013-2018 that was linked to the construction of a roadway, alterations of hydrological conditions, illegal logging, and soil urbanization, mainly for tourist purposes. Although Colombian legislation has made efforts to protect mangrove ecosystems, human activities are the main cause of mangrove degradation, and thus it is mandatory for the local population to understand the value of the ecosystem services provided by mangroves.

TI  - Identity, Kinship, and the Evolution of Cooperation
T2  - CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Extensive cooperation among biologically unrelated individuals is uniquely human. It would be surprising if this uniqueness were not related to other uniquely human characteristics, yet current theories of human cooperation tend to ignore the human aspects of human behavior. This paper presents a theory of cooperation that draws on social, cultural, and psychological aspects of human uniqueness for which current theories have little or no explanation. We propose that the evolution of human cooperative behavior required (1) a capacity for self-sustained, self-referential thought manifested as an integrated worldview, including a sense of identity and point of view, and (2) the cultural formation of kinship-based social organizational systems within which social identities can be established and transmitted through enculturation. Human cooperative behavior arose, we argue, through the acquisition of a culturally grounded social identity that included the expectation of cooperation among kin. This identity is linked to basic survival instincts by emotions that are mentally experienced as culture-laden feelings. As a consequence, individuals are motivated to cooperate with those perceived culturally as kin, while deviations from expected social behavior are experienced as a threat to one's social identity, leading to punishment of those seen as violating cultural expectations regarding socially proper behavior.

CL  - Wiesbaden, GERMANY
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the percentage of patients potentially eligible for implantation of the Sentinel (TM) Cerebral Protection System (Sentinel-CPS) during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and to identify the reasons for treatment exclusion.METHODS: We retrospectively performed an analysis of pre-TAVI multislice computed tomography (MSCT) aortograms and data review of all patients undergoing a TAVI procedure in 2017 (n = 317). MSCT evaluation included the assessment of aortic arch anatomy and the vascular dimensions of the brachiocephalic and left common carotid artery. Data analysis focused on comorbid conditions, precluding 6-Fr sheath radial access and filter deployment due to history of previous artery interventions.RESULTS: MSCT and data analysis showed Sentinel-CPS compatibility in 61.5% of patients (n = 195). Sentinel-CPS would have been contraindicated in 38.5% (n = 122) due to one or more of the following: (i) measured diameters of the filter-landing zones <9 or >15 mm in the brachiocephalic artery and <6.5 or >10 mm in the left common carotid artery (n = 116; 88 with carotid dimensions too small); (ii) significant subclavian artery stenosis (n = 4) or an aberrant subclavian artery (n = 3) precluding Sentinel-CPS implantation and (iii) clinical characteristics including hypersensitivity to nickel-titanium (n = 1), radial artery occlusion (n = 1) or previous left common carotid artery interventions (n = 5).CONCLUSIONS: MSCT and clinical data supported Sentinel-CPS compatibility in 61.5% of patients. The most common reason for treatment exclusion was inappropriate diameter within the target landing zone of the left carotid artery. Future device development should address this limitation.

TI  - Extracting Agricultural Fields from Remote Sensing Imagery Using Graph-Based Growing Contours
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Knowledge of the location and extent of agricultural fields is required for many applications, including agricultural statistics, environmental monitoring, and administrative policies. Furthermore, many mapping applications, such as object-based classification, crop type distinction, or large-scale yield prediction benefit significantly from the accurate delineation of fields. Still, most existing field maps and observation systems rely on historic administrative maps or labor-intensive field campaigns. These are often expensive to maintain and quickly become outdated, especially in regions of frequently changing agricultural patterns. However, exploiting openly available remote sensing imagery (e.g., from the European Union's Copernicus programme) may allow for frequent and efficient field mapping with minimal human interaction. We present a new approach to extracting agricultural fields at the sub-pixel level. It consists of boundary detection and a field polygon extraction step based on a newly developed, modified version of the growing snakes active contours model we refer to as graph-based growing contours. This technique is capable of extracting complex networks of boundaries present in agricultural landscapes, and is largely automatic with little supervision required. The whole detection and extraction process is designed to work independently of sensor type, resolution, or wavelength. As a test case, we applied the method to two regions of interest in a study area in the northern Germany using multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery. Extracted fields were compared visually and quantitatively to ground reference data. The technique proved reliable in producing polygons closely matching reference data, both in terms of boundary location and statistical proxies such as median field size and total acreage.

TI  - Crustal Porosity of Lunar Impact Basins
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-PLANETS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lateral variations in bulk density and porosity of the upper lunar highland crust are mapped using a high-resolution Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) gravity field model and Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) derived topography. With a higher spatial resolution gravity model than previous studies, we focus on individual impact basins with diameters greater than 200 km. The bulk density of the upper few kilometers of the lunar crust is estimated by minimizing the correlation between the topography and Bouguer gravity at short wavelengths that are unaffected by lithospheric flexure. Porosity is then derived using estimates of the grain density obtained from remote sensing data of the surface composition. The near surface crust in proximity to many large basins is found to exhibit distinct radial porosity signatures. Low porosities are found in the basin centers within the peak ring, whereas high porosities are identified near and just exterior to the main rim. The larger basins exhibit a more pronounced porosity signature than the smaller basins. Though the number of basins investigated in this study is limited, younger basins appear to be associated with the largest amplitude variations in porosity. For basins with increasing age the magnitude of the porosity variations decreases.

TI  - Detecting nutrient deficiency in spruce forests using multispectral satellite imagery
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Nutrient deficiency in forest stands has a negative impact on timber production. Although there are numerous studies investigating nutrient deficiency in forests using remote sensing, research has usually focused on extracting nutrient/pigment concentrations using hyperspectral imagery. Results of studies using this method of assessment are uncertain at the canopy level. This study proposes using freely available multispectral imagery to identify nutrient deficiency in commercially managed forest plantations. A classification map of nutrient deficient, healthy, and a third class, other, for State spruce forests in the Republic of Ireland was constructed using multispectral Sentinel 2 images from Spring and a Random Forest model. The forest area of interest (AOI) was Sitka spruce or Norway spruce plantations greater than 12 years old. Results showed that the overall accuracy was 89% and the associated Kappa Index of agreement was 79%. An unbiased area estimator was vital for an accurate estimate of the scale of nutrient deficiency, which concluded that 23% of the AOI was nutrient deficient. Early detection of nutrient deficiency is crucial to mitigate negative impacts on productivity so a time series analysis of the spectral response of healthy and nutrient deficient classes using Google Earth Engine's Landsat 5, 7, and 8 archive was carried out. A control of known nutrient deficient sites, as identified through foliar analysis, was used for comparison with the nutrient deficient and healthy training data. The spectral response showed a decrease through time for all of the foliar analysis and training data using the green (520-600 nm), red (630-690 nm), and SWIR spectra (1550-1700 nm) during Spring. This decreasing trend is due to the growth of foliage, with the difference in spectral response between nutrient deficient and healthy stands being attributed to the presence of chlorosis in stands suffering from nutrient deficiency. Spectral thresholds using digital numbers for nutrient deficient stands were identified for an operational optimum age cohort of between 10-12 years old which will be used for early detection.

TI  - Analysis of Agricultural Drought Using Remotely Sensed Evapotranspiration in a Data-Scarce Catchment
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - Understanding spatial drought characteristics is vital for planning adaptation and mitigation measures in river catchments. In many parts of the world, spatial drought information is not available due to lack of adequate evenly distributed data for spatial drought analyses. This study elucidates a spatial drought analysis in a data-scarce tropical catchment using remote sensing actual evapotranspiration (ET) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) data. Firstly, the time series of 690 images of remotely sensed ET and PET between the years 2000 and 2014 were spatially analyzed using the evapotranspiration deficit index (ETDI) approach to obtain ETDIs in the Kilombero River catchment (Tanzania). Then, spatio-temporal patterns of ETDIs were used to characterize drought frequency, total drought durations, total drought severity, and drought intensity. The frequency, durations, severity, and intensity of drought increased from the year 2000 towards 2014, causing substantial drought changes in the catchment. However, drought intensity revealed that those changes were mainly from no drought and mild drought to moderate drought. Between the years 2000 and 2014, no-drought areas and mild drought areas declined from 10% to 0% and from 42% to 19%, respectively, whereas moderate drought areas increased from 47% to 81% of the catchment size. Those changes of drought conditions were partly attributed to anthropogenic land cover change, especially in the southwest grasslands, and were partly attributed to meteorological factors in other parts of the catchment. This information is crucial for further land cover change and climate change investigations, as well as planning water and land resources in the Kilombero River catchment. Moreover, the study also demonstrates the potential of using publicly available remote sensing ET products and the ETDI approach for spatially characterizing drought in ungauged regions.

TI  - Simulating Spatial Variation of Soil Carbon Content in the Yellow River Delta: Comparative Analysis of Two Artificial Neural Network Models
T2  - WETLANDS
M3  - Article
AB  - A reasonable predicting model for spatial variation of soil carbon would be a useful tool in monitoring and restoration of salt marshes. In this study, radial basis function neural networks model (RBFNN) and back propagation neural networks model (BPNN) were built to predict total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) contents in salt marsh of the Yellow River Delta. Both models contained thirteen input parameters, i.e., nine topographic factors selected from ASTER GDEM Version2 and Geographical Information System (GIS), one vegetation index - MODIS 16-day composite Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and three soil physicochemical properties. For prediction of TC, the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller than those of BPNN by 61.87%, 81.36% and 56.82%; for TOC, the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller than those of BPNN by 37.13%, 58.06% and 35.23%; both models had no significant difference in accuracy for DOC prediction, but the MAE, MSE and RMSE values of RBFNN were smaller. All ME values of RBFNN rather than BPNN were closer to zero. RBFNN integrating environmental factors had a higher accuracy than BPNN in predicting soil carbon content at a relatively small regional scale.

TI  - Spatial and temporal variability of open biomass burning in Northeast China from 2003 to 2017
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC AND OCEANIC SCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Open biomass burning (OBB) has a significant impact on the heavy haze pollution in Northeast China (NEC) in recent years, which requires the investigation of the spatiotemporal variations of OBB with different vegetation types to better monitor and control OBB in NEC. The MODIS C6 fire and land cover products, together with the emissions inventory from the Global Fire Assimilation System, were used in this study. The changes in the total number of MODIS fire points in NEC from 2003 to 2017 demonstrated a fluctuating but generally rising trend, with a peak during 2013-2017. Most fire points concentrated in two key periods, i.e. March-April (37%) and October-November (46%). The total number of crop residue burnings in March-April was basically slightly fluctuating and increased sharply from 2013, whilst the number in October-November had a fluctuating and upward trend until 2015, when a decline appeared. The amount of OBB in March-April was higher than that in October-November during 2016-17. OBB in Heilongjiang Province comprised a major proportion of all fires, which accounted for 70.7% from 2003 to 2017; however, the proportion was only 66.2% during 2013-2017. The largest proportion of all fires was in cropland (90.8%), then forest (5.3%) and grassland (3.1%). The cumulative emissions of fine particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, and ammonia from agricultural open burning in NEC reached 78.43 Gg, 24.9 Gg, and 13.7 Gg for March-April during 2013-17, respectively, which were close to those in October-November.

TI  - Role of sonoelastography in assessment of axillary lymph nodes in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - CLINICAL RADIOLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of shear-wave elastography (SWE) and strain elastography (SE) for axillary lymph nodes (ALNs).MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were searched until September 2018. Weighted mean difference was calculated for continuous variables. The accuracy of sonoelastography was assessed by calculating pooled sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR). All data were analysed using Stata 12.0.RESULTS: Ten studies with 1,038 ALNs were included in the meta-analysis. Five studies evaluated the use of SE, and the other five evaluated the SWE. The SWE stiffness values of malignant ALNs were significantly higher than those of benign nodes. Both SE and SWE have relatively high specificity and sensitivity. The max stiffness in SWE showed the highest specificity (0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-0.98), PLR (12.1; 95% CI, 4-36.5), NLR (0.29; 95% CI, 0.12-0.69), AUC (0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.96), and DOR (42; 95% CI, 12-154); in contrast, the mean stiffness showed the highest sensitivity (0.80; 95% CI, 0.61-0.91).CONCLUSION: Sonoelastography demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between malignant and benign ALNs. The max and mean stiffness on SWE appeared to exhibit the highest accuracy. Thus, SWE is an effective accompaniment to sentinel node biopsy, and is appropriate for preoperative assessment of ALNs in the post-Z0011 era. (C) 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists.

TI  - Responses of Alpine Wetlands to Climate Changes on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau Based on Remote Sensing
T2  - CHINESE GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - The alpine wetlands in QTP (Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau) have been profoundly impacted along with global climate changes. We employ satellite datasets and climate data to explore the relationships between alpine wetlands and climate changes based on remote sensing data. Results show that: 1) the wetland NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and GPP (Gross Primary Production) were more sensitive to air temperature than to precipitation rate. The wetland ET (evapotranspiration) across alpine wetlands was greatly correlated with precipitation rate. 2) Alpine wetlands responses to climate changes varied spatially and temporally due to different geographic environments, variety of wetland formation and human disturbances. 3) The vegetation responses of the Zoige wetland was the most noticeable and related to the temperature, while the GPP and NDVI of the Qiangtang Plateau and Gyaring-Ngoring Lake were significantly correlated with both temperature and precipitation. 4) ET in the Zoige wetland showed a significantly positive trend, while ET in Maidika wetland and the Qiangtang plateau showed a negative trend, implying wetland degradation in those two wetland regions. The complexities of the impacts of climate changes on alpine wetlands indicate the necessity of further study to understand and conserve alpine wetland ecosystems.

TI  - Fractional vegetation cover and topographic effects in Pisha sandstone area of Northwest China in 2000-2018
T2  - Yingyong Shengtai Xuebao
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on MODIS-EVI data and binary pixel model, we calculated fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) in Pisha sandstone area of Northwest China from 2000 to 2018. The topographic effects on fractional vegetation coverage was analyzed from elevation, slope, and aspect using digital elevation model ( DEM) data. From 2000 to 2018 , FVC in Pisha sandstone area of Northwest was relatively low, which increased with a rate of 2.43.a(-1). The positive anomaly of FVC existed in 12 years, with higher positive anomaly FVC mainly in 2018 and 2013. The negative anomaly of FVC existed in seven years , with the lower negative anomaly of FVC mainly in 2000 and 2001. The spatial distribution of FVC in Pisha sandstone area decreased from southeast to northwest, which differed significantly among different types, with that in bare Pisha sandstone being the lowest, followed by sand-covered Pisha sandstone, and soil-covered Pisha sandstone area being the highest. The FVC in this area had an average increasing rate of 0.0031, suggesting an improved vegetation growth status. Analysis of elevation-aspect effect showed that aspect had a great influence on FVC at the elevation no more than 1000 m and more than 1500 m in bare Pisha sandstone and sand-covered Pisha sandstone areas, respectively. The aspect of soil-covered Pisha sandstone had a small influence on FVC , its influence was relatively large at 1200-1300 m. When the slope of Pisha sandstone area was no more than 15 degrees, the slope-aspect effect of FVC was not obvious. When the slope was more than 25 degrees, FVC of shady and semi-shady slope in bare and sand-covered Pisha sandstone areas was larger than that of sunny and semi-sunny slopes. For soil-covered Pisha sandstone, when the slope was more than 15 degrees, FVC of semi-shady and semi-sunny slopes was larger than that of shady and sunny slopes.

TI  - Residential greenness, air pollution and psychological well-being among urban residents in Guangzhou, China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - China's rapid urbanization has led to an increasing level of exposure to air pollution and a decreasing level of exposure to vegetation among urban populations. Both trends may pose threats to psychological well-being. Previous studies on the interrelationships among greenness, air pollution and psychological well-being rely on exposure measures from remote sensing data, which may fail to accurately capture how people perceive vegetation on the ground. To address this research gap, this study aimed to explore relationships among neighbourhood greenness, air pollution exposure and psychological well-being, using survey data on 1029 adults residing in 35 neighbourhoods in Guangzhou, China. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and streetscape greenery (SVG) to assess greenery exposure at the neighbourhood level, and we distinguished between trees (SVG-tree) and grasses (SVG-grass) when generating streetscape greenery exposure metrics. We used two objective (PM2.5 and NO2 concentrations) measures and one subjective (perceived air pollution) measure to quantify air pollution exposure. We quantified psychological well-being using the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Results from multilevel structural equation models (SEM) showed that, for parallel mediation models, while the association between SVG-grass and psychological well-being was completely mediated by perceived air pollution and NO2, the relationship between SVG-tree and psychological well-being was completely mediated by ambient PM2.5, NO2 and perceived air pollution. None of three air pollution indicators mediated the association between psychological well-being and NDVI. For serial mediation models, measures of air pollution did not mediate the relationship between NDVI and psychological wellbeing. While the linkage between SVG-grass and psychological well-being scores was partially mediated by NO2-perceived air pollution, SVG-tree was partially mediated by both ambient PM2.5-perceived air pollution and NO2-perceived air pollution. Our results suggest that street trees may be more related to lower air pollution levels and better mental health than grasses are. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Predicting Soil Organic Carbon and Soil Nitrogen Stocks in Topsoil of Forest Ecosystems in Northeastern China Using Remote Sensing Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Forest ecosystems play an important role in regional carbon and nitrogen cycling. Accurate and effective monitoring of their soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) stocks provides important information for soil quality assessment, sustainable forestry management and climate change policy making. In this study, a geographical weighted regression (GWR) model, a multiple stepwise regression (MLSR) model, and a boosted regression trees (BRT) model were compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC and STN stocks of the forest ecosystems in northeastern China. Five-hundred and thirteen topsoil (0-30 cm) samples (10.32 kg m(-2) (+/- 0.53) for SOC, 1.21 kg m(-2) (+/- 0.32) for STN), and 9 remotely-sensed environmental variables were collected and used for the model development and verification. By comparing with independent verification data, the best model (BRT) achieved R-2 = 0.56 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 00.85 kg m(-2) for SOC stocks, R-2 = 0.51 and RMSE = 0.22 kg m(-2) for STN stocks. Of all the remotely-sensed environment variables, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are of the highest relative importance in predicting SOC and STN stocks. The spatial distribution of the predicted SOC and STN stocks gradually decreased from northeast to southwest. This study provides an attempt to rapidly predict SOC and STN stocks in the dense vegetation covered area. The results can help evaluate soil quality and facilitate land policy and regulation making by the government in the region.

TI  - An Improved Method for Road Extraction from High-Resolution Remote-Sensing Images that Enhances Boundary Information
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - At present, deep-learning methods have been widely used in road extraction from remote-sensing images and have effectively improved the accuracy of road extraction. However, these methods are still affected by the loss of spatial features and the lack of global context information. To solve these problems, we propose a new network for road extraction, the coord-dense-global (CDG) model, built on three parts: a coordconv module by putting coordinate information into feature maps aimed at reducing the loss of spatial information and strengthening road boundaries, an improved dense convolutional network (DenseNet) that could make full use of multiple features through own dense blocks, and a global attention module designed to highlight high-level information and improve category classification by using pooling operation to introduce global information. When tested on a complex road dataset from Massachusetts, USA, CDG achieved clearly superior performance to contemporary networks such as DeepLabV3+, U-net, and D-LinkNet. For example, its mean IoU (intersection of the prediction and ground truth regions over their union) and mean F1 score (evaluation metric for the harmonic mean of the precision and recall metrics) were 61.90% and 76.10%, respectively, which were 1.19% and 0.95% higher than the results of D-LinkNet (the winner of a road-extraction contest). In addition, CDG was also superior to the other three models in solving the problem of tree occlusion. Finally, in universality research with the Gaofen-2 satellite dataset, the CDG model also performed well at extracting the road network in the test maps of Hefei and Tianjin, China.

TI  - Evaluation of axillary lymph node metastasis burden by preoperative ultrasound in early-stage breast cancer with needle biopsy-proven metastasis
T2  - CLINICAL & TRANSLATIONAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose The findings from the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) Z0011 trial have questioned the use of axillary lymph node (ALN) dissection (ALND) in breast cancer patients with low ALN burden. In this study, our aim was to evaluate axillary nodal metastasis burden in patients with early-stage breast cancer who presented with metastatic lymph nodes diagnosed by fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Methods The data from 346 patients with cT1-T2 breast cancer who showed positive FNAB results and were seen at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Hospital from January 2014 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The patients were divided into high axillary nodal burden (>= 3 positive lymph nodes) or low axillary nodal burden (one to two positive lymph nodes) groups. The clinical, radiological, and pathological features were compared between the two groups. Results From the 346 patients, 136 (39.3%) had low axillary nodal burden and 210 patients had high axillary nodal burden. Compared to patients with high metastatic burden, the patients with low metastatic burden were more likely to have two or fewer abnormal lymph nodes detected by AUS (95.6% vs. 65.3%, p < 0.05), and more likely to have HR-/HER2(-) lesions (15.4% vs. 5.2%, p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with more than two abnormal lymph nodes had an odds ratio of 18.385 (95% CI 7.315-46.205, p < 0.05) to have axillary metastasis. Conclusions The presence of three or more abnormal lymph nodes on AUS was a significant indicator of high axillary nodal burden in early-stage breast cancer patients with positive FNAB findings. The combination of radiological and clinicopathological findings allows physicians to identify patients with high axillary nodal burden who will likely benefit from ALND in the post-ACOSOG Z0011 trial era.

TI  - An Automatic Method for Black Margin Elimination of Sentinel-1A Images over Antarctica
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The Sentinel-1A satellite was launched in April 2014 with a primary C-Band terrain observation with progressive scans synthetic aperture radar (TOPSAR) onboard and has collected plenty of high-quality images for global change studies. However, low magnitude signals around image margins (black margins) does not preserve the normal standard level, influencing the potential usage with these data. Through image analysis, we find that the signal from black margin (BM) is highly dominated by the closest effective signals and the signal in BM shows an increasing trend along the direction from image boundary to image center. An edge detector is developed based on the signal characteristics of BM. Furthermore, an automatic method to discriminate and eliminate BM is designed. Images from both extra wide (EW) and interferometric wide (IW) swath observation modes, covering the land, ocean, and coast of the Antarctic, are taken to verify the robustness of our method. Through comparison with BM edges extracted by human interpretation, our method has the maximum BM edge extraction error of 1.9 +/- 3.2 pixels. When considering perimeter (or area) difference along radial direction of BM edge, our method has an averaging extraction accuracy of -0.35 +/- 0.11 (or 0.14 +/- 1.38) pixels, which suggests that our method is effective and can be potentially used to eliminate BM for multidisciplinary applications of Sentinel-1 data.

TI  - Spatial Differentiation of Land Use and Landscape Pattern Changes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Area
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
M3  - Article
AB  - Landscape pattern analysis based on geometric features effectively reflects the spatial patterns of land use. Based on the administrative boundaries of prefecture-level cities, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei collaborative development area is divided into three sub-regions, according to ecological-production-living functions. We used remote sensing data of long time series land-use change from late 1980 to 2015, and analyzed landscape pattern changes and spatial differentiation in the past 30 years. The results show that: (1) The main type of land-use change was the flow of cultivated land to urban construction land, and the urbanization process was significant. (2) The urban construction land was the landscape type with the highest degree of fragmentation and maximum land-use change in the region. (3) The patch density in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area increased while the average patch area decreased, and the entire landscape tended towards significant fragmentation. The Shannon diversity and evenness indexes continued to increase, indicating that the overall landscape in this region is heterogeneous and diversified. The ecological and environmental protection measures implemented in this region so far have achieved results, but require more stringent measures to ensure the total diversification of land use in the region.

TI  - Combining Multi-Source Data and Machine Learning Approaches to Predict Winter Wheat Yield in the Conterminous United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important cereal crops, supplying essential food for the world population. Because the United States is a major producer and exporter of wheat to the world market, accurate and timely forecasting of wheat yield in the United States (U.S.) is fundamental to national crop management as well as global food security. Previous studies mainly have focused on developing empirical models using only satellite remote sensing images, while other yield determinants have not yet been adequately explored. In addition, these models are based on traditional statistical regression algorithms, while more advanced machine learning approaches have not been explored. This study used advanced machine learning algorithms to establish within-season yield prediction models for winter wheat using multi-source data to address these issues. Specifically, yield driving factors were extracted from four different data sources, including satellite images, climate data, soil maps, and historical yield records. Subsequently, two linear regression methods, including ordinary least square (OLS) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and four well-known machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and deep neural network (DNN), were applied and compared for estimating the county-level winter wheat yield in the Conterminous United States (CONUS) within the growing season. Our models were trained on data from 2008 to 2016 and evaluated on data from 2017 and 2018, with the results demonstrating that the machine learning approaches performed better than the linear regression models, with the best performance being achieved using the AdaBoost model (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.51 t/ha, MAE = 0.39 t/ha). Additionally, the results showed that combining data from multiple sources outperformed single source satellite data, with the highest accuracy being obtained when the four data sources were all considered in the model development. Finally, the prediction accuracy was also evaluated against timeliness within the growing season, with reliable predictions (R-2 > 0.84) being able to be achieved 2.5 months before the harvest when the multi-source data were combined.

TI  - Detection of hydrothermal alteration zones using ASTER data in Nimu porphyry copper deposit, south Tibet, China
T2  - ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Advanced space-borne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER) data were evaluated for the hydrothermal alteration mapping of the Nimu porphyry copper deposit, southern Tibet. According to the metallogenic model for porphyry copper, we chose hydrothermal alteration mineral association and then established a remote sensing model. Relative absorption-band depth (RBD) and simple band combination methods in visible near infrared (VNIR) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands were used to retrieve information about lithological distributions. Principal component analyses (PCA) were applied to extract the prospecting information based on the spectral information of argillization mineral association, propylitization mineral association, and iron stained (limonite) effects. Results of the study match up well with known copper occurrences and a circular structure in study area, while circular structures usually have close relationship with mineralization. Combined with field validation, ASTER data are proved able to characterise the alteration zone of these porphyry deposits. With VNIR and SWIR bands, argillic, propylitic and ferritization alterations in a single deposit can be effectively discriminated. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of COSPAR.

TI  - An ∼1899 glacier inventory for Nordland, northern Norway, produced from historical maps
T2  - JOURNAL OF GLACIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Glaciers depicted on old maps reveal their historical extents, before the advent of aerial and satellite remote sensing. Digital glacier inventories produced from these maps can be employed in assessments of centennial-scale glacier change. This study reconstructs the 1899 (covering the period 1882-1916) glacier extent in Nordland, northern Norway, from historical gradteigskart maps, with an emphasis on examining the accuracy of the mapped glaciers. Glacier outlines were digitised from georectified scans of the analogue maps in a raster graphics editor and were subsequently inventoried in a GIS. The accuracy of the historical glacier extent was established from written descriptions and landscape photographs created during the original field surveys, and further validated against independent glacier outlines of (1) the maximum Little Ice Age extent derived from geomorphological evidence, and (2) the 1945 extent derived from vertical aerial photographs. An overall uncertainty of +/- 17% is associated with our inventory. Nordland's glaciers covered an area of 1712 +/- 291 km(2) in 1899. By 2000, total ice cover had decreased by 47% (807 +/- 137 km(2)) at a rate of 6% 10 a(-1) (80 +/- 14 km(2) 10 a(-1)). The approach presented here may serve as a blueprint for future studies intending to derive glacier inventories from historical maps.

TI  - Can we trust remote sensing evapotranspiration products over Africa?
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important components in the water cycle. However, there are relatively few direct measurements of ET available (e.g. using flux towers). Nevertheless, various disciplines, ranging from hydrology to agricultural and climate sciences, require information on the spatial and temporal distribution of ET at regional and global scales. Due to the limited data availability, attention has turned toward satellite-based products to fill observational gaps. Various data products, including remote sensing (RS) products, have been developed and provide a large range of ET estimations. Across Africa, only a limited number of flux towers are available; hence, they are insufficient for the systematic evaluation of the available ET products. Thus, in this study, we conduct a methodological evaluation of nine existing RS-derived ET products as well as other available ET products in order to evaluate their reliability at the basin scale. A general water balance (WB) approach is used, where ET is equal to precipitation minus discharge for long-term averages. Firstly, ET products are compared with WB-inferred ET (ETWB) for basins that do not show long-term trends. The ET products and the calculated ETWB are then evaluated against the Budyko equation, which is used as a reference condition. The spatial characteristics of the ET products are finally assessed via the analysis of selected land cover elements across Africa: forests, irrigated areas and water bodies. Additionally, a cluster analysis is conducted to identify similarities between individual ET products. The results show that CMRSET, SSEBop and WaPOR rank highest in terms of the estimation of the long-term average mean ET across basins, with low biases and good spatial variability across Africa. GLEAM consistently ranks lowest in most evaluation criteria, although it has the longest available time period. Each product shows specific advantages and disadvantages. Depending on the study in question, at least one product should be suitable for a particular requirement. The reader should bear in mind that many products suffer from a large bias. Based on the evaluation criteria in this study, the three highest ranked products, CMRSET, SSEBop and WaPOR, would suit many users' needs due to the low biases and good spatial variability across Africa.

TI  - Spatial detection of alpine treeline ecotones in the Western United States
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Human-mediated climate change over the past century has resulted in significant impacts to global ecosystems and biodiversity including accelerating redistribution of the geographic ranges of species. In mountainous regions, the transition zone from continuous closed-canopy montane forests to treeless alpine tundra areas at higher elevations is commonly referred to as the "alpine treeline ecotone" (ATE). Globally, warming climate is expected to drive ATEs upslope, which could lead to negative impacts on local biodiversity and changes in ecosystem function. However, existing studies rely primarily on field-based data which are difficult and time consuming to collect. In this study, we define an ATE-detection index (ATEI) to automatically identify the ATE positions from 2009 to 2011 in the western United States using geospatial tools and remotely sensed datasets provided by Google Earth Engine. A binomial logistic regression model was fitted between standardized ATEI components and a binary variable of pixel status of 141 sampled Landsat pixels manually classified with high-resolution imagery in Google Earth. The average model accuracy was around 0.713 (+/- 0.111) and the average Kappa coefficient was approximately 0.426 (+/- 0.221) based on a 100-time repeated 10-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, the ATEI-estimated elevation is highly correlated (Pearson's r = 0.98) with a published set of field-collected ATE elevations at 22 sampling sites across the region. The detection metric developed in this study facilitates monitoring the geographic location and potential shifts of ATEs as well as the general impact of climate change in mountainous areas during recent decades. We also expect this approach to be useful in monitoring other ecosystem boundaries.

TI  - A new conceptual model of pesticide transfers from agricultural land to surface waters with a specific focus on metaldehyde
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES & IMPACTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Pesticide losses from agricultural land to water can result in the environmental deterioration of receiving systems. Mathematical models can make important contributions to risk assessments and catchment management. However, some mechanistic models have high parameter requirements which can make them difficult to apply in data poor areas. In addition, uncertainties in pesticide properties and applications are difficult to account for using models with long run-times. Alternative, simpler, conceptual models are easier to apply and can still be used as a framework for process interpretation. Here, we present a new conceptual model of pesticide behaviour in surface water catchments, based on continuous water balance calculations. Pesticide losses to surface waters are calculated based on the displacement of a limited fraction of the soil pore water during storm events occurring after application. The model was used to describe the behaviour of metaldehyde in a small (2.2 km(2)) under-drained catchment in Eastern England. Metaldehyde is a molluscicide which has been regularly detected at high concentrations in many drinking water supply catchments. Measured peak concentrations in stream water (to about 9 mu g L-1) occurred in the first few storm events after application in mid-August. In each event, there was a quasi-exponential decrease in concentration during hydrograph recession. Peak concentrations decreased in successive events - responding to rainfall but reflecting an effective exhaustion in soil supply due to degradation and dissipation. Uncertain pesticide applications to the catchment were estimated using land cover analysis of satellite data, combined with a Poisson distribution to describe the timing of application. Model performance for both the hydrograph (after calibration of the water balance) and the chemograph was good and could be improvedviasome minor adjustments in assumptions which yield general insights into the drivers for pesticide transport. The use of remote sensing offers some promising opportunities for estimating catchment-scale pesticide applications and associated losses.

TI  - Quantifying large-scale ecosystem stability with remote sensing data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING IN ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To fully understand ecosystem functioning under global change, we need to be able to measure the stability of ecosystem functioning at multiple spatial scales. Although a number of stability components have been established at small spatial scales, there has been little progress in scaling these measures up to the landscape. Remote sensing data holds huge potential for studying processes at landscape scales but requires quantitative measures that are comparable from experimental field data to satellite remote sensing. Here we present a methodology to extract four components of ecosystem functioning stability from satellite-derived time series of Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data. The four stability components are as follows: variability, resistance, recovery time and recovery rate in ecosystem functioning. We apply our method to the island of Ireland to demonstrate the use of remotely sensed data to identify large disturbance events in productivity. Our method uses stability measures that have been established at the field-plot scale to quantify the stability of ecosystem functioning. This makes our method consistent with previous small-scale stability research, whilst dealing with the unique challenges of using remotely sensed data including noise. We encourage the use of remotely-sensed data in assessing the stability of ecosystems at a scale that is relevant to conservation and management practices.

TI  - Evidence for Elevation-Dependent Warming in the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLIMATE
M3  - Article
AB  - The climate of high midlatitude mountains appears to be warming faster than the global average, but evidence for such elevation-dependent warming (EDW) at higher latitudes is presently scarce. Here, we use a comprehensive network of remote meteorological stations, proximal radiosonde measurements, downscaled temperature reanalysis, ice cores, and climate indices to investigate the manifestation and possible drivers of EDW in the St. Elias Mountains in subarctic Yukon, Canada. Linear trend analysis of comprehensively validated annual downscaled North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) gridded surface air temperatures for the years 1979-2016 indicates a warming rate of 0.028 degrees C a(-1) between 5500 and 6000 m above mean sea level (MSL), which is similar to 1.6 times larger than the global-average warming rate between 1970 and 2015. The warming rate between 5500 and 6000 m MSL was similar to 1.5 times greater than the rate at the 2000-2500 m MSL bin (0.019 degrees C a(-1)), which is similar to the majority of warming rates estimated worldwide over similar elevation gradients. Accelerated warming since 1979, measured by radiosondes, indicates a maximum rate at 400 hPa (similar to 7010 m MSL). EDW in the St. Elias region therefore appears to be driven by recent warming of the free troposphere. MODIS satellite data show no evidence for an enhanced snow albedo feedback above 2500 m MSL, and declining trends in sulfate aerosols deposited in high-elevation ice cores suggest a modest increase in radiative forcing at these elevations. In contrast, increasing trends in water vapor mixing ratio at the 500-hPa level measured by radiosonde suggest that a longwave radiation vapor feedback is contributing to EDW.

TI  - In Water-Limited Landscapes, an Anthropocene Exchange: Trading Lakes for Irrigated Agriculture
T2  - EARTHS FUTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Lakes-quintessential features of Earth's surface prized from perspectives of water security, aquatic ecosystems, and recreation alike-are shrinking in water-limited regions of all of Earth's inhabited continents. Here we assessed Landsat-derived long-term decrease in global lake area relative to historical lake extent aiming to determine the role of recent Anthropocene levels of irrigated agriculture in the global phenomenon of lake desiccation. As of 2015, 11% (1.8 center dot 10(5)km(2)) of global lake area has already been lost, primarily due to increased water consumption in support of irrigated agriculture in endorheic basins within water-limited regions. However, current levels of irrigated agriculture portend substantial additional shrinkage of global lakes before reaching new equilibria with present-day inflows, with an additional 60-130% increase in endorheic lake loss anticipated. The time required for shrinking lakes to attain new equilibria ranges from decades to centuries depending on lake hyposometry. Even a small decrease in lake area can portend lake transition from exorheic to endorheic and dramatic reductions in water quality. Thus, lake area changes severely understate the perilous condition of global lakes. The watershed area contributing to shrinking (endorheic and exorheic) lakes accounts for 18% of Earth's land area, far too large for the irrigated agriculture therein to be transferred elsewhere in order to save these lakes, though continued developments in the efficiency of water consumption in agriculture and urban areas can save significant quantities of water. This suggests that global lake shrinkage may be a harbinger signaling mankind having exceeded Earth's sustainable carrying capacity.

TI  - High-resolution UV/Optical/IR Imaging of Jupiter in 2016-2019
T2  - ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL SUPPLEMENT SERIES
M3  - Article
AB  - Imaging observations of Jupiter with high spatial resolution were acquired beginning in 2016, with a cadence of 53 days to coincide with atmospheric observations of the Juno spacecraft during each perijove pass. The Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) collected Jupiter images from 236 to 925 nm in 14 filters. The Near-Infrared Imager (NIRI) at Gemini North imaged Jovian thermal emission using a lucky-imaging approach (co-adding the sharpest frames taken from a sequence of short exposures), using the M ' filter at 4.7 mu m. We discuss the data acquisition and processing and an archive collection that contains the processed WFC3 and NIRI data (doi:). Zonal winds remain steady over time at most latitudes, but significant evolution of the wind profile near 24 degrees N in 2016 and near 15 degrees S in 2017 was linked with convective superstorm eruptions. Persistent mesoscale waves were seen throughout the 2016-2019 period. We link groups of lightning flashes observed by the Juno team with water clouds in a large convective plume near 15 degrees S and in cyclones near 35 degrees N-55 degrees N. Thermal infrared maps at the 10.8 micron wavelength obtained at the Very Large Telescope show consistent high brightness temperature anomalies, despite a diversity of aerosol properties seen in the HST data. Both WFC3 and NIRI imaging reveal depleted aerosols consistent with downwelling around the periphery of the 15 degrees S storm, which was also observed by the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. NIRI imaging of the Great Red Spot shows that locally reduced cloud opacity is responsible for dark features within the vortex. The HST data maps multiple concentric polar hoods of high-latitude hazes.

TI  - Trend of Sea Surface Temperature Increase and Coral Resilience After Bleaching Events of 2010 and 2016 in The Marine Tourism Park (TWP) of Pieh Island, Padang, West Sumatra.
T2  - Oseanologi dan Limnologi di Indonesia
M3  - Article
AB  - The coral bleaching event has hit almost all of Indonesia's waters at least 4 times (in the last 34 years), which the last two events (2010 and 2016) have been discussed rather deeply. However, detailed studies in a specific location, such as in Marine Tourism Park (TWP) of Pieh Island, Padang waters, West Sumatra Province that influenced by the water mass of Indian Ocean have not yet been studied. The aim of this paper is to examine the trend of sea surface temperatures (SST)'s increase in the TWP of Pieh Island in 2010 and 2016 coral bleaching, and the coral resilience after the events. In this study, the long-term SST data acquired from the Aqua MODIS satellite images were used intensively. Results show that the highest mean monthly SST called MMM that corals can be tolerated in the TWP of Pieh is 29.6 [degree]C, higher than in all Indonesian waters (29.1 [degree]C).The differences between the anomaly SST and the normal SST (MMM) or called Hot Spot (HS) has exceeded the average MMM in the 2010 bleaching event around 0.4-0.5 [degree]C with its peak in April, and with alert-1 severity (Degree Heating Weeks (DHW) < 8 [degree]C-weeks; which means that the coral has partial bleaching with patchy pattern),In 2016, the HS increased by an average of 0.5 [approximately] 1.0 [degree]C with peaks in January-February and May-June and with the severity of Alert-2 (DHW >= 8 [degree]C-weeks, which means corals experienced severe bleaching, over wider areas, and some of corals are died). One year earlier (2015), higher HS with an average value of 0.3-0.8 [degree]C and DHW [approximately] 4 [degree]C-weeks were also observed. This indicates that coral bleaching events in the TWP of Pieh Island is repeated and occurs for long periods.The trend of increasing SST in this TWP is 0.23[degree]C/decade, lower than in the all Indonesian waters (0.36 [degree]C/decade). This trend shows that coral reefs in Indonesian waters including this TWP have a high resilience to recover themselves from bleaching, since the trend of increasing SST < 1.0 [degree]C/decade of the 11 coral resilience key factors, positive factors that support high coral resilience are low pollution/nutrients, low sedimentation (high water transparency), and low unfriendly of human activities, while the most negative one is the explosion of crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci population as well as coral disease.

TI  - Using SMOS soil moisture data combining CO<sub>2</sub> flask samples to constrain carbon fluxes during 2010-2015 within a Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS)
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The terrestrial carbon cycle is an important component of the global carbon budget due to its large gross exchange fluxes with the atmosphere and their sensitivity to climate change. Terrestrial biosphere models show large uncertainties in simulating carbon fluxes, which impact global carbon budget assessments. The land surface carbon cycle is tightly controlled by soil moisture through plant physiological processes. Accurate soil moisture observations thereby have the potential to improve the modeling of carbon fluxes in a model-data fusion framework. We employ the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) to assimilate six years of surface soil moisture provided by the SMOS satellite in combination with global-scale observations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that assimilation of SMOS soil moisture exhibits better performance on soil hydrology modeling at both global and site-level than only assimilating atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and it improves the soil moisture simulation particularly in mid- to high-latitude regions where the plants suffer from water stress frequently. The optimized model also shows good agreements with inter-annual variability in simulated Net Primary Productivity (NEP) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) from an atmospheric inversion (Jena CarboScope) and the up-scaled eddy covariance flux product (FLUXNET-MTE), respectively. Correlation between SIF (Solar Induced Fluorescence) and optimized GPP also shows to be the highest when soil moisture and atmospheric CO2 are simultaneously assimilated. In general, CCDAS obtains smaller annual mean NEP values (1.8 PgC/yr) than the atmospheric inversion and an ensemble of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), but larger GPP values (167.8 PgC/yr) than the up-scaled eddy covariance dataset (FLUXNET-MTE) and the MODIS based GPP product for the years 2010 to 2015. This study demonstrates the high potential of constraining simulations of the terrestrial biosphere carbon cycle on inter-annual time scales using long-term microwave observations of soil moisture.

TI  - Winter wheat LAI inversion considering morphological characteristics at different growth stages coupled with microwave scattering model and canopy simulation model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - To better eliminate the adverse effects of the ground surface on winter wheat Leaf area index (LAI) inversions and to further improve the accuracy of regional winter wheat LAI inversion using SAR remote sensing data, considering the morphological characteristics at different wheat growth stages, a winter wheat LAI inversion model coupled with the microwave scattering model (MSM) for winter wheat at different growth stages (MSMDGS) and the canopy scattering simulation model (CSSM) was proposed. In this research, taking Hengshui City of Huanghuaihai Plain of North China as the study region, using RADARSAT-2 data as image sources and based on parameter sensitivity analysis and model calibration, the proposed model was applied and validated. The LAI inversion results of winter wheat showed that the proposed model had good performance in the regional application and that LAI inversion results with high accuracy could be obtained. Among the three key growth stages (jointing stage, booting stage and heading stage) of winter wheat, the R-2, adjusted R-2 and RMSE between the LAI inversion value and the ground-measured data were 0.918, 0.917 and 0.675, respectively, which indicated that the winter wheat LAI inversion model coupled with MSMDGS and CSSM had certain feasibility and applicability.

TI  - Impaired Autophagy in the Fibroblasts by Titanium Particles Increased the Release of CX3CL1 and Promoted the Chemotactic Migration of Monocytes
T2  - INFLAMMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - Abstract Aseptic loosening (AL) is the most frequent cause of failure of total hip arthroplasties (THA). Prosthetic wear particle-induced monocyte recruitment to the periprosthetic tissue and subsequent inflammatory response are thought to be the major contribution to AL. Fibroblast is a dominant cell type in interfacial membrane (IFM) which is the main pathological feature of periprosthetic osteolysis in failed THAs. Considering the role of fibroblasts, as sentinel cells, in the synthesis of chemokines and regulation of inflammation, we hypothesize that fibroblasts might be involved in the monocyte recruitment in the pathogenesis of periprosthetic osteolysis associated with particle debris. This study explored the induction of fibroblasts on the monocyte recruitment. The results showed that titanium (Ti) particle-stimulated fibroblasts isolated from IFMs of loosened THAs significantly promoted the chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells by increasing the release of CX3CL1 (C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1). Further investigation demonstrated that Ti particle stimulation increased the expression of ADAM10 (ADAM metallopeptidase domain 10) by impairing autophagy in the fibroblasts and in turn increased the cleavage and shedding of CX3CL1. Thus, we propose a new insight to the pathogenesis of aseptic loosening which implies that autophagy-ADAM10-CX3CL1 signaling pathway in fibroblasts can be leveraged to alleviating inflammation caused by monocyte recruitment in aseptic loosening and improving performance of articulation of the joint device.

TI  - Remembering the Past through Music: The Transmission of Chinese <i>Qin</i> Songs in Seventeenth-to Nineteenth-Century Japan
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ORIENTAL SOCIETY
M3  - Article
AB  - In the late seventeenth century, a Chinese Buddhist priest named Donggao Xinyue (1639-1695) introduced a selection of qin songs (songs accompanied on the gin zither) to Japan. Over the following centuries, Japanese qin players continued to sing these songs in Chinese. This paper looks into this cross-cultural interaction from both Donggao's and the Japanese perspectives, against the historical background of the Ming-Qing dynastic transition and the breakdown of the Sinocentric world order in East Asia. I argue that Donggao and Japanese literati understood the significance of these songs differently as they both connected the songs to their own cultural past. Nonetheless, they were brought together by the shared belief that the performance of qin songs would bridge the past and the present and hence realize their vision of the ideal civilization. Meanwhile, neither Donggao nor the Japanese literati regarded the qin-as well as the ideal society it symbolized-to be exclusively Chinese or Japanese. My analysis shows how the idea of being Chinese/Japanese was intertwined with the changing understandings of the worldview during this period, and how it was negotiated through the cultural memories that shaped and reshaped the past. This particular case also explains how qin songs as a medium for cultural memory differed from other musical and non-musical forms.

TI  - Satellite-based time series land cover and change information to map forest area consistent with national and international reporting requirements
T2  - FORESTRY
M3  - Article
AB  - Forests are dynamic ecosystems, subject to both natural and anthropogenic agents of change. Wildfire, harvesting and other human activities alter the tree-covered area present in forests. From national and international reporting perspectives, forests include areas currently treed, as well as those disturbed forest areas that are not currently treed but will be, given time for regeneration and the advancement of natural successional processes. As a consequence, forest area can be depicted at a particular point in time, informed by a retrospective temporal context. Using time series of Landsat imagery, annual land cover maps can be generated that are informed by knowledge of past disturbance history (such as wildfire and harvesting). In this research, we use over three decades of annual land cover data generated from Landsat time series to generate a spatially explicit estimate of the forest area of Canada in 2010. We demonstrate how land cover and disturbance information can be combined to map the area of 'forest', as defined by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), within Canada's 650 Mha of forested ecozones. Following this approach, we estimated Canada's total forest area in 2010 to be 354.5 Mha. This estimate includes 324.5 Mha of current forest cover in 2010, plus an additional 33.2 Mha (or 9.4 per cent) of temporally informed forest area where tree cover had been temporarily lost due to fire or harvest, less 3.3 Mha that were removed to meet a definitional minimum size (0.5 ha) for contiguous forest area. Using Canada's National Forest Inventory (NFI) as an independent reference source, the spatial agreement between the two estimates of forest area was similar to 84 per cent overall. Aspatially, the total area of the Landsat-derived estimate of 2010 forest area and the NFI baseline estimates differed by only 3 per cent, with notable regional differences in the wetland-dominated Hudson Plains Ecozone. Satellite-derived time series land cover and change information enable spatially explicit depictions of forest area (distinct from representations of forest cover) in a robust and transparent fashion, producing information of value to science, management and reporting information needs.

TI  - Global retrieval of phytoplankton functional types based on empirical orthogonal functions using CMEMS GlobColour merged products and further extension to OLCI data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study presents an algorithm for globally retrieving chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations of phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) from multi-sensor merged ocean color (OC) products or Sentinel-3A (S3) Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) data from the GlobColour archive in the frame of the Copernicus Marine Environmental Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The retrieved PFTs include diatoms, haptophytes, dinoflagellates, green algae and prokaryotic phytoplankton. A previously proposed method to retrieve various phytoplankton pigments, based on empirical orthogonal functions (EOF), is investigated and adapted to retrieve Chl-a concentrations of multiple PFTs using extensive global data sets of in situ pigment measurements and matchups with satellite OC products. The performance of the EOF-based approach is assessed and cross-validated statistically. The retrieved PFTs are compared with those derived from diagnostic pigment analysis (DPA) based on in situ pigment measurements. Results show that the approach predicts well Chl-a concentrations of most of the mentioned PFTs. The performance of the approach is, however, less accurate for prokaryotes, possibly due to their general low variability and small concentration range resulting in a weak signal which is extracted from the reflectance data and corresponding EOF modes. As a demonstration of the approach utilization, the EOF-based fitted models based on satellite reflectance products at nine bands are applied to the monthly GlobColour merged products. Climatological characteristics of the PFTs are also evaluated based on ten years of merged products (2002-2012) through inter-comparisons with other existing satellite derived products on phytoplankton composition including phytoplankton size class (PSC), SynSenPFT, OC-PFT and PHYSAT. Inter-comparisons indicate that most PFTs retrieved by our study agree well with previous corresponding PFT/PSC products, except that prokaryotes show higher Chl-a concentration in low latitudes. PFT dominance derived from our products is in general well consistent with the PHYSAT product. A preliminary experiment of the retrieval algorithm using eleven OLCI bands is applied to monthly OLCI products, showing comparable PFT distributions with those from the merged products, though the matchup data for OLCI are limited both in number and coverage. This study is to ultimately deliver satellite global PFT products for long-term continuous observation, which will be updated timely with upcoming OC data, for a comprehensive understanding of the variability of phytoplankton composition structure at a global or regional scale.

TI  - A Bathymetry Mapping Approach Combining Log-Ratio and Semianalytical Models Using Four-Band Multispectral Imagery Without Ground Data
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Four-band multispectral remote sensing imagery is widely used for a variety of purposes and has a long historical data record. However, most of the existing bathymetry inversion methods are either unable to determine the optimal solution through theoretical or semianalytical models due to the limited number of bands, or their application is limited by the difficulty in obtaining in situ data. In this article, a log-ratio model and a semianalytical model are combined to develop a new shallow water depth inversion method (L-S model) using four-band multispectral remote sensing images without the need for supporting truth data. A case study was conducted for Ganquan Island in the South China Sea, using four-band multispectral imagery from the GeoEye-1, WorldView-2 (four bands selected), Sentinel-2 (four bands selected), and Gaofen-1 satellites; a sound range of 30 m was achieved. When compared to LiDAR-measured water depth data, GeoEye-1, WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, and Gaofen-1 data have root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 1.33-1.97 m. In addition, compared with the results of the log-ratio model trained using 200 LiDAR-based depth readings, the L-S model results obtained for the four satellite types are similar in the RMSE. These results show that the L-S model can achieve results that are close to those of the log-ratio model without the need for external inputs. This provides a feasible new method for bathymetry inversion in areas without truth data using only four-band imagery.

TI  - A Novel Image Fusion Method for Water Body Extraction Based on Optimal Band Combination
T2  - TRAITEMENT DU SIGNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - This paper attempts to design an image fusion method that facilitates the extraction of water bodies from remote sensing images, namely, the images taken by Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) of Landsat 7 and those taken by Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) of Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS). Firstly, the water body information was extracted from ETM+ data and PALSAR data, and combined into a benchmark image. Next, several traditional image fusion methods were separately adopted to merge the ETM+453 image and the PALSAR HH image, and the water bodies extracted from the fused images were compared in details. The selected methods include principal component analysis (PCA), Brovey transform (BT), intensity-hue-saturation (IHS) transform, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and high-pass filter (HPF). After that, a new image fusion method was designed based on optimal band combination (OBC), and the water bodies extracted by the method were compared with the benchmark image and those extracted by the traditional methods. The results show that the ALOS HH image alone achieved higher accuracy in water body extraction than the ETM+ image alone; the traditional image fusion methods, namely, PCA, BT, IHS, HPF and DWT, were more accurate than the ETM+ image alone in water body extraction, and less accurate than the ALOS HH image alone. The OBC-based image fusion method greatly outperformed all the traditional methods. The research results provide a good reference for image fusion and extraction tasks in similar cases.

TI  - Change point estimation of deciduous forest land surface phenology
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Dramatic phenological shifts and ecosystem responses of deciduous forests to global climate change have been reported around the world. Land Surface Phenology (LSP) derived from satellite imagery is useful to estimate the phenological responses of vegetation to climate variability and inform terrestrial ecosystem models at landscape to global scales. However, there is a large (and unquantified) uncertainty in estimated phenological dates due to the relatively coarse temporal resolution of typical data and methodological limitations. To assess responses of phenology and related ecological function and services, it is essential to decrease the temporal uncertainty of estimated phenological processes. In this study, we developed a new LSP estimation method using linear change point models to determine four phenological transitions using twice-daily Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from 2000 to 2015. We evaluated the approach using long-term phenological ground observations and compare performance of four LSP estimations generated from two data sources (i.e. 8-day and twice daily EVI time series) and two methods (i.e. double logistic and change point estimation). We found that the LSP generated from change point estimation with twice daily EVI time series had the highest accuracy (i.e. lower Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), mean bias, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)) for both spring and fall phenology evaluated by Harvard Forest phenology observations and a large citizen science database of phenological observations from the National Phenology Network. For example, change point estimation reduced the estimation error for fall senescence date from over 40 days in the standard MODIS phenology product (version 005) to 11.5-24 days of RMSE, -2.6 to -5.8 days of mean bias, and 7.9-20.1 days of MAE. The change point methodology also enables calculation of additional metrics to describe the biophysical process of vegetation, including rates of greenup, green-down, and senescence, EVI values at each phenological transition, and the estimation uncertainties for each transition date. Our LSP estimations will improve more comprehensive investigations of landscape phenology of deciduous forest and the associated ecosystem processes at regional to global scales.

TI  - Contrast of Mastoscopic and Conventional Axillary Lymph Node Dissection of Patients With Breast Cancer: Meta-Analysis
T2  - CANCER CONTROL
M3  - Article
AB  - Mastoscopic axillary lymph node dissection (MALND) is a currently used and safe surgical treatment option for breast cancer. However, the extensive application of MALND is still debatable because of the use of conventional axillary lymph node dissection (CALND). Therefore, in the current study, we aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of MALND and CALND for obtaining evidence-based conclusions about the short-term and long-term outcomes of MALND for patients with breast cancer. PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and CNKI were comprehensively searched for articles published between January 1998 and January 2019. Then Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for quality assessment. The Review Manager software version 5.0 was utilized for generating forest maps and funnel plots. Twelve studies including 2157 patients were selected for the meta-analysis. There were no significant differences in the number of lymph node dissections, tumor recurrence rate, axillary drainage, postoperative hospitalization time, and tumor size between the MALND and CALND groups (P> .05). In the MALND group, the surgery time was longer, while the incidence of intraoperative bleeding was lesser and the duration of drainage was shorter than those in the CALND group (P< .01). The complications in the MALND group were also fewer than those in the CALND group (P< .05). The results of the current study showed that MALND is reliable and feasible for breast cancer owing to the lesser incidence of intraoperative bleeding, shorter drainage duration, and lower incidence of complications compared to CALND.

TI  - The total P estimation with hyper-spectrum A novel insight into different P fractions
T2  - CATENA
M3  - Article
AB  - Phosphorus (P) is one of the main characterization parameters of soil fertility and an important element affecting vegetation growth. This paper used the multivariate stepwise regression to estimate the soil P concentration through multiple mathematical transformation of the original spectrum, evaluate the accuracy of different models, and determine the optimal modeling method. The total P (TP) is classified as loosely adsorbed P (Ad-P), P bound by iron oxides or hydroxides (Fe-P), aluminum-bound P (Al-P), calcium-bound P (Ca-P) and residual P (Re-P). Then the relationship between various P fractions and soil properties and their spectral characteristics were analyzed. The effects of different P fractions on total P (TP) estimation were discussed from the aspects of selected bands, corresponding forms and spectral transformation forms, the direct and indirect estimation models are constructed respectively, which provided a new idea for soil spectrum estimation of soil properties. The results show that (1) Al-P is the main component of TP, and its spectral characteristics are not obvious, and the correlation coefficient between Al-P and TP is 0.437, which is the main reason for the stability of TP estimation model. (2) Soil organic matter and Ca-P have the greatest influence on TP estimation. When the band is less than 1200 nm, soil organic matter concentration is the main factor affecting TP estimation. When the wavelength is greater than 1200 nm, Ca-P is the main factor affecting TP estimation. (3) An indirect estimation model of TP was developed by using Ca-P, the R-2 of the calibration reached 0.78, and the R-2 of the validation reached 0.66, the model is stable and can be used to estimate TP content. It is proved that it is a feasible method to estimate the TP content through the spectral characteristics of P fractions, the relationship between organic matter and TP is not the only key reason for the successful estimation of TP.

TI  - Improved SRGAN for Remote Sensing Image Super-Resolution Across Locations and Sensors
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Detailed and accurate information on the spatial variation of land cover and land use is a critical component of local ecology and environmental research. For these tasks, high spatial resolution images are required. Considering the trade-off between high spatial and high temporal resolution in remote sensing images, many learning-based models (e.g., Convolutional neural network, sparse coding, Bayesian network) have been established to improve the spatial resolution of coarse images in both the computer vision and remote sensing fields. However, data for training and testing in these learning-based methods are usually limited to a certain location and specific sensor, resulting in the limited ability to generalize the model across locations and sensors. Recently, generative adversarial nets (GANs), a new learning model from the deep learning field, show many advantages for capturing high-dimensional nonlinear features over large samples. In this study, we test whether the GAN method can improve the generalization ability across locations and sensors with some modification to accomplish the idea "training once, apply to everywhere and different sensors" for remote sensing images. This work is based on super-resolution generative adversarial nets (SRGANs), where we modify the loss function and the structure of the network of SRGANs and propose the improved SRGAN (ISRGAN), which makes model training more stable and enhances the generalization ability across locations and sensors. In the experiment, the training and testing data were collected from two sensors (Landsat 8 OLI and Chinese GF 1) from different locations (Guangdong and Xinjiang in China). For the cross-location test, the model was trained in Guangdong with the Chinese GF 1 (8 m) data to be tested with the GF 1 data in Xinjiang. For the cross-sensor test, the same model training in Guangdong with GF 1 was tested in Landsat 8 OLI images in Xinjiang. The proposed method was compared with the neighbor-embedding (NE) method, the sparse representation method (SCSR), and the SRGAN. The peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) were chosen for the quantitive assessment. The results showed that the ISRGAN is superior to the NE (PSNR: 30.999, SSIM: 0.944) and SCSR (PSNR: 29.423, SSIM: 0.876) methods, and the SRGAN (PSNR: 31.378, SSIM: 0.952), with the PSNR = 35.816 and SSIM = 0.988 in the cross-location test. A similar result was seen in the cross-sensor test. The ISRGAN had the best result (PSNR: 38.092, SSIM: 0.988) compared to the NE (PSNR: 35.000, SSIM: 0.982) and SCSR (PSNR: 33.639, SSIM: 0.965) methods, and the SRGAN (PSNR: 32.820, SSIM: 0.949). Meanwhile, we also tested the accuracy improvement for land cover classification before and after super-resolution by the ISRGAN. The results show that the accuracy of land cover classification after super-resolution was significantly improved, in particular, the impervious surface class (the road and buildings with high-resolution texture) improved by 15%.

TI  - Improving leaf area index retrieval over heterogeneous surface mixed with water
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Land cover mixture at moderate- to coarse-resolution is an important cause for the uncertainty of global leaf area index (LAI) products. The accuracy of LAI retrievals over land-water mixed pixels is adversely impacted because water absorbs considerable solar radiation and thus can greatly lower pixel-level reflectance especially in the near-infrared wavelength. Here we proposed an approach named Reduced Water Effect (RWE) to improve the accuracy of LAI retrievals by accounting for water-induced negative bias in reflectances. The RWE consists of three parts: water area fraction (WAF) calculation, subpixel water reflectance computation in land-water mixed pixels and LAI retrieval using the operational MODIS LAI algorithm. The performance of RWE was carefully evaluated using the aggregated Landsat ETM+ reflectance of water pixels over different regions and observation dates and the aggregated 30-m LAI reference maps over three sites in the moderate-resolution pixel grid (500-m). Our results suggest that the mean absolute errors of water endmember reflectance in red and NIR bands were both < 0.016, which only introduced mean absolute (relative) errors of < 0.15 (15%) for the pixel-level LAI retrievals. The validation results reveal that the accuracy of RWE LAI was higher than that of MODIS LAI over land-water mixed pixels especially for pixels with larger WAFs. Additionally, the mean relative difference between RWE LAI and aggregated 30-m LAI did not vary with WAF, indicating that water effects were significantly reduced by the RWE method. A comparison between RWE and MODIS LAI shows that the maximum absolute and relative differences caused by water effects were 0.9 and 100%, respectively. Furthermore, the impact of water mixed in pixels can induce the LAI underestimation and change the day selected for compositing the 8-day LAI product. These results indicate that RWE can effectively reduce water effects on the LAI retrieval of land-water mixed pixels, which is promising for the improvement of global LAI products.

TI  - Downscaling Aster Land Surface Temperature over Urban Areas with Machine Learning-Based Area-To-Point Regression Kriging
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Land surface temperature (LST) is a vital physical parameter of earth surface system. Estimating high-resolution LST precisely is essential to understand heat change processes in urban environments. Existing LST products with coarse spatial resolution retrieved from satellite-based thermal infrared imagery have limited use in the detailed study of surface energy balance, evapotranspiration, and climatic change at the urban spatial scale. Downscaling LST is a practicable approach to obtain high accuracy and high-resolution LST. In this study, a machine learning-based geostatistical downscaling method (RFATPK) is proposed for downscaling LST which integrates the advantages of random forests and area-to-point Kriging methods. The RFATPK was performed to downscale the 90 m Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LST 10 m over two representative areas in Guangzhou, China. The 10 m multi-type independent variables derived from the Sentinel-2A imagery on 1 November 2017, were incorporated into the RFATPK, which considered the nonlinear relationship between LST and independent variables and the scale effect of the regression residual LST. The downscaled results were further compared with the results obtained from the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) based thermal sharpening method (TsHARP). The experimental results showed that the RFATPK produced 10 m LST with higher accuracy than the TsHARP; the TsHARP showed poor performance when downscaling LST in the built-up and water regions because NDVI is a poor indicator for impervious surfaces and water bodies; the RFATPK captured LST difference over different land coverage patterns and produced the spatial details of downscaled LST on heterogeneous regions. More accurate LST data has wide applications in meteorological, hydrological, and ecological research and urban heat island monitoring.

TI  - Sequential modelling of the 2016 Central Italy earthquake cluster using multisource satellite observations and quantitative assessment of Coulomb stress change
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - A sequence of earthquake events consisting of three large shocks occurred in Central Italy from August to October in 2016 with the duration of almost 2 months. The preliminary study on the seismic mechanism suggests that the sequence of events is the result from the activity of the SW dipping Mt Bove-Mt Vettore-Mt Gorzano normal fault system. For investigation and understanding of the coseismic faulting of the seismogenic fault alignment, we collect a set of comprehensive satellite observations including the Sentinel-1A, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 and GPS data to map the coseismic surface deformation and estimate the source models in this study. The derived faulting model for the first Amatrice event is characterized by two distinct slip asperities suggesting that it is a predominantly normal dip-slip motion with slight strike-slip component. The second event, Visso earthquake is almost a purely normal rupture. The third Norcia event is dominated by the normal dip-slip rupture of the seismogenic fault, and has propagated up to the ground with significant slip. The three faulting models are then utilized to quantify the Coulomb failure stress (CFS) change over the seismic zone. First, the CFS change on the subsequent two seismogenic faults of the earthquake sequence is estimated, and the derived positive CFS change induced by the preceding earthquakes suggests that the early events have positive effects on triggering the subsequent seismicity. We then explore the response relation of the aftershocks including 961 events with magnitudes larger than M3.0 to the CFS change over the seismic zone. It suggests that the rupture pattern of the aftershocks is similar to the major shocks with predominantly normal dip-slip. To assess the risk of the future seismic hazard, we analyse quantitatively the spatial distribution of aftershock occurrence and CFS transfer at the seismogenic depth, indicating that the ruptures of the three major shocks do partly release the accumulated strain on the associated fault alignment as well as the dense aftershock, but the CFS increase zone with few aftershocks in the southwest of the eastern Quaternary fault alignment of Central Italy poses the potential of further rupture. In particular, the distribution of aftershock migration also suggests that the north extension of the Mt Bove fault is the potential zone with rupture risk.

TI  - Prediction of Wheat Grain Protein by Coupling Multisource Remote Sensing Imagery and ECMWF Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Industrialization production with high quality and effect on winter is an important measure for accelerating the shift from increasing agricultural production to improving quality in terms of grain protein content (GPC). Remote sensing technology achieved the GPC prediction. However, large deviations in interannual expansion and regional transfer still exist. The present experiment was carried out in wheat producing areas of Beijing (BJ), Renqiu (RQ), Quzhou, and Jinzhou in Hebei Province. First, the spectral consistency of Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (LS8) and RapidEye (RE) was compared with Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites at the same ground point in the same period. The GPC prediction model was constructed by coupling the vegetation index with the meteorological data obtained by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts using hierarchical linear model (HLM) method. The prediction and spatial expansion of regional GPC were validated. Results were as follows: (1) Spectral information calculated from S2 imagery were highly consistent with LS8 (R-2 = 1.00) and RE (R-2 = 0.99) imagery, which could be jointly used for GPC modeling. (2) The predicted GPC by using the HLM method (R-2 = 0.524) demonstrated higher accuracy than the empirical linear model (R-2 = 0.286) and showed higher improvements across inter-annual and regional scales. (3) The GPC prediction results of the verification samples in RQ, BJ, Xiaotangshan (XTS) in 2018, and XTS in 2019 were ideal with root mean square errors of 0.61%, 1.13%, 0.91%, and 0.38%, and relative root mean square error of 4.11%, 6.83%, 6.41%, and 2.58%, respectively. This study has great application potential for regional and inter-annual quality prediction.

TI  - IVOA HiPS implementation in the framework of WorldWide Telescope
T2  - ASTRONOMY AND COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - The WorldWide Telescope(WWT) is a scientific visualization platform which can browse deep space images, star catalogs, and planetary remote sensing data from different observation facilities in a three-dimensional virtual scene. First launched and then open-sourced by Microsoft Research, the WWT is now managed by the American Astronomical Society (AAS). Hierarchical Progressive Survey (HiPS) is an astronomical data release scheme proposed by Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS) and has been accepted as a recommendation by International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). The HiPS solution has been adopted widely by many astronomical institutions for data release. Since WWT selected Hierarchical Triangular Mesh (HTM) as the standard for data visualization in the early stage of development, data released by HiPS cannot be visualized in WWT, which significantly limits the application of WWT. This paper introduces the implementation method for HiPS dataset visualization in WWT, and introduces HiPS data projection, mesh rendering, and data index implementation in WWT. Taking Chang'E-2 lunar probe data as an example, this paper introduces how to convert planetary remote sensing data into a HiPS dataset and integrate it into WWT. This paper also compares the efficiency and memory consumption of WWT loading its native data and HiPS data, and illustrates the application of HiPS in scientific data visualization and science education in WWT.

TI  - Estimating the spatial distribution of soil total nitrogen and available potassium in coastal wetland soils in the Yellow River Delta by incorporating multi-source data
T2  - ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Coastal wetland soils play a vital role in providing habitats for wildlife and vegetation, and in affecting water quality and primary production in coastal wetland ecosystem. The spatial prediction of soil properties provides important data support to help sustainable wetland management. This research explored the relationships between soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil available potassium (AK) and multiple environmental variables such as remote sensing spectral indices, geographic attributes and land use types of coastal wetlands in the Yellow River Delta (YRD). Soil moisture and geographic attributes were the major factors controlling the spatial distribution of soil TN. Soil salinity, vegetation and geographic attributes were the key factors affecting the spatial distribution of soil AK. The research established spatial prediction models of soil TN and AK by random forest method, and showed heterogeneous spatial patterns of TN and AK in the study area. Soil TN model showed relatively higher prediction performance compared with soil AK model. The research framework utilized in this study can be promoted to predict and map other soil properties, and has significant implication for the site-specific soil management of coastal wetlands in the YRD.

TI  - Using SPOT-7 for Nitrogen Fertilizer Management in Oil Palm
T2  - AGRICULTURE-BASEL
M3  - Article
AB  - Environmental concerns are growing about excessive applying nitrogen (N) fertilizers, especially in oil palm. Some conventional methods which are used to assess the amount of nutrient in oil palm are time-consuming, expensive, and involve frond destruction. Remote sensing as a non-destructive, affordable, and efficient method is widely used to detect the concentration of chlorophyll (Chl) from canopy plants using several vegetation indices (VIs) because there is an influential relation between the concentration of N in the leaves and canopy Chl content. The objectives of this research are to (i) evaluate and compare the performance of various vegetation indices (VIs) for measuring N status in oil palm canopy using SPOT-7 imagery (AIRBUS Defence & Space, Ottobrunn, Germany) to (ii) develop a regression formula that can predict the N content using satellite data to (iii) assess the regression formula performance on testing datasets by testing the coefficient of determination between the predicted and measured N contents. SPOT-7 was acquired in a 6-ha oil palm planted area in Pahang, Malaysia. To predict N content, 28 VIs based on the spectral range of SPOT-7 satellite images were evaluated. Several regression models were applied to determine the highest coefficient of determination between VIs and actual N content from leaf sampling. The modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) generated the highest coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.93). MTVI1 and triangular VI had the highest second and third coefficient of determination with N content (R-2 = 0.926 and 0.923, respectively). The classification accuracy assessment of the developed model was evaluated using several statistical parameters such as the independent t-test, and p-value. The accuracy assessment of the developed model was more than 77%.

TI  - Assessment of Agricultural Water Productivity in Arid China
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The water crisis has become increasingly serious, particularly in arid and semiarid areas. Agricultural water productivity (AWP) is an important indicator for evaluating water use efficiency and agricultural water management. This study uses water consumption derived from satellite data, combined with statistical survey information, to analyze the spatiotemporal variations and driving factors of AWP at the region and county scales over the past 15 years (2002-2015) in the Turpan region (China). The results showed the increasing change trends of AWP throughout Turpan and its three counties. A multiple regression analysis was applied to evaluate AWP, agricultural production and water consumption with driving factors. The contribution of agricultural factors (fertilizer amount, pesticide use and irrigation area) was 86.3% for change of production and 93.3% for change of water consumption in Turpan. The synchronous changes associated with the similar factor contributions resulted in a nonsignificant change in AWP for the whole region. However, the significant increase in AWP in Toksun County was caused by a weakened effect of synchronous changes due to the difference between the largest contributing factors (irrigation area for production at 29.3% and temperature for water consumption at 35.4%). The different change trends of the AWP at regional and county levels indicated that agricultural planting structure adjustment could be an effective way to improve water productivity. This paper provides objective and new information to understand the effects of AWP changes at regional and county scales, which is beneficial for irrigation agriculture development in Turpan.

TI  - A Hybrid SAR/ISAR Approach for Refocusing Maritime Moving Targets with the GF-3 SAR Satellite
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to self-motion and sea waves, moving ships are typically defocused in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images. To focus non-cooperative targets, the inverse SAR (ISAR) technique is commonly used with motion compensation. The hybrid SAR/ISAR approach allows a long coherent processing interval (CPI), in which SAR targets are processed with ISAR processing, and exploits the advantages of both SAR and ISAR to generate well-focused images of moving targets. In this paper, based on hybrid SAR/ISAR processing, we propose an improved rank-one phase estimation method (IROPE). By using an iterative two-step convergence approach in the IROPE, the proposed method achieves accurate phase error, maintains robustness to noise and performs well in estimating various phase errors. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed by comparing it with other focusing algorithms in terms of processing simulated data and real complex image data acquired by Gaofen-3 (GF-3) in spotlight mode. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TI  - Integrated geometric self-calibration of stereo cameras onboard the ZiYuan-3 satellite
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The geometric quality of images is a principal concern for a stereo mapping satellite. On-orbit geometric calibration (GC) is an essential processing step that is always performed to ensure the geometric accuracy of satellite images. However, the traditional GC method is typically expensive and inefficient due to a large dependence on ground-based locations. Although recent GC methods based on relative constraints between images can substantially reduce plane constraints, which are used as the benchmark measurements in the traditional method, there is a strong correlation between elevation and camera orientation that necessitates additional elevation constraints. This paper proposes an integrated GC method to compensate for systematic errors in the three linear cameras (TLC) of the ZiYuan-3 (ZY-3) satellite. The relative constraints and the stereo intersection constraints from two sets of overlapped TLC imagery pairs allow for the removal of dense plane constraints, as well as elimination of the GC dependencies from the additional elevation constraints. This paper also systematically analyzes the relationship between elevation error and camera GC accuracy, proposes a unified GC model for TLC cameras based on matrix decomposition, and develops a suitable global estimation method for the solution of GC parameters. The method was validated through experiments performed on the TLC images, and satisfactory results indicated that it effectively compensates for systematic errors by onboard stereo TLC cameras.

TI  - Sentinel-1 observation of 2019 M<sub>w</sub> 5.7 Acipayam earthquake: A blind normal-faulting event in the Acipayam basin, southwestern Turkey
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEODYNAMICS
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid disaster response will provide significant information to relevant responding agencies. On 20 March 2019, an Mw 5.7 earthquake struck the Acipayam basin in southwestern Turkey, which is the largest event to occur in the basin. Here, we use Sentinel-1A interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data to investigate the cosesimic deformation related to the Acipayam earthquake. The ascending and descending interforegrams suggest the normal faulting during this earthquake, with the maximum line of sight (LOS) displacements of 4.6 cm and 4.8 cm, respectively. The fault geometric parameters and a detailed coseismic distributed slip model of this event are retrieved by using geodetic data for the first time. Though the coseismic interferograms don't show enough polarity changes to ascertain the dip orientation of the rupture fault, we regard the northeast-dipping fault as the causative fault by a joint analysis of the residuals plots, 2.5 dimensional (2.5D) deformation field, field investigation results, regional geomorphic feature and overall distribution of aftershock (4.0< Mw< 4.9). The inversion results show that coseismic rupture was mainly dominated by normal faulting with minor sinistral strike-slip components. The rupture fault is a blind normal fault and the main slip is concentrated in the depth range of 3 similar to 9.5 km with a maximum slip of approximately 0.33 m at a depth of similar to 6 km. The InSAR-determined geodetic seismic moment is 3.96 x 10(17) Nm corresponding to Mw 5.7. Our model resolution test supports these interpretations for the Acipayam earthquake. Based on the coseismic Coulomb stress change, we find that this 2019 event increases the stress loading in the northwestern and southeastern segment of the rupture fault plane and possibly triggers the subsequent Mw 4.8 and Mw 4.9 earthquakes. The mechanism of the determined seismogenic fault may be helpful to evaluate seismic hazards and understand the evolution of the Acipayam basin.

TI  - Temporal and spatial trends in aerosols near the English Channel - An air quality success story?
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT-X
M3  - Article
AB  - We present a detailed analysis of long-term aerosol measurements from four sun photometer sites (from west to east: Plymouth, Chilbolton, Dunkirk, Oostende) and four Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs surface sites (from west to east: Plymouth, Southampton, Portsmouth, Eastbourne) near the English Channel. From the early 2000s to about 2016, annual mean Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) from all sun photometer sites decreased by an overall average of 23% decade(-1) (range of 15-28% decade(-1)). From 2010 to 2017, annual mean concentration of particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 mu m (PM2.5) from all the surface sites decreased by an overall average of 44% decade(-1) (range of 7-64% decade(-1)). Seasonally, the highest aerosol loading is generally found around the springtime, and this maximum has been decreasing much faster over recent years than during the other seasons. This is driven by the interaction between the seasonal weather patterns (e.g. reduced westerly flow and drier weather in the spring) and the main emission sources being predominantly from the European Continent. We find clear spatial gradients in the aerosol loading as well as aerosol composition. From west to east along the English Channel, PM2.5 concentration increases with a mean gradient of about 0.007 mu g m(-3) km(-1). At the westernmost site Plymouth, sea spray is estimated on average to account for 16% of the AOD and 13% of the particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 10 mu m (PM10). The importance of sea spray is reduced by at least a factor of two at the more eastern sites. The long-term decrease in aerosol loading along the English Channel appears to be more strongly driven by the reduced anthropogenic emissions, rather than by changes in the large-scale circulation such as the North Atlantic Oscillation. Clean ups in road vehicles and ship emissions, however, do not appear to be strong drivers for the long-term trends in aerosol loading at these coastal sites.

TI  - Assessing Drought Conditions in Cloudy Regions Using Reconstructed Land Surface Temperature
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) in a triangular or trapezoidal feature space can be calculated from the land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and has been widely applied to regional drought monitoring. However, thermal infrared sensors cannot penetrate clouds to detect surface information of sub-cloud pixels. In cloudy areas, LST data include a large number of cloudy pixels, seriously degrading the spatial and temporal continuity of drought monitoring. In this paper, the Remotely Sensed Daily Land Surface Temperature Reconstruction model (RSDAST) is combined with the LST reconstructed (RLST) by the RSDAST and applied to drought monitoring in a cloudy area. The drought monitoring capability of the reconstructed temperature vegetation drought index (RTVDI) under cloudy conditions is evaluated by comparing the correlation between land surface observations for soil moisture and the TVDI before and after surface temperature reconstruction. Results show that the effective duration and area of the RTVDI in the study area were larger than those of the original TVDI (OTVDI) in 2011. In addition, RLST/NDVI scatter plots cover a wide range of values, with the fitted dry-wet boundaries more representative of real soil moisture conditions. Under continuously cloudy conditions, the OTVDI inverted from the original LST (OLST) loses its drought monitoring capability, whereas RTVDI can completely and accurately reconstruct surface moisture conditions across the entire study area. The correlation between TVDI and soil moisture is stronger for RTVDI (R = -0.45) than that for OTVDI (R = -0.33). In terms of the spatial and temporal distributions, the R value for correlation between RTVDI and soil moisture was higher than that for OTVDI. Hence, in continuously cloudy areas, RTVDI not only expands drought monitoring capability in time and space, but also improves the accuracy of surface soil moisture monitoring and enhances the applicability and reliability of thermal infrared data under extreme conditions.

TI  - Evaluation of the Simard et al. 2011 Global Canopy Height Map in Boreal Forests
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) provides a state-of-the-art technique for measuring forest canopy height. Nevertheless, it may miss some forests due to its spatial separation of individual spots. A number of efforts have been made to overcome the limitation of global LiDAR datasets to generate wall-to-wall canopy height products, among which a global satellite product produced by Simard et al. (2011) (henceforth, the Simard-map) has been the most widely applied. However, the accuracy of the Simard-map is uncertain in boreal forests, which play important roles in the terrestrial carbon cycle and are encountering more extensive climate changes than the global average. In this letter, we evaluated the Simard-map in boreal forests through a literature review of field canopy height. Our comparison shows that the Simard-map yielded a significant correlation with the field canopy height (R-2 = 0.68 and p < 0.001). However, remarkable biases were observed with the root mean square error (RMSE), regression slope, and intercept of 6.88 m, 0.448, and 10.429, respectively. Interestingly, we found that the evaluation results showed an identical trend with a validation of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) tree-cover product (MOD44B) in boreal forests, which was used as a crucial input data set for generating the Simard-map. That is, both the Simard-map and MOD44B yielded an overestimation (underestimation) in the lower (upper) tails of the scatterplots between the field and satellite data sets. This indicates that the MOD44B product is the likely source of error for the estimation biases of the Simard-map. Finally, a field calibration was performed to improve the Simard-map in boreal forests by compensating for the estimation biases and discarding non-forest areas, which provided a more reliable canopy height product for future applications.

TI  - Temporal Validation of Four LAI Products over Grasslands in the Northeastern Tibetan Plateau
T2  - PHOTOGRAMMETRIC ENGINEERING AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Time series of leaf area index (LAI) products are now widely used, and the temporal validation is the prerequisite for their proper application. However, a systematical comparison between different products using both direct and indirect methods is still lacking. The objective of this paper is to assess and compare the temporal performances of four LAI products: Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectromdiometer (MODIS) LAI (MOD)15A2, MOD15A2h, Geoland2 Version 1 (GEOvi), and Global Land Surface Satellite (cLAss). The study area, which is dominated by gmsslands, is located in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau (Ti), and temperature is the main stress factor affecting grass growth. Both a correlation analysis with temperature and a direct comparison with temporally continuous LAI reference maps were implemented in our temporal validation experiments. The results show that no single product can capture the rapid change and the seasonal trend in LAI simultaneously, and the compositing period used in each product determines the quality of the corresponding LAI time series. The MOD15A2 and MOD15A2h products, which have short compositing windows (eight days), are suitable for detecting rapid change. A grazinginduced biomass decrease that occurred around day of year 205 in 2014 in our study area was clearly revealed in these two products. For the GEOV1 and GLASS products, which have compositing windows of 30 days and 1 year, respectively, the grazing date was shifted (GEovr) or even invisible (0ms.9). However, products with prolonged compositing windows may be more robust to observation noise, and the resulting products may be suitable for capturing the seasonal trend. This study highlights that the concurrent use of data from various sensors onboard different satellites, and the introduction of new generations of satellites (e.g., Gaofen-6), are two promising ways to further improve existing LAI time series.

TI  - Scale Impact of Soil Moisture Observations to Noah-MP Land Surface Model Simulations
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Due to the limitations of satellite antenna technology, current operational microwave soil moisture (SM) data products are typically at tens of kilometers spatial resolutions. Many approaches have thus been proposed to generate finer resolution SM data using ancillary information, but it is still unknown if assimilation of the finer spatial resolution SM data has beneficial impacts on model skills. In this paper, a synthetic experiment is thus conducted to identify the benefits of SM observations at a finer spatial resolution on the Noah-MP land surface model. Results of this study show that the performance of the Noah-MP model is significantly improved with the benefits of assimilating 1 km SM observations in comparison with the assimilation of SM data at coarser resolutions. Downscaling satellite microwave SM observations from coarse spatial resolution to 1 km resolution is recommended, and the assimilation of 1 km remotely sensed SM retrievals is suggested for NOAA National Weather Service and National Water Center.

TI  - The potential of integrating landscape, geochemical and economical indices to analyze watershed ecological environment
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - A river watershed is a complex ecosystem, and its spatial structure and temporal dynamics are driven by various natural factors such as soil properties and topographic features, human activities, and their interactions. In this study, we explored the characteristics of the ecosystem and environment of watershed by analyzing and modeling the relationships among socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape metrics. Landsat 8 data were used to generate a land cover classification map and to derive landscape pattern indices. Governmental finance statistics yearbook data were referred to provide socio-economic indices. Moreover, 9 samples were collected from the upstream to the downstream to obtain the values of heavy metal concentrations in the water body. Then, both correlation and regression analyses were applied to analyze and model the relationships among these indices. The results of this study showed that 1) The ecological status and process (social economy, land cover, water and soil pollution) of this river watershed could be explained by analyzing the relationships among the socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape pattern indices selected based on correlation analysis; 2) The accumulated socio-economic indices were significantly correlated with Al, Fe and Ni and should be applied to the integrated assessment of the watershed ecological environment; 3) Cu, Zn and Pb were the main elements that showed significant correlations with the forest land; 4) Some landscape patterns indices such as Total Area (TA) and Effective Mesh Size (MESH) could be used to the integrated assessment of the watershed characteristics because of their strong correlations with the area (or area percentage) of important landscape types; and 5) transportation land had a close relationship with per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This study implied that analyzing and modeling the relationships among the socio-economic indices, heavy metal elements and landscape pattern indices can provide a powerful tool for characterizing the ecosystem of the river watershed and useful guidelines for the watershed management and sustainable development.

TI  - Evaluating the Potential of WorldView-3 Data to Classify Different Shoot Damage Ratios of <i>Pinus yunnanensis</i>
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tomicus yunnanensis Kirkendall and Faccoli and Tomicus minor Hartig have caused serious shoot damage in Yunnan pine (Pinus yunnanensis Faranch) forests in the Yunnan province of China. However, very few remote sensing studies have been conducted to detect the different shoot damage ratios of individual trees. The aim of the study was to evaluate the suitability of eight-band WorldView-3 satellite image for detecting different shoot damage ratios (e.g., "healthy", "slightly", "moderately", and "severely"). An object-based supervised classification method was used in this study. The tree crowns were delineated on a 0.3 m pan-sharpened worldview-3 image as reference data. Besides the original eight bands, normalized two-band indices were derived as spectral variables. For classifying individual trees, three classifiers-multinomial logistic regression (MLR), a stepwise linear discriminant analysis (SDA), and random forest (RF)-were evaluated and compared in this study. Results showed that SDA classifier based on all spectral variables had the highest classification accuracy (78.33%, Kappa = 0.712). Compared to original eight bands of Worldview-3, normalized two-band indices could improve the overall accuracy. Furthermore, the shoot damage ratio was a good indicator for detecting different levels of individual damaged trees. We concluded that the Worldview-3 satellite data were suitable to classify different levels of damaged trees; therefore, the best mapping results of damaged trees was predicted based on the best classification model which is very useful for forest managers to take the appropriate measures to decrease shoot beetle damage in Yunnan pine forests.

TI  - Remote Sensing of <i>Potamogeton crispus</i> L. in Dongping Lake in the North China Plain Based on Vegetation Phenology
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Curly-leaf pondweed (Potamogeton crispus L.) is a perennial, submerged plant native to Eurasia, Africa, and Australia that tolerates fresh or slightly brackish water. The pondweed has been found widely in many lakes in northern China. The Dongping Lake is a typical shallow macrophytic lake in north China, and it is an important junction at the East Route Project of China's South-to-North Water Diversion Project (ERP-CSNWDP). In mid-summer, the pondweed die-offs result in a critical loss of dissolved oxygen and decaying plants can result in Dongping Lake eutrophication, blocked waterway, and fish kills. In order to maintain the environment security of the ERP-CSNWDP, there is an urgent need to understand the spatial and temporal changes of pondweed's rapid range expansion in Dongping Lake. We employed moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer, normalized difference vegetation index data, and field investigations to extract its phenological characteristic. Landsat images from pondweed blooming and decay phases were acquired for eight representative growth stage years during the period of 1985-2017 to extract pondweed distribution. Through the validation, there was an accuracy of more than 89% for pondweed extraction in 2017. Then, we used a dimidiate pixel model to calculate its fractional green vegetation coverage (FVC). The results illustrated that its range expanded continuously during the 32-year study period. Its habitat changed from the scattered near shore distribution in 1985 to the contiguous coverage of large areas of the lake surface in 2017. The range expansion of pondweed was grouped into three stages. From 1985 to 1996, it had a slow growth stage with a maximum species range of 10.34 km(2) in Dongping Lake. During the period of 1996-2001, there was an explosive growth stage during which it become the dominant species in the Lake. From 2001 to 2017, the range continued to increase to 49.07 km(2), which comprised 40% of the surface area of the Lake. By spearman rank correlation analysis, we found that there was a significant correlation between pondweed area and the lake eutrophication level (R = 0.79, P < 0.05). The FVC spatial pattern after 2001 exhibited a gradual horizontal decrease from the southeast to the northwest of Dongping Lake. This study illustrates the application of vegetation phenology to assess the spatial and temporal pattern of pondweed. The opening of the ERP-CSNWDP is diverting a fraction of the total flow of the Yangtze River to Northern China via the Dongping Lake and presents an ongoing environmental security risk which will require future pondweed invasive species control and mitigation strategies utilizing ground and satellite-based spectrum observations.

TI  - Stability Assessment of OCO-2 Radiometric Calibration Using Aqua MODIS as a Reference
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - With three imaging grating spectrometers, the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) measures high spectral resolution spectra (lambda/Delta lambda approximate to 19,000) of reflected solar radiation within the molecular oxygen (O-2) A-band at 0.765 mu m and two carbon dioxide (CO2) bands at 1.61 and 2.06 mu m. OCO-2 uses onboard lamps with a reflective diffuser, solar observations through a transmissive diffuser, lunar measurements, and surface targets for radiometric calibration and validation. Separating calibrator aging from instrument degradation poses a challenge to OCO-2. Here we present a methodology for trending the OCO-2 Build 8R radiometric calibration using OCO-2 nadir observations over eight desert sites and nearly simultaneous observations from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) with sensor viewing zenith angles of 15 +/- 0.5 degrees. For the O-2 A-band, this methodology is able to quantify a drift of -0.8 +/- 0.1% per year and capture a small error in correcting the aging of the solar calibrator. For the other two OCO-2 bands, no measurable changes were seen, indicating less than 0.1% and less than 0.3% per year drift in the radiometric calibration of Band 2 and Band 3, respectively.

AB  - As a means of copyright protection for multimedia data, digital watermarking technology has attracted more and more attention in various research fields. Researchers have begun to explore the feasibility of applying it to remote sensing data recently. Because of the particularity of remote sensing image, higher requirements are put forward for its security and management, especially for the copyright protection, illegal use and authenticity identification of remote sensing image data. Therefore, this paper proposes to use image watermarking technology to achieve comprehensive security protection of remote sensing image data, while the use of cryptography technology increases the applicability and security of watermarking technology. The experimental results show that the scheme of remote sensing image digital watermarking technology has good performance in the imperceptibility and robustness of watermarking.

TI  - Integrated InSAR and strain tensor to estimate three-dimensional coseismic displacements associated with the 2016 <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> 7.0 Kumamoto earthquake
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - The three-dimensional (3D) surface displacements associated with different geohazard phenomenon derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images significantly improve our ability to understand their formation mechanisms and assess the potential disaster risk. At present, the most common approach for 3D coseismic deformation field derived from SAR images is using the Weighted Least Squares (WLS) method to resolve the 3D components based on more than three observations at each pixel point. However, this approach will be no constraints on the spatial correlation between the adjacent pixel points. Therefore, a new approach, i. e., the Extended Simultaneous and Integrated Strain Tensor Estimation from geodetic and satellite deformation Measurements (ESISTEM), has been proposed to reveal the 3D coseismic displacement by adding a constraint equation of stress continuity between the adjacent pixel points. In this study, we collect both the ascending and descending ALOS-2 images for the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake sequence, and then generate the displacement both in line of sight (LOS) and azimuth direction by using the traditional differential InSAR (DInSAR) method and the Multiple Aperture InSAR (MAI) method, respectively. After that, we utilize the ESISTEM method to recover 3D coseismic deformation field for this event. In addition, we verify the uncertainty of the 3D displacements with GPS and field work observations, respectively. In compare to the traditional WLS approach, our results show the ESISTEM approach can not only effectively reduce the disturbance of singular displacement, and recover the displacement in incoherence region, which is helpful to the coseismic 3D displacement characteristics analyzed. Our final 3D displacement map demonstrates that the main deformation zone occurs in the central section of the Futagawa fault and the northernmost part of the Hinagu fault, and the maximum horizontal and uplift displacement are 2 m and 0.55 m, respectively. The subsurface rupture is dominated by NE-SW-trending dextral strike-slip with minor normal-slip component. The strain tensor indicates that the seismic area sustains an obvious contraction and shear forces.

TI  - Increase in Mangrove Area on the North Coast of Central Java Analyzed Using Geospatial Based Approach
T2  - Annals of Biology (Hissar)
M3  - Article
AB  - Mangrove community has essential benefits to human-beings and other living creatures since it has physical, biological, social and economic functions. Now-a-days, the mangrove area tends to decrease due to land conversion by anthropogenic activities. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the extent of mangrove land on the north coast of Central Java, based on the geospatial analysis approach using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. The results of the measurement of the mangroves community area on the north shore of Central Java in 2014 showed an increase of 2,922.76 ha or 118.89% for three years. A significant increase was due to the absence of detection of mangrove areas in embankment ponds by previous studies. Also, it was due to increasing mangrove vegetation rehabilitation activities on the north coast of Central Java, as well as the natural mangrove development of secondary succession over three years (from 2011-14). The field survey encountered 22 mangrove species growing on the north coast of Central Java, where Avicennia marina and Rhizophora mucronata dominated all research sites. Based on the rejuvenation category, the mangrove sapling category dominated Brebes Regency, Kendal Regency having the highest density of seedling mangrove, and the tree mangrove category met plentiful in Rembang Regency.

TI  - Understanding Fields by Remote Sensing: Soil Zoning and Property Mapping
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Precision agriculture aims to optimize field management to increase agronomic yield, reduce environmental impact, and potentially foster soil carbon sequestration. In 2015, the Copernicus mission, with Sentinel-1 and -2, opened a new era by providing freely available high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data. Since then, many studies have been conducted to understand, monitor and improve agricultural systems. This paper presents results from the SolumScire project, focusing on the prediction of the spatial distribution of soil zones and topsoil properties, such as pH, soil organic matter (SOM) and clay content in agricultural fields through random forest algorithms. For this purpose, samples from 120 fields were investigated. The zoning and soil property prediction has an accuracy greater than 90%. This is supported by a high agreement of the derived zones with farmer's observations. The trained models revealed a prediction accuracy of 94%, 89% and 96% for pH, SOM and clay content, respectively. The obtained models for soil properties can support precision field management, the improvement of soil sampling and fertilization strategies, and eventually the management of soil properties such as SOM.

TI  - Green contents in English language textbooks in Pakistan: An ecolinguistic and ecopedagogical appraisal
T2  - BRITISH EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - The belief that English language teaching (ELT), for its global scope, should not only focus on furnishing learners' language skills but also on raising their awareness about critical global issues, like environmental crises, led to the 'greening' of ELT textbooks. However, the ecopedagogical import of the green contents in ELT textbooks has a bearing on the linguistic/discursive representation of nature and the human-nature relationship in them as it conditions the way we humans perceive and treat the natural environment. Ecolinguistics, an emerging paradigm in linguistic research, offers the premise to analyse the construction of ecology in texts. This study conducted an ecolinguistic and ecopedagogical appraisal of the environmental texts in English language textbooks used in Pakistani schools at primary level, adapting Gaard's ecopedagogical framework for children's texts and Halliday's transitivity analysis model. The study found that the construction of nature and the human-nature relationship in the selected textbooks principally propagated an anthropocentric worldview, thus lacking in ecopedagogical import.

TI  - River discharge estimation from radar altimetry: Assessment of satellite performance, river scales and methods
T2  - JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - The ENVISAT, Jason-2 and -3, Sentinel-3A, CryoSat-2, and AltiKa satellite altimeters were used to estimate the discharge of two Arctic rivers: the Ob and Pur in western Siberia. The accuracy of the water height estimates from ENVISAT varied with river size from 0.63 m for the Ob (similar to 2 km in width) to 1.1 m for the Pur (similar to 0.5 km in width). A new method for water level estimation combining the CryoSat-2, AltiKa, and Sentinel-3A altimeters provided better height accuracy (0.49 m for the Ob). The rating curve method of discharge estimation outperforms the Manning formulation, on the Ob, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 13% vs 20% for daily discharge and 1% vs 5% for annual discharge. Sensitivity analysis performed on the Manning formulation showed high sensitivity to the river depth parameterisation. A functional relationship was identified between the depth of rivers, in the north of western Siberia, and their widths and deposits types. The combination, for the Ob, of the rating curve method with the multi-satellite water level retrieval algorithm provided higher discharge accuracy than previous studies relying on satellite measurements, on numerical modelling or on their combination. A synthesis of worldwide river altimetry studies supported our finding that the accuracy of altimetric discharge estimations decreases for narrower rivers. The rating curve method applied to Jason 2/3 height measurements allows estimation of daily discharges with RMSE of 18% for the wide Ob River but 38% for the narrow Pur River.

TI  - A satellite system for monitoring the radiation budget at the Baltic Sea surface
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper discusses the possibilities and limitations of using satellite data to determine the radiation budget NET and its components at the Baltic Sea surface in near real time using a newly established SBRB system (SatBaltyk Radiation Budget). The system enables determination of daily radiation fluxes over the entire Baltic Sea employing data from satellites in combination with data from numerical prognostic models. Data from satellite radiometers like SEVIRI, AVHRR are used together with algorithms that take into account the specificity of this sea and are developed based on large empirical data sets collected in this region. A verification of the system has been carried out based on separate, empirical data collected in 2015 on the oil rig Plat placed on the Baltic Sea and Svenska Hogarna station. The analysis showed that daily average NET had been calculated with RMSD of 15 Wm(-2) and R-2 = 0.95 for the South Baltic. For downward radiation fluxes in the solar wavelength range (SW) and the terrestrial, thermal wavelength range (LW) RMSD is respectively 11.9 Wm(-2) and 9.6 Wm(-2) and in both cases increase with latitude. The NET components estimated using SBRB were also compared with the corresponding magnitudes OSI -303-a and OSI 304-a from OSI SAF, EBAF surface Edition 4.0 from CERES and ERA-interim data from ECMWF systems. The main reasons for the discrepancies are discussed. The analyses confirmed the advisability of using local solutions which ensure high accuracy and spatial resolution.SBRB was developed and implemented as part of the comprehensive SatBaltyk System designed to monitor the Baltic Sea environment. The maps together with instantaneous values of the radiation components measured at actinometric stations employed at SatBaltyk System are accessible at www.satbaltyk.iopan.gda.pl. The scheme, algorithms and the way of the SBRB operation are described in detail.

TI  - Using forest historical information to target landscape ecological restoration in Southwestern Patagonia
T2  - AMBIO
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecotonal zones between eastern semi-arid steppes and Nothofagus spp. forests in western Patagonia are the result of broad ecosystem changes, which have intensified in the last 140 years. Our objectives were to determine historical changes in land use, land cover, and forces driving such changes in Nothofagus ecosystems in the Rio Verde district in southern Chile, to support future management recommendations. This interdisciplinary study used historical records including scientific and military expeditions, Landsat imagery, and other archival sources. Forest cover changed radically between the late nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries, from subsistence use by indigenous peoples, to forestry and livestock industries. The main driving forces of landscape change have been anthropogenic forest fires, logging, exotic pasture establishment, and mining. Future perspectives suggest that conserving the cultural values and natural resources of this region will depend on ecologically sound landscape planning, reversing forest fragmentation, restoring riparian corridors, and preserving indigenous archaeological sites.

TI  - Does the mortality salience effect on worldview defence depend on the cultural orientation of Chinese people?
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - According to the terror management theory, people tend to favour their worldview and in-group members after being reminded of death (i.e., mortality salience [MS] effect). However, inconsistent findings of the MS effect were found among Chinese people. In the present study, we examined the MS effect with Chinese samples and tested whether the effect would depend on participants' cultural orientation and relational self-esteem. In Studies 1 (N = 227) and 2 (N = 221), we examined the roles of participants' cultural orientations and relational self-esteem in their evaluations on moral transgression and/or perceived regard from people around after being primed with mortality (vs. dental pain) salience. We obtained the interaction effects of mortality salience, cultural orientations, and relational self-esteem. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of Chinese culture.

TI  - A Radiative Transfer Model for Patchy Landscapes Based on Stochastic Radiative Transfer Theory
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The availability of global high-resolution land cover maps provides promising a priori knowledge for characterizing subpixel heterogeneity and improving predictions of directional reflectance of coarse-resolution pixels. Due to mutual shadowing and sheltering effects between the adjacent forest and cropland patches, the spectral nonlinear mixing of patchy ecotones is significant, especially when the sun illuminates the ecotone from the forest side with high solar zenith angle. The spectral linear mixture (SLM) approach leads to overestimation of the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) in the red band in the principal plane (PP), with a maximum absolute error (MAE) of 0.0063 and a maximum relative error (MRE) of 52.5%, and to underestimation in the near-infrared band in PP with an MAE of 0.0940 and an MRE of 14.5%. In a scenario with randomly distributed boundary orientations, the overestimation of SLM increases with the degree of fragmentation and the view zenith angle. We propose a Radiative Transfer model for patchy ECotones (RTEC). which improves R-2 from 0.61 to 0.94 in the red band of Landsat-8 directional reflectance at the validation site. The RTEC model provides an efficient and analytical approach for directional reflectance predictions over heterogeneous patchy landscapes at coarse resolution and will be used for biophysical parameter retrievals [e.g., the leaf area index (LAI)] in future applications.

TI  - Effect of Textural Features in Remote Sensed Data on Rubber Plantation Extraction at Different Levels of Spatial Resolution
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The expansion of rubber (Hevea brasiliensis) plantations has been a critical driver for the rapid transformation of tropical forests, especially in Thailand. Rubber plantation mapping provides basic information for surveying resources, updating forest subplot information, logging, and managing the forest. However, due to the diversity of stand structure, complexity of the forest growth environment, and the similarity of spectral characteristics between rubber trees and natural forests, it is difficult to discriminate rubber plantation from natural forest using only spectral information. This study evaluated the validity of textural features for rubber plantation recognition at different spatial resolutions using GaoFen-1 (GF-1), Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 optical data. C-band Sentinel-1 10 m imagery was first used to map forests (including both rubber plantations and natural forests) and non-forests, then the pixels identified as forests in the Sentinel-1 imagery were compared with GF-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 images to separate rubber plantations and natural forest using two different approaches: a method based on spectral information characteristics only and a method combining spectral and textural features. In addition, we extracted textural features of different window sizes (3 x 3 to 31 x 31) and analyzed the influence of window size on the separability of rubber plantations and natural forests. Our major findings include: (1) the suitable texture extraction window sizes of GF-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 are 31 x 31, 11 x 11 to 15 x 15, and 3 x 3 to 7 x 7, respectively; (2) correlation (COR) is a robust textural feature in remote sensing images with different resolutions; and (3) compared with classification by spectral information only, the producer's accuracy of rubber plantations based on GF-1, Sentinel-2, and Landsat 8 was improved by 8.04%, 9.44%, and 8.74%, respectively, and the user's accuracy was increased by 4.63%, 4.54%, and 6.75%, respectively, when the textural features were introduced. These results demonstrate that the method combining textural features has great potential in delineating rubber plantations.

TI  - Land Cover Change in the Central Region of the Lower Yangtze River Based on Landsat Imagery and the Google Earth Engine: A Case Study in Nanjing, China
T2  - SENSORS
M3  - Article
AB  - Urbanization in China is progressing rapidly and continuously, especially in the newly developed metropolitan areas. The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a powerful tool that can be used to efficiently investigate these changes using a large repository of available optical imagery. This work examined land-cover changes in the central region of the lower Yangtze River and exemplifies the application of GEE using the random forest classification algorithm on Landsat dense stacks spanning the 30 years from 1987 to 2017. Based on the obtained time-series land-cover classification results, the spatiotemporal land-use/cover changes were analyzed, as well as the main factors driving the changes in different land-cover categories. The results show that: (1) The obtained land datasets were reliable and highly accurate, with an overall accuracy ranging from 88% to 92%. (2) Over the past 30 years, built-up areas have continued to expand, increasing from 537.9 km(2) to 1500.5 km(2), and the total area occupied by built-up regions has expanded by 178.9% to occupy an additional 962.7 km(2). The surface water area first decreased, then increased, and generally showed an increasing trend, expanding by 17.9%, with an area increase of approximately 131 km(2). Barren areas accounted for 6.6% of the total area in the period 2015-2017, which was an increase of 94.8% relative to the period 1987-1989. The expansion of the built-up area was accompanied by an overall 25.6% (1305.7 km(2)) reduction in vegetation. (3) The complexity of the key factors driving the changes in the regional surface water extent was made apparent, mainly including the changes in runoff of the Yangtze River and the construction of various water conservancy projects. The effects of increasing the urban population and expanding industrial development were the main factors driving the expansion of urban built-up areas and the significant reduction in vegetation. The advantages and limitations arising from land-cover mapping by using the Google Earth Engine are also discussed.

TI  - Incidence of Serious Infections and Design of Utilization and Safety Studies for Biologic and Biosimilar Surveillance
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGED CARE & SPECIALTY PHARMACY
M3  - Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a need for postmarketing evidence generation for novel biologics and biosimilars.OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility, strengths, and limitations of the Biologics and Biosimilars Collective Intelligence Consortium (BBCIC) Distributed Research Network (DRN) to examine the utilization and comparative safety of immune-modulating agents among patients with autoimmune diseases.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study among patients enrolled in health insurance plans participating in the BBCIC DRN between January 1, 2006, and September 30, 2015. Eligible patients were adult (>= 18 years) new users of a disease-modifying nonbiologic and/or biologic agent with a prior diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), other inflammatory conditions (psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis), or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Follow-up started at treatment initiation and ended at the earliest of outcome occurrence (serious infection); treatment discontinuation; or switching, death, disenrollment, or end of study period. The study leveraged the FDA Sentinel System infrastructure for data management and analysis; descriptive statistics of patient characteristics and unadjusted incidence rates of study outcomes during follow-up were calculated.RESULTS: Eligible patient drug episodes included 111,611 with RA (75% female), 61,050 with other inflammatory conditions (51% female), and 30,628 with IBD (52% female). Across all 3 cohorts, approximately half of the patient drug episodes initiated a biologic (50% in RA; 60% in psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis; and 55% in IBD). The crude incidence rate of serious infection was 9.8 (9.5-10.0) cases per 100 person-years in RA, 7.1 (6.8-7.5) in other inflammatory conditions, and 14.2 (13.6-14.8) in IBD patients.CONCLUSIONS: This study successfully identified large numbers of new users of biologics and produced results that were consistent with those from earlier published studies. The BBCIC DRN is a potential resource for surveillance of biologics.

TI  - Validation of AIRS temperature and ozone profiles over Antarctica
T2  - CHINESE JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICS-CHINESE EDITION
M3  - Article
AB  - Using the temperature and ozone sounding data from Zhongshan Station, Amundesen-Scott Station (SouthPole) and Neumayer Station in 2008 for one year, the accuracy of the sixth version of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) temperature and ozone vertical profile products was verified in Antarctica. The results show that the AIRS temperature and the sounding temperature have significant consistency in general. The tropospheric deviation is the smallest (RMSe<2 degrees C), but the near-surface temperature bias is slightly higher due to the influence of the underlying surface (RMSe similar to 2 degrees C). The stratospheric deviation is larger (2 degrees C<RMSe<3 degrees C). The average temperature of AIRS is lower than the sounding observation and has obviously seasonal variation. The deviations in autumn and winter are generally higher than that in spring and summer. The accuracy of AIRS ozone inversion in the stratosphere (RMSe similar to 5%) is better than that in the troposphere (RMSe similar to 30%). The maximum value of RMSe appears in the UT-LS region (up to 40%) and increases significantly during the "ozone hole" periods. The accuracy of AIRS products varies between the Antarctic coast and the inland. As there is few sounding experiments in the Antarctic area and it is mainly located along the coast, conducting sounding observations in the Antarctic inland area is of great significance to improve the accuracy of satellite data and improve the weather forecast capabilities of the region.

TI  - Watershed Segmentation Algorithm Based on Luv Color Space Region Merging for Extracting Slope Hazard Boundaries
T2  - ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION
M3  - Article
AB  - To accurately identify slope hazards based on high-resolution remote sensing imagery, an improved watershed segmentation algorithm is proposed. The color difference of the Luv color space was used as the regional similarity measure for region merging. Furthermore, the area relative error for evaluating the image segmentation accuracy was improved and supplemented with the pixel quantity error to evaluate the segmentation accuracy. An unstable slope was identified to validate the algorithm on Chinese Gaofen-2 (GF-2) remote sensing imagery by a multiscale segmentation extraction experiment. The results show the following: (1) the optimal segmentation and merging scale parameters were, respectively, minimum threshold constant C for minimum area Amin of 500 and optimal threshold D for a color difference of 400. (2) The total processing time for segmentation and merging of unstable slopes was 39.702 s, much lower than the maximum likelihood classification method and a little more than the object-oriented classification method. The relative error of the slope hazard area was 4.92% and the pixel quantity error was 1.60%, which were superior to the two classification methods. (3) The evaluation criteria of segmentation accuracy were consistent with the results of visual interpretation and the confusion matrix, indicating that the criteria established in this study are reliable. By comparing the time efficiency, visual effect and classification accuracies, the proposed method has a good comprehensive extraction effect. It can provide a technical reference for promoting the rapid extraction of slope hazards based on remote sensing imagery. Meanwhile, it also provides a theoretical and practical experience reference for improving the watershed segmentation algorithm.

TI  - Thick cloud and cloud shadow removal in multitemporal imagery using progressively spatio-temporal patch group deep learning
T2  - ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Thick cloud and its shadow severely reduce the data usability of optical satellite remote sensing data. Although many approaches have been presented for cloud and cloud shadow removal, most of these approaches are still inadequate in terms of dealing with the following three issues: (1) thick cloud cover with large-scale areas, (2) all the temporal images included cloud or shadow, and (3) deficient utilization of only single temporal images. A novel spatio-temporal patch group deep learning framework for gap-filling through multiple temporal cloudy images is proposed to overcome these issues. The global-local loss function is presented to optimize the training model through cloud-covered and free regions, considering both the global consistency and local particularity. In addition, weighted aggregation and progressive iteration are utilized for reconstructing the holistic results. A series of simulated and real experiments are then performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Especially on Sentinel-2 MSI and Landsat-8 OLI with single/multitemporal images, under small/large scale regions, respectively.

TI  - Evaluating impacts of snow, surface water, soil and vegetation on empirical vegetation and snow indices for the Utqiagvik tundra ecosystem in Alaska with the LVS3 model
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite observations for the Arctic and boreal region may contain information of vegetation, soil, snow, snowmelt, and/or other surface water bodies. We investigated the impacts of vegetation, soil, snow and surface water on empirical vegetation/snow indices on a tundra ecosystem area located around Utqiagvik (formerly Barrow) of Alaska with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) images in 2001-2014. Empirical vegetation indices, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), the index of near infrared of vegetation (NIRv), and modified EVI (EVI2), have been used to monitor vegetation. Normalized difference snow index (NDSI) has been widely applied to monitor snow. The vegetation cover fraction (VGCF), the soil cover fraction (SOILCF), the snow cover fraction (SNOWCF), the surface water body cover fraction (WaterBodyCF), the fractional absorption of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) by vegetation chlorophyll (fAPAR(chl)), the fractional absorption of PAR by non-chlorophyll components of the vegetation (fAPAR(non-chl)), and the fractional absorption of PAR by the entire canopy (fAPAR(canopy)) are retrieved with the MODIS images and a coupled Leaf-Vegetation-Soil-Snow-Surface water body radiative transfer model, LVS3. The vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, EVI2 and NIRv) differ from VGCF, fAPAR(chl), fAPAR(non-chl), and fAPAR(canopy). In addition to vegetation, we find that soil, snow and surface water also have impacts on vegetation indices NDVI, EVI (EVI2), and NIRv. Presence of snow makes lower the observed values of NDVI, EVI2 and NIRv. After snowmelt is gone, the vegetation indices (NDVI, EVI, EVI2 and NIRv) linearly decrease with SOILCF and WaterBodyCF, and WaterBodyCF has stronger impacts on these vegetation indices than SOILCF. The relationship between EVI and snow is complicated. NDSI non-linearly increases with SNOWCF, but linearly increases with sum of SNOWCF and WaterBodyCF (sum = 0.5893 x NDSI +0.4342, R-2 = 0.976). NDSI linearly decreases with VGCF, and the relationship between NDSI and SOILCF is complex. Retrievals of VGCF, fAPAR(chl), fAPAR(non-chl) and fAPAR(canopy) with the LVS3 model provide alternatives for vegetation monitoring and ecological modeling.

TI  - An Empirical Algorithm for Retrieving Land Surface Temperature From AMSR-E Data Considering the Comprehensive Effects of Environmental Variables
T2  - EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Microwave (MW) remote sensing has the potential to obtain all-weather land surface temperature (LST) and serves as a complement to the thermal-infrared (TIR) LST under cloudy sky conditions. However, the accuracy of MW LST is generally lower than that of TIR LST, making the retrieval of highly accurate all-weather LST a challenging task. We propose an empirical algorithm for retrieving LST from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) brightness temperature (BT) data. First, we constructed a comprehensive classification system of environmental variables (CCSEV), allowing for the influence of topography, land cover, solar radiation, and atmospheric condition on the spatiotemporal distribution of LST, then the LST was expressed as a function of the combination of different AMSR-E channels for each CCSEV class. When performing the testing with the data from 2005, 2009 and 2011, the accuracy is 3.27 K, 2.65 K and 3.48 K in the daytime and 2.94 K, 2.63 K, 2.15 K at nighttime, respectively. The proposed algorithm was compared to an existing algorithm developed for China without considering the topography. The result shows that the accuracy of LST has improved by 2.81 K in the daytime and 2.14 K at nighttime in China, compared with the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST. The verification at the Naqu sites in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau shows that the accuracy has improved by 1-2 K in the daytime and 0.7-1 K at nighttime. These results indicate that the developed algorithm is universal and accurate and benefits the retrieval of accurate all-weather LST.

TI  - Long-Term Spatiotemporal Variation and Environmental Driving Forces Analyses of Algal Blooms in Taihu Lake Based on Multi-Source Satellite and Land Observations
T2  - WATER
M3  - Article
AB  - The algal blooms caused by the eutrophication of lakes is a major environmental problem. In this study, we took China's Taihu Lake as the research area, using multi-source satellite imagery data to monitor the information of algal blooms from 2008 to 2017. Following the analyses of the temporal and spatial variation trends of the blooms, water quality and meteorological data from land observation stations were employed to investigate the main environmental driving forces of the algal bloom outbreaks. The results show that, over the decade, the blooms with medium and higher hazard degrees mainly occurred in summer and autumn, and especially in autumn. From 2008 to 2016, the algal blooms outbreak degree was relatively stable, but, in 2017, it was severe, and the Northwest Lake area and the northern bays had heavier blooms than the other lake areas. From the analyses of the environmental driving forces, the variation trend of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) concentrations in Taihu Lake from 2008 to 2017 was moderate, and the minimum concentrations of TN and TP both exceeded the threshold for algal bloom outbreaks. It was also found that the algal bloom area had notable correlations with the sunshine duration, wind speed and direction, precipitation, and air pressure. The research results of this paper will provide a theoretical basis for the scientific prediction of the occurrence of algal blooms in Taihu Lake.

TI  - Transferability of the Deep Learning Mask R-CNN Model for Automated Mapping of Ice-Wedge Polygons in High-Resolution Satellite and UAV Images
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - State-of-the-art deep learning technology has been successfully applied to relatively small selected areas of very high spatial resolution (0.15 and 0.25 m) optical aerial imagery acquired by a fixed-wing aircraft to automatically characterize ice-wedge polygons (IWPs) in the Arctic tundra. However, any mapping of IWPs at regional to continental scales requires images acquired on different sensor platforms (particularly satellite) and a refined understanding of the performance stability of the method across sensor platforms through reliable evaluation assessments. In this study, we examined the transferability of a deep learning Mask Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) model for mapping IWPs in satellite remote sensing imagery (similar to 0.5 m) covering 272 km(2) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (0.02 m) imagery covering 0.32 km(2). Multi-spectral images were obtained from the WorldView-2 satellite sensor and pan-sharpened to similar to 0.5 m, and a 20 mp CMOS sensor camera onboard a UAV, respectively. The training dataset included 25,489 and 6022 manually delineated IWPs from satellite and fixed-wing aircraft aerial imagery near the Arctic Coastal Plain, northern Alaska. Quantitative assessments showed that individual IWPs were correctly detected at up to 72% and 70%, and delineated at up to 73% and 68% F1 score accuracy levels for satellite and UAV images, respectively. Expert-based qualitative assessments showed that IWPs were correctly detected at good (40-60%) and excellent (80-100%) accuracy levels for satellite and UAV images, respectively, and delineated at excellent (80-100%) level for both images. We found that (1) regardless of spatial resolution and spectral bands, the deep learning Mask R-CNN model effectively mapped IWPs in both remote sensing satellite and UAV images; (2) the model achieved a better accuracy in detection with finer image resolution, such as UAV imagery, yet a better accuracy in delineation with coarser image resolution, such as satellite imagery; (3) increasing the number of training data with different resolutions between the training and actual application imagery does not necessarily result in better performance of the Mask R-CNN in IWPs mapping; (4) and overall, the model underestimates the total number of IWPs particularly in terms of disjoint/incomplete IWPs.

TI  - <i>FY-4A</i> LMI Observed Lightning Activity in Super Typhoon Mangkhut (2018) in Comparison with WWLLN Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF METEOROLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Using lightning observations from the Fengyun-4A Lightning Mapping Imager (FY-4A LMI), best-track data from the Shanghai Typhoon Institute, bright temperature (TBB) data from Himawari-8 satellite, and composite reflectivity (CR) data from the South China radar network, we investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of lightning activity and convective evolution during the landfall of Super Typhoon Mangkhut, the strongest landing typhoon in China in 2018. Three stages of active total lightning are observed, and differences of lightning characteristics between the inner core and the outer rainbands are present. The onset of inner-core lightning outbreak is about 4 h ahead of the maximum intensity of the storm, providing indicative information on the change of typhoon intensity. Lightning rates in the outer rainbands increase rapidly 12 h before the landfall, and lightning activity is mainly confined in the outer rainbands after the landfall. A good correlation in hourly variation is shown between lightning rates from the LMI and TBBs from the satellite. The averaged TBB within the inner core reaches its minimum (-80 degrees C) when the inner-core lightning outbreak occurs, indicating the occurrence and enhancement of deep convection there. Lightning locations observed by the LMI has a good spatial correspondence with regions of low TBBs and high CRs, revealing the monitoring capability of the LMI to lightning activity and deep convection in landing typhoons. Comparisons between the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and the LMI reveal that the spatial distribution, temporal evolution, and radial pattern of lightning activity in Mangkhut observed by the two systems are consistent. Furthermore, due to the detection capability of total lightning, the LMI has advantages in revealing the higher ratio of intra-cloud lightning within the inner core in typhoon. The continuous and real-time observation of FY-4A LMI provides an unprecedented platform for monitoring total lightning and deep convection in landing typhoons in China, which will promote the generation of new research and applications in the future.

TI  - The impact of aerosol on MODIS cloud detection and property retrieval in seriously polluted East China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous researches proved that aerosols have a significant influence on the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud observation. In East China, this impact is much greater and special compared with other regions because of the frequent haze pollution. This study evaluated the impact of aerosols on cloud detection, cloud top height (CTH) and cloud optical thickness (COT) retrieval in East China primarily using the MODIS and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) observation, combined with a cloud detection rectification algorithm. The results showed that, in haze weather, MODIS misjudged large-scale of dense aerosols as "clouds", which increased the observed cloud cover by 0.4 to 0.6 in the most seriously polluted regions. Compared with the clear condition, high aerosol loading with AOD >2 would increase the misjudgment possibility by 35%. Another influence is that MODIS has a 30% higher possibility to obtain an over low CTH of high and thin clouds, and overestimate the COT of thin ice clouds by 2.15 to 3.74 under serious air pollution. Further analyzes found that the cloud detection and COT retrieval was mainly influenced by the dense aerosols, while the CTH retrieval is vulnerable to both thin and dense aerosol. This study made a quantitative measurement of the aerosol influence on MODIS cloud observation, and first made a deep explanation for the effect of air pollution density. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Determining the drivers of suspended sediment dynamics in tidal marsh-influenced estuaries using high-resolution ocean color remote sensing
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Sediment budgets are a critical metric to assess coastal marsh vulnerability to sea level rise and declining riverine sediment inputs. However, calculating accurate sediment budgets is challenging in tidal marsh-influenced estuaries where suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) typically vary on scales of hours and hundreds of meters, and where SSC dynamics are driven by a complex and often site-specific interplay of hydrodynamic and meteorological conditions. The mapping of SSC using ocean-color remote sensing is well established and can help capture the spatio-temporal variability of SSC and determine the dominant drivers regulating sediment budgets. However, the coarse spatial resolution of traditional ocean-color sensors (1-km) generally precludes their use in coastal-marsh estuaries. Here, using the Plum Island Estuary (Massachusetts, USA) as an example, we demonstrate that high-spatial-resolution maps of SSC derived from Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and Sentinel-2A/B Multispectral Instruments (MSI) can be used to determine the main drivers of SSC dynamics in tidal marsh-influenced estuaries, despite the long revisit time of these sensors. Local empirical algorithms between SSC and remote-sensing reflectance were derived and applied to a total of 46 clear-sky scenes collected by the OLI and the MSI between 2013 and 2018. The analysis revealed that this 5-year record was sufficient to capture a representative range of meteorological and tidal conditions required to determine the main drivers of SSC dynamics in this mid-latitude system. The interplay between river and tidal flows dominated SSC dynamics in this estuary, whereas wind-driven resuspension had a more moderate effect. The SSC was higher during spring because of increased river discharge due to snowmelt. Tidal asymmetry also enhanced sediment resuspension during flood tides, possibly favoring deposition on marsh platforms. Together, water level, water-level rate of change, river discharge and wind speed were able to explain > 60% of the variability in the main channel SSC, thereby facilitating future prediction of SSC from these readily available variables. This study demonstrates that the existing multi-year records of high-resolution remote sensing can provide a representative depiction of SSC dynamics in hydrodynamically-complex and small-scale estuaries that moderate-resolution ocean color remote sensing and in situ measurements are unable to capture.

TI  - Assessing spatio-temporal changes in forest cover and fragmentation under urban expansion in Nanjing, eastern China, from long-term Landsat observations (1987-2017)
T2  - APPLIED GEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Assessing changes in forest cover and fragmentation under urban expansion and the correlation analysis between these changes can provide decision support for urban forest managers. In this study, forest cover and morphological spatial patterns (cores, islets, perforations, edges, loops, bridges, and branches) were firstly mapped by the vegetation change tracker (VCT) algorithm and morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) respectively in Nanjing from 1987 to 2017. Next, the visible red and near-infrared-based built-up index (VrNIR-BI) was derived to extract urban impervious surface (UIS) areas, and the neighbourhood-based urban expansion model was proposed to describe the expansion types (edge-expansion, infilling and outlying). Finally, the relationships among the forest cover, fragmentation changes and urban expansion were determined using the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). The results showed that the distribution of forest cover in Nanjing was relatively scattered and it decreased by 94 km(2), while the UIS area increased by 893 km(2 )from 1987 to 2017, resulting in some forests being gradually surrounded or encroached upon by UIS areas. The main forest morphological spatial pattern was identified as cores, with many small-area cores. Moreover, islets exhibited a higher proportion of 0.18, and these suggested that the fragmentation of Nanjing's forests was severe. Forest net changes had the higher correlation with cores, edges and branches. In addition, there were strong correlations between edge-expansion and cores, edges, branches with the r values greater than 0.75, which meant that most of the urban areas extended to core regions from the forest edges or branches. The derived information will help forest managers monitor forest dynamics in response to urban expansion and achieve sustainable development.

TI  - Estimation of rice yield from a C-band radar remote sensing image by integrating a physical scattering model and an optimization algorithm
T2  - PRECISION AGRICULTURE
M3  - Article
AB  - Accurate estimation of rice yield with remotely sensed data plays a role in ensuring food security at local or national scales. In this study, an estimation scheme integrating a rice canopy scattering model (RCSM) and a genetic algorithm optimization tool (GAOT) was proposed on a basis of radar remote sensing technology. A C-band Radarsat-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image acquired at rice maturity stage in Northeast, China was tested to simulate three yield-related rice parameters via an integrated RCSM-GAOT scheme, with a parallel computing environment. Rice yield was then estimated via a regression analysis by linking the simulated parameters to rice ear weights. Results showed that three parameters, ear length, ear diameter and ear density, can be simulated by the RCSM-GAOT scheme with a simulation error of 1.2 cm, 0.11 cm and 29 ears/m(2), respectively. Rice yield is estimated with an average error of 0.28 kg/m(2) and 0.22 kg/m(2) for fresh ear weight and dry ear weight, respectively. In comparison with the need of multiple SAR data acquisitions in past studies, this study demonstrates the capability of one time Radarsat-2 quad-polarized SAR image in regional rice yield estimation. At the same time, it also indicates that the proposed RCSM-GAOT scheme has a potential in future precision agriculture applications.

M3  - Article
AB  - To understand the dynamics of temperate forest in Northeast Asia and its response to climate change under the scenario of global change, we examined the temporal and spatial changes of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and their correlation with temperature and precipitation of Changbai Mountain Nature Reserve in the growing season during 2001 and 2018, based on the remote sensing database of MODIS with a resolution of 250 m, land surface temperature data with a resolution of 1 km and meteorological data in the studied and surrounding area. The results showed that, in the growing season of 2001-2018, the averaged NDVI value of the study area was 0.711. Vegetation coverage was relatively high, increasing with a rate of 0.0025 . a(-1). The temperature showed an extremely significantly increasing trend (0.032 degrees C . a(-1)) , the rate of which was higher than that at global level. Precipitation also showed a significantly increasing trend (5.54 mm . a(-1)) with increased interannual variation. Spatially , NDVI generally was higher in the northwest and decreased with elevation. During the study period, the area with increased NDVI accounted for 46.2%, mainly concentrated in the north and south central high-altitude areas, while 53.8% of total area remained unchanged or slightly decrease. NDVI of the study area was mainly affected by temperature. At the annual scale, NDVI and land surface temperature were positively correlated, with 90.2% presented positive correlation and 43.6% significantly correlated. At the monthly scale, the impact of temperature on NDVI was more significant at the beginning and the end of growing season.

CP  - 30th Nordic Hydrological Conference

AB  - Located in the Tibetan Plateau, the upstream regions of the Mekong River (UM) and the Salween River (US) are very sensitive to climate change. The 'VIC-glacier' model, which links a degree-day glacier algorithm with variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model, was employed and the model parameters were calibrated on observed streamflow, glacier mass balance and MODIS snowcover data. Results indicate that: (1) glacier-melt runoff exhibits a significant increase in both areas by the Mann-Kendall test. Snowmelt runoff shows an increasing trend in the UM, while the US is characterized by a decreasing tendency. In the UM, the snowmelt runoff peak shifts from June in the baseline period 1964-1990 to May for both the 1990s and 2000s; (2) rainfall runoff was considered as the first dominant factor driving changes of river discharge, which could be responsible for over 84% in total runoff trend over the two regions. The glacial runoff illustrates the secondary influence on the total runoff tendency; (3) although the hydrological regime is rain dominated in these two basins, the glacier compensation effect in these regions is obvious, especially in dry years.

TI  - Quantifying methane emissions from the largest oil-producing basin in the United States from space
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
M3  - Article
AB  - Using new satellite observations and atmospheric inverse modeling, we report methane emissions from the Permian Basin, which is among the world's most prolific oil-producing regions and accounts for >30% of total U.S. oil production. Based on satellite measurements from May 2018 to March 2019, Permian methane emissions from oil and natural gas production are estimated to be 2.7 +/- 0.5 Tg a(-1), representing the largest methane flux ever reported from a U.S. oil/gas-producing region and are more than two times higher than bottom-up inventory-based estimates. This magnitude of emissions is 3.7% of the gross gas extracted in the Permian, i.e., similar to 60% higher than the national average leakage rate. The high methane leakage rate is likely contributed by extensive venting and flaring, resulting from insufficient infrastructure to process and transport natural gas. This work demonstrates a high-resolution satellite data-based atmospheric inversion framework, providing a robust top-down analytical tool for quantifying and evaluating subregional methane emissions.

TI  - The potential of satellite FPAR product for GPP estimation: An indirect evaluation using solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite remotely sensed fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) products are widely used in land-surface monitoring and modeling, especially for estimating global terrestrial photosynthetic activity through light use efficiency (LUE) models. PAR absorbed by active chlorophyll (APAR(chl)) is directly linked to vegetation photosynthesis and can be used to estimate ecosystem gross primary production (GPP). Previous studies have demonstrated that solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence has very tight relationship with APAR(chl) at various ecosystems. Therefore, the solar angle normalized SIF (nSIF) is directly related to the fraction of PAR absorbed by chlorophyll (FPAR(chl)). This paper intercompared six space FPAR products from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Copernicus Global Land Service (CGLS), Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR), Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) and Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI). Their potential relationships with FPAR(chl) were indirectly evaluated with both spaceborne (Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, OCO-2 and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI) and airborne (Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer, CFIS) nSIF data as well as in situ GPP measurements. Our results show that these FPAR products are different in terms of amplitudes and seasonal variations across biomes. Among six FPAR products, OLCI FPAR shows the best relationships with TROPOMI nSIF740, OCO-2 nSIF757, and CFIS nSIF755. The coefficient of determination (R-2) for the relationship between OLCI FPAR and TROPOMI nSIF740 is 0.79 +/- 0.17 on a global average. APAR calculated from OLCI also exhibits the best relationship (R-2 = 0.79) with in situ GPP over 25 flux towers.

TI  - Monthly and Quarterly Sea Surface Temperature Prediction Based on Gated Recurrent Unit Neural Network
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The sea surface temperature (SST) is an important parameter of the energy balance on the Earth's surface. SST prediction is crucial to marine production, marine protection, and climate prediction. However, the current SST prediction model still has low precision and poor stability. In this study, a medium and long-term SST prediction model is designed on the basis of the gated recurrent unit (GRU) neural network algorithm. This model captures the SST time regularity by using the GRU layer and outputs the predicted results through the fully connected layer. The Bohai Sea, which is characterized by a large annual temperature difference, is selected as the study area, and the SSTs on different time scales (monthly and quarterly) are used to verify the practicability and stability of the model. The results show that the designed SST prediction model can efficiently fit the results of the real sea surface temperature, and the correlation coefficient is above 0.98. Regardless of whether monthly or quarterly data are used, the proposed network model performs better than long short-term memory in terms of stability and accuracy when the length of the prediction increases. The root mean square error and mean absolute error of the predicted SST are mostly within 0-2.5 degrees C.

TI  - Combining Fractional Cover Images with One-Class Classifiers Enables Near Real-Time Monitoring of Fallows in the Northern Grains Region of Australia
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fallows are widespread in dryland cropping systems. However, timely information about their spatial extent and location remains scarce. To overcome this lack of information, we propose to classify fractional cover data from Sentinel-2 with biased support vector machines. Fractional cover images describe the land surface in intuitive, biophysical terms, which reduces the spectral variability within the fallow class. Biased support vector machines are a type of one-class classifiers that require labelled data for the class of interest and unlabelled data for the other classes. They allow us to extrapolate in-situ observations collected during flowering to the rest of the growing season to generate large training data sets, thereby reducing the data collection requirements. We tested this approach to monitor fallows in the northern grains region of Australia and showed that the seasonal fallow extent can be mapped with >92% accuracy both during the summer and winter seasons. The summer fallow extent can be accurately mapped as early as mid-December (1-4 months before harvest). The winter fallow extent can be accurately mapped from mid-August (2-4 months before harvest). Our method also detected emergence dates successfully, indicating the near real-time accuracy of our method. We estimated that the extent of fallow fields across the northern grains region of Australia ranged between 50% in winter 2017 and 85% in winter 2019. Our method is scalable, sensor independent and economical to run. As such, it lays the foundations for reconstructing and monitoring the cropping dynamics in Australia.

TI  - Soil moisture experiment in the Luan River supporting new satellite mission opportunities
T2  - REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR) was conducted from 2017 to 2018 in the semi-arid Luan River watershed located in the North of China. One of the objectives of SMELR is to serve as an assessment tool and demonstration for a new Terrestrial Water Resources Satellite (TWRS) concept with one-dimensional synthetic aperture microwave techniques, for which soil moisture retrieval under variable satellite observing configurations (mainly in terms of incidence angels) is the greatest challenge. This proposed mission is targeted to provide continuity for the current satellite L-band microwave observations, and further improve the accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture mapping through the synergistic use of active, passive and optical remote sensing data. Multi-resolution, multi-angle and multi-spectral airborne data were obtained four times over a 70 km by 12 km area in the Shandian River basin, and one time over a 165 km by 5 km area that includes the Xiaoluan River basin. The near surface soil moisture (0 cm-5 cm) was measured extensively on the ground in fifty 1 km by 2 km quadrats (targeted to compare with the airborne radiometer), and two hundred and fifty 200 m by 200 m quadrats corresponding to radar observations. Two networks were established for continuous measurement of the soil moisture and temperature profile (3 cm, 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm, 50 cm) and precipitation in the Shandian and Xiaoluan River basin, respectively. Supporting ground measurements also included ground temperature, vegetation water content, surface roughness, continuous measurement of microwave emission and backscatter at a pasture site, reflectance of various land cover types, evapotranspiration and aerosol observations. Preliminary results within the experimental area indicate that (1) the near surface soil moisture spatial variability at a 200 m scale was up to similar to 0.1 cm(3)/cm(3) at an intermediate value of similar to 0.35 cm(3)/cm(3). (2) The difference of soil and vegetation temperature in grass and croplands reach its maximum of 11 K around solar noon time, and the soil temperature gradient is largest at around 15 P.M. (3) Both the airborne and ground measurements cover a wide range of conditions. The L-band active and passive observations exhibit a large variation of similar to 30 dB and similar to 80 K, respectively, corresponding to soil moisture range from 0.1 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.5 cm(3)/cm(3). The sensitivity of both active and passive data to soil moisture is compared at corresponding spatial resolutions and show high information complementarity for better accuracy and resolution soil moisture retrieval.

TI  - Incorporating Metric Learning and Adversarial Network for Seasonal Invariant Change Detection
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Change detection by comparing two bitemporal images is one of the most fundamental challenges for dynamic monitoring of the Earth surface. In this article, we propose a metric learning-based generative adversarial network (GAN) (MeGAN) to automatically explore seasonal invariant features for pseudochange suppressing and real change detection. To achieve this purpose, a seasonal invariant term is introduced to maximally suppress pseudochanges, whereas the MeGAN explores the transition patterns between adjacent images in a self-learning fashion. Different from the previous works on bitemporal imagery change detection, the proposed MeGAN have the following contributions: 1) it automatically explores change patterns from the complex bitemporal background without human intervention and 2) it aims to maximally exclude pseudochanges from the seasonal transition term and map out real changes efficiently. To our best knowledge, this is the first time we incorporate the seasonal transition term and GAN for change detection between bitemporal images. At last, to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method, we included two data sets which are the Google Earth data and the Landsat data, for bitemporal change detection and evaluation. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method is able to perform change detection with precision can be as high as 81% and 88% for the Google Earth and Landsat data set, respectively.

TI  - Legacy and emerging semi-volatile organic compounds in sentinel fish from an arctic formerly used defense site in Alaska
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION
M3  - Article
AB  - The Arctic is subject to long-range atmospheric deposition of globally-distilled semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) that bioaccumulate and biomagnify in lipid-rich food webs. In addition, locally contaminated sites may also contribute SVOCs to the arctic environment. Specifically, Alaska has hundreds of formerly used defense (FUD) sites, many of which are co-located with Alaska Native villages in remote parts of the state. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent of SVOC contamination on Alaska's St. Lawrence Island through the analysis of sentinel fish, the ninespine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius), collected from Troutman Lake located within the watershed of an FUD site and adjacent to the Yupik community of Gambell. We measured the concentrations of legacy and emerging SVOCs in 303 fish samples (81 composites), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organophosphate esters (OPEs) and their diester metabolites, and per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PBDEs and PCBs were the most abundant SVOC groups found in stickleback with Sigma PBDE and Sigma PCB median concentrations of 25.8 and 10.9 ng/g ww, respectively, followed by PFAS (median Sigma PFAS 7.22 ng/g ww). Sigma OPE and Sigma OPE metabolite concentrations were lower with median concentrations of 4.97 and 1.18 ng/g ww, respectively. Chemical patterns and distributions based on correlations and comparison with SVOC concentrations in stickleback from other parts of the island suggest strong local sources of PCBs, PBDEs, and PFAS on St. Lawrence Island.

TI  - Comparison of GF2 and SPOT6 Imagery on Canopy Cover Estimating in Northern Subtropics Forest in China
T2  - FORESTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Canopy cover is an important vegetation attribute used for many environmental applications such as defining management objectives, thinning and ecological modeling. However, the estimation of canopy cover from high spatial resolution imagery is still a difficult task due to limited spectral information and the heterogeneous pixel values of the same canopy. In this paper, we compared the capacity of two high spatial resolution sensors (SPOT6 and GF2) using three ensemble learning models (Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Gradient Boosting (GDBoost), and random forest (RF)), to estimate canopy cover (CC) in a Chinese northern subtropics forest. Canopy cover across 97 plots was measured across 41 needle forest plots, 24 broadleaf forest plots, and 32 mixed forest plots. Results showed that (1) the textural features performed more importantly than spectral variables according to the number of variables in the top ten predictors in estimating canopy cover (CC) in both SPOT6 and GF2. Moreover, the vegetation indices in spectral variables had a lower relative importance value than the band reflectance variables. (2) GF2 imagery outperformed SPOT6 imagery in estimating CC when using the ensemble learning model in our data. On average across the models, the R-2 was almost 0.08 higher for GF2 over SPOT6. Likewise, the average RMSE and average MAE were 0.002 and 0.01 lower in GF2 than in SPOT6. (3) The ensemble learning model showed good results in estimating CC, yet the different models performed a little differently in the results. Additionally, the GDBoost model performed the best of all the ensemble learning models with R-2 = 0.92, root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.001 and mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.022.

TI  - Gap Fill of Land Surface Temperature and Reflectance Products in Landsat Analysis Ready Data
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The recently released Landsat analysis ready data (ARD) over the United States provides the opportunity to investigate landscape dynamics using dense time series observations at 30-m resolution. However, the dataset often contains data gaps (or missing data) because of cloud contamination or data acquisition strategy, which result in different capabilities for seasonality modeling. We present a new algorithm that focuses on data gap filling using clear observations from orbit overlap regions. Multiple linear regression models were established for each pixel time series to estimate stable predictions and uncertainties. The model's training data came from stratified random samples based on the time series similarity between the pixel and data from the overlap regions. The algorithm was first evaluated using four tiles (5000 x 5000 30-m pixels for each tile) from 2018 land surface temperature data (LST) in Atlanta, Georgia. The accuracy was assessed using randomly masked clear observations with an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 3.88 and an average bias of -0.37, which were comparable to the product accuracy. We also applied the method on ARD surface reflectance bands at Fairbanks, Alaska. The accuracy assessment suggested a majority RMSE of less than 0.04 and a bias of less than 0.0023. The gap-filled time series can be of help for reliable seasonal modeling and reducing artifacts related to data availability. This approach can also be applied to other datasets, vegetation indexes, or spectral reflectance bands of other sensors.

TI  - Cloud detection over snow and ice with oxygen A- and B-band observations from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC)
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Satellite cloud detection over snow and ice has been difficult for passive remote sensing instruments due to the lack of contrast between clouds and cold/bright surfaces; cloud mask algorithms often heavily rely on shortwave infrared (IR) channels over such surfaces. The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on board the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) does not have infrared channels, which makes cloud detection over snow and ice surfaces even more challenging. This study investigates the methodology of applying EPIC's two oxygen absorption band pair ratios in the A band (764, 780 nm) and B band (688, 680 nm) for cloud detection over the snow and ice surfaces. We develop a novel elevation and zenith-angle-dependent threshold scheme based on radiative transfer model simulations that achieves significant improvements over the existing algorithm. When compared against a composite cloud mask based on geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) and low Earth orbit (LEO) sensors, the positive detection rate over snow and ice surfaces increased from around 36 % to 65 % while the false detection rate dropped from 50 % to 10 % for observations of January 2016 and 2017. The improvement in July is less substantial due to relatively better performance in the current algorithm. The new algorithm is applicable for all snow and ice surfaces including Antarctic, sea ice, high-latitude snow, and high-altitude glacier regions. This method is less reliable when clouds are optically thin or below 3 km because the sensitivity is low in oxygen band ratios for these cases.

TI  - Spatiotemporal variations of total suspended matter in complex archipelagic regions using a sigmoid model and Landsat-8 imagery
T2  - REGIONAL STUDIES IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Total suspended matter (TSM) is an important parameter of ocean water quality and for aquatic environmental assessment. The Zhoushan Islands are near the estuarine and coastal regions of the Yangtze River and Qiantang River and TSM occurs at very high concentrations and in long-term suspended states. The distribution and variation of TSM in the Zhoushan Islands has great impacts on its coastal water quality and activities such as ferry services, fisheries, and tourism. Based on Landsat-8's blue and near-infrared bands, this study developed a sigmoid TSM inversion model that was more accurate and robust than the other common linear and exponential models. We also checked three types of atmospheric correction models, FLAASH, 6S, and ACOLITE and determined that ACOLITE is better than the other two methods when using Landsat-8 in ocean color in estuarine and coastal regions. The sigmoid model was then applied to a series of Landsat-8 images covering the Zhoushan Islands from 2013 to 2018, and the image-derived results show that TSM absorption coefficients in the Zhoushan Islands are extremely high and range from 0.26 to 444.29 m(-1) with a mean of 113.14 m(-1). Furthermore, they have a clear downward gradient from the Hangzhou Bay to the open sea. In addition, the TSM concentrations in winter are usually much higher than those in summer. Our results indicate that TSM spatiotemporal variations in the Zhoushan Islands are not only controlled by many natural environmental factors, such as riverine discharge, but are also significantly influenced by many human activities such as transportation, tourism, and fisheries.

TI  - Identification of Apple Orchard Planting Year Based on Spatiotemporally Fused Satellite Images and Clustering Analysis of Foliage Phenophase
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - The planting year of apple orchard not only determines the fruit output but also provides information for the governmental management of the fruit industry. However, considering that different orchards use different management and cultivation methods, this may result in some trees having similar outlines but different planting years, and it is, therefore, difficult to effectively determine the actual planting year based on textural or structural characteristics. Therefore, the monitoring method provided in this paper is not to monitor the growing year positively from the planting of orchard seedlings but to use time series remote sensing data to reverse determine the continuous growth age of each existing orchard. The city of Qixia, Shandong Province, China, was used as a case study. Firstly, the spatial distribution of apple orchards was accurately extracted using the Sentinel-2 normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) spatiotemporally fused images and phenological vegetation information. Secondly, using region of interest (ROI) data for different vegetation types obtained from a field survey, NDVI time series were extracted from the Sentinel-2 NDVI spatiotemporally fused image. Among them, three characteristic phenological periods were selected, and the NDVI time series for apple orchards was used as a template to extract the apple orchard distribution area from 2000 to 2017. Then, the distribution area of apple orchards was defined as the area of interest in the planting year, combined with the Landsat NDVI time series image composed of three characteristic phenological periods each year from 2000 to 2017, and the apple orchard phenological curve. Subsequently, a Euclidean distance (ED) method was used to calculate the distribution area of apple orchards for each year between 2000 and 2017. Finally, a pixel-by-pixel inverse time series calculation method was used to obtain the planting year of apple orchards in the study area. This study provides a new way to accurately identify the planting year of apple orchards using satellite remote sensing images.

TI  - Comparison of Remote Sensing based Multi-Source ET Models over Cropland in a Semi-Humid Region of China
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - The estimation of cropland evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for agriculture water management, drought monitoring, and yield forecast. Remote sensing-based multi-source ET models have been widely applied and validated in the semi-arid region of China. However, careful investigation of the models' performances for different crop types (winter wheat and summer maize) over the semi-humid region is still necessary. This study used remote sensing data (Landsat 8 and ASTER) and compared three mainstream multi-source ET models: (i) the two-source energy balance model, i.e., TSEB; (ii) the Penman-Monteith based four-source model, i.e., 4s-PM; (iii) the Priestley Taylor-Jet Propulsion Laboratory ET algorithm, i.e., PT-JPL. The measurements of the eddy-covariance (EC) flux tower located in Guantao county of North China were used to validate the models. The results showed that the TSEB model performed the best in estimating latent heat flux (LE) of maize, with an RMSE of 75.0 W/m(2) and an R-2 of 0.9, and the 4s-PM model had the highest accuracy of LE estimation for wheat, with an RMSE of 61.0 W/m(2) and an R-2 of 0.91. The LE spatial distribution comparison indicated that the PT-JPL model had more capacity to exhibit crop ET heterogeneity. The major environmental factors affecting ET varied with crop types and crop growth stages. Without taking soil moisture into account, the 4s-PM and TSEB models overestimated LE under water deficit in the maturation stage of wheat. The plant moisture stress based on vegetation index in the PT-JPL model underestimated the evaporation in the maturation stage while the cropland was still wet.

TI  - Using Satellite Data to Determine Empirical Relationships between Volcanic Ash Source Parameters
T2  - ATMOSPHERE
M3  - Article
AB  - Poor knowledge of dispersion model source parameters related to quantities such as the total fine ash mass emission rate, its effective spatial distribution, and particle size distribution makes the provision of quantitative forecasts of volcanic ash a difficult problem. To ameliorate this problem, we make use of satellite-retrieved mass load data from 14 eruption case studies to estimate fine ash mass emission rates and other source parameters by an inverse modelling procedure, which requires multidimensional sampling of several thousand trial simulations with different values of source parameters. We then estimate the dependence of these optimal source parameters on eruption height. We show that using these empirical relationships in a data assimilation procedure leads to substantial improvements to the forecasts of ash mass loads, with the use of empirical relationships between parameters and eruption height having the added advantage of computational efficiency because of dimensional reduction. In addition, the use of empirical relationships, which encode information in satellite retrievals from past case studies, implies that quantitative forecasts can still be issued even when satellite retrievals of mass load are not available in real time due to cloud cover or other reasons, making it especially useful for operations in the tropics where ice and water clouds are ubiquitous.

TI  - Prognostic Value of Non-Contrast CT Markers and Spot Sign for Outcome Prediction in Patients with Intracerebral Hemorrhage under Oral Anticoagulation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction: In patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), several non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) markers and the spot sign (SS) in computed tomography (CT) angiography (CTA) have been established for the prediction of hematoma growth and neurological outcome. However, the prognostic value of these markers in patients under oral anticoagulation (ORAC) is unclear. We hypothesized that outcome prediction by these imaging markers may be significantly different between patients with and without ORAC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the predictive value of NCCT markers and SS in patients with ICH under ORAC. Methods: This is a retrospective study of the database for patients with ICH at a German tertiary stroke center. Inclusion criteria were (1) patients with ICH, (2) oral anticoagulation within the therapeutic range, and (3) NCCT and CTA performed on admission within 6 h after onset of symptoms. We defined a binary outcome: modified Rankin Scale (mRS) <= 3 = good outcome versus mRS > 3 = poor outcome at discharge. The predictive value of each sign was assessed in uni- and multivariable logistic regression models. Results: Of 129 patients with ICH under ORAC, 76 (58.9%) presented with hypodensities within the hematoma in admission NCCT, 64 (52.7%) presented with an irregular shape of the hematoma, 60 (46.5%) presented with a swirl sign, 49 (38.0%) presented with a black hole sign, and 46 (35.7%) presented with a heterogeneous density of the hematoma. Moreover, 44 (34.1%) patients had a satellite sign, in 20 (15.5%) patients, an island sign was detected, 18 (14.0%) patients were blend-sign positive, and 14 (10.9%) patients presented with a CTA spot sign. Inter-rater agreement was very high for all included characteristics between the two readers. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified the presence of black hole sign (odds ratio 10.59; p < 0.001), swirl sign (odds ratio 14.06; p < 0.001), and satellite sign (odds ratio 6.38; p = 0.011) as independent predictors of poor outcome. Conclusions: The distribution and prognostic value of several NCCT markers and CTA spot sign in ICH patients under ORAC is comparable to those with spontaneous ICH, even though these parameters are partly based on coagulant status. These findings suggest that a similar approach can be used for further research regarding outcome prediction in ICH patients under ORAC and those with spontaneous ICH.

TI  - Evaluating the utility of various drought indices to monitor meteorological drought in Tropical Dry Forests
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BIOMETEOROLOGY
M3  - Review
AB  - Even though existing remote-sensing-based drought indices are widely used in many different types of ecosystems, their utility has not been widely assessed in tropical dry forests (TDFs). The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of three remote-sensing-based drought indices, the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition Index (TCI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI), for meteorological drought monitoring in TDFs using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The correlation between the VCI, TCI, and VHI and multiple time scales of the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24 months) for each month (January to December) and each season (dry season, dry-to-wet season, wet season and wet-to-dry season) were conducted using the Pearson correlation analysis. We also correlated year-to-year changes of satellite-based drought indices with the changes of the in situ annual SPI (A_SPI) which provides annual information on the mean meteorological drought. The analysis reveals that the ability of these remote-sensing-based drought indices for meteorological drought monitoring varies with timing, and the TCI outperforms the VCI and VHI in terms of seasonal and annual scale. These remote-sensing indices performed well in monitoring meteorological drought in the dry season, poorly in the in the dry-to-wet season, and moderately in the wet season. The TCI performed best in monitoring meteorological drought in the wet-to-dry period, followed by VHI, whereas the VCI performed worst. All of these remote-sensing-based drought indices failed to detect drought in May during the green-up period and in September, October, and November when the water content in the root regions was abundant. Our results indicate that the evapotranspiration of TDFs is more sensitive than canopy greenness to detect meteorological drought. Results from this study increase the ability to provide real-time drought monitoring and early warnings of drought in TDFs.

TI  - Mapping and Assessment of Tree Roots Using Ground Penetrating Radar with Low-Cost GPS
T2  - REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - In this paper, we have presented a methodology combining ground penetrating radar (GPR) and a low-cost GPS receiver for three-dimensional detection of tree roots. This research aims to provide an effective and affordable testing tool to assess the root system of a number of trees. For this purpose, a low-cost GPS receiver was used, which recorded the approximate position of each GPR track, collected with a 500 MHz RAMAC shielded antenna. A dedicated post-processing methodology based on the precise position of the satellite data, satellite clock offsets data, and a local reference Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Earth Observation Network System (GEONET) Station close to the survey site was developed. Firstly, the positioning information of local GEONET stations was used to filter out the errors caused by satellite position error, satellite clock offset, and ionosphere. In addition, the advanced Kalman filter was designed to minimise receiver offset and the multipath error, in order to obtain a high precision position of each GPR track. Kirchhoff migration considering near-field effect was used to identify the three-dimensional distribution of the root. In a later stage, a novel processing scheme was used to detect and clearly map the coarse roots of the investigated tree. A successful case study is proposed, which supports the following premise: the current scheme is an affordable and accurate mapping method of the root system architecture.

TI  - The link between language and culture on the lessons of Russian as a foreign language
T2  - AMAZONIA INVESTIGA
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of a foreign language teacher is to form a student's communicative competence, which is a complex of other competencies such as linguistic, discursive and linguocultural. For successful psychological and social adaptation in a new cultural and linguistic space for a foreign student is extremely important at the initial level of education begin to master the basic linguistic and cultural concepts that reflect the culture of the speakers of the studied language and leads to the adoption of a different worldview. Thus, for successful communication, you need not only use phonetic, grammatical, syntactic and pragmatic rules of the language, but also you should have a clear idea of the conceptual picture of the world of the people, who speaks this language. It follows that the study of any foreign language should occur inextricably linked with the knowledge of culture, values and understanding of the native people of this language. The objective of the work is to formulate the key linguocultural principles of teaching Russian as a foreign language. To achieve this objective, the works of leading researchers in the field of linguistics, didactics, methods of teaching Russian as a foreign language have been analyzed. The research object is an inextricable link between learning a foreign language and the culture of its speakers. The research result is the proof of the need to learn a foreign language as being inextricably linked with knowledge of the culture, values and world outlook of the people - speakers of this language, as well as a list of basic linguocultural principles, on which teaching a foreign language, including Russian as a foreign language, should be based.

TI  - Documenting the evolution and expansion of surface urban heat in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region, 2000-2019
T2  - ASIAN GEOGRAPHER
M3  - Article
AB  - The evolution of land surface temperatures (LSTs) within the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR) is examined with respect to patterns of urbanization from 2000 to 2019. Change detection as well as examinations of five periods within the 20 years yield insights into the spatial patterning of surface urban heat (SUH) within the BMR. Results suggest that the LSTs in portions of the BMR have increased more than 5 degrees C during the 20-year period. The spatial distribution of SUH exhibits a pattern where high LSTs occur outward and primarily westward from the urban core along highways serving as development corridors and related regions of rapid urbanization. Nighttime LSTs have not increased as markedly as daytime; however, several noted "hotspots" have intensified over time and are located in districts along the southern seaboard. The greatest LST increase through the 20-year period is located in the northwest of the Bangkok urban core in Bang Kruai and Mueang Nonthaburi. A close investigation of this area indicates that the LST hotspots are co-located with rapid urban expansion into the area that has been facilitated by the destruction of orchards and other agriculture lands from a flood that occurred in 2011. The significant changes in land cover from orchards and agriculture to urban and built-up have led to the large increases in LSTs within the region.

TI  - Assessment of cropping intensity dynamics in Odisha using multitemporal Landsat TM and OLI images
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Satisfying the global food demand of the growing population from limited cropland resources is a huge challenge for scientists and policymakers. Approximately 14 mha land remains fallow (rice-fallow) in the dry season after monsoon season crop in South Asia. Accurate geospatial information of cropping intensity is key to identifying the potential areas for crop intensification. In this regard, we aim to map and evaluate cropping intensity dynamics over Odisha, using moderate-resolution multitemporal Landsat OLI (2013 to 14 to 2017 to 18) and TM (2006 to 07) images. The study performed k-mean clustering on principal components extracted from annual surface reflectance composites to identify the presence and absence of crop in the kharif and rabi seasons. The overall accuracy was estimated as 0.92 +/- 0.01, 0.91 +/- 0.01, 0.92 +/- 0.01, 0.89 +/- 0.01, and 0.91 +/- 0.01 for cropping intensity map of 2006 to 07, 2013 to 14, 2014 to 15, 2015 to 16, 2016 to 17, and 2017 to 18 years, respectively. The analysis of this study revealed that similar to 70% (3.5 mha) of the total kharif crop area remains fallow during the rabi season. The study illustrated that the dynamics in cropping intensity in the coastal region of Odisha was directly influenced by the occurrence of floods during 2013 to 14 and 2014 to 15. Whereas, extreme and moderate drought during 2015 to 16 and 2017 to 18, respectively, reduced the total crop growing area of rabi season as well as cropping intensity especially in middle and western Odisha. The results and findings of this study can be used for policy-level interventions to target improved agricultural practices for improved productivity and crop intensification. The methodology and approach used in this study can be scaled up in similar areas of South and East Asia and Africa to study the dynamics of cropping intensity.

TI  - How Important Is Meltwater to the Chamkhar Chhu Headwaters of the Brahmaputra River?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - As our global climate warms, people, and economies utilizing water resources sourced by snow and ice melt in mountain areas are disproportionately affected relative to locations that rely on rainfall. Worldwide, the vast majority of those impacted by snowfall changing to rainfall and earlier melt from a warming climate live in Asia. The Brahmaputra River originates in the declining glaciers and snowfields of the Chinese and Bhutanese Himalaya before flowing to the mega population centers of the Bangladesh delta. Bhutan's economy relies on water resource-dependent hydropower and agriculture imposing important questions about the impact of climate change on the long-term viability of water supplies in these important economic sectors. To clarify potential effects on water supplies in a warming world, and specifically to quantify the role of meltwater to river discharge in the headwaters of the Brahmaputra basin, we utilize a combined field observation-remote sensing approach to quantify river discharge source waters in a representative headwater basin, the Chamkhar Chhu. Using 4 years of water isotope and chemistry data together with a Bayesian Monte Carlo mixing model run seasonally in 2016, we find that the Chamkhar Chhu is mostly a rain-dominated basin at the lower elevation of our study domain (2591 m a.s.l.), with peak contributions from snowmelt in the early-monsoon and ice melt in the post-monsoon seasons. The radioactive tritium isotope shows glacier ice at the terminus was formed before the 1960s bomb spike while groundwater and river water samples taken in August (late monsoon) are sourced from mostly newer water inputs that show little tritium. The influence of the highly reacted Tsampa tributary, sourced by a debris covered glacier, and additional groundwater inputs generally increase major ion concentrations with distance from the glacier snout. An overall decreasing trend in the minimum snow and ice cover extent maps produced using MODIS Terra data from 2000 to 2017 suggest a lessening of cryospheric water resource availability in the basin, although this timeseries is short compared to the timescale of atmospheric-oceanic oscillations controlling snowfall. While decreasing snow and ice resources will likely lead to changing melt water contributions to river discharge, the overall impact on the water resources may be buffered by rainfall contributions as previous studies forecast an increase in precipitation for the region that will likely make up for lower melt water inputs.

TI  - Assessment of urban growth effects on green space and surface temperature in Doon Valley, Uttarakhand, India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - This study aims to examine the spatio-temporal urban expansion pattern and its impacts on green space variation as well as thermal behavior in Doon valley over the last two decades during 2000 and 2019. Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 images of February and May month of two study years 2000 and 2019 were used for the analysis. The land use change analysis revealed notable outgrowth of urbanization with 184% increase in Doon valley during 2000-2019. To examine the effects of locational factors on urban growth, relative Shannon entropy analysis was carried out based on two factors, i.e., distances from city center and roads. It was seen that all the roads and city center have witnessed consistent and higher urban spread in its surroundings with high relative entropy value more than 0.9. Further analysis shows that there was considerable loss of agriculture crop lands and fallow lands along the major roads and around city center. Forest area was mostly affected along the road towards Mussorie hill station (road 2) because of its hilly surroundings whereas in Subhash Nagar area (road 4), fallow land and cultivated land were mainly replaced by the development activities. Analysis was also carried out to assess the spatial-temporal distribution of land surface temperature (LST) and its changing dynamics with land covers. It revealed that LST has increased in all the land use types with overall increase of 1.86 degrees C and 8.62 degrees C in the months February and May, respectively, during the study period. It is also found that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST are negatively correlated with R-2 0.46 and 0.28 for the months February and May, respectively. However, the correlation between NDVI and LST was found highly significant with P value less than 0.01. Therefore, spatial and temporal changes of different land use types especially rapid urbanization at the cost of green spaces with rampant anthropogenic activities is one of the main factor for LST increase in the study area. Moreover, this temperature rise with ever-increasing anthropogenic activities is not a healthy indication for the hilly region like Doon Valley which may adversely affect the ecosystem stability and its resources as well. The study may be used as reference for future ecological and urban management studies and policies.

Imaging had a moderate sensitivity and specificity for detection of occult disease when compared with histopathologic analysis. Forty-two percent (25 of 60) of patients underwent neck dissection, and 12% (7 of 60) had a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). There was a high rate of negative SLNB findings. The majority of patients were treated with surgery alone (29 of 60), followed by a cohort (21 of 60) treated with surgery plus adjuvant treatment, and 10 of 60 patients were treated with radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy. Recurrence-free survival was 50%, 45%, and 42% at 1, 2, and 5 years.ConclusionsWe report higher recurrence rates and higher negative SLNB result rates than other studies. Our results affirm that imaging may not be a substitute for SLNB and that it had an intermediate ability to identify the occult disease. Traditional predictors, including SLNB and cervical node pathology, may not identify patients at risk for recurrence in HN-MCC. We report similar recurrence rates in patients who had treatment of the cervical nodes by radiation therapy or neck dissection as compared with those who did not receive neck treatment.

TI  - Integrating forecast meteorological data into the ArcDualK<sub>c</sub> model for estimating spatially distributed evapotranspiration rates of a citrus orchard
T2  - AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - In the last years, several satellite-based models, using measured or forecast meteorological data, have been developed for determining spatially distributed crop evapotranspiration (ETc) estimates. The study herein presented aims at assessing the reliability of the ArcDualKc model, based on the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient (K-c), for deriving spatially distributed estimates of K-c and ETc in a deficit irrigated (DI) orange orchard. Daily ETc and dual-K-c values were obtained using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery in combination with measured and forecast meteorological data provided by the nearest weather station and by COSMO model, respectively. Overestimations on K-c and ETc resulted from the study when using forecast instead of measured meteorological data (average PBIAS of 7.62% and 26.24%, respectively); this might be caused by some inaccuracies in meteorological predictions. The evaporation coefficient (K-e) derived by the ArcDualK(c) model resulted similar between the DI and the fully irrigated treatments. Differences up to 6% in terms of K-c and ETc were identified among the irrigation strategies, mainly due to variations of the transpiration coefficient (K-cb). Despite the reliability of the ArcDualK(c) model, the obtained results might be influenced by the heterogeneity of Sentinel-2 pixel, containing vegetated and bare soil surfaces, highlighting the need to integrate the model with ground-based data or by using higher-resolution images.

TI  - Photographic records of plant phenology and spring river flush timing in a river lowland ecosystem at the taiga-tundra boundary, northeastern Siberia
T2  - ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH
M3  - Article
AB  - Arctic terrestrial ecosystems near the treeline in river lowlands are vulnerable to the changing climate and seasonal extreme events, including flooding. We set up a simple camera monitoring system to record the timings and durations of the leafy period and the spring flush of river water at three observation sites (Boydom [B]: 70.64 degrees N, 148.15 degrees E; Kodac [K]:70.56 degrees N, 148.26 degrees E; Verkhny-Khatistakh [VK]:70.25 degrees N,147.47 degrees E) in the Indigirka lowland, in Northeastern Siberia. Time-lapse digital cameras were located at seven points across the three sites. The time intervals were 1-4 or 24 hours. The minimum and maximum monitoring periods were 2 years (July 2016 to August 2018) at B and 5 years (August 2013 to July 2018) at K. One camera documented the timings of river ice melt and open water periods from the riverbank of the Kryvaya River, one of the small tributaries of the Indigirka River. The other six cameras recorded several types of ground cover typical of the area, including larch trees (Larix cajanderi), shrubs (including Salix spp. and Betula nana), forbs, mosses and graminoids in an ecosystem of sparsely forested shrublands, wetlands and riversides. The data consists of 45,617 JPEG-format images. This dataset can be used to detect the onset and offset of the growing season and to capture the ice melt timing and water cover periods in wetlands and riversides. It may be useful in validating satellite data such as the vegetation remote sensing index for remote and little-known areas. These data may contribute to the study of the role of high-latitude ecosystems in global climate changes.

TI  - Study for Predicting Land Surface Temperature (LST) Using Landsat Data: A Comparison of Four Algorithms
T2  - ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - The soft computing models used for predicting land surface temperature (LST) changes are very useful to evaluate and forecast the rapidly changing climate of the world. In this study, four soft computing techniques, namely, multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), wavelet neural network (WNN), adaptive neurofuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and dynamic evolving neurofuzzy inference system (DENFIS), are applied and compared to find the best model that can be used to predict the LST changes of Beijing area. The topographic change is considered in this study to accurately predict LST; furthermore, Landsat 4/5 TM and Landsat 8OLI_TIRS images for four years (1995, 2004, 2010, and 2015) are used to study the LST changes of the research area. The four models are assessed using statistical analysis, coefficient of determination (R-2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) in the training and testing stages, and MARS is used to estimate the important variables that should be considered in the design models. The results show that the LST for the studied area increases by 0.28 degrees C/year due to the urban changes in the study area. In addition, the topographic changes and previously recorded temperature changes have a significant influence on the LST prediction of the study area. Moreover, the results of the models show that the MARS, ANFIS, and DENFIS models can be used to predict the LST of the study area. The ANFIS model showed the highest performances in the training (R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.78 degrees C, MAE = 0.55 degrees C) and testing (R-2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.36 degrees C, MAE = 0.16 degrees C) stages; therefore, the ANFIS model can be used to predict the LST changes in the Beijing area. The predicted LST shows that the change in climate and urban area will affect the LST changes of the Beijing area in the future.

TI  - Unexpected presentation of accessory breast cancer presenting as a subcutaneous mass at costal ridge: a case report
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: During embryogenesis, bilateral thickening of ectoderm from anterior axillary folds to inguinal folds, called mammary ridges or milk lines, develops into breast tissues. Only a pair in the pectoral area is spared from regression and continuously develops into normal breasts. Accessory breasts can result if the regression process is incomplete. These ectopic breasts can change physiologically and pathologically similar to normal breasts. Unsurprisingly, they are capable of turning malignant Reported cases show the most common area for accessory breast cancer to be the axillary area. We report a rare case of accessory breast cancer over the costal ridge.Case presentation: We present the case of a 51-year-old Asian woman who complained of an enlarged mass lower to her left breast developed over the period of 3 months while on contraceptive pills. Unaware that the mass could be an accessory breast, the primary doctor had prescribed oral contraceptives. After our patient had noticed that the mass was obviously growing, she decided to consult a surgeon as the mass continued to grow. Expected to be benign, the mass was investigated by ultrasonography and then excised surgically. A pathology report identified the mass to be a carcinoma of the ectopic breast tissue. However, sentinel lymph node biopsy showed no nodal metastasis of all four lymph nodes. Following surgery, she received chemotherapy, radiation, and antihormonal treatment. After 2 years of postoperative follow up, she remained free of disease.Conclusions: This patient was diagnosed as having accessory breast cancer which presented with a subcutaneous mass. As this condition is exceptionally rare but curable by early treatments, we recommend surgeons to consider potential malignancy when patients present with a subcutaneous mass.

TI  - Soil total nitrogen estimation of alpine grassland using visible/near-infrared spectra: a comparison of multivariate techniques with different spectral transformations
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Rapid, precise, and quantitative assessment of soil total nitrogen (TN) of alpine grassland is crucial for monitoring the environmental conditions of grasslands. The right choice of preprocessing and calibration methods may improve the model performance of soil property estimation in visible/near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIRS). VNIRS (350 to 2500 nm) measurements were made of 80 soil samples from the northeast part of the Tibetan Plateau. To reduce the signal noise, the Savitzky-Golay technique was implemented and six spectral transformations were evaluated with the aim of identifying the best transformation for predicting soil TN. The performance of three linear calibration models, namely, stepwise multiple linear regression, principal component regression, partial least squares regression (PLSR), and a combination of these models with a nonlinear back propagation neural network (BPNN) was tested for accuracy in the measurement of soil TN. Our results indicate the following: (1) models using the derivative transformations of spectra as inputs perform better than those using nonderivative transformations, and the first derivative of the reciprocal of reflectance [(1/R)'] is the best spectral transformation for soil TN estimation; (2) models based on the PLSR and companion BPNN-latent variables (LVs) yield better predictions and smallest errors of soil TN. We demonstrate that (1/R)' is the best spectral transformation and consistently improves the estimation models of soil TN. Among multivariate techniques, the BPNN-LVs is recommended for estimation of soil TN with great accuracy. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)

TI  - Reinforcement Learning-Based Genetic Algorithm in Optimizing Multidimensional Data Discretization Scheme
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
M3  - Article
AB  - Feature discretization can reduce the complexity of data and improve the efficiency of data mining and machine learning. However, in the process of multidimensional data discretization, limited by the complex correlation among features and the performance bottleneck of traditional discretization criteria, the schemes obtained by most algorithms are not optimal in specific application scenarios and can even fail to meet the accuracy requirements of the system. Although some swarm intelligence algorithms can achieve better results, it is difficult to formulate appropriate strategies without prior knowledge, which will make the search in multidimensional space inefficient, consume many computing resources, and easily fall into local optima. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a genetic algorithm based on reinforcement learning to optimize the discretization scheme of multidimensional data. We use rough sets to construct the individual fitness function, and we design the control function to dynamically adjust population diversity. In addition, we introduce a reinforcement learning mechanism to crossover and mutation to determine the crossover fragments and mutation points of the discretization scheme to be optimized. We conduct simulation experiments on Landsat 8 and Gaofen-2 images, and we compare our method to the traditional genetic algorithm and state-of-the-art discretization methods. Experimental results show that the proposed optimization method can further reduce the number of intervals and simplify the multidimensional dataset without decreasing the data consistency and classification accuracy of discretization.

TI  - Theorizing self-repairers' worldview-personhood to advance new thinking on extended product lifetimes
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The ecological and societal problems caused by product obsolescence and consumerism in modern economies constitute a "wicked human-made problem" of significant magnitude. Current (old) ways of thinking cannot address these problems. Accordingly, in this paper, we critically explore the novel idea of integrated personhood and worldviews to theorize research on self-repairers and their repair behaviours to extend product lifetimes. We conducted a structured and systematic review of published work (n = 183) to identify the conceptual content of the field to inform our theorization. Our findings highlight three key issues. First, constricted theorization undermines understanding of self-repairers and their product lifetime extension (and spillover) behaviours. Second, the underlying conceptual complexity is typically underestimated. Third, the dominance of voluntarist and deterministic studies impedes new directions in research. From our review, an integrated worldview-personhood framework emerges that can deepen understanding of avant-garde self-repairers' engagement with product lifetimes.

TI  - Efficient dimension reduction of hyperspectral images for big data remote sensing applications
T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - A large amount of remote sensing data can be easily acquired due to the increase in the advances in sensor's technologies. The sensors can generate high-dimensional data in a lower time producing problems related to big data such as management and organization. Since the acquired data is characterized by a large dimension and lack of structure, the information analysis becomes harder. Therefore, an organization stage should structure the data reducing the dimension while maintaining the main properties to enable further analysis. The feature extraction and selection methods can achieve this task. Consequently, we aim to explore various pixel-wise feature extraction and selection algorithms to manage the organization stage of big data for hyperspectral images. Our work covers the comparison between feature vectors computed using the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform (DCT), and stationary wavelet transform. Moreover, spectral angle mapper, Jeffries-Matusita distance, spectral information divergence, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) were implemented as feature selectors. Feature extraction and selection methods were combined and evaluated in terms of algorithm complexity, reduction efficiency, and classification accuracy with the aid of a support vector machine and a maximum likelihood classifier. The analysis shows that some linear transformations can perform better in natural landscapes and others in urban images. Furthermore, the study found that the combination of DCT and LDA, which achieves high classification rates with an efficient dimension reduction, can be suitable for the organization stage of a big data remote sensing application of hyperspectral images.

TI  - Use of indirect computed tomography lymphangiography to determine metastatic status of sentinel lymph nodes in dogs with a pre-operative diagnosis of melanoma or mast cell tumour
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Canine melanomas and mast cell tumours (MCTs) frequently metastasize to lymph nodes, worsening prognosis compared with dogs without metastasis. Sentinel lymph node (SLN) evaluation is more specific than evaluation of the lymph node closest to the tumour, which may not be the draining lymph node. Computed tomography lymphangiography (CTL) allows for SLN identification and one study of canine mammary tumours found that CTL was able to assist in determination of the metastatic status of inguinal SLNs prior to extirpation and histopathology. The objective of the present study was to evaluate CTL for use in determining metastasis to the SLN in dogs with a pre-operative diagnosis of melanoma or MCT in various locations by correlating CTL findings with histopathology. The hypothesis was that CTL would not be able to determine the metastatic status of lymph nodes, based on author experience. Dogs were prospectively enrolled and underwent CTL and subsequent SLN extirpation. Histopathology results for the primary tumour, SLN, and additional extirpated lymph nodes were recorded. Fifteen dogs were enrolled and 21 SLN were evaluated. The SLN enhancement pattern (heterogeneous, homogenous or peripheral) was not associated with metastasis, nor was the attenuation value at 1 minute, 5 minutes, or the change in attenuation value. No correlation was found between CTL findings and metastatic status of SLNs. Based on these results, CTL alone cannot be used to diagnose SLN metastasis. Extirpation of the SLN with histopathology is recommended to diagnose lymph node metastasis in dogs with melanoma and MCT.

TI  - Male breast metastasis of ureteral cancer: a case report
T2  - SURGICAL CASE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Background: Breast metastasis from extra-mammary primary tumors is extremely rare. We recently experienced a rare case of a male breast metastasis of ureteral cancer and will provide a case report.Case presentation: A 74-year-old man developed a ureteral cancer and underwent left nephroureterectomy with lymph node dissection. Although enlarged abdominal lymph nodes did not disappear completely after chemoradiotherapy, further extensive therapy was not performed. A mass just below the nipple of his right breast was acknowledged and he visited our department. Histological diagnosis was invasive carcinoma. It was initially diagnosed as a primary breast cancer, and he underwent a mastectomy and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. There was no intraductal lesion and the border of the tumor was clear. It was very similar to that of the previous ureteral cancer. The final diagnosis was breast metastasis of ureteral cancer rather than primary breast cancer. The postoperative course was good, but multiple lung metastases appeared 2 months after surgery. He eventually died of cancerous lymphangiopathy.Conclusion: It is important to accurately diagnose primary breast cancer or breast metastasis so as not to cause extra-invasion, but it was considered difficult to make a complete preoperative diagnosis.

TI  - Detecting disturbed forest tracts in the Sariska Tiger Reserve, India, using forest canopy density and fragmentation models
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The paper explored the level of forest disturbance in the Sariska Tiger Reserve (STR) of Indian tropical forest. We acquired single scene image of Landsat-5 (1989) and Landsat-8 (2015) for the analysis. Disturbance map was produced using fragmentation and canopy density models. The map was categorized into high, moderate, low, and undisturbed forest tracts. Spatiotemporal analysis of forest disturbance (1989-2015) revealed that highly disturbed tracts experienced a decrease of 43%, while medium and low disturbed tracts showed an increase of 57% and 30%, respectively. Undisturbed forest tracts witnessed decrease mainly due to a decrease in very high canopy density and increase in forest fragmentation. Within cores I, II and III of STR, undisturbed forest tracts in core I have significantly declined due to increased anthropogenic activities. Thus, the study calls for immediate attention to check forest disturbance in core I of STR. Though the government has initiated relocation program of the villages and restoration of the STR, the execution process has still a long way to achieve the goal. The methodology adopted in this study can effectively be utilized for assessing the forest disturbance tracts at spatial scales.

TI  - Geochemical characteristics of iron ore deposits and processing of Landsat-8 data (geology, geomorphology and lineaments) in semi-arid region and using geospatial techniques
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The main aim of the present study is to investigate geochemical analysis of iron ore and iron-enriched mineralised zones and their source identification by understanding lithological, structural and geomorphological units. The geology, geomorphology and lineament maps were prepared with help of Landsat 8 OLI satellite data and prepared thematic layers in two mandals namely Veerapunayunipalle and Pendlimarri of YSR Kadapa District, AP, India. Subsequently, geochemical analysis was performed in the mineralised zones to know the type and grade of the iron ore. The study revealed that the iron ore in the study area is of haematite (Fe2O3) type, and its mineralisation is confined to lineaments trending in E-W direction and are derived from ferruginous quartzites and shales belonging to the Cuddapah Supergroup. Based on the geochemical investigation, the overall grade of iron ore in respect of a Fe % in the study area is 39.04 which is commercially considered as lower grade and is useful for cement industry except for some villages like Chabali (56.76% Fe), Tummaluru (55.53% Fe), Animala (54.19% Fe) which is used for the steel industry.

TI  - Understanding and reconstructing the coastal sea level variations along the western boundary of the North Pacific
T2  - GEOSCIENCE LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - To better understand the coastal sea level (SL) variations along the western boundary of the North Pacific, we quantitatively estimate the contributions of various forcing to the coastal SL variations on seasonal and longer time scales. Based on a western boundary SL theory and a linear least-squares regression, we obtain a polynomial equation to estimate the coastal SL variations from ocean interior information, atmospheric forcing, as well as local steric effects. The estimated results can explain about 91% (93%) of the SL variations at tide gauges south (north) of the Kuroshio extension jet. It is found that the local thermosteric effect is dominant on seasonal time scales. On interannual time scales, the signals from ocean interior and atmospheric forcing are dominant. For decadal SL trends, the coastal SL rise is mainly resulted from the signals from the open ocean. With the same polynomial equation, the SL variations at 6 new tide gauges were estimated and compared to the nearest satellite measurements. The newly estimated SL is generally in much better agreement with the tide gauge data than the satellite data. It is promising to apply the newly derived polynomial equation to estimate SL variations along the western boundary of the North Pacific where tide gauge data are not available. Particularly, the approach is promising to estimate the future SL change given the required oceanic and atmospheric conditions.

TI  - Surface plasmon resonance assay for exosomes based on aptamer recognition and polydopamine-functionalized gold nanoparticles for signal amplification
T2  - MICROCHIMICA ACTA
M3  - Article
AB  - A novel surface plasmon resonance (SPR) strategy is introduced for the specific determination of exosomes based on aptamer recognition and polydopamine-functionalized gold nanoparticle (Au@PDA NP)-assisted signal amplification. Exosomes derived from hepatic carcinoma SMMC-7721 were selected as the model target. SMMC-7721 exosomes can be specifically captured by the aptamer ZY-sls that was complementary to the DNA tetrahedron probes (DTPs), and then the CD63 aptamer-linked Au@PDA NPs recognized SMMC-7721 exosomes for signal amplification. The DTPs were modified on a Au film for preventing Au deposition on the surface during the introduction of HAuCl4, and PDA coated on the AuNPs was used to reduce HAuCl4 in situ without any reductant assistance. It results in a further enhanced SPR signal. The assay can clearly distinguish SMMC-7721 exosomes from others (HepG2 exosomes, Bel-7404 exosomes, L02 exosomes, MCF-7 exosomes, and SW480 exosomes, respectively). SMMC-7721 exosomes are specifically determined as low as 5.6 x 10(5) particles mL(-1). The method has successfully achieved specific determination of SMMC-7721 exosomes even in 50% of human serum without any pretreatment.

TI  - Is perinatal asphyxia predictable?
T2  - BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH
M3  - Article
AB  - Background The objective of our study was to evaluate the association between perinatal asphyxia and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) with the presence of ante and intrapartum risk factors and/or abnormal fetal heart rate (FHR) findings, in order to improve maternal and neonatal management. Methods We did a prospective observational cohort study from a network of four hospitals (one Hub center with neonatal intensive care unit and three level I Spoke centers) between 2014 and 2016. Neonates of gestational age >= 35 weeks, birthweight >= 1800 g, without lethal malformations were included if diagnosed with perinatal asphyxia, defined as pH <= 7.0 or Base Excess (BE) <= - 12 mMol/L in Umbical Artery (UA) or within 1 h, 10 min Apgar < 5, or need for resuscitation > 10 min. FHR monitoring was classified in three categories according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Pregnancies were divided into four classes: 1) low risk; 2) antepartum risk; 3) intrapartum risk; 4) and both ante and intrapartum risk. In the first six hours of life asphyxiated neonates were evaluated using the Thomson score (TS): if TS >= 5 neonates were transferred to Hub for further assessment; if TS >= 7 hypothermia was indicated. Results Perinatal asphyxia occurred in 21.5 parts per thousand cases (321/14,896) and HIE in 1.1 parts per thousand (16/14,896). The total study population was composed of 281 asphyxiated neonates: 68/5152 (1.3%) born at Hub and 213/9744 (2.2%) at Spokes (p < 0.001, OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.45-0.79). 32/213 (15%) neonates were transferred from Spokes to Hub. Overall, 12/281 were treated with hypothermia. HIE occurred in 16/281 (5.7%) neonates: four grade I, eight grade II and four grade III. Incidence of HIE was not different between Hub and Spokes. Pregnancies resulting in asphyxiated neonates were classified as class 1) 1.1%, 2) 52.3%, 3) 3.2%, and 4) 43.4%. Sentinel events occurred in 23.5% of the cases and FHR was category II or III in 50.5% of the cases. 40.2% cases of asphyxia and 18.8% cases of HIE were not preceded by sentinel events or abnormal FHR. Conclusions We identified at least one risk factor associated with all cases of HIE and with most cases of perinatal asphyxia. In absence of risk factors, the probability of developing perinatal asphyxia resulted extremely low. FHR monitoring alone is not a reliable tool for detecting the probability of eventual asphyxia.

TI  - A novel QIM-DCT based fusion approach for classification of remote sensing images via PSO and SVM models
T2  - SOFT COMPUTING
M3  - Article
AB  - Fusion of panchromatic and multispectral images has become a research interest for the classification of remote sensing images. The spectral and spatial resolutions of different images give better information with the aid of image classification. However, fusing pixels for various satellite images is difficult due to the nature of original image consists of complex information. Similarly, most of the existing fusion algorithms implement a unified processing over the whole part of the image, thereby leaving certain important needs out of consideration. The main aim of our proposed approach is to fuse the images by gathering all important information from multiple images with minimum errors. In this paper, we propose a novel quantization index modulation with discrete contourlet transform-based fusion approach for classification of remote sensing images (LISS IV sensor). In order to improve the image fusion performance, we eliminate certain noises (salt, pepper, and Gaussian) using Bayesian filter with Adaptive Type-2 Fuzzy System. After image fusion, we make image classification by two steps of processes including deep multi-feature extraction and feature selection. Multiple features such as spectral, shape, global and local features are extracted using Affine Transformation (0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, and 270 degrees), and then the best set of features are chosen by mutual information and maximal information coefficients. Finally, the image is classified into seven classes using PSO and SVM namely Urban, Vegetation, Wetland, Tank, Water Area, Bare Land, and Roadways. MATLAB R2017b has been used for evaluation of the LISS IV images. Experimental results revealed that our proposed approach is very effective in terms of their classification accuracy.

TI  - Mapping the impacts of cyclone Idai in Mozambique using Sentinel-2 and OBIA approach
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Cyclones are some of the most devastating natural disasters that cause major losses of life and property. A few months after Cyclone Idai swept through Beira, Mozambique between 4 and 20 March 2019. An analysis is presented on the impacts of this disaster by assessing the extent of the floods. This study employed Sentinel-2 imagery and remote sensing techniques including a threshold analysis and an object-based image analysis (OBIA) approach. Water and non-water land covers were established by using a Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), while the classification approach assessed three land covers. These assessments were done on four dates: (1) 31 January (before), (2) 25 February 20 (before), (3) 12 March (during) and (4) 16 April (after). Accuracies ranging from 74% to 90% were attained. The OBIA approach showed that 61% of the study area was affected by floods, while the threshold approach showed that 55% of the area was flooded. Areas with low elevation and close to the coast were more effected by the floods. After the cyclone, the area under water reduced by more than 20%. The results here could be useful for developing early warning systems, risk assessment, establishing damage and developing natural hazard policies.

AB  - Background For patients with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), multiple national cancer organizations recommend that sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) be offered when treated with mastectomy, but not when treated with breast-conserving surgery (BCS). This study analyzes national surgical trends of SLNB and axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in DCIS patients undergoing breast surgery with the aim to quantify deviations from national guidelines. Methods A retrospective cohort analysis of the American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) database from 2005 to 2017 identified patients with DCIS. Patients were categorized by their primary method of breast surgery, i.e. mastectomy or BCS, then further categorized by their axillary lymph node (ALN) management, i.e. no intervention, SLNB, or ALND. Data analysis was conducted via linear regression and a non-parametric Mann-Kendall test to assess a temporal trend and Sen's slope. Results Overall, 43,448 patients with DCIS met the inclusion criteria: 20,504 underwent mastectomy and 22,944 underwent BCS. Analysis of DCIS patients from 2005 to 2017 revealed that ALND decreased and SLNB increased in every subgroup, regardless of surgical treatment modality. Evaluation in the mastectomy group increased overall: mastectomy alone increased from 57.1 to 65.8% (p < 0.01) and mastectomy with immediate reconstruction increased from 58.5 to 72.1% (p < 0.01). Increases also occurred in the total BCS population: partial mastectomy increased from 14.0 to 21.1% and oncoplastic surgery increased from 10.5 to 23.0% (both p < 0.01). Conclusions Despite national guideline recommendations for the management of ALN surgery in DCIS patients, approximately 20-30% of cases continue to not follow these guidelines. This warrants further education for surgeons and patients.

TI  - Revamping land coverage analysis using aerial satellite image mapping
T2  - TRANSACTIONS ON EMERGING TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES
M3  - Article
AB  - The customary terrestrial survey involves direct measurement of the land dimension in a particular area. The information accuracy of land dimension changes person to person in the existing method. Moreover, it consumes more time to conduct an assessment and produces a precise outcome. Hence, Remote Sensing offers an effective solution for accurate measurement using the Land Satellite Image Mapping with Geographic Positioning System (GPS) values. Therefore, the proposed model concentrates on the analysis of the object using Landsat Image through categorization based on the field cover analysis. The Geographic Information System (GIS) facilitates convenient measurement to determine the land dimension along with Georeferential tag. In addition to that, the features of each object are preprocessed to reduce the noise and the acquired information is stored in the classifier. Also, the features are trained using 2-fold validation, which will improve efficiency during detection. Finally, the soft hyperplane discriminators of Gaussian produce better separation accuracy compared to feature classes and object prediction. Furthermore, the Bag of feature model performance is improved by working on Hue, Saturation, and Intensity color map with multifeatured extractions on the sample images. The proposed model was trained with 1800 image samples of various land covers. On testing, the classifiers aggregate 91.4% accuracy on cross-evaluation between true class and predicted class using medium Gaussian Support Vector Machine.

TI  - A poststructural analysis of study abroad as teacher preparation pedagogy: Thinking through theory for generative practice
T2  - THEORY INTO PRACTICE
M3  - Article
AB  - Scholarship in teacher education reflects study abroad as established pedagogy and part of 'best practices' in preparing K-12 teachers for diverse classrooms. Three discourses dominate the literature to affirm the positive role of study abroad: (a) changing White preservice teachers' perceptions of self and others; (b) increasing their multicultural knowledge and global-mindedness; and, (c) developing competencies for culturally responsive classroom practice. In drawing from several scholars, this article uses poststructural analysis to trouble the above discourses that articulate study abroad within normalizing conceptions of self and other, universal worldview of multicultural knowledge and global-mindedness, and fixed conceptualization of culturally responsive teaching, so that new ways of thinking about disciplinary knowledge and pedagogical practice emerge. This article recommends teacher education pedagogies include critical frames of analyses when interpreting study abroad experiences for thinking through theory for generative practice and reclaiming epistemic reflexivity in how we do research.

TI  - CD8-positive memory T cells in tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with breast cancer
T2  - BMC CANCER
M3  - Article
AB  - BackgroundHuman immunological memory is a hallmark of the adaptive immune system and plays an important role in the development of effective immune responses against tumors. In the present study, we aimed to determine the frequencies of CD8(+) memory T cell subsets including T stem cell memory (TSCM) in tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with breast cancer (BC).MethodsMononuclear cells were obtained from axillary lymph nodes of 52 untreated patients with BC and stained for CD8, CCR7, CD45RO, CD95 markers to detect different subtypes of memory cells in the CD8(+) lymphocyte population. Data were acquired on four-color flow cytometer and analyzed with CellQuest Pro software.ResultsWe observed that 47.652.66% of CD8(+) lymphocytes expressed the CD45RO, a marker for memory T cells. Statistical analysis showed that the total frequency of central memory T cells (TCM) and their subset with low CD45RO expression was significantly higher in tumor-involved nodes compared to tumor-free ones (P =0.024 and P =0.017, respectively). The level of CD95 expression (based on mean fluorescence intensity) on the surface of TCM, their CD45RO(hi) and CD45RO(low) subsets, and TSCM was higher in patients with stage II compared to those in stage I (P <0.05). In addition, the percentage of naive CD8(+) T cells was significantly lower in tumor-involved lymph nodes compared to tumor-free ones (P =0.025).Conclusions p id=Par Our data collectively indicate no significant differences in the frequencies of CD8(+) lymphocytes or their memory subsets in tumor-draining lymph nodes of patients with BC. However, the frequency of CD45(low) TCM was higher in tumor-involved nodes. Along with a decrease in the frequency of naive T cells, the higher frequency of CD45(low) TCM suggests that despite the immune reaction to provide a pool of effective memory cells, it is blocked in early-stage of memory cells' differentiation (CD45RO(low)), probably by tumor-derived suppressive factors. Identifying the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind this suppression can provide invaluable tools for adoptive T cell therapies in cancer.

TI  - Intraoperative high dose rate brachytherapy during breast-conserving surgery: A Prospective Pilot Study
T2  - SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose:To evaluate feasibility, quality of life, toxicity, and cosmetic outcome for intraoperative breast cancer brachytherapy after breast-conserving surgery using high dose rate brachytherapy.Methods and materials:Fifty-two consecutive women, > 50 years old, diagnosed with a unifocal non-lobular breast cancer <= 3 cm, N0, underwent breast-conserving surgery and sentinel node biopsy. Twenty-five women received intraoperative brachytherapy pre-pathology at primary surgery and the others post-pathology, during a second procedure. An applicator, connected to a high dose rate afterloader, was used. Two of the women were excluded due to metastases found per-operatively at a frozen section from the sentinel node. Quality of life was evaluated using two validated health questionnaires. Treatment toxicity was documented according to the LENT-SOMA scale by two oncologists. The cosmetic result was evaluated using the validated freely available software BCCT.core 2.0.Results:The clinical procedure worked out well logistically. Seven women received supplementary external radiotherapy due to insufficient margins and, in one case, poor adaptation of the breast parenchyma to the applicator. No serious adverse effects from irradiation were registered. The results from the health questionnaires showed no major differences compared with reference groups from the Swedish population. Only two women were registered as having a "poor" cosmetic result while a majority of the women had a "good" outcome.Conclusion:This pilot study shows that intraoperative brachytherapy is a feasible procedure and encourages further trials evaluating its role in treatment of early breast cancer.

TI  - Mapping impervious surface distribution in China using multi-source remotely sensed data
T2  - GISCIENCE & REMOTE SENSING
M3  - Article
AB  - Impervious surface area (ISA) data are required for such studies as urban environmental modeling, hydrological modeling, and socioeconomic analysis, but updating these datasets in a large area remains a challenge due to the complex urban landscapes consisting of different materials and colors with various spatial patterns. This research explores the integration of multi-source remotely sensed data for mapping China's ISA distribution at 30-m spatial resolution. The integration of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite Day/Night Band (VIIRS DNB) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data were used to extract initial ISA with spatial resolution of 250 m using a thresholding approach. The Landsat-derived NDVI and Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI) were used to remove vegetation and water areas from the mixed pixels that existed in the initial ISA data. The spectral signatures of these ISA data were further extracted from Landsat multispectral images and used to refine the ISA data using expert knowledge. The results indicate that the integration of multi-source data can successfully map ISA distribution with 30-m spatial resolution in China with producer's and user's accuracies of 83.1 and 91.9%, respectively. These ISA data are valuable for better management of urban landscapes and for use as an input in other studies such as socioeconomic and environmental modeling.

TI  - Impact of Hurricane Maria on Beach Erosion in Puerto Rico: Remote Sensing and Causal Inference
T2  - GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS
M3  - Article
AB  - Beach erosion due to large storms critically affects coastal vulnerability, but is challenging to monitor and quantify. Attributing erosion to a specific storm requires a reliable counterfactual scenario: hypothetical beach conditions, absent the storm. Calibrating models to construct counterfactuals requires numerous observations that are rarely available. Storm paths are unpredictable, making long-term instrumentation of specific beaches costly. Optical remote sensing is hampered by persistent cloud cover. We use Sentinel-1 satellite radar imagery to monitor shoreline changes through clouds and propose regression discontinuity as a strategy to estimate the causal effect of large storms on beach erosion. Applied to 75 beaches across Puerto Rico, the approach detects shoreline changes with a root-mean-square error comparable to the resolution of the imagery. Hurricane Maria caused an erosion of 3 to 5 m along its path, up to 40 m at particular beaches. Results reveal strong local disparities that are consistent with simulated nearshore hydrodynamic conditions.

TI  - Modelling species distributions in dynamic landscapes: The importance of the temporal dimension
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY
M3  - Article
AB  - Aim Temporal variation in environmental conditions merits greater consideration in species distribution models (SDMs), and is especially relevant in dynamic systems, such as arid and semi-arid environments, where precipitation and resource pulses are unpredictable in space and time. Species responses to this spatio-temporal variation include tracking resource availability with nomadic life histories or reliance on refugia that provide stable, high-quality habitat. This study evaluated whether inclusion of temporal variables representing short- and long-term environmental variation improves SDMs.Location Great Western Woodlands, Western Australia.Taxon Birds.Methods Temporal information was added to SDMs of 36 bird species with two types of environmental predictor variables: (a) time-specific estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) and precipitation paired to survey dates; and (b) estimates of the temporal stability of GPP over the MODIS archive, providing an index of the degree to which sites might function as habitat refugia from disturbance and drought. Predictions were compared with those from SDMs using static variables from single time points.Results Model predictions revealed considerable temporal variation in species distributions and various spatio-temporal responses to environmental variation. Temporal variables modestly improved model performance overall, but results were species-specific. Time-specific environmental variables were most important to models of nomadic and nectivorous species, which experienced the greatest improvements in model performance when including temporal variables, and showed the greatest disagreement between temporal and static model predictions, and the predictions of temporal models applied to different time points. Long-term environmental variation was relevant across species groups, though the chosen measure of variability differed between species.Main Conclusions Temporal variation influences species distributions and may need to be explicitly included in SDMs. However, the nature and degree of species' responses to environmental dynamics depends on species movement behaviours; appropriate selection of temporal variables for SDMs requires ecological understanding of the species of interest. Results of spatio-temporal SDMs can identify the extent to which landscape management must account for temporal variability to achieve conservation goals.

TI  - Synergetic Satellite Trend Analysis of Aerosol and Warm Cloud Properties ver Ocean and Its Implication for Aerosol-Cloud Interactions
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Decadal-scale trends in aerosol and cloud properties provide important ways for understanding aerosol-cloud interactions. In this paper, by using MODIS products (2003-2017), we analyze synergetic trends in aerosol properties and warm cloud properties over global ocean. Cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) and aerosol parameters (aerosol optical depth, angstrom exponent, and aerosol index) show consistent decreasing trend over East Coast of the United States (EUS), west coast of Europe (WEU), and east coast of China (EC), and no significant trend in liquid water path is found over these regions during the period 2003-2017. Over regions with significant long-term trends of aerosol loading and CDNC (e.g., EUS and WEU), the sensitivity of CDNC to aerosol loading based on the long-term trend is closer to those derived from ground and aircraft observations and larger than those derived from instantaneous satellite observations, providing an alternative way for quantifying aerosol-cloud interactions. A clear shift in the normalized probability density function of CDNC between the first 5 years (2003-2007) and the last 5 years (2013-2017) is found, with a decrease of around 50% in the occurrence frequency of high CDNC (>400 cm(-3)) over EUS and WEU. The relative variances of cloud droplet effective radius generally decrease with decreasing aerosol loading, providing large-scale evidence for the effects of anthropogenic aerosols on the dispersion of cloud droplet size distribution. The long-term satellite data sets provide great opportunities for quantifying aerosol-cloud interactions and further confronting these interactions in climate models in the future.

TI  - DINCAE 1.0: a convolutional neural network with error estimates to reconstruct sea surface temperature satellite observations
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - A method to reconstruct missing data in sea surface temperature data using a neural network is presented. Satellite observations working in the optical and infrared bands are affected by clouds, which obscure part of the ocean underneath. In this paper, a neural network with the structure of a convolutional auto-encoder is developed to reconstruct the missing data based on the available cloud-free pixels in satellite images. Contrary to standard image reconstruction with neural networks, this application requires a method to handle missing data (or data with variable accuracy) in the training phase. The present work shows a consistent approach which uses the satellite data and its expected error variance as input and provides the reconstructed field along with its expected error variance as output. The neural network is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the observed value. The approach, called DINCAE (Data INterpolating Convolutional Auto-Encoder), is applied to a 25-year time series of Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sea surface temperature data and compared to DINEOF (Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions), a commonly used method to reconstruct missing data based on an EOF (empirical orthogonal function) decomposition. The reconstruction error of both approaches is computed using cross-validation and in situ observations from the World Ocean Database. DINCAE results have lower error while showing higher variability than the DINEOF reconstruction.

TI  - Quantifying impacts of the 2018 drought on European ecosystems in comparison to 2003
T2  - BIOGEOSCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - In recent decades, an increasing persistence of atmospheric circulation patterns has been observed. In the course of the associated long-lasting anticyclonic summer circulations, heatwaves and drought spells often coincide, leading to so-called hotter droughts. Previous hotter droughts caused a decrease in agricultural yields and an increase in tree mortality. Thus, they had a remarkable effect on carbon budgets and negative economic impacts. Consequently, a quantification of ecosystem responses to hotter droughts and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms are crucial. In this context, the European hotter drought of the year 2018 may be considered a key event. As a first step towards the quantification of its causes and consequences, we here assess anomalies of atmospheric circulation patterns, maximum temperature, and climatic water balance as potential drivers of ecosystem responses which are quantified by remote sensing using the MODIS vegetation indices (VIs) normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI). To place the drought of 2018 within a climatological context, we compare its climatic features and remotely sensed ecosystem response with the extreme hot drought of 2003. The year 2018 was characterized by a climatic dipole, featuring extremely hot and dry weather conditions north of the Alps but comparably cool and moist conditions across large parts of the Mediterranean. Analysing the ecosystem response of five dominant land cover classes, we found significant positive effects of climatic water balance on ecosystem VI response. Negative drought impacts appeared to affect an area 1.5 times larger and to be significantly stronger in July 2018 compared to August 2003, i.e. at the respective peak of drought. Moreover, we found a significantly higher sensitivity of pastures and arable land to climatic water balance compared to forests in both years. We explain the stronger coupling and higher sensitivity of ecosystem response in 2018 by the prevailing climatic dipole: while the generally water-limited ecosystems of the Mediterranean experienced above-average climatic water balance, the less drought-adapted ecosystems of central and northern Europe experienced a record hot drought. In conclusion, this study quantifies the drought of 2018 as a yet unprecedented event, outlines hotspots of drought-impacted areas in 2018 which should be given particular attention in follow-up studies, and provides valuable insights into the heterogeneous responses of the dominant European ecosystems to hotter drought.

T2  - Facts, views & vision in ObGyn
M3  - Journal Article
AB  - BACKGROUND: The therapeutic value of lymphadenectomy in early stage endometrial cancer (EC) is still debated. Sentinel-lymph-node identified with indocyanine green (ICG) can replace lymphadenectomy in the staging of endometrial cancer minimizing the potential morbidity of a complete lymphadenectomy. The aim of this study was to analyze our initial experience using indocyanine green for sentinel-lymph-node mapping in a minimally robotic-assisted laparoscopic approach with Da Vinci XI near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging system.METHODS: A total of 23 patients who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery with the Da Vinci Xi Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with NIR imaging and ICG fluorescence detection for early stage EC were retrospectively analyzed.RESULTS: Sentinel-lymph-node mapping was achieved in 18 patients for a detection rate of 78.26%, bilateral pelvic detection was possible in 14 patients (60.9%) and no sentinel-lymph-node mapping was noted in 4 patients (17.4%). We compared 11 patients (Group 1) at intermediate and high- risk of recurrence who underwent sentinel-lymph- node mapping and pelvic lymphadenectomy and 12 patients (Group 2) at low risk of recurrence who underwent only sentinel-lymph-node mapping. A statistically significant difference was found for the average operation time and for the hospital stays.CONCLUSIONS: The high detection rate, absence of intraoperative or postoperative complications, the short time required for mapping and removal of the sentinel-lymph-nodes and the short duration of the hospital stay, support performing sentinel-lymph-node in all women with early endometrial cancer.

TI  - Evaluation of Evaporation Climatology for the Congo Basin Wet Seasons in 11 Global Climate Models
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Across the Congo, there is a wide spread in rainfall in the two wet seasons in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 global climate models (GCMs). As the Congo is believed to be a moisture recycling hot spot, the evaporation of excess water from the land surface in some models could be amplifying the model spread in rainfall. This study performs an exploratory process-based evaluation of Congo Basin evaporation in 11 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 GCMs that took part in the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project. Our aims are to improve scientific understanding about Congo evaporation, and to determine whether there are opportunities to improve how models produce Congo evaporation. Climatologically, we find that models with "realistic" rainfall simulate higher rainfall in November, the peak of the second wet season, than March, the peak of the first. However, models with "realistic" evaporation simulate lower evaporation in November than March, because these models suppress the transpiration component of the evaporation in November relative to March. In both wet seasons, subgrid rainfall schemes make these models simulate a credible ratio of transpiration to canopy evaporation, and cause them to generate evaporation in a more realistic manner. We therefore trust how these models produce evaporation in the wet seasons, and argue that lower transpiration is likely to explain why evaporation is lower in November than March in reality. We also suggest that using subgrid rainfall schemes in all GCMs could improve how models produce Congo evaporation during the wet seasons. This might reduce the model spread in Congo rainfall.

TI  - The Influence of Elevated Smoke Layers on Stratocumulus Clouds Over the SE Atlantic in the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Model
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Previous evaluations of simulated aerosol transport over the south-east Atlantic by global aerosol models, including the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) atmospheric general circulation model, showed that the bulk of the modeled smoke aerosol layer resided similar to 1-2 km lower than Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) lidar observations. Using this finding as the motivation, this study examines the changes in model-simulated cloud properties in response to redistributing the vertical placement of the aerosol over the ocean. Ten years (2006-2015) of CALIOP-retrieved smoke aerosol extinction profiles were used to redistribute the model-simulated aerosol mass on a monthly mean basis, keeping the column aerosol mass conserved. The results from the model sensitivity experiments show that elevating the aerosol layer to higher levels in agreement with CALIOP observations causes an increase in cloud fractions by similar to 33% for shallow marine boundary layers (MBL) and a decrease by similar to 30% for deeper MBL. For a shallow MBL, aerosol-induced warming within the cloud layers for the lower altitude aerosol case decreases relative humidity at these levels and leads to a reduction of overall cloud amount compared to the elevated aerosol case. For a deeper MBL, however, aerosol heating within the upper cloud levels in the lower altitude aerosol case increases the underlying MBL stability, which suppresses the cloud vertical extent, enhances cloud cover, and delays the stratocumulus to cumulus transition. Finally, aerosol redistribution impacts on radiative forcing are investigated, which appear to be mainly driven by the changes in cloud area fractions rather than in-cloud liquid water path changes between the model experiments.

TI  - Finding the Fingerprint of Anthropogenic Climate Change in Marine Phytoplankton Abundance
T2  - CURRENT CLIMATE CHANGE REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Purpose of Review We review how phytoplankton abundance may be responding to the increase in stratification associated with anthropogenic climate change, providing context on the utility of remote sensing datasets and Earth system model output to understand these perturbations. Recent Findings Assessing disruption in the ocean biosphere using remote sensing datasets is challenged by the relatively short length of the observational record, restricting our ability to disentangle fluctuations due to internal climate variability from those imposed by externally forced anthropogenic trends. Ensembles of Earth system models can be used to quantify past and future drivers, but may not skillfully predict observed spatial patterns and temporal dynamics in marine phytoplankton. To better understand the role of internal climate variability in the observational record, we construct a synthetic ensemble of global chlorophyll concentration over the MODIS satellite mission using statistical emulation techniques. We emphasize the use of a synthetic ensemble to illuminate the role of internal climate variability in the evolution of the ocean biosphere over time.

TI  - Heat health risk assessment in Philippine cities using remotely sensed data and social-ecological indicators
T2  - NATURE COMMUNICATIONS
M3  - Article
AB  - More than half of the world's population currently live in urban areas and are particularly at risk from the combined effects of the urban heat island phenomenon and heat increases due to climate change. Here, by using remotely sensed surface temperature data and social-ecological indicators, focusing on the hot dry season, and applying the risk framework of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we assessed the current heat health risk in 139 Philippine cities, which account for about 40% of the country's total population. The cities at high or very high risk are found in Metro Manila, where levels of heat hazard and exposure are high. The most vulnerable cities are, however, found mainly outside the national capital region, where sensitivity is higher and capacity to cope and adapt is lower. Cities with high levels of heat vulnerability and exposure must be prioritized for adaptation. Our results will contribute to risk profiling in the Philippines and to the understanding of city-level heat health risks in developing regions of the Asia-Pacific. Evaluating the heat risk among city dwellers is important. Here, the authors assessed the heat risk in Philippine cities using remote sensing data and social-ecological indicators and found that the cities at high or very high risk are found in Metro Manila, where levels of heat hazard and exposure are high.

TI  - Europe's offshore winds assessed with synthetic aperture radar, ASCAT and WRF
T2  - WIND ENERGY SCIENCE
M3  - Article
AB  - Europe's offshore wind resource mapping is part of the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA) international consortium effort. This study presents the results of analysis of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ocean wind maps based on Envisat and Sentinel-1 with a brief description of the wind retrieval process and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) ocean wind maps. The wind statistics at 10 and 100 m above mean sea level (a.m.s.1.) height using an extrapolation procedure involving simulated long-term stability over oceans are presented for both SAR and ASCAT. Furthermore, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) offshore wind atlas of NEWA is presented. This has 3 km grid spacing with data every 30 min for 30 years from 1989 to 2018, while ASCAT has 12.5 km and SAR has 2 km grid spacing. Offshore mean wind speed maps at 100 m a.m.s.l. height from ASCAT, SAR, WRF and ERAS at a European scale are compared. A case study on offshore winds near Crete compares SAR and WRF for flow from the north, west and all directions.The paper highlights the ability of the WRF model to simulate the overall European wind climatology and the near-coastal winds constrained by the resolution of the coastal topography in the WRF model simulations.

TI  - Primary productivity connects hilsa fishery in the Bay of Bengal
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Tropical hilsa shad (Tenualosa ilisha) contributes significantly to the society and economy of Bangladesh, India and Myanmar, but little is known about their habitats across the life cycle and their relationship with environmental drivers. This study describes spatial and temporal variability of productivity in the Bay of Bengal (BoB) relating to hilsa fishery. Decadal data on net primary productivity, nutrients (i.e. nitrate, phosphate and silicate) and zooplankton were collected from Aqua MODIS, world ocean database and COPEPOD respectively with spatial resolution 1 degrees x1 degrees. Moreover, monthly abundance of phytoplankton, hilsa catch and long-term catch dynamics were analyzed to determine the associations between variables. The present study was extended over 3.568 million km(2) area, of which 0.131-0.213 million km(2) area characterized as the most productive with net primary production of >2,000mgC/m(2)/day, 0.373-0.861 million km(2) area as moderately productive with 500-2,000mgC/m(2)/day, and 2.517-3.040 million km(2) area as the least productive with <500mgC/m(2)/day which were consistent with field verification data. In case of nutrients, the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) delta was rich in nitrate and phosphate than that of the Ayeyarwady delta, while silicate concentration persisted high all over the northern BoB including the deltas. A peak abundance of phytoplankton was observed in GBM delta during the months of August-November, when similar to 80% of total hilsa are harvested in Bangladesh annually. Variations in seasonal productivity linked with nutrients and phytoplankton abundance are important factors for predicting hilsa habitat and their migration patterns in the deltaic regions and shelf waters of BoB. These results can be useful in forecasting potential responses of the hilsa in BoB ecosystem to changing global ocean productivity.

TI  - Large-Scale Characteristics of Tropical Convective Systems Through the Prism of Cloud Regime
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - We employ the cloud regime concept to identify large-scale tropical convective systems and investigate their characteristics in terms of organization and precipitation. The tropical cloud regimes (TCRs) are derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud optical thickness and cloud top pressure two-dimensional joint histograms. We focus on the TCRs that have relatively low cloud top pressures and high cloud optical thicknesses, as well as heavy precipitation, namely, TCR1 (convective core-dominant), TCR2 (various high clouds), and TCR3 (anvils). The horizontal size of aggregates of TCR1, TCR2, or TCR3 occurrences (TCR123) is identified as the number of contiguous 1 degrees x 1 degrees grid cells occupied by either of these three TCRs. For the small- to intermediate-size aggregates (TCR123 size 20 to 160 one-degree grid cells), there is large variability in the fraction of the aggregate each TCR occupies, but generally, TCR2 exhibits the highest fraction. As the total system size grows, the variability shrinks and for the largest systems ratios eventually converge to 0.3, 0.2, and 0.5 for TCR1, TCR2, and TCR3, respectively. The mean precipitation of convective core-rich TCR1 is generally high for the systems of intermediate size (80-160 one-degree grid cells) but with the highest mean coming from smaller systems of 20-40 grid cells. For the largest systems, their mean precipitation in areas containing cores (TCR1) are relatively low with suppressed variation. The mean precipitation rates of TCR2 and TCR3 in a TCR123 aggregate tend to be stronger when accompanying TCR1 mean precipitation rate is also high.Plain Language Summary Tropical convection systems often grow larger than several thousand kilometers in diameter. In this study, we identify these large systems using gridded satellite observations of cloud extinction and cloud top height. Using the concept of "cloud regime" that helps to classify and assign cloud observations to preset cloud classes, we can quantify the characteristics of large-scale tropical convective systems such as the area of the system occupied by the most intense convection. This area varies widely for systems of smaller sizes but is confined to a limited range around 30% of the total area for the largest systems. In addition, the mean precipitation in the area of strongest convective activity is not the heaviest for the largest systems but rather for the systems of moderate size. As the systems become larger, both area fraction and precipitation variabilities decrease.

TI  - Identification and lipolytic activity of yeasts isolated from foods and wastes
T2  - MYCOLOGY-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL ON FUNGAL BIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Thirty-three yeasts were isolated from palm oil industrial wastes and traditional fermented foods in Thailand. Based on the analysis of the sequences of the D1/D2 region of the large subunit ribosomal RNA gene (LSU rDNA) and their phenotypic characteristics, they were identified as Pichia kudriavzevii (11 isolates), Candida ethanolica (1 isolate), Clavispora lusitaniae (2 isolates), Ogataea polymorpha (1 isolate), Hanseniaspora opuntiae (1 isolate), Lodderomyces elongisporus (1 isolate), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2 isolates), C. tropicalis (5 isolates), Yarrowia lipolytica (2 isolates), Magnusiomyces ingens (1 isolate), and Magnusiomyces capitatus (3 isolates), Trichosporon insectorum (1 isolate), and Trichosporon asteroides (2 isolates). Seven strains, T. insectorum 4E-1D, M. capitatus 5E-1T and 5E-2D, T. asteroides 8E-1T and 8E-1D, and Y. lipolytica Fy-12 and Fy-13, showed high lipolytic activity ranged from 5.21 +/- 0.09 to 45.68 +/- 2.37 U/mL. Moreover, these seven strains exhibited good lipolytic activity after culturing in the medium containing palm oil (11.79 +/- 0.67 to 28.19 +/- 4.84 U/mL) and soy oil (9.14 +/- 1.08 to 22.97 +/- 0.69 U/mL) as lipase inducers. The result of this study suggests that the palm oil industrial wastes and Thai fermented foods could be promised as the invaluable sources of lipolytic yeasts.

TI  - LUCC-Driven Changes in Gross Primary Production and Actual Evapotranspiration in Northern China
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - Gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET) are the key variables in global carbon and water cycle, respectively. Therefore, it is important to understand how they respond to land use and land cover change (LUCC). Northern China has experienced dramatic LUCC because of a large-scale ecological restoration project implemented since 1999. This study uses a diagnostic model (PML-V2) driven by satellite data to quantify LUCC-driven changes in GPP and ET, at 500 m resolution in northern China from 2004 to 2017. The results indicate that the GPP and ET of northern China has increased by 164 TgC year(-1) and 13 km(3) year(-1). The GPP and ET are strongly increased in the Loess Plateau and Northeast China Plain in the research period, especially after 2009. Cropland has the highest GPP change of 184 gC m(-2) year(-1) was in Loess Plateau, followed by the Northeast China Plain (128 gC m(-2) year-1) and then the Inner Mongolia Plateau (82 gC m(-2) year(-1)). The highest ET increase of 45 mm year(-1) occurs in shrubland in the Loess Plateau, followed by the increase of 20 mm year(-1) in the Northeast China Plain. The increase in leaf area index is the major cause of GPP and ET increases for these regions. Our results suggest that it is necessary to carefully plan the afforestation and other land use change patterns for sustainable water resources management.

TI  - Global partitioning of runoff generation mechanisms using remote sensing data
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
M3  - Article
AB  - A set of complex processes contribute to generate river runoff, which in the hydrological sciences are typically divided into two major categories: surface runoff, sometimes called Hortonian flow, and baseflow-driven runoff or Dunne flow. In this study, we examine the covariance of global satellite-based surface water inundation (SWI) observations with two remotely sensed hydrological variables, precipitation, and terrestrial water storage, to better understand how apparent runoff generation responds to these two dominant forcing mechanisms in different regions of the world. Terrestrial water storage observations come from NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission, while precipitation comes from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) combined product, and surface inundation levels from the NASA Surface WAter Microwave Product Series (SWAMPS) product. We evaluate the statistical relationship between surface water inundation, total water storage anomalies (TWS; TWSAs), and precipitation values under different time lag and quality control adjustments between the data products. We find that the global estimation of surface inundation improves when considering a quality control threshold of 50 % reliability for the SWAMPS data and after applying time lags ranging from 1 to 5 months. Precipitation and total water storage equally control the majority of surface inundation developments across the globe. The model tends to underestimate and overestimate at locations with high interannual variability and with low inundation measurements, respectively.

TI  - The 2000-2017 drought risk assessment of the western and southwestern basins in Iran
T2  - MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The study investigates the relationship between drought and vegetation variations in three main basins of western and southwestern of Iran, using the comprehensive approach of time-series analysis, Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), and anomaly calculation. A total of 30 ground stations' daily meteorological data and the MODIS 16-day composite NDVI products (2000-2017) were used in this case. The results showed that in the Great Karoun River (GKRW) and Karkheh River (KRW) sub-regions, the NDVI decreased slightly over the study period. Simultaneously, in the West Marginal (WMW) sub-region the NDVI slightly increased somewhat. Overall, the NDVI in the whole study area presented an insignificant decrease. Also the results found that there is a significant relationship (p < 0.02) between the NDVI (0.3-0.7) with spring drought and between NDVI (0.2-0.3) with fall drought (p < 0.01). There is a marginally significant relationship (R = 0.43, p = 0.07) between NDVI (0.3-0.4) with fall drought and a relatively high, but insignificant relationship between NDVI (0.7-0.8) with spring drought (R = 0.41, p = 0.09). Low temperature can play an important role in determining the relationship between SPI and NDVI, which evidenced that it can trade-off the effect of a very wet year. As well as a year with very wet condition can affect the NDVI of the coming years. Since summer is hot season in the study area and most of the vegetation consists of shrubs and grasslands, of which the NDVI ranges between 0.2 and 0.4, the vegetation cover can be significantly affected by a wet summer with abundant precipitation.

TI  - Diagnostic performance of standard breast MRI compared to dedicated axillary MRI for assessment of node-negative and node-positive breast cancer
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Objectives To investigate whether breast MRI has comparable diagnostic performance as dedicated axillary MRI regarding assessment of node-negative and node-positive breast cancer. Methods Forty-seven patients were included. All had undergone both breast MRI and dedicated axillary MRI, followed by surgery. All included breast MRI exams had complete field of view (FOV) of the axillary region. First, unenhanced T2-weighted (T2W) and subsequent diffusion-weighted (DW) images of both MRI exams were independently analyzed by two breast radiologists using a confidence scale and compared to histopathology. ADC values were measured by two researchers independently. Diagnostic performance parameters were calculated on a patient-by-patient basis. Results T2W breast MRI had the following diagnostic performance: sensitivity of 50.0% and 62.5%, specificity of 92.3%, PPV of 57.1% and 62.5%, NPV of 90.0% and 92.3%, and AUC of 0.72 for reader 1 and 0.78 for reader 2. T2W dedicated axillary MRI had the following diagnostic performance: sensitivity of 37.5% and 62.5%, specificity of 82.1% and 92.3%, PPV of 44.6% and 50.0%, NPV of 87.8% and 91.4%, and AUC of 0.65 for reader 1 and 0.73 for reader 2. In both evaluations, addition of DW images resulted in comparable diagnostic performance. For both breast MRI and dedicated axillary MRI, there was no significant difference between mean ADC values of benign and malignant lymph nodes. Conclusions T2W breast MRI with complete FOV of the axillary region has comparable diagnostic performance as T2W dedicated axillary MRI regarding assessment of node-negative and node-positive breast cancer. Optimization of T2W breast MRI protocol by including a complete FOV of the axillary region can, therefore, be recommended in clinical practice.

TI  - Worldview Under Stress: Preliminary Findings on Cardiovascular and Cortisol Stress Responses Predicted by Secularity, Religiosity, Spirituality, and Existential Search
T2  - JOURNAL OF RELIGION & HEALTH
M3  - Article
AB  - This study reports preliminary findings on the hypothesis that worldview can predict cardiovascular and cortisol responses to social stress. Based on theory and previous findings, we assumed that worldview security would provide a basis for stress resilience. Accordingly, religious and atheist individuals were expected to show higher stress resilience than spiritual and agnostic participants. Likewise, dimensional measures of religiosity and atheism were hypothesized to predict decreased, and existential search-indicating worldview insecurity-was hypothesized to predict increased physiological stress responses. Subjects included 50 university students who completed online questionnaires and took part in a standardized social stress test (Trier Social Stress Test). Systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP), heart rate (HR), and salivary cortisol (SC) were assessed at baseline, immediately after stress testing, and during a forty-minute recovery period. Worldview comparisons revealed lower cardiovascular stress responses among religious than among atheist and spiritual participants and particularly high baseline SC among spiritual participants. Across the entire sample, existential search showed substantial positive correlations with SBP, HR, and SC stress parameters. The findings suggest that worldview security might partly explain the health benefits often associated with religion.

TI  - The Stationary Banding Complex and Secondary Eyewall Formation in Tropical Cyclones
T2  - JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES
M3  - Article
AB  - 89 GHz passive microwave satellite data are used to develop a five year climatology of the incidence and morphology of the stationary banding complex in tropical cyclones and quantify changes in convective morphology prior to secondary eyewall formation. The stationary banding complex is shown to be present in 39% of passive microwave overpasses. Morphology varies substantially between tropical cyclones, with crossing angles ranging from 0.19 degrees to 61.78 degrees and azimuthal extents from 0.29 to 4.02 radians. Variations in the incidence and geometry of the stationary banding complex are observed in different environmental conditions and geographic locations. For 84 secondary eyewall formation events included in the sample, a stationary banding complex is observed within 6 hr of the secondary eyewall developing in 79% of cases. Within 12 hr prior to secondary eyewall formation, the crossing angle is significantly lower than its sample median, while the azimuthal extent is higher than its sample median. These results demonstrate that secondary eyewall formation is (most) often preceded by the formation and axisymmetrization of a stationary banding complex.

TI  - Evaluation of satellite-based aerosol datasets and the CAMS reanalysis over the ocean utilizing shipborne reference observations
T2  - ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES
M3  - Article
AB  - Reliable reference measurements over the ocean are essential for the evaluation and improvement of satellite- and model-based aerosol datasets. Within the framework of the Maritime Aerosol Network, shipborne reference datasets have been collected over the Atlantic Ocean since 2004 with Microtops Sun photometers. These were recently complemented by measurements with the multi-spectral GUVis3511 shadowband radiometer during five cruises with the research vessel Polarstern. The aerosol optical depth (AOD) uncertainty estimate of both shipborne instruments of +/- 0:02 can be confirmed if the GUVis instrument is cross calibrated to the Microtops instrument to account for differences in calibration, and if an empirical correction to account for the broad shadowband as well as the effects of forward scattering is introduced. Based on these two datasets, a comprehensive evaluation of aerosol products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) flown on NASA's Earth Observing System satellites, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) aboard the geostationary Meteosat satellite, and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service reanalysis (CAMS RA) is presented. For this purpose, focus is given to the accuracy of the AOD at 630 nm in combination with the Angstrom exponent (AE), discussed in the context of the ambient aerosol type. In general, the evaluation of MODIS AOD from the official level-2 aerosol products of C6.1 against the Microtops AOD product confirms that 76% of data points fall into the expected error limits given by previous validation studies. The SEVIRI-based AOD product exhibits a 25% larger scatter than the MODIS AOD products at the instrument's native spectral channels. Further, the comparison of CAMS RA and MODIS AOD versus the shipborne reference shows similar performance for both datasets, with some differences arising from the assimilation and model assumptions. When considering aerosol conditions, an overestimation of AE is found for scenes dominated by desert dust for MODIS and SEVIRI products versus the shipborne reference dataset. As the composition of the mixture of aerosol in satellite products is constrained by model assumptions, this highlights the importance of considering the aerosol type in evaluation studies for identifying problematic aspects.

TI  - Characteristics of Hourly Extreme Precipitation along the Yangtze River Basin, China during Warm Season
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Based on the hourly gauge-satellite merged precipitation data with the spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees during 2008-2016, the characteristics of extreme precipitation (EP) diurnal cycle along the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) and their regional and sub-seasonal differences during warm season have been indicated and revealed in this study. Results show that the EP amount (EPA) over most lower reaches of YRB exhibits two diurnal peaks with one in late afternoon and the other in morning, while the EPA over most eastern Tibetan Plateau (the Sichuan Basin and the northern Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau) generally peaks during late afternoon to midnight (midnight to early morning). The afternoon (morning) EPA diurnal peaks over the areas east to 110 degrees E is mainly resulted from the short (long) duration EP events. However, both the short and long duration EP events lead to the nocturnal diurnal peaks and eastward propagating features of EPA over the regions west to110 degrees E. The EP events over the Sichuan Basin generally begin at midnight and mostly peak around 03:00-04:00 Beijing time, and they start earlier and end later with the duration time increased. However, the EP events with short (long) duration over the lower reaches of YRB frequently start and peak in afternoon (early morning) and typically end at around 18:00 (07:00-08:00) Beijing time, and they start later (earlier) and end later with the duration time increased. Meanwhile, the EP frequency (EPF) diurnal cycles over the lower reaches of YRB exhibit obvious sub-seasonal differences in warm season, which show only a morning peak in the pre-Meiyu period, two comparable peaks with one in afternoon and the other in morning during the Meiyu period, and a predominant afternoon peak and a secondary morning peak in the post-Meiyu period, respectively. While the EPF over Sichuan Basin characterized by only one dominant early morning peak during all periods of the warm season exhibits much smaller sub-seasonal differences in the diurnal phase relative to that over the lower reaches of YRB.

TI  - Statistical analysis of the long-range transport of the 2015 Calbuco volcanic plume from ground-based and space-borne observations
T2  - ANNALES GEOPHYSICAE
M3  - Article
AB  - This study investigates the influence of the 2015 Calbuco eruption (41.2 degrees S, 72.4 degrees W; Chile) on the total columnar aerosol optical properties over the Southern Hemisphere. The well-known technic of sun photometry was applied for the investigation of the transport and spatio-temporal evolution of the optical properties of the volcanic plume. The CIMEL sun photometer measurements performed at six South American and three African sites were statistically analysed. This study involves the use of the satellite observations and a back-trajectory model. The passage of the Calbuco plume is statistically detectable in the aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations obtained from sun photometer and MODIS observations. This statistical detection confirms that the majority of the plume was transported over the northeastern parts of South America and reached the South African region 1 week after the eruption. The plume impacted the southern parts of South America to a lesser extent. The highest AOD anomalies were observed over the northeastern parts of South America. Over the South African sites, the AOD anomalies induced by the spread of the plume were quite homogeneously distributed between the east and west coasts. The optical characteristics of the plume near the source region were consistent with an ash-bearing plume. Conversely, sites further from the Calbuco volcano were influenced by ash-free plume. The optical properties discussed in this paper will be used as inputs for numerical models for further investigation of the ageing of the Calbuco plume in a forthcoming study.

TI  - Mercury, arsenic, lead and cadmium in waters of the Singrauli coal mining and power plants industrial zone, Central East India
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - The present investigation is an attempt to assess the contamination of heavy metals in the ground and surface water of the Singrauli industrial belt area. Pollution indices like heavy metal index (HPI), contamination index (CD) and heavy metal evaluation index (HEI) are used for the evaluation of heavy metal pollution (arsenic As, mercury Hg, cadmium Cd, and lead Pb). Contour maps are constructed to interpret metal spatial distribution. Further, the land-use/land-cover (LULC) maps for the year 2000, 2010 and 2016 are prepared using Landsat satellite data. A total of 48 water samples (Groundwater (27), Surface water (21)) are analysed for heavy metal concentration. Eighty-eight percent of groundwater and 90% of surface water samples are contaminated with Hg. Similarly, high concentrations of Pb and Cd were found in the samples. Surprisingly, all the water samples have As concentration above the WHO permissible limit of 10 ppb. Further, 95% of the samples have an HPI value greater than 100 indicating high heavy metal contamination. CD value denotes contamination of 89% of the samples with heavy metals (As, Hg, Cd, Pb). Through spatial distribution, it can be interpreted that most of the contaminated samples lie near thermal power plants, ash ponds, and coal mines. LULC (land use/land cover) study shows a significant decrease in water bodies by (108 km(2)), agricultural land by (54 km(2)) and bare/fallow land by (51 km(2)) from 2000 to 2016. During these 16 years, there has been a fourfold increase in the overburden, a threefold increase in dumping yards, a 2.5 times increase in urban areas, and a twofold increase in mining areas. Both the environment and the water quality are deteriorating at an alarming rate. Such scientific investigations are relevant for risk management studies of potable water. The knowledge acquired from such assessment shall be considered with utmost priority by concerned authority considering degrading water quality in the study area. Hence, this study is applicable for designing action plans and control measures to reduce water resource pollution.

TI  - Assessment of surface runoff conditioned by road works and urban settlements in large plain basins
T2  - NATURAL HAZARDS
M3  - Article
AB  - The province of Buenos Aires located in Argentina contains numerous agricultural plain basins of world importance among which the Samborombon river basin stands out, where regular floods affect agricultural activities and urban expansion. This sector has large road works with approach embankments that obstruct the natural drainage, a poorly planned urban growth, and an increase in the rainfall regime in recent decades. The aim of this work is to carry out an analysis and assessment of the surface runoff conditioned by road works and urban settlements in large plain basins, taking the Samborombon river basin as a case study. Satellite images were used to define the floodplain and identify the main road works and urban settlements that develop within it. Subsequently, hydrological simulations were carried out to assess how these anthropic structures modify the surface runoff and the flooded areas. To validate the simulation results, the flooded areas obtained were compared with a similar flood event of a Landsat image. The results show that the road works embankments and urban settlements restrict the floodplain area of the river, generating an increase in the flooded area and delaying the water runoff. This problem, together with the rainfall increase, shows the need to generate a territorial management plan and adopt mitigation measures. The use of sacrificial embankments could be an economic alternative that would prevent the obstruction of water runoff, being able to use the basin as a pilot site for this innovative idea.

TI  - Citclops: A next-generation sensor system for the monitoring of natural waters and a citizens' observatory for the assessment of ecosystems' status
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - The European-Commission-funded project 'Citclops' (Citizens' observatory for coast and ocean optical monitoring) developed methods, tools and sensors, which can be used by citizens to monitor natural waters, with a strong focus on long-term data series related to environmental sciences. The new sensors, based on optical technologies, respond to a number of scientific, technical and societal objectives, ranging from more precise monitoring of key environmental descriptors of the aquatic environment (water colour, transparency and fluorescence) to an improved management of data collected with citizen participation. The sensors were tested, calibrated, integrated on several platforms, scientifically validated and demonstrated in the field. The new methods and tools were tested in a citizen-science context. The general conclusion is that citizens are valuable contributors in quality and quantity to the objective of collecting, integrating and analysing fragmented and diverse environmental data. An integration of these data into data-analysis tools has a large potential to support authoritative monitoring and decision-making. In this paper, the project's objectives, results, technical achievements and lessons learned are presented.

TI  - An intercomparison of tropospheric ozone reanalysis products from CAMS, CAMS interim, TCR-1, and TCR-2
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Global tropospheric ozone reanalyses constructed using different state-of-the-art satellite data assimilation systems, prepared as part of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS-iRean and CAMS-Rean) as well as two fully independent reanalyses (TCR-1 and TCR-2, Tropospheric Chemistry Reanalysis), have been intercompared and evaluated for the past decade. The updated reanalyses (CAMS-Rean and TCR-2) generally show substantially improved agreements with independent ground and ozone-sonde observations over their predecessor versions (CAMS-iRean and TCR-1) for diurnal, synoptical, seasonal, and interannual variabilities. For instance, for the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes the tropospheric ozone columns (surface to 300 hPa) from the updated reanalyses show mean biases to within 0.8 DU (Dobson units, 3 % relative to the observed column) with respect to the ozone-sonde observations. The improved performance can likely be attributed to a mixture of various upgrades, such as revisions in the chemical data assimilation, including the assimilated measurements, and the forecast model performance. The updated chemical reanalyses agree well with each other for most cases, which highlights the usefulness of the current chemical reanalyses in a variety of studies. Meanwhile, significant temporal changes in the reanalysis quality in all the systems can be attributed to discontinuities in the observing systems. To improve the temporal consistency, a careful assessment of changes in the assimilation configuration, such as a detailed assessment of biases between various retrieval products, is needed. Our comparison suggests that improving the observational constraints, including the continued development of satellite observing systems, together with the optimization of model parameterizations such as deposition and chemical reactions, will lead to increasingly consistent long-term reanalyses in the future.

TI  - Beyond 'Liberals' and 'Conservatives': Complexity in Ideology, Moral Intuitions, and Worldview Among Swedish Voters
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY
M3  - Article
AB  - This research investigated the congruence between the ideologies of political parties and the ideological preferences (N = 1515), moral intuitions (N = 1048), and political values and worldviews (N = 1345) of diverse samples of Swedish adults who voted or intended to vote for the parties. Logistic regression analyses yielded support for a series of hypotheses about variations in ideology beyond the left-right division. With respect to social ideology, resistance to change and binding moral intuitions predicted stronger preference for a social democratic (vs. progressive) party on the left and weaker preference for a social liberal (vs. social conservative or liberal-conservative) party on the right. With respect to political values and broader worldviews, normativism and low acceptance of immigrants predicted the strongest preference for a nationalist party, while environmentalism predicted the strongest preference for a green party. The effects were generally strong and robust when we controlled for left-right self-placements, economic ideology, and demographic characteristics. These results show that personality variation in the ideological domain is not reducible to the simplistic contrast between 'liberals' and 'conservatives', which ignores differences between progressive and non-progressive leftists, economic and green progressives, social liberal and conservative rightists, and nationalist and non-nationalist conservatives.

TI  - The Lake Chad hydrology under current climate change
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - Lake Chad, in the Sahelian zone of west-central Africa, provides food and water to similar to 50 million people and supports unique ecosystems and biodiversity. In the past decades, it became a symbol of current climate change, held up by its dramatic shrinkage in the 1980s. Despites a partial recovery in response to increased Sahelian precipitation in the 1990s, Lake Chad is still facing major threats and its contemporary variability under climate change remains highly uncertain. Here, using a new multi-satellite approach, we show that Lake Chad extent has remained stable during the last two decades, despite a slight decrease of its northern pool. Moreover, since the 2000s, groundwater, which contributes to similar to 70% of Lake Chad's annual water storage change, is increasing due to water supply provided by its two main tributaries. Our results indicate that in tandem with groundwater and tropical origin of water supply, over the last two decades, Lake Chad is not shrinking and recovers seasonally its surface water extent and volume. This study provides a robust regional understanding of current hydrology and changes in the Lake Chad region, giving a basis for developing future climate adaptation strategies.

TI  - P-model v1.0: an optimality -based light use efficiency model for simulating ecosystem gross primary production
T2  - GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Terrestrial photosynthesis is the basis for vegetation growth and drives the land carbon cycle. Accurately simulating gross primary production (GPP, ecosystem-level apparent photosynthesis) is key for satellite monitoring and Earth system model predictions under climate change. While robust models exist for describing leaf-level photosynthesis, predictions diverge due to uncertain photosynthetic traits and parameters which vary on multiple spatial and temporal scales. Here, we describe and evaluate a GPP (photosynthesis per unit ground area) model, the P-model, that combines the Farquhar-von Caemmerer-Berry model for C-3 photosynthesis with an optimality principle for the carbon assimilation-transpiration trade-off, and predicts a multi-day average light use efficiency (LUE) for any climate and C-3 vegetation type. The model builds on the theory developed in Prentice et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2017a) and is extended to include low temperature effects on the intrinsic quantum yield and an empirical soil moisture stress factor. The model is forced with site-level data of the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) and meteorological data and is evaluated against GPP estimates from a globally distributed network of ecosystem flux measurements. Although the P-model requires relatively few inputs, the R-2 for predicted versus observed GPP based on the full model setup is 0.75 (8 d mean, 126 sites) - similar to comparable satellite-data-driven GPP models but without predefined vegetation-type-specific parameters. The R-2 is reduced to 0.70 when not accounting for the reduction in quantum yield at low temperatures and effects of low soil moisture on LUE. The R-2 for the P-model-predicted LUE is 0.32 (means by site) and 0.48 (means by vegetation type). Applying this model for global-scale simulations yields a total global GPP of 106-122 Pg C yr(-1) (mean of 2001-2011), depending on the fAPAR forcing data. The P-model provides a simple but powerful method for predicting - rather than prescribing - light use efficiency and simulating terrestrial photosynthesis across a wide range of conditions. The model is available as an R package (rpmodel).

TI  - Impact of flooded rice paddy on remotely sensed evapotranspiration in the Krishna River basin, India
T2  - HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES
M3  - Article
AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the major water exchange processes between the earth's surface and the atmosphere. ET is a combined process of evaporation from open water bodies, bare soil and plant surfaces, and transpiration from vegetation. Remote sensing-based ET models have been developed to estimate spatially distributed ET over large regions, however, many of them reportedly underestimate ET over semi-arid regions (Jamshidi et al., Journal of Hydrometeorology, 2019, 20, 947-964). In this work, we show that underestimation of ET can occur due to the open water evaporation from flooded rice paddies ignored in the existing ET models. To address the gap in ET estimation, we have developed a novel approach that accounts for the missing ET component over flooded rice paddies. Our method improved ET estimates by a modified Penman-Monteith algorithm that considered the fraction of open water evaporation from flooded rice paddies. Daily ET was calculated using ground based meteorological data and the MODIS satellite data over the Krishna River Basin. Seasonal and annual ET values over the Krishna Basin were compared with two different ET algorithms. ET estimates from these two models were also compared for different crop combinations. Results were validated with flux tower-based measurements from other studies. We have identified a 17 mm/year difference in average annual ET over the Krishna River Basin with this new ET algorithm. This is very critical in basin scale water balance analysis and water productivity studies.

T2  - GEOCARTO INTERNATIONAL
M3  - Article
AB  - Ulva prolifera blooms have occurred every summer in the South Yellow Sea since 2008. U. prolifera blooms appeared in the area near the Jiangsu shoal and then were driven to the Shandong Peninsula by the prevailing summer winds. The blooms covered a maximum area of more than 50000 km(2) and had an aggregate estimated biomass of 3.64 x 10(5) tons. Large number of U. prolifera dissipation in the natural degradation and this cause a serious impact on the marine environment. We used MODIS, HJ-1A/B and GF-1 remote sensing image data to conduct large-scale monitoring of U. prolifera. Combined with sea surface monitoring station data from Haiyang city, Shandong province, we analyzed the impact of U. prolifera death on the coastal sea environment of Haiyang city from 2012 to 2016 using multiple regression analysis. It showed that chlorophyll-a concentration was related to sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphate (R-2 = 0.50, P < 0.001). Among these, DIN and phosphate were important factors affecting chlorophyll-a concentration. There was a significant positive correlation between chlorophyll-a concentration and DIN, but a significant negative correlation between chlorophyll-a concentration and phosphate. The nutrients released by the decomposition of U. prolifera enhanced the growth of planktonic microalgae, and increased the mean chlorophyll-a concentration from 1.398 mu mol/L to 2.819 mu mol/L during May to August in the study area. This increased the Level of eutrophication in the coastal area and contributed to blooms of secondary algae such as red tides.

TI  - Sand and dust storm trajectories from Iraq Mesopotamian flood plain to Kuwait
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Although Kuwait is greatly impacted by sand and dust storms (SDS) from Southern Iraq, lo dale little is known about the nature of these storms. Kuwait is vulnerable to SDS trajectories from the middle Euphrates region, specifically, from two "hot spot" areas (AI-Batha and Mamlahat Al-Samawah) of 4550 km(2) located 250 km from its northern border. This study explores the transboundary SDS jets originating from Southern Iraq using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images obtained from Aqua and Terra satellites over a twelve-year period (2007-2018). Furthermore, an analysis of a 5-day diurnal variation (two days prior, the day of the SDS occurrence, and two days after) explored the hourly patterns of visibility and wind speed, as well as grain size distribution of soil samples to better understand grain size compositions and sediment transport mechanisms. Satellite images confirmed that dust storm jets originated from the "hot spot" in southern Iraq and spread over Kuwait and extended to neighboring Arab Gulf countries as far as Bahrain (900 km) and Qatar (1200 km). In general, the highest wind speed and lowest visibility values were recorded in Northern of Kuwait, with suspended dust sustained for two days following the dust storm. The largest silt and day fractions (grains <= 63 mu m) were identified at the center and west Sabkha region of the "hot spot" area. Very fine sand partides (63-250 mu m) were identified within the crescent sand dunes (Barchans) and artificial sand dunes (Al-Fajr). It is recommended that sustainable rehabilitation and land restoration of the "hot spot" area will result in the elimination of the long-range transport of SDS jet streams affecting the downwind Gulf countries.

TI  - Phytoplankton Orientation in a Turbulent Ocean: A Microscale Perspective
T2  - FRONTIERS IN MARINE SCIENCE
M3  - Review
AB  - Phytoplankton are by definition autotrophic microorganisms that passively drift with fluid motion. Accordingly, the traditional view of a turbulence-homogenized phytoplankton distribution in the ocean, where cells randomly organize and interact, is deeply rooted in biological oceanography studies. However, increasing understanding of microscopic processes in the ocean is revealing a world of microscale patterns resulting from cell behaviors and fluid-cell interactions that challenges this vision. Autotrophic cells have developed active (i.e., flagella) and passive (i.e., morphological structures and vesicles) motility mechanisms that allow them different degrees of spatial control. Their complex interaction with the ocean physicochemical landscape commonly results in small-scale spatial heterogeneities and non-isotropic orientations that can strongly influence ecosystem level processes. Cell orientation, in particular, is fundamental for key biological functions such as sensing, metabolism, locomotion, chain formation, or sexual reproduction. Moreover, preferential alignment of elongated cells can modulate the propagation of light through the ocean and is fundamental for accurate interpretation of remote sensing data. Innovative observational and experimental techniques (e.g., in situ holography, laser diffractometry, etc.) allowing the subtle analysis of cell-fluid interactions are revealing that, at the microscopic level, organisms present well defined orientation and interaction patterns under prevalent conditions in the sea. Thus, the interplay of biology, fluid dynamics, and optics may shape, by means of anisotropic cell distributions, pivotal cross-scale aspects of phytoplankton ecology.

TI  - Partitioning the impacts of land use/land cover change and climate variability on water supply over the source region of the Blue Nile Basin
T2  - LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Water plays a vital role in sustaining the natural functioning of the entire ecosystem that supports life on Earth. It plays key roles in the well-being of society in numerous ways. However, climate variability and land use land cover (LULC) change have caused spatiotemporal water supply variation. Disentangling the effects of climate variability from LULC change on water supply is crucial for sustainable water resource management. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to disentangle the relative contribution of LULC change and climate variability to the overall average annual water supply variation. Residual trends analysis combined with Integrated Valuation of Environmental Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) annual water yield model was adopted to perform simulations and disentangle the relative impacts of climate variability and LULC change. Ground and satellite data were used in this study. The study area has experienced a significant increasing wetness trend and significant LULC dynamics between 2003 and 2017. As a result, an increasing water supply was observed due to the joint effects of climate variability and LULC change in the watershed (203 mm). The contribution of climate variability was 94%, whereas LULC contributes only 6% from 2003 to 2017. Climate variability negatively led to water supply variation while LULC change contributed positively from 2010 to 2017. Although the ongoing soil and water conservation (SWC) practices improved vegetation cover and water retention of the watershed, climate variability is the main driver of water supply variation. Therefore, SWC practices should incorporate ecosystem-based climate change adaptation strategies and scale up to community-based integrated watershed management to sustain water supply.

TI  - Factors associated with mortality among asphyxiated newborns in a low-resource setting
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERNAL-FETAL & NEONATAL MEDICINE
M3  - Article
AB  - Objective: Neonatal asphyxia accounts for a quarter of neonatal deaths. We aimed to assess factors associated with mortality among asphyxiated neonates in a low-resource setting. Methods: A retrospective observational study evaluating all neonates who were admitted for asphyxia to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at Tosamaganga Hospital (Tanzania) in 2017-2018. Inclusion criteria were: Apgar score <7 at 5 min and/or failure to initiate spontaneous breathing and/or presence of sentinel events and/or clinical signs suggesting encephalopathy not explained by other obvious factors or early convulsions. Newborns with congenital malformations, birth weight Results: NICU admission for perinatal asphyxia was 17.5%. In 169 neonates, mortality rate was 23% and was associated with being outborn, low 5-minute Apgar score, depressed clinical status at NICU admission, occurrence of infection or seizures within 24 h from admission, and receiving aminophylline during the hospital stay. Conclusions: Perinatal asphyxia was responsible for a relevant proportion of NICU admissions and neonatal deaths in a low-resource setting. Appropriate clinical examination remains the main asset in settings with limited availability of diagnostic tools. Improvements in antenatal and perinatal care are needed to reduce mortality in asphyxiated newborns. Future studies should assess long-term outcome in survivors.

TI  - The Spectrum-STI Groups model: syphilis prevalence trends across high-risk and lower-risk populations in Yunnan, China
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
M3  - Article
AB  - The Spectrum-STI model, structured by sub-groups within a population, was used in a workshop in Yunnan, China, to estimate provincial trends in active syphilis in 15 to 49-year-old adults. Syphilis prevalence data from female sex workers (FSW), men who have sex with men (MSM), and lower-risk women and men in Yunnan were identified through literature searches and local experts. Sources included antenatal care clinic screening, blood donor screening, HIV/STI bio-behavioural surveys, sentinel surveillance, and epidemiology studies. The 2017 provincial syphilis prevalence estimates were 0.26% (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.34%) in women and 0.28% (0.20-0.36%) in men. Estimated prevalence was 6.8-fold higher in FSW (1.69% (0.68-3.97%) than in lower-risk women (0.25% (0.18-0.35%)), and 22.7-fold higher in MSM (5.35% (2.74-12.47%) than in lower-risk men (0.24% (0.17-0.31%). For all populations, the 2017 estimates were below the 2005 estimates, but differences were not significant. In 2017 FSW and MSM together accounted for 9.3% of prevalent cases. These estimates suggest Yunnan's STI programs have kept the overall prevalence of syphilis low, but prevalence remains high in FSW and MSM. Strengthening efforts targeting FSW and MSM, and identification of other risk populations e.g. among heterosexual men, are critical to reduce syphilis.

AB  - In this study, the atmosphere major greenhouse-gases monitor instrument (GMI) loaded on the GF-5 satellite platform is used to measure the column concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4. To ensure the accuracy of the greenhouse gas inversion in GMI remote sensing data, the influence of aerosol and other factors in greenhouse gas inversion on inversion results is analyzed and used as the correction factor of the inversion algorithm. Given this, the GMI inversion results arc verified using the total carbon column observing network (TCCON) site. Furthermore, results show that the GMI near-infrared inversion results exhibit a low bias with -1.06 +/- 2.93 x 10(-6)(-0.26 +/- 0.72%), and the inversion accuracy is within 1%.

TI  - Responses of landscape structure to the ecological restoration programs in the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China
T2  - SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT
M3  - Article
AB  - Ecological restoration programs (ERPs) have been conducted in China since 2000 to improve ecological conditions, particularly in the farming-pastoral ecotone of Northern China. Few have studied the effects of ERPs on landscape structure. Taking West Liaohe River Basin (WLRB) as a case study, we explored how landscape dynamics were altered before and after ERPs from 1990 through 2015 by using multi-temporal Landsat TM images. We analyzed the effects of ERPs on landscape structure by exploring the relationships between landscape features and land cover change (LCC). The results indicate that dramatic changes in land cover and landscape structure occurred before and after ERPs implementation. During 2000-2015 woodlands increased with a sharper annual growth, grasslands reclamation slowed down and was restricted, whereas more croplands were converted to grasslands and woodlands. ERPs decreased landscape fragmentation and increased landscape diversity, due mostly to the portion and spatial configures of croplands, grasslands and woodlands. landscape fragmentation was significantly correlated with mean patch size of grasslands (r = -0.677, p < 0.0001) and woodlands (r = -0.515, p < 0.0001), as well as patch number ratio of croplands to the sum of grasslands and woodlands (r = -0.414,p < 0.01). Additionally, landscape diversity had a significant negative correlation with the areal ratio of grasslands (r = -0.345, p < 0.001). Our findings indicate that the LCCs were in agreement with ERPs' key goals. The changes in landscape structure in WLRB, however, were not expected from the ERPs design. Given the importance of landscape structure in human vulnerability to environment, it seemed that EPRs from the central government should not only regulate specific land use but also focus on the health and sustainability of the landscapes. Explicit function-based local landscape management should be taken into account for the future through better design and implementations of ERPs. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trends in Surgical Axillary Management in Early Stage Breast Cancer in Elderly Women: Continued Over-Treatment
T2  - ANNALS OF SURGICAL ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Introduction In the past two decades, three prospective randomized trials demonstrated that elderly women with early stage hormone positive breast cancer had equivalent disease-specific mortality regardless of axillary surgery. In 2016, the Choosing Wisely campaign encouraged patients and providers to reconsider the role of axillary surgery in this population. We sought to identify factors that contribute to adopting non-operative management of the axilla in these patients. Materials and Methods We performed a retrospective analysis of women >= 70 years old with cT1/T2, hormone positive invasive ductal carcinoma who underwent partial or total mastectomy, with/without axillary surgery, and did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy from the National Cancer Database from 2004 to 2015. We used multivariable log-binomial regression to model the risk of undergoing axillary surgery across region, care setting, and Charlson-Deyo scores, and analyzed temporal trends using Poisson regression. From 2004 to 2015, 87,342 of 99,940 women who met inclusion criteria (83%) had axillary surgery. Over time, axillary surgery increased from 78% to 88% (p < 0.001). This rise was consistent across region (p = 0.81) and care setting (p = 0.09), but flattened as age increased (p < 0.001). Omitting axillary surgery was more likely in patients treated in New England (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.86, 0.89) and patients >= 85 (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.65, 0.67). Conclusions Axillary surgery continues to be the preferred option of axillary management in elderly women with early stage, clinically node negative, hormone-positive, invasive breast cancer despite no survival benefit. Identifying factors to improve patient selection and dissemination of current recommendations can improve adoption of current evidence on axillary surgery in the elderly.

TI  - The development of an indirect computed tomography lymphography protocol for sentinel lymph node detection in head and neck cancer and comparison to other sentinel lymph node mapping techniques
T2  - VETERINARY AND COMPARATIVE ONCOLOGY
M3  - Article
AB  - Identification of metastatic disease critically impacts the care and prognosis of patients with neoplasia. Multiple techniques exist for identifying the sentinel or first lymph node(s) that receive draining tumour lymph. Identification of the sentinel lymph node enables accurate tissue sampling for determination of lymphatic metastasis. The aims of this study were to develop a computed tomography (CT) protocol for identifying the sentinel lymph node in dogs with tumours of the head and neck. In addition, indirect CT lymphography was compared to lymphoscintigraphy and vital dye injection to determine which technique more reliably identified the sentinel lymph node. CT indirect lymphography using intratumoral injection of iodinated contrast identified draining lymphatic vessels in eight of 18 dogs and identified the sentinel lymph node in five of 18 dogs. CT indirect lymphography employing four-quadrant peritumoral injection of iodinated contrast identified draining lymphatic vessels in 18 of 20 dogs and identified the sentinel lymph node in 11 of 20 dogs. Vital dye injection and lymphoscintigraphy identified the sentinel lymph node in 17 of 18 and 20 of 20 dogs, respectively. Identified sentinel lymph nodes were either ipsilateral or bilateral to the primary tumour. Both CT techniques were found to be safe and simple. Peritumoral injection has the greatest promise for the detection of sentinel lymph nodes in various head and neck cancers using CT, while lymphoscintigraphy had the greatest success of the compared techniques.

TI  - GIS-based flood hazard mapping using relative frequency ratio method: A case study of Panjkora River Basin, eastern Hindu Kush, Pakistan
T2  - PLOS ONE
M3  - Article
AB  - Flood is the most devastating and prevalent disaster among all-natural disasters. Every year, flood claims hundreds of human lives and causes damage to the worldwide economy and environment. Consequently, the identification of flood-vulnerable areas is important for comprehensive flood risk management. The main objective of this study is to delineate flood-prone areas in the Panjkora River Basin (PRB), eastern Hindu Kush, Pakistan. An initial extensive field survey and interpretation of Landsat-7 and Google Earth images identified 154 flood locations that were inundated in 2010 floods. Of the total, 70% of flood locations were randomly used for building a model and 30% were used for validation of the model. Eight flood parameters including slope, elevation, land use, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), topographic wetness index (TWI), drainage density, and rainfall were used to map the flood-prone areas in the study region. The relative frequency ratio was used to determine the correlation between each class of flood parameter and flood occurrences. All of the factors were resampled into a pixel size of 30x30 m and were reclassified through the natural break method. Finally, a final hazard map was prepared and reclassified into five classes, i.e., very low, low, moderate, high, very high susceptibility. The results of the model were found reliable with area under curve values for success and prediction rate of 82.04% and 84.74%, respectively. The findings of this study can play a key role in flood hazard management in the target region; they can be used by the local disaster management authority, researchers, planners, local government, and line agencies dealing with flood risk management.
